I thank the joint committee for giving us the opportunity to come before it.  I will start on our overall approach to the market, while Mr. Farrell will address agriculture-specific areas.  <\/p> <p>  As shown on the slides we sent in advance, Bank of Ireland has the largest branch footprint across the country.  We continue to operate in all towns in which we have operated since before the downturn.  The branch network is supported by a team of 115 mobile relationship managers who are focused on small and medium enterprises, SMEs, and the agri-community.  They, in turn, are supported by a direct lending unit which supports many of the day to day requirements for working capital of the agri-community.  There are two teams spread across Dublin and Kilkenny, with the majority of agri-community requirements being looked after by our team in Kilkenny which is staffed by a number of experienced advisers, many of whom have direct farming experience and run farms in their own time.  <\/p> <p>  Bank of Ireland continues to be the largest lender to the economy.  In 2017 we contributed 51% of overall new lending to the agriculture sector.  Total agri-approvals in 2017 amounted to a sum of &euro;563 million.  <\/p> <p>  I will pass over to Mr. Farrell who will cover specific areas in agriculture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#B00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Lauhoff"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":10,"content":"<p>Agriculture continues to be the largest stand-alone business sector in Bank of Ireland.  We are committed to meeting our customers' needs across all enterprises.  When we look across the range of lending we provide for the sector, we see that most of the demand for on-farm development funding comes from the dairy sector, with pig and poultry farmers also investing in improved housing facilities as they seek to increase efficiency and output levels.  The beef, tillage and sheep sectors also continue to have annual working capital requirements to fund stock and input purchases.  With our customers, we are aware of the potential implications of a hard Brexit and the importance of Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, payments to support farm incomes.  In that context, we welcome funding applications for farm developments focused on improving efficiencies.  Lending for land purchase spans all enterprises.  We saw a 25% increase in land loan approvals last year.  Bank of Ireland also participated in the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, agriculture cashflow support loan scheme in 2017.  We successfully loaned &euro;65 million to our customers in partnership with the SBCI.  Farmers are not eligible to apply under the new SBCI scheme aimed at supporting SMEs exposed to Brexit.  However, should another farmer-focused scheme come onto the agenda in 2018, we will look to offer support and participate, as we have done in previous SBCI and Government-sponsored lending initiatives.<\/p> <p>  Driven by increased profitability and improved cashflow last year, average agri-overdraft balances at the start of the year were 26% lower than 12 months previously.  Despite the additional fodder and feed purchased on farms in recent months, current overdraft utilisation levels are lower than they were a year ago.  In recent weeks we have seen a small increase in the number of requests from customers seeking temporary overdraft limit increases and stocking loan extensions owing to increased feed costs.  We are taking a proactive approach to supporting customers.  All of our front-line staff are acutely aware of the challenges they are facing and we are actively asking customers, if they believe they are likely to need extra working capital or other support, to let us know and that we will look to put the required facilities in place for them.  Our approach, where we believe a customer has a viable farm business, is that we need to support him or her through short-term cashflow challenges.  Options available to support customers with cashflow challenges include increases in overdraft facilities and the provision of new or the extension of existing stocking loans.  Additionally, through our AgriFlex loan proposition we can offer customers interest only repayments to reduce their annual debt funding requirements.  We understand many customers invested significantly in new farm buildings and land improvements, funded through cashflow during 2017 which, in hindsight, might have been funded more appropriately through a farm development loan.  Customers can apply to retrospectively fund these developments with some borrowings now and apply the loan proceeds to supporting their cashflow in the current year.  Bank of Ireland views lending to the agri-sector through that lens of volatility, accounting for peaks and troughs in commodity prices and farm input costs, and their subsequent impact on farm incomes.  We understand weather conditions, disease and other factors can also have a serious impact on cashflow.  We are willing to provide support through these troughs where a farm business is viable in the long run.<\/p><p>Lending is one of the ways we look to support customers.  We place significant value on the sector-specific expertise that we bring to clients and as the agri-sector head I work with a team of agri-development managers who provide specialist support to customers and to colleagues and to implement an agri-training and capability development programme across the bank's branch network.  We offer customers online business and cashflow business tools through<i>thinkbusiness.ie<\/i>, a website developed by Bank of Ireland to support farmers in all businesses, and customers can now also apply online to Bank of Ireland for loans for up to &euro;120,000.<br\/><br\/>We are committed to hosting sector-specific events aimed at providing relevant information and networking opportunities to customers.  So far this year, we have held over 40 such events, targeted specifically at the agri-sector.  These events included farm development case studies forums, digital skills development workshops, agri-business breakfasts and sector update seminars.<br\/><br\/>I thank the Vice Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee today and would like to conclude by reiterating Bank of Ireland's commitment to supporting our customers.  We understand the challenges brought about by the fodder crisis and it will take some time for its full impact to be known and to feed through the system.  We will continue to assess how best we can channel specific supports to the sector in line with market demand.  I will gladly answer any questions the committee may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#B00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman and members of the committee for inviting AIB to discuss with it the recent fodder crisis that has impacted on Irish farms and AIB&rsquo;s response to any cashflow pressure that may materialise.  I am head of agriculture with AIB and I am joined by Ms Margaret Brennan, head of sector strategy in AIB.<br\/><br\/>AIB has a long association with Irish agriculture and is the main lender to Irish farmers accounting for over 40% of total outstanding lending balances to the sector.  Agriculture is core to AIB&rsquo;s strategy.  AIB's dedicated agri-advisory team of 12 agricultural science graduates, provides objective farm financial and technical analysis in individual farm lending cases and through training equips our front-line staff to support farmers throughout the cycle.  They work closely with all customer-facing staff to support farmers through various income and cashflow cycles and crises.<br\/><br\/>The past 18 months have been somewhat of a dichotomy for Irish farmers.  On the one hand, annual average incomes for most sectors increased in 2017, beyond expectations in some sectors and to an historic high in the dairy sector.  With the exception of tillage farmers, who experienced another relatively low margin year, all sectors performed relatively strongly. <br\/><br\/>On the other hand, weather from the end of July onwards complicated operations at farm level, first in the north west and west of the country where both the quality and quantity of second cut silage was impacted.  In some cases, animals required rehousing, fodder shortages started to emerge and the use of concentrate feeds increased.  In the south and east of the country the delayed spring and lack of growth significantly delayed the turnout of stock.  The situation, as we find it, has varied significantly both regionally and between farms depending on individual circumstances.  Both dairy and beef farmers report an impact on animal performance and milk yield.  The tillage sector too has faced disruption to spring plantings which again varies between geography and farm.<br\/><br\/>The result for many farmers has been significant operational challenges at what is typically the busiest time of the year.  AIB appreciates that this has resulted in considerable additional pressure on farmers and their families and has added to work load and stress over the past number of months.  From a financial perspective, this will undoubtedly result in higher costs.<br\/><br\/>The sector came into 2018 in a relatively strong financial position.  At the end of the first quarter of 2018, AIB&rsquo;s metrics show that average cash balances for the agriculture sector were up considerably year-on-year, while average overdraft utilisation for the sector was down year-on-year.  To date we have seen no material increase in requests for working capital support and no material pressure on farming current accounts.<br\/><br\/>The extent to which cashflow and current accounts have been impacted to date has varied depending on the strength of cash balances coming into the year, fodder availability on the farm and whether fertiliser had been bought forward.  The significant cost of increased concentrate feed has yet to be felt in current accounts.  As expected, farmers purchased concentrate feed on credit with co-ops and merchants.  As these bills fall due, the cost will crystallise in farm current accounts and the impact on working capital will become apparent.  We expect that this to materialise into the summer months.<br\/><br\/>AIB has been mindful of the emerging challenges on farm since late 2017 and of the pressures that farm families have been experiencing.  We participated in the Fodder Action Group in the north west during the winter, which was established by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and chaired by Teagasc.  All front-line staff were advised of the emerging fodder situation and on AIB&rsquo;s cashflow support options.  We wrote to national and regional stakeholders in early April highlighting the range of options available to farmers and advising that farmers make early contact with their bank.  In addition, we issued external communications acknowledging the challenges being experienced by farmers and advising impacted farmer to make early contact with their bank.  Depending on the severity of the problem, in some locations we have initiated proactive contact programmes with our customers.<br\/><br\/>We are encouraging farmers who may need support to quantify the level of working capital they require and make early contact with the bank to consider an appropriate solution to their circumstances.  We will work with customers on a case-by-case basis as experience has taught us that no one solution will suit all farms.<br\/><br\/>AIB has a range of options to support our farming customers, including 48 hour decision on business loans and overdrafts up to &euro;60,000 for AIB customers; flexible working capital finance by way of a AIB farmer credit line at a competitive interest rate; and extended contact hours for farmers via a dedicated phone line, which is available Monday to Friday from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. and Saturdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  Farmers who find themselves under severe cashflow pressure should advise the bank that their situation is urgent and we will prioritise their request accordingly.<br\/><br\/>AIB encourages affected farmers to engage with Teagasc supports on fodder budgeting and rebuilding winter fodder stocks.  Our forthcoming edition of <i>Agri Matters<\/i>advises on how to rebuild fodder stocks for next winter and how to deal with the cashflow impact of the past winter and, indeed, our two editions of <i>Young Farmer Bytes<\/i>since the start of the year have dealt with this issues as well.<br\/><br\/>We know that cashflow support will, in the main, be short term to medium term in nature.  The additional costs experienced may continue to be felt on the farm throughout the summer and into back end of the year and AIB will continue to monitor the situation closely.  We maintain a positive long-term outlook for the agriculture sector, recognising that there will be periods of income and cashflow pressure when the sector will require short-term financial support.  We will continue to support farmer initiatives focused on increasing efficiency and financial resilience at farm level, such as Teagasc's Grass10, which is also supported by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  These initiatives are key to ensuring resilience during periods of income and cashflow challenges.<br\/><br\/>On behalf of the bank, I again thank the Vice Chairman and the committee for inviting us today.  We very much appreciate the opportunity to discuss with the committee one of our most important SME sectors and we look forward to questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Finnegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I thank the Vice Chairman and the members of the committee for inviting us today.  We welcome the opportunity to discuss Ulster Bank&rsquo;s ongoing support for the agriculture sector, particularly following a prolonged period of adverse weather conditions and the significant pressures on farming communities.  I am Ulster Bank&rsquo;s head of agriculture and I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Eddie Cullen, managing director of our commercial banking division.<\/p> <p>  As I previously discussed with committee members, supporting agriculture and the farming sector is a key focus for Ulster Bank.  The increased volatility evident in the agriculture sector over the last few years, either due to weather, price or unexpected individual on-farm challenges is a reality the sector must learn to manage.  Irish farmers must continue to improve on-farm efficiencies and competitiveness to survive the income cycles which have now become the norm.  At Ulster Bank, we take a long-term view of agricultural lending and we believe that the production and utilisation of grass on livestock farms drives efficiency.  To support this and meet the needs of the industry, we developed and introduced a pasture loan, which provides finance for grazing infrastructure, drainage, re-seeding and soil fertility.  We proactively engage and interact with farmers and industry stakeholders, including having a recent meeting with Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, to ensure we understand the current challenges facing the sector.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of key items about the current pressures facing farmers I would like to highlight.  The nature and extent of the current challenges are not uniform throughout the country even though there is a nationwide fodder shortage.  We believe that due to the physical and mental strain on farmers over the last few months, they may not have yet reacted to the possible financial impact of the current situation.  At Ulster Bank we have not experienced any significant increase in demand for working capital facilities.  Farmers need to consider how they will replenish their fodder stocks in 2018 which will result in increased fertiliser and contractor charges, they need to plan for the possibility of a larger than normal tax bill in November and some may also need to reassess their infrastructure requirements on expanding farms.  All of these pressures must be managed in a year in which a reduction in agricultural output across all the main farming sectors is anticipated.<\/p> <p>  Anecdotally, we believe that farmers have acquired additional fodder, with the majority of payments still to be made.  Overdraft utilisation levels remain in line with previous years when seasonal variations are taken into account.<\/p><p>While this indicates that there are no major signs of liquidity issues across the sector as a whole, we are aware that there are pressures on individual farms.  Farmers use a variety of mechanisms to manage working capital, including bank funding and merchant credit.  Depending on the nature of the enterprise and the working capital cycle, Ulster Bank has a number of options available, including a business overdraft, trading stock facility and seasonal input facility.  A farmer may avail of one or all of these in combination to support his or her working capital requirements. <\/p><p> Over the last few weeks we have engaged with our farming customers ranging from dairy farmers who have recently expanded, to drystock farmers in the north west, to ascertain if they are under cashflow pressure.  Some farmers requested small increases in their overdraft limits to pay for feed and fertiliser, while other farmers indicated that they might need additional finances as the year progresses.  No farmer advised that they could not get access to feed.  A handful of farmers will have significantly increased feed costs due to the prolonged winter compared to what they budgeted for and they all advised that they had learned valuable lessons this year.  Ulster Bank offers support and solutions to all our customers during periods of pressure, once the underlying core business is sustainable into the future.  One thing I would like to emphasise today is that farmers should talk to their bank if they are in any way concerned about their financial circumstances.<\/p><p> As part of our meaningful help and support measures for farm families we recently ran regional seminars in Cork, Kilkenny, Limerick and Donegal, entitled \"Building Capabilities on Farms\".  These seminars brought industry experts and sectoral intermediaries together to enable the attending farmers and stakeholders in the industry to discuss and seek advice on solutions and strategies to help farmers to address volatility in their businesses.  We had representatives from Aware, Pieta House and Mental Health Ireland at these events to recognise and support the need for mental well-being as well as financial well-being on farms.  They stressed the importance of talking, listening and seeking regular downtime from the stresses and strains of running a farm business.  During the last 12 months, Ulster Bank has partnered with Teagasc Moorepark to support its biannual open day, supported robotic and organic farm open days in Cavan and Monaghan, a beef expo in Mayo and the Agricultural Science Association dairy technical masterclass. <\/p><p> I reiterate that Ulster Bank is committed to the agrifood and farming sectors.  Our aim is to partner with farming businesses to enable them to grow and to continue to support the agriculture sector through the difficulties that arise.  We have developed flexible solutions to support our customers, including the dairy expansion loan, dairy farmer toolkit and pasture loans, as well as participating in the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, agriculture cashflow loan support scheme.  Ulster Bank looks forward to further engagement and collaboration with all stakeholders in the industry to consider a range of options to address the fundamental difficulties facing the sector.  <\/p><p> I thank the Vice Chairman and members for affording Ulster Bank the opportunity to address the committee.  Mr. Cullen and I will be happy to address questions members may have for us. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Ailish Byrne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Byrne and invite Mr. Ashmore to make his contribution.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#D00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members.  We welcome the opportunity to tell the committee about the work the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, has been doing to support farmers and agribusinesses throughout Ireland.  Joining me today is my colleague, Suzanne Sweeney, head of lending.  I am conscious of the committee&rsquo;s concerns around the recent fodder shortage and its interest in any measures that are open to farmers to help address their financial pressures.<\/p> <p>  The SBCI is a significant supporter of farmers and the wider agribusiness sector.  We have done this through two main channels.  The first is the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme, which we deployed through three partner banks, all present today, between January and May last year.  This scheme was hugely successful in delivering &euro;145 million in low-cost working capital loans with an interest rate of 2.95% to over 4,000 primary agriculture businesses throughout the country.  Demand for this support was so strong that it reached capacity within weeks of its launch, far ahead of our expectations.  There was a strong mix of farm categories benefitting from this scheme.  Dairy farmers accounted for 45% of the total; beef farmers 40%; tillage 6%; and others, primarily pigs, sheep and horticulture, 9%.  There was also a broad-based geographical mix with a particularly strong uptake on the southern and western seaboards and in Border counties.<\/p> <p>  Our second major channel for supporting farmers has been the low-cost loans we have provided through our network of eight on-lending institutions.  These partners currently include three non-bank providers of leasing and asset finance to farmers and give us excellent reach throughout Ireland, facilitating access to a wide range of borrowers.  Through this channel we have supported almost 23,000 businesses overall throughout Ireland with low-cost loans, leasing, working capital and other forms of finance totalling over &euro;920 million.  We were not surprised to see farmers being among the biggest users of SBCI loans.  Taken together, the SBCI with its partners have deployed &euro;330 million, or 35% of total SBCI funding since it first opened for business three years ago, in funding supports to farmers and the wider Irish agricultural sector.<\/p> <p>  In addition to these direct benefits for the sector, we also have a wider aim of improving the general funding environment for SMEs and farms by stimulating much-needed competition in the financing market.  Our strategy is based on supporting new entrants to the SME financing market, both domestic and international businesses, which in turn enhances the level of competition and encourages existing lenders to offer better terms and more innovative products.  We also use existing operators to benefit from their wide geographical coverage and gain access to as many SMEs as possible.  Ultimately we are aiming for greater diversity in the supply of SME and farm finance, with a wider range of finance offerings and a greater number of finance providers.<\/p> <p>  Our success with the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme comprehensively demonstrates our ability to act as an effective conduit to the Irish market for similar supports schemes in the future.  Building on this, the SBCI recently launched the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme, which is there to support businesses impacted by Brexit, especially food businesses which are often customers of the farming sector.<\/p> <p>  We have included some slides on the activities of the SBCI for the committee&rsquo;s reference.  That concludes my opening remarks.  I hope members have found them helpful and we will be happy to take any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nick Ashmore"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>Thank you.

I think the women will be a bit softer and easier to deal with in terms of trying to get loans for farmers and small businesses.  We have been deeply concerned for the past month or six weeks in terms of the impact the fodder crisis was having on farmers.  A lot of other things are happening as well.  We know the milk situation is getting to a point where there may well be voluntary cessation schemes.  We have reached our level of production well in advance of what was anticipated in terms of Harvest 2025 and so on.  I hope the witnesses are evaluating all those things and the various market situations that are likely to arise for the different farm sectors and products.  I hope they are devising financial packages that can help people.  A lot of investment has gone into dairying, particularly in the last three or four years.  I anticipate that the witnesses are watching that with an eagle eye.<\/p> <p>  It is no use engaging in the usual claptrap of everybody getting excited when the game is over and the teams have left the field and are in the dressing room.  We want to be getting excited when the referee is going onto the pitch.  I am referring in metaphorical terms to the marking that is in place.  I know the SBCI is bringing in the &euro;300 million Brexit loan scheme for small businesses.  The agriculture cashflow support scheme was very successful last year in January and May.  The SBCI has the ear of the Minister continuously and is always talking to him.  In response to various questions that we raise here, he indicates that he is in constant contact with it.  Was there a request to bring forward a cashflow loan scheme this year between January and May?  That would have been very interesting in the light of the significant obstacles facing farmers, particularly over the last weeks.  <\/p> <p>  I am not surprised at what the witnesses are talking about.  The financial institutions are skinning everyone for the cost of money.  They are legalised robbers.  Let us be clear about a few things.  The cost of overdraft money means not one farmer wants to increase or get an extra few bob through overdraft.  The witnesses are all very educated.  AIB told us in its written presentation that it has 16 agricultural science graduates although that figure has gone down to 12 in today's meeting.  There are graduates coming out of UCD and elsewhere in agricultural science and they are very sharp boys and ladies.  They will tell the witnesses that it is the cost of money.  No one wants to get an overdraft because the banks are charging too much.<\/p><p>I am not surprised, notwithstanding that farmers are on their knees.  All the witnesses have said it.  The common thread throughout the presentations has been that no one has looked for an extra penny.  I am not surprised.  The witnesses should ask themselves why that is the case.<\/p><p> I am glad to see Ulster Bank representatives before the committee and I compliment them.  The bank had representatives from Aware, Pieta House and Mental Health Ireland at various events in recognition of the need for mental well-being.  I congratulate the bank on that, but there has been extraordinary strain and anxiety for a large cohort of farmers.  It has been scattered and localised in various areas.  The recent bad weather heralded the feed difficulty, the fodder crisis and various animal welfare issues.  Human health and mental welfare issues arise as well for individual farmers.  As the witnesses know, farmers are attached to animals to the point where they know them by name and so on.  I would hope that what Ulster Bank has done is being seen by others as worthwhile and something that should be taken up.  I compliment Ulster Bank in that regard.<\/p><p> I cannot but go back to Bank of Ireland because I know something about the organisation.  In theory, the bank operates in all major centres throughout the country.  The only things the bank has operating are the buildings.  It has eliminated almost every human face out of the buildings.  The bank has come up with a great idea.  It probably presented it as digital support with potential for 120,000 online applications.  Despite this, the only thing that counts is the relationship between the banker and the borrower.  In this case, we are discussing the farmer but the same applies to any small business.  The bank has virtually removed people from rural Ireland.  Perhaps it is still packing people into the four or five cities but it has certainly removed staff from rural Ireland.  The bank has undertaken wholesale withdrawal.  God help the poor bank employees left behind &ndash; I salute them.  They are working the skin off their bones to keep going.<\/p><p> The bank representatives need not tell me this is not happening.  The Bank of Ireland chief executive was lauding the development as another cost-cutting measure only a couple of weeks ago at the annual general meeting.  Cost-cutting comes at a price and the price is the reduction of the individual reaction, contact and relationship.  I know it myself because I am a customer of Bank of Ireland.  I would not bother my head going in.<\/p><p> Despite this, the bank representatives talk about digital progress.  I hope it is as fast as they are making it out to be.  I would not like to be looking for 120,000 staff with a digital application.  I would not like to be the farmer depending on it either.  What we have now is impersonal banking.  There is no personal contact.  At one time a customer could go into the local bank manager.  The Vice Chairman knows this because he is president of an organisation.  The bank manager knew the customer and everyone belonging to the customer.  The bank manager made a decision based on the immediate situation.  The bank manager knew who the customer was, what he or she would be and could rely upon that, but that approach does not work anymore.  The bank representatives can come before the committee with glossy presentations and so on but I am afraid that I am inclined to tell the truth and tell them what I think rather than what they might like me to tell them.  I have no wish to engage with that.<\/p><p> It is great that the bank representatives can come in with all of those things.  They have not so much shocked me &ndash; I am not altogether surprised &ndash; but no farmer needed a tosser, as they say down the country, during the crisis.  There were little blips and only a handful.  I must be going around drumming up stuff in Westmeath and Longford if that is the situation.  Either I must be drumming it up or I am sleepwalking and do not realise that everything is so good.<\/p><p> I cannot understand the position with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  Let us leave aside the Brexit money which we all acknowledge is important.  The banks probably need more because I figure &euro;300 million is only a start.  We appreciate that fact.  I imagine the banks are all working hard on Brexit scenarios unfolding.  They can see that two people at the top of the British Government cannot agree about what day of the week it is never mind what is going to happen with Brexit.  It is difficult for the banks just as it is difficult for anyone to try to guess what will happen.  The prudent approach to any econometric evaluation is to evaluate for the worst scenario and then perhaps the best will unfold.<\/p><p> Is there a chance of making money available at reasonable prices?  I imagine the bank representatives will tell me they are doing that.  If that is the case, why is there hue and cry throughout the country?  A well-to-do farmer dealing with one of the institutions before the committee asked me to keep highlighting the need for a Sparkasse model or a similar model in this country to give \"those boyos\" &ndash; that is what he called the banks &ndash; a rub of competition.  The farmer in question works extremely hard.  He works 18 hours a day.  He is working the flesh off his bones to meet his commitments.  He believes the banks are charging too much.<\/p><p> I will leave the witnesses with this thought.  That farmer told me that he, his wife and his children are paying for the sins of the bankers.  He said that the banks do not have the decency to put forward a loan with a decent rate.  Meanwhile the banks are shouting.  That is why he is calling for the community-based model of banking to shake up the system.  It is an interesting thought.  Perhaps the bank representatives might take the view that there is no need for community-based banking, that the existing banks are community-based and that they are giving away money at 2% or 3%, but I doubt it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#D00500","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>We will take some questions before we go back to the panel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#E00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":21,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives before the committee from the various banking organisations.  I will follow on somewhat on what my colleague, Deputy Penrose, has been saying.  The common denominator in every presentation was an increase in the overdraft facility as the solution to the problems facing farmers.  As Deputy Penrose has said, any farmer or any person knows that an overdraft is the most expensive way a customer can possibly get money.  Having said that, numerous other loan structures are operated by the various institutions and they are expensive as well.  Given the European rate and the interest rates business people, individuals and the farming community have to pay, the question has to be revisited.<\/p> <p>  We are specifically dealing with the fodder crisis of winter 2017 and spring 2018.  My question is for all the representatives.  As Deputy Penrose has said, the bank representatives have all painted a rather glossy picture.  In their eyes it does not seem to be nearly as bad as we see it.  Do the bank representatives think that perhaps it has not come to their attention yet?  Do they believe merchants have been carrying the majority of the problem of the farmers to date?  As the year goes on, merchant credit will run out and will have to be paid.  Where farmers have had to buy extra fodder as well as grain and feedstuffs through the merchants, they will now have to move into fertiliser, silage wrap and so forth now.  The merchant credit will come to an end.  The merchant will have to call stop.  It is possible that only then will the banks see the seriousness of this crisis.<\/p> <p>  This may be something of a contradiction to what I have said earlier because it may be only coming down the line.  Have the banks seen a spur in defaulters or those with problems and issues?  Has there been a spike in the number of those unable to meet their arrangements with the banks?<\/p><p> I would also like to hear a little more from the delegates on specific sectors within agriculture.  Farmers in my area are predominately suckler cow or dry stock farmers, with some engaged in tillage.  If one speaks to any of these farmers about banking, he or she will say attending a bank is a waste of half a day and dependent on a member of staff actually being available, as Deputy Willie Penrose said.  The bank will ask how many cows is a farmer milking and if he or she does not milk cows, he or she might as well leave and close the door behind.  What are the specific targets for the suckler cow sector and also those engaged in small-scale tillage?  I come from County Westmeath which is not in a major tillage area, but some farmers might have 40, 50 or 60 acres and they are in serious difficulty.  A report was carried out on the crisis in the tillage sector which found that bigger farmers in areas with a greater concentration of tillage were not in as bad a position, but the small family unit is struggling.  When we talk about agriculture, our emphasis should always be on maintaining the small family farm.  Those involved have been forgotten about.  If a farmer is not milking cows, the one thing he or she can bring to the table when looking for a loan is the guarantee of a single farm payment at the end of the year.  Last week Commissioner Oettinger indicated that there would probably be a 5% cut in the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, budget.  When it filters down to individual farmers, how will existing and potential future arrangements with banks be affected if the one guarantee they can provide is a cut in income of 5%?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#E00300","speaker":"1383","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":23,"content":"<p>There has to be a degree of honesty in our assessment.  The pillar banks that are represented before us are in the business of making a profit for their shareholders.  That is what they do; it is the task staff are given by management and shareholders.  The difficulty as I see it is the framework and infrastructure provided by the Government for farmers.  A range of sectors have been vulnerable to cashflow issues and the fodder crisis again demonstrated the very tight margins within which people were operating.  Most farmers rely on the single farm payment for the vast majority of their annual income.  We must be honest and acknowledge that the system has been designed to produce cheap food.  The objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, are centred on the production of cheap food for European consumers and farmers are compensated via environmental and other schemes.  Schemes are dreamed up all the time, but, ultimately, farmers are financially compensated for the poor price they get for their produce which feeds the cheap food agenda at European level.  By its very nature, the sector is vulnerable and because of the way we have set up the framework.<\/p> <p>  I do not have any attack to make on the pillar banks represented as they are in the business of making money.  Has Government pulled the banks into any dialogue or framework aimed at getting them to offer lower interest rates, similar to those offered to farmers in other European jurisdictions?  Has that been mooted?  I read the presentations submitted by the delegates and apologise for missing their delivery.  In Ms Finnegan's presentation I was struck by the use of the word \"dichotomy\".  These things fluctuate, but it has been a decent year in a number of sectors.  However, that may change next year, but this year has been decent.  In the presentation made by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland the huge demand for the agri-cashflow support loan scheme is correctly identified.  I am struck that there is a demand among farmers for low interest rates, good deals and sustainability because of the nature of their industry.  Is the Government taking a hands-on approach?  If the pillar banks are left to their own devices, they will try to make as much profit as possible for their shareholders and reduce the exposure to risk.  I have no issue with this as it is their job, but is the Government asking them to come up with a fairer deal for farmers based on European norms?  That is the main complaint I hear when speaking to farmers and farm organisations.  <\/p> <p>  I apologise again as I have to slip out for about 20 minutes.

All of the delegates are welcome.  <\/p> <p>  I am very conscious that the ultimate problem farmers face in most cases is that margins are tight and that when farmers have a problem, it is also a problem for their banks.  They may find it difficult to meet repayments, etc.  When I was 18 or 19 years old, I borrowed money from AIB to build mushroom tunnels.  At the time the interest rate was 17.5%.  It was so high because I did not have a record with the bank.  The notion within banking, that if someone is struggling, he or she will be hit with a penalty, thus making things worse for him or her, is often spoken about by farmers.  Help is hardest to find when it is needed most.<\/p> <p>  It is clear from the presentations we have heard that a large volume of business with the banks is done with the agrifood sector.  The banks do well from this business.  There is, in times of difficulty, an onus on the banking sector to step up to the mark and support farmers.  That support will be repaid in multiples because farms are long-term businesses, extending for several generations, which are usually very loyal to their banks, provided they work with them.  We are coming out of a financial crisis and we are not going to get into a fight about how it occurred, but there has to be a recognition that the agrifood sector has been to the fore in helping the recovery to happen, from which the banks have benefited. <\/p> <p>  I have a bee in my bonnet about the interest rates being charged.  At times the Government has to intervene and leverage various schemes to lower interest rates, which are still not as low as those charged by the standard banks across the European Union.  I know that people from the various banking institutions have appeared before the committee and provided all sorts of excuse, saying Ireland has a different market and that a different model is used, but it is clear to everybody looking at this issue that the money comes from the same place and at the same rate.  It comes from the European Central Bank at a low rate, yet the lending rate in Ireland is much higher.  I am sure it is acknowledged in private conversations that this is done to fund the recovery from the disaster that happened and that it has nothing to do with different markets and different models being used.  It should be acknowledged that Irish businesses and householders, including mortgage holders, are paying a price for what happened in the past.  We need to put a plan in place to change this.  A way to do it is to start by lending money, particularly to the agrifood sector which has been so good to the banking sector in assisting with its recovery, at the interest rates available in other countries across Europe.  That could be done and there is nothing to stop it from happening.  I suggest the banking institutions and the Government need to consider this carefully.<\/p><p>We need to put something in place such that our financial services sector actually services our businesses, rather than the other way around as has been the case up to now. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#F00300","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":26,"content":"<p>On the agricultural cash flow support loan scheme, Mr. Ashmore said, \"Demand for this support was so strong that it reached capacity within weeks of its launch &ndash; far ahead of our expectations.\"  In the D&aacute;il Chamber I told the Minister that the &euro;145 million being put in place for below-cost capital loans would not be nearly sufficient to meet demand.  That shows the pent-up frustration in the industry at the absence of money at a low cost.  Once a loan was made available that frustration was evident and the scheme closed in a matter of weeks.<\/p> <p>  While the banks were partners in the scheme they were never really happy with it.  The first problem was that the maximum length of the loan was to be six years.  There was a concerted attempt to make it as short as possible.  One of the pillar banks gave stocking loans for this agricash flow which was not the purpose of the scheme.<\/p> <p>  The other drawback was that those farmers who needed it the most, the ones in serious financial difficulties, definitely did not get access to it as well.  The door was closed and they were told the scheme was oversubscribed.  It was a good initiative but the demand just shows the frustration at the cost of credit.  The other speakers have referred to the cost of overdraft and farmers' reluctance to go to the banks to sort out their cash flow problems.  It is very hard to comprehend how the banks can say they do not see evidence of cash flow difficulties on farms at the moment because up to two or three days ago dairy cows were being fed the same amount of concentrate they would normally be fed in February.  The level of its use this spring is double what it would normally be.  We are almost at the middle of May and cows are still being fed significant levels of concentrates.  There is tillage ground not yet sown and that will bring its problems as we go into the back end of the year.  <\/p> <p>  The cash flow problems that arise with the volatility in pricing and our taxation system mean that invariably, as has happened in the past couple of years, we have a high tax bill in a year when income is down.  Do the banks have any view on a system that would relieve that pressure on cash flow?  I am not blaming the banks for the volatility in pricing, although I might blame them for a lot of other things.  In the dairy sector, for example, in 2017 there were relatively reasonable prices for milk but this year it will be down between 5 cent and 7 cent a litre with the increased costs.  In October there will be a very high tax bill to be paid.  Have the witnesses any idea how to get around that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#G00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":27,"content":"<p>Many issues have been raised but I am sure if I leave one out the Vice Chairman will remind me.<\/p> <p>  There are several themes in the questions, one is prices and the cost of credit.  Mr. Lauhoff will address that specifically.  <\/p> <p>  One of the other themes feeds into the Vice Chairman's points about taxation and cash flow. Deputy Penrose spoke about the optimism and excitement about dairying.  We view the agrisector through the lens of volatility, the ups and downs of good and bad years, and we try not to get too excited when there is a particularly good year for profitability or to get too concerned when there is a more challenging year with low levels of profitability.  Irish agriculture has significant competitive advantage over some of its international counterparts and costs of production, while certainly higher here this year, stand us in good stead compared with some international competitors.  We understand, taking the taxation example, that we will need to give support later this year in terms of cash flow as that feeds through the system.  <\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny or Senator Paul Daly mentioned merchant credit and how much of that has come through to the system, and will come through later in the year.  Looking back to the last fodder crisis we expect that the cost of this challenge will feed through into current accounts and lending later this year.  Last time around this was experienced in the following spring.  We may receive requests at that point.  Our operating model remains the same once we are comfortable with long-term viability.  <\/p> <p>  The other point concerned our interaction with the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and our conversations with him.  Bank of Ireland's chief executive officer, Ms McDonagh, met the Minister in the past couple of weeks.  He impressed on us, as the committee has done, the importance of supplying credit to the sector at a competitive margin.  At that meeting we clearly outlined our appetite to continue to support the sector, as we are doing today.  <\/p> <p>  It is not that we are particularly focused on dairying.  That is where the demand has come from.  Most of our customers are not dairy farmers.  The majority have some exposure to the beef sector, be it sucklers or other types of beef production, and we have a significant portion of tillage farmer customers and are acutely aware of the requirement to support them, as we are of the significance of CAP.  While the 5% announcement made earlier this week is probably an early indication of where the budget might go our view is that there is some conversation to be had about the direction of that budget within the overall EU and within member states.  How that will end in respect of individual farmer payments has some way to go yet.  We continue to monitor and assess that.<\/p> <p>  I have tried to address some of the issues raised.  I will ask Mr. Lauhoff to address the overall cost of credit because it is relevant not only to the agrimarket but to all business banking markets. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Farrell"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":28,"content":"<p>Rate is always very topical in respect of the overall cost of credit and how we deploy it.  Competition is part of it but we do have to cover our core costs and there is a return on the capital we deploy too.  Overdraft is the most expensive form of funding for several reasons, even if the lines are not used we have to allocate capital against it and that has to be funded, so that feeds into some of it.  Overdraft is not necessarily the right solution for the pressures at the moment.  If a more enduring cash flow or cash cost is incurred that needs to be funded over several years, a term loan should be in put in place.  In some cases it is more short term where a stocking loan that will be paid within the 12-month period is most appropriate.  Our default position is not to look for overdraft.  We focused on overdraft usage in the presentation because that is normally the first place that we would see signs of cash flow pressure.  Each situation differs from another but the level of cash resources is higher now than it would have been at this time last year.  There are several farmers who have significant cash flow challenges that have been increased as a result of the fodder crisis but we do not see that in some other areas where cash resources have not been spent.  The experience differs according to the part of the country and the sector.<\/p> <p>  In respect of the different interest rates in Ireland and the rest of Europe, another key feature is that the scale of the downturn in the Irish market, relative to much of Europe, has been far more severe in the banking sector here with the consequence that we have higher capital requirements and have to allocate more capital against lending than many of our European peers.<\/p><p>That is a feature in the market that we have to deal with.  Ensuring that we can provide pricing at as competitive a rate as possible and getting a return on the capital we allocate are matters on which we must focus.<\/p><p> The branch model changes were mentioned.  I accept Deputy Penrose's point that the number of staff in the branches has changed significantly.  To ensure that we can maintain a presence in the market and provide a service, we have had to change how we provide that service.  Our focus is to make sure that we have staff available out in the marketplace to meet farmers or business and to be able to discuss their requirements at their place of business where at all possible, and then changing the branch structure too to make sure that it can provide a service.<\/p><p> In terms of our customers' requirements, specifically, in the agri-area when it comes to seasonal-type facilities, being able to apply for and get credit by phone is a significant benefit to them.  It does not take time out of their day.  Historically, where they would have had to come in to the branch to go through their requirements, we now have all the details of their previous history because of the relationship and it enables us to provide that facility through a phone call with no need for form-filling and other issues as happened in the past.  How we provide that service will evolve.  It is a matter of making sure that we can provide a service as best as possible.<\/p><p> Likewise, we have invested in our ATM network in order that farmers can lodge a cheque or anything whenever they want.  We have external lodgment ATMs.  They do not have to come off the farm during the day to do these tasks whereas, historically, they would have had to.<\/p><p> I accept that there are changes.  Some of those changes will take time to evolve but our focus is to make sure we can provide the service through investing in technology and support in that area but also in trying to make sure that we can provide the service for more complex needs on a one-to-one basis.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Lauhoff","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":30,"content":"<p>I will start with Deputy Penrose.  I am sorry for bamboozling the Deputy with the numbers on our team.  There are 16 agricultural graduates on the team.  Four of those are centrally based and 12 are regionally based, and they are all customer facing.  We make a point of hiring agricultural graduates into this team because the technical capabilities and understanding are key to delivering an appropriate service to farmers.  I always say we can build bankers and we can build credit but it is difficult to build the sector knowledge and expertise.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the point around volatility, similar to Bank of Ireland, we are cognisant of the volatility.  We take a through-the-cycle approach to lending to all sectors, not only the dairy sector.  We look at repayment capacity over a three-to-five year period trying to account for any particularly good or particularly bad years, and we base our budgets on budget prices for each of the sectors which are usually somewhat on a divergence from the market prices of the day, for example, at present our budget price on dairying is 30 cent a litre.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the availability of credit, Senator Paul Daly asked has the problem not come to our door yet.  I would say it has not.  The figures we gave to the committee for overdraft utilisation and current account cash balance show the strength of the sector at present.  Cash balances and current accounts in AIB for the farming sector were up 25% year on year at the end of quarter one.  We do not expect that picture to continue throughout the year.  Those bills - all of that feed that is being purchased on credit - will fall due in 30, 60 or 90 days and will have to be repaid.  We will start to see that flow through current accounts and we will be encouraging farmers, particularly to come and talk to us, not to put undue pressure on the overdraft and to look at what other options are available.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the principal option that is available from AIB, we talk about two types of working capital solutions.  The overdraft, which works in tandem with the current account, is the default position.  It is for the unforeseen circumstances and most farmers will operate an overdraft alongside their current account.  We also encourage farmers to take out our farmer credit line.  This is a flexible working capital solution which gives farmers an unlimited number of drawdowns in a 12-month period.  It works similar to an overdraft in that it has to come into credit for 30 days within the year but farmers only pay interest on the drawn balances.  The current rate on that product is 3.825%, which is a competitive rate for farmer working capital.  It takes an amount of management.  Farmers can manage that online, on the phone or through their branch.  We encourage customers to look at that alongside an element of overdraft.  The farmer credit line should be for their planned seasonal expenditure and what is known, using the overdraft for the unforeseen circumstances.<\/p> <p>  In response to Senator Paul Daly's question about customers who have not met their commitments or defaulters, we have not seen any sign of pressure on loan accounts or current accounts.  There was some small amount of pressure, very variable, between individual farmers coming up to the April milk cheque and the milk cheque has more or less washed that out.  There were small numbers of cases.<\/p> <p>  Senator Paul Daly spoke to the suckler sector and the tillage sector.  Approximately 25% of the new money that AIB lends on an annual basis goes to the beef sector.  If one takes the points in relation to CAP, the announcement last week was key for the sector.  We have been stress testing for a reduction in CAP payments post 2019 and we will continue to do so.  Whether the finality of CAP means that there is a reduction in the overall budget where we see greater flattening of payments, or, indeed, if we saw the budget maintained but more funds going from Pillar I into Pillar II, there will be a range of issues and matters on the table that could ultimately impact on farmers in Ireland.  We are already stress testing for that when we lend to farmers for the post-2019 period.  Up to 2019, we are already taking account of what the previous reform has accounted for.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman commented on the SBCI and I will give the figures of our own fund last year.  Fifty-five per cent of the amount of SBCI funding that we loaned to farmers under the low-cost loan scheme was for more than five years and only 4% was for up to one year last year.  We were fairly confident that where farmers came to us with a proposal, we did our best to meet that.  We did not put any tolerances around the amount that had to be loaned over any particular period.  We met the requirement as it came in to us.  Perhaps our figures are somewhat related to the fact that we have a fairly dominant dairy business and the demand was for longer-term finance there.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman made the point that it was hard to comprehend that we are not seeing cashflow pressure at present.  We are just not seeing it in the current accounts - they came off a strong position last year - but we fully expect to see that materialise throughout the summer months and into the back end of the year.  It is anybody's guess how much can be saved between now and middle of August in terms of a normalised weather pattern, grass growth, and how the cost bases materialise.  We expect this to come to our door.  It just has not arrived yet but we will see it coming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Anne Finnegan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":31,"content":"<p>Last year was a good year for Irish farmers, as reported in the Teagasc national farm survey results.  This, combined with the SBCI funding that was available in 2017, left farmers in a strong financial position coming into 2018.  However, they have had it difficult over the past six or seven months due to the adverse weather conditions, a fall in milk price and, for the tillage sector, a delayed spring that will mean that harvest prospects for spring-growing crops will look poor, which will put extra pressure on the tillage sector.<\/p><p>This term loan funding may also be used to finance an additional tax bill that farmers could have coming up to the November period.  <\/p><p> We are currently seeing very little demand from farmers for increased working capital facilities.  I feel that is due to the pressures on farms in terms of the physical workload now; stock was housed for much longer than farmers had anticipated and they are also busy as temperatures rise and ground conditions improve.  Farmers are getting fertiliser out on land, sowing crops and ensuring that they get their business back on track so that they will have enough feed in place for next year.  Their big focus was on getting enough feed, getting the physical performance of their businesses back on track and then they can examine the financial impact of this once they have returned their business back to a normal track of activities.<\/p><p> On the suckler, dry stock and tillage sectors, Ulster Bank's geographical footprint means that we have a stronger presence in the agrimarket around the Border regions and midlands where there are more suckler, tillage and dry stock farmers.  We support the sector there which was evident in our distribution of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, agri cash flow loan scheme.  Ulster Bank had 30% of its funds going out in those particular areas, compared with 15% of the overall fund.  <\/p><p> Deputy Martin Kenny referred to the tillage sector.  We are supporting that sector, however, harvest prospects for 2018 do not look good as crops were sown much later than normal.  Tillage prices may be slightly higher but overall costs for the sector are high and the majority of the demand in the tillage sector is for working capital facilities which we supply to farmers on an annual basis, and which they clear from the proceeds of their harvest.<\/p><p> On the CAP proposals announced last week and the up to 5% reduction, in recent years we have been stress testing CAP payments for our loans that extend beyond 2019.  On milk price, we use a base milk price of 28 cents per litre, plus VAT and fat and protein bonuses on top, regardless of the market milk price.  We try to take a sustainable long-term view of businesses rather than short term, for instance where in 2016 the milk price was very low or last year when it was very high.  Instead we take a medium to long-term view. <\/p><p> The Vice Chairman, Deputy Cahill, asked about SBCI.  Some 50% of Ulster Bank's loans which went out on the SBCI scheme were for a period of three years or more and another 30% of loans were between for periods of one to three years.

We are the only foreign-owned bank now operating in Ireland, following several exits.  Our position would be that providing competition is part of what we do.  We have the smallest market share so we are very focused on trying to provide that competition.  In discussing the cost of capital for a bank, a bank has multiple stakeholders so we must think about depositors and those who provide capital as well as those who borrow money from us.  Part of the challenge is to ensure that we are even-handed across those stakeholders.  As my colleague from Bank of Ireland commented, and this would be something that would be well understood in terms of capital inputs or, to use the technical term, the risk-weighted asset input that Irish banks have compared to European banks, is relatively high.  There are many reports which go to that point.  This is something that will need to work its way out of the system over years as we move past the crisis.  The models that we use are something that we are all working on with the regulatory authorities.  We also see in Europe the history of using guarantee schemes, such as those which SBCI has brought to the market, is much more deeply embedded.  The SBCI have been bringing that focus to the Irish market and will continue to do so.  As we see that come in over time, it will have an impact on relative pricing.

It is the first time that we have brought a SBCI-generated guarantee programme.  We also support and deliver the credit guarantee scheme on behalf of the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation but this was the first time that we took the risk on our own balance sheet of delivering a guarantee.  It was something of a step into the unknown for us.  We saw very strong demand, as we noted earlier, and price was definitely a factor.  The knowledge and awareness around the scheme among farmers was very high.  From the outset, we did not have to do any marketing.  The Irish Farmers Association and other representative bodies took care of that for us.  Among all the SMEs we spoke to and that we interact with, farmers are by far the most switched on in finances and interest rate sensitivity.<br\/><br\/>The scheme was sized for a number of factors.  One was the funding available through the European Commission and the State, which was &euro;25 million.  That was exceptional aid.  A window opened in the state aid rules through which we could then deploy that funding, which was on an exceptional basis.  A European-wide market failure was acknowledged, funding was deployed and a state aid window was opened.  We were able to intervene and provide a support to the working capital side of farming that we would not normally be able to do.  The only way to provide aid through working capital is through a <i>de minimis<\/i>state aid window which is very small, it is &euro;15,000 of aid per farmer in any one three-year period.  If we take up too much of that capacity, direct aid such as fodder supports or other schemes that the Department operates may be restricted in their ability to be deployed.  State aid is a factor in how we can do these things.<br\/><br\/>Early on, the loan duration in that scheme appeared to be a little shorter on average than we expected.  Ultimately, the longer-term loans took longer to come through so that by the end of the scheme when we deployed &euro;145 million, we found that 29% was less than two years in duration while the vast majority of the scheme went out at longer durations, with 23% out at six years.  We got a good spread in the duration of the loans.  <br\/><br\/>We are looking to learn lessons from that scheme.  We have engaged a market research firm to conduct our survey to examine the impact and see what happened on the ground with farmers, and asking questions such as whether the farmers who wanted aid got it and whether the farmers who got it need it.  Getting these answers in a pure piece of research will help to inform us about how the scheme worked and inform new schemes that we hope to bring to market in future.  We are doing that with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We have included questions in the survey to address what the needs are now and what they will be going into the second half of the year.<br\/><br\/>The scheme was first come, first served.  We felt that was the fairest way of doing this for the first time.  There were various criteria around whether farmers had engaged in environmental practices or education processes and those criteria were deployed by the Department and provided some degree of targeting although most farmers qualified in one way or another.  Ultimately, we understood from the banks that the decline rate was about 2% across the board.<br\/><br\/>As we look at new schemes for the future, one question is whether we should support investment loans or working capital loans.  Of the aggregate of about &euro;350 million that we deployed to farmers, slightly over half has been in support of investment loans through the original bank funding that we provided and also through the non-bank lenders.  In each case, we have sought to ensure that the financial advantage of discount that we provide is passed through to the end borrower.  Those discounts have varied over recent years from 1% to 2% and more against what they would normally pay.  <br\/><br\/>We have had very strong interest in our schemes and co-operation from the banks.<\/p><p>It was no easy task to spin up a new product and a new scheme for new lenders to operate and we very much appreciate the hard work of all the institutions in this respect, as well as their co-operation and collaboration in delivering these schemes.  As we do more of them, the process will get easier and will get better.  It is a serial process and, given the number of banks, we can only bring one scheme to market at one time.  We have to manage the demands of the primary agriculture sector and the SME sector.  Our recent priority has been to deliver the Brexit support loan scheme.  We have learned a lot of lessons from the agri scheme and used it in the Brexit support scheme and we will learn the lessons from the latter in our next scheme.<\/p><p> The type of guarantee is important.  We deployed a capped portfolio guarantee in the original scheme and an uncapped guarantee in the Brexit support loan scheme.  The former is easier under state aid rules but the latter has a bigger impact because the capital costs of SME and farming lending are high.  If we can do an uncapped guarantee we can have a bigger impact on the capital requirement and we can leverage the funding available much more significantly.  In the original scheme we had to put a lot of the money into subsidising the interest rate to get it down to where it was.  In the Brexit scheme, where we have a price cap of 4%, we are not providing any subsidy and that is purely down to the guarantee we have provided.  We are starting to work our way through the different options.<\/p><p> The split within the support loan scheme was pretty much equal as between beef and dairy.  We are not in a position to comment too much on price but Central Bank and other research suggests that capital requirements, historic loss rates and new SME regulations increase the cost of administration, and in turn the price of lending.  We also believe a small element is down to competition and if there were more competitors in the market the prices would come down a little bit in line with the economics of supply and demand.<\/p><p> The community banking model is very interesting but very challenging.  Germany and other countries have an effective community banking model but it is massively underpinned by Government support.  The role of KfW in that market is fundamental and enormous but the SBCI is not at that level nor do we want to get to that level and create a Government-reliant market.  We would rather intervene where there are specific market failures and look to the banks to use their capital to lend to the market, rather than relying on a pure Government support.  That is challenging in the farming sector where margins are tight and the onus is on looking at the cost of funds.  It is also more efficient for the State if there is an effective private market in place.<\/p><p> We are seeing some interesting green shoots within the community banking space and a number of credit unions have got together in the west to share their resources to provide loans to farmers.  That is a really encouraging first step and if we can see more of that we may be able to deploy risk sharing in the future to support them in competing and in growing their operations.  We also understand the Irish Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, is reporting a new MilkFlex product today, though I do not want to steal its thunder, which speaks to the volatility around milk prices and is a broader measure than we have seen heretofore in terms of the co-ops through which it can be operated.<\/p><p> We operate through our three non-bank finance on-lenders, Finance Ireland, Fexco and First Citizen, which support farmers releasing hire purchase products so that they can invest in new equipment and facilities.  Our average interest rate across the spectrum is around 5% at the moment.  We are co-ordinating with the Department around new supports that might come forward.  The Minister is the policy setter in this regard while we are the policy delivery mechanism.  We are not here to comment on policy and will leave that to him but we are here to help deliver what mechanism he chooses to use.  We also engage at European level, which is very important because the European Commission is waking up to the importance of financial instruments as it goes into the next multiannual financial framework and we are hearing talk of surveys being done around special financial instruments for farming.  We have been successful in deploying small, SME-type, supports such as the COSME programme which we were the first in Europe to use for farmers.  Indeed, the head of the COSME programme came over to have a look at our books, having been unable to understand how we had managed to do it.  It is about taking European supports, adapting them and making them work with the banking organisations for Irish businesses and farmers.<\/p><p> We are engaged in preliminary discussions with other promotional institutions around Europe and the European Investment Bank, EIB, ahead of the next multiannual financial framework because, as the emphasis pushes more towards financial instruments given budget constraints and their impact on the CAP, we need to be ready to be able to deploy new instruments and supports into the market.  I am meeting the European Investment Bank with a bunch of other national promotional institutions, NPIs, next week in Luxembourg to talk specifically about this and I will put agriculture on the table at that meeting as a key area of concern.  The EIB has stepped up its interest in supporting farmers too.<\/p><p> Farmers are in a strong position in generally being asset rich and so able to access lending through their collateral, which can also have an impact on pricing.  We understand that it is not appropriate in every case, however, and that it is important to have the full range of lending options for farmers, which we will look to support how and wherever we can.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Nick Ashmore","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":36,"content":"<p>There have been a number of cases where farm loans have been sold to various vulture funds and there is a fear of repossession in these cases.

We have circulated a document to the committee to which I will refer.  I am happy to report that I have up-to-date data this morning on grass growth.  It is good to be able to say that grass is growing well after what we all know was a very late start.  There was a substantial drop in grass production from mid-March to mid-April but there has been a recovery since then and the weekend just gone has helped tremendously.  As of this morning, we are looking at growth rates ranging from 50 kg to more than 60 kg per hectare per day.  That is in line with what has been the normal situation for this time of the year.  There are still some parts of the country where ground is very wet.  As the committee knows, the dominant characteristic of the past winter rolling into recent months has been the persistent rainfall.  In many areas, this has been the case since last September.  Only very recently have ground temperatures risen.  That is what has given rise to the growth.<\/p> <p>  I thought I should inform the committee of the responses and actions taken by Teagasc over recent months.  We have had an internal standing committee in place since about September of last year working on the issues that were emerging around the country, particularly in the north west initially but subsequently extending to other regions.  We think a number of the actions we took will stand should a similar situation arise in the future.  One development that was quite successful was the establishment of a fodder register in all 12 Teagasc regions.  That enabled us to identify regularly the number of farmers who were in need of fodder and the number registered with us who had fodder to offer.  Of course, other organisations such as ICOS and the co-ops and indeed the private sector had similar arrangements in place.  In the very early stages of the crisis, we also set up a 24-7 helpline manned by Teagasc staff on a consistent basis.<\/p><p>We focused on putting out key technical messages twice a week during the height of the crisis.  We held almost 90 clinics at our 52 offices and these were attended by nearly 700 farmers.  We had a major campaign of radio advertisements on all local radio stations during the peak of the crisis.  This proved to be a very effective way to communicate.  Of course, we worked closely with co-operatives, farm organisations and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We engaged actively through our discussion group network and in the provision of one-to-one consultations.  One statistic indicates the importance of phone consultations in particular.  This was a very sensitive issue for many farmers and it continues to be for some.  As such, we had approximately 12,000 phone consultations over recent weeks.  More than 8,000 farmers in total were dealt with by way of group contact.<\/p><p> The focus now is very much on the future.  I want to talk a little about our advice on the replenishment of forage stocks, which is a critical issue for the next winter.  I want also to discuss the importance of us addressing the risk of fodder crises in future.  The most important message on the replenishment of stocks is the need for farmers to put a plan in place.  It has been a very difficult situation and it appears easy to talk about planning when one is in the middle of a shortage.  However, it is essential.  My colleague, Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kavanagh, is the expert in this area and she will elaborate on the most important advice for farmers, which is that they must create a fodder budget to establish their needs.  This has proved critical, in particular in situations of deficit.  We recommend, of course, that having created a budget, farmers should maximise the production of fodder inside the farm gate.  We are looking very closely at options for the purchase and contract growing of feed.  This presents an opportunity for some farmers to engage in the provision of fodder supplies on a contract basis.  It will be very important for farmers to assess stock numbers constantly relative to projected available forage.<\/p><p> As regards risk management, our focus is on the adaptation strategies farmers can adopt.  We cannot overemphasise the importance of conducting winter feed budgets.  We have a variety of tools available for farmers to use themselves or in consultation with their advisers.  It is very important for farmers to plan.  We have had some discussions about what might constitute a normal winter, but it is most important to plan for an adequate reserve of fodder.  We recommend eight weeks' reserve as a requirement.  These are not new messages, but they are often pushed to the back burner.  If there is no pressure in a particular year, some farmers may take their eye off the ball, as we all can in similar situations.  It is very important to match grass growing capacity with stocking rates.  We want to address the importance of utilising the grass resource in the best possible manner and that, of course, requires farmers to examine their grazing infrastructure and ensure it is fit for purpose.  We continue to stress, year in and year out, the critical importance of getting soil fertility right.  There has been significant slippage throughout the country in this regard in recent years.  The importance of good soil fertility cannot be overemphasised.  We are looking at the option for many farmers, especially the larger dairy farmers, to engage in contract arrangements, as I mentioned, for the growing of fodder.  Indeed, we are looking at any arrangement to minimise the number of animals that have to be fed on the home farm, including contract rearing of heifers.  It is also important for farmers to examine housing and feeding facilities.  Where farmers must go out on the land, they should pay attention to the type of machinery used to minimise the impact on soil conditions.<\/p><p> We are very happy to answer any questions the Chairman and his colleagues may have.  We are probably in a better position now than we were a number of years ago in terms of our capacity to respond to crises.  We have PastureBase Ireland in place.  This is a national database which allows us to update growing conditions throughout the country systematically.  That can only improve.  We have also brought forward a very effective grass prediction exercise for the week ahead.  We encourage as many farmers as possible to participate in what we call PastureBase Ireland so that they can have that information ready to hand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#L00900","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":50,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman for affording us the opportunity to share our thoughts and experiences with the committee.  I thank the members of the committee also.  As the Chairman said in his introduction, with is Mr. T. J. Flanagan and Mr. Eamonn Farrell.  The co-operative movement has been very active in responding to the difficult weather conditions experienced by farmers over recent months.  A fodder shortage developed along the western seaboard last autumn.  Certainly, it was well before Christmas.  Many of our farmer-owned co-operatives were at the forefront in sourcing and transporting fodder for farmers in these counties.  In many cases, livestock was housed from August on and farmers were unable to preserve adequate levels of fodder for the winter period.  Fodder was transported from east to west by co-operatives to help alleviate that situation.<\/p> <p>  As 2018 unfolded, the late spring resulted in a serious fodder crisis emerging nationally.  As Professor Boyle suggested, normal grass growth failed to materialise due to wet and cold conditions which persisted well into late spring.  Land was saturated and it became impossible for stock to be allowed out.  Cows which would normally be on grass in March and April were housed day and night.  Milk collections were down in March and April with protein levels affected.  The co-operatives were very cognisant of the fact that cow condition may have suffered also due to the level of protein in the milk, with resulting challenges as they approach the breeding season and possible fertility challenges on farms.  The entire period was an extremely stressful one for farmers and farm families.  Most of their waking hours were occupied with concerns around acquiring feed for animals.  The mental strain of this crisis on farmers and their families cannot be underestimated.<\/p> <p>  As the poor weather conditions worsened around the Easter weekend period, a decision by co-operatives to import fodder became inevitable.  A measurable tightening of supply became apparent as farmers who might have been in a position to sell fodder previously could no longer afford to do so as their own fodder situation became a concern.  Co-operative societies, both dairy and mart, have imported approximately 18,000 tonnes of fodder consisting mainly of hay and haylage from the UK and alfalfa from the Continent.  In addition to importing fodder, co-operative members undertook a number of other actions.  Co-operatives sourced and transported significant volumes of fodder within the Republic and Northern Ireland.  They facilitated the transfer or matching up of fodder between their own suppliers.  Some farmers would have had supplies in excess of what they required while others were not in that position.  Co-operative farm advisory teams worked very hard with farmers to identify fodder requirements and to develop appropriate fodder regimes to stretch out existing stocks.<\/p><p>This was consistent with the message from Teagasc and others that taking early action could alleviate some of the worst effects by stretching out the availability of roughage and extending feed rations.  Co-ops made ruminant feed available at discounted prices, and kept prices low even though ingredient costs rose substantially over the period.  Co-op mills operated 24-7 over past two months, an incredible endeavour by all the people involved in the process.  Critically, co-ops applied flexible and reasonable approaches towards credit to members throughout the crisis and that will continue into the summer.  This will be seen on co-op balance sheets as we go through the summer.<\/p><p> We acknowledge the support provided by the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine towards the cost of importing fodder.  The contribution by the Department was necessary to reduce the extra costs involved in sourcing and transporting fodder from abroad.  Despite the contribution by the Department, many of our members have borne a significant increased cost by importing fodder.  It is critical that the entire allocation of &euro;1.5 million promised by the Minister is made available to the co-op sector.<\/p><p> ICOS also welcomed the changes made to the national fodder scheme, reducing the minimum distance requirement of 50 km instead of 100 km.  The scheme worked better when that change was made.  The derogation from the three-crop rule for the tillage sector was a further welcome decision.<\/p><p> In the immediate term, cash flow on farms is a real and pressing concern.  In budget 2018, the Government committed to the delivery of a new low-cost loan measure for farmers.  This must be introduced as quickly as possible.<\/p><p> Earlier today we had the privilege of being at the national roll-out of the milk flex announcement in partnership with co-ops.  It is another significant development by the industry to make available funds that are flexible with the volatility of the milk market.  The repayments will be flexible with that as well.  It is very welcome that the milk flex scheme has been introduced nationally.<\/p><p> ICOS firmly believes that the past two budgets missed the opportunity to introduce a taxation measure to defer income in a good year in order to draw it down in a bad year.  ICOS representatives met Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine officials on several occasions to discuss this in the past two years.  There was significant goodwill towards this measure.  If this measure was in place, it would have been available to farmers this year to deal with the significant added costs associated with the long winter at a time of increasing market volatility.  Prices have been dropping over the past six months and the co-ops have cushioned their members to a great extent, while co-ops in Europe reduced milk farm-gate prices by 7 cent, 8 cent or 9 cent.  It is only now that our co-operatives are reflecting the real market returns.  They have cushioned their members over recent months.<\/p><p> The Department of Finance has announced a public consultation on agri-taxation which will run until 25 of May.  I urge members of the committee to support the inclusion of an income-stabilisation measure in budget 2019.<\/p><p> In addition to cashflow, other practical issues have arisen due to the adverse weather on farms going back to last autumn.  As Professor Boyle mentioned, these issues will impact on the ability of farmers to conserve fodder for the coming year.  In this regard, we welcome the establishment of a co-ordination group by Teagasc, to develop the necessary technical advice for farmers who need to replenish stock.<\/p><p> We need to avoid similar problems in the future.  ICOS calls for a detailed assessment of fodder needs to be carried out on farms after the harvest to identify any shortfalls that may arise in spring 2019.  We know that extreme weather events are becoming more frequent.  The farming community has suffered from a similar fodder crisis in 2013.  Recently Storm Ophelia in late 2017 and Storm Emma in early 2018 caused enormous disruption to the country and especially to the farming community.<\/p><p> The industry and stakeholders must learn several lessons, including the adoption of more risk-averse strategies, such as carrying greater fodder reserves from year to year.  We must learn from this episode that in an ideal world and when things are really good, February is an option in some parts of the country for early turnout, but in many years that may not materialise.  When it does not, farmers who only budget for fodder to mid-February or mid-March have a huge crisis. <\/p><p> The fodder crisis and recent extreme weather events have shown the importance of the co-operative movement and its true value to farmers.<\/p><p> I welcome Professor Boyle's comments on having at least eight weeks' reserve.  That is the key learning of the present generation from a previous generation that recognised it was essential to have a buffer of fodder available in the event of a very difficult year or late spring.  We need to learn that message and need to drill it home.  Teagasc, co-ops and all of us who speak to farmers regularly need to reinforce that message.  I am not sure whether that will be achieved coming out of a very difficult year, and whether the timeframe will allow for a sufficient buffer to be built up.  That will become clear over the summer months.  As I said earlier, if we carry out an assessment of requirements in early autumn and we find there is a risk, we need to take action very early on to mitigate that risk.<\/p><p> I thank the Vice Chairman for giving us the opportunity.  I pay special tribute to co-op boards throughout the country, their senior management and the staff on the ground for the massive efforts they have made in dealing with the fodder crisis and the extreme weather events.  If it ever needed to be demonstrated, this clearly demonstrates the importance of the co-op movement to the farming community and to the fabric of rural society.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#M00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":52,"content":"<p>Mr. Keane mentioned an eight-week buffer.

I know Professor Boyle was a few years ahead of me in UCD.  He will know Dr. Caffrey very well.  I recall clearly what he used to lecture back in the early 1970s that there was one tonne of silage or haylage per adult animal per month.  At that time it was roughly a five-month period.<\/p> <p>  What all the witnesses have said this evening is self-evident and relates to farm-management issues.  It boils down to two things - the appreciation of climate change and its significant impact on the capacity to achieve this, as the Chairman mentioned earlier.  Deputy Cahill is absolutely right that it will be more difficult this year.  The eight-week buffer will require an extra two tonnes of silage or other feed being put aside.<\/p><p>That is it.  If that cannot be achieved, let us face the unpalatable truth.  There is too much hiding, ducking, diving and everything going on, not by the witnesses, but by people in farming organisations and everything else.  There is only one thing to do.  Stocking numbers have to be reduced, end of story.  If one does not have fodder, one cannot be coming along and whingeing.  My own brother is in farming.  He cannot be coming along and whingeing next winter.  I do not want to start repeating the definition of being a fool.  To do something one year is an error, but to repeat it a second or third year is something else.  This is obvious.  If one was sitting in an exam, perhaps a final year exam in UCD or even an exam for an elective module, this is what one would have to say.  The numbers must be reduced, otherwise fodder has to be imported.  If it cannot be gotten it is replaced with concentrate, which is a fool's farthing, or it is imported and one starts on the same thing again.  ICOS will be looking for another &euro;1.5 million, &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million subsidy to import it from Northern Ireland, if it is available, or from England.  That is the only place it will be gotten.  It is all correlated to stock numbers.  The numbers went up by 300,000 like a shot.  There was a perfect storm here.  There was climate change, an elongated winter, a decreased period in which to produce fodder and increased stock numbers.  Talk about a perfect storm.  It was absolutely perfect.  Perhaps some of the events could not have been anticipated but we should remember that we were in a not dissimilar position five years ago.  Now we have the warning.  We had 2013 and the winter of 2018.  That is the lesson.  We have to learn.  <\/p><p> Professor Boyle has hit the nail on the head.  It is now a matter of matching the stocking rate to the production capacity of the land.  That is now very important.  One often sees fields such as one I saw lately.  I knew the stocking rate on the field was not high enough to meet the production.  The rate should have been adequate and the cattle should have taken up more of the land as a corollary.  That is a farm management practice and that has to be addressed.  Next winter I will give a pardon, but if somebody comes to me the winter after that there will be no pardon.  The Chairman is right, it will not be possible to correct this by next winter.  With the help of God the winter will not be as long, but again we are in lottery territory in that regard.<\/p><p> I compliment Teagasc.  It is talking about this winter budget.  I know some its advisers are working hard on that.  Have many participated in PastureBase Ireland?  I referred to it a number of times here.  I thought it was a very useful tool.  Have many of the farmers gotten involved with it?  Again the issue of nutrient replenishment is also down to farm management.  It is about restoring the particular nutrients that are taken out as a result of crop harvesting.  Particularly after the first cut, slurry is judiciously utilised to restore the nutrients that are taken out.  <\/p><p> I compliment ICOS.  It did a great job.  We wish the banks were as reactive as it was.  I compliment it.  I know it will probably find a little bit of a hole in its balance sheet but it is operating on behalf of its own members, which is great, and it has done well.  ICOS tries to be flexible in terms of the cost of credit.  How much did discounting on normal pricing cost across the wider co-operative movement across the last six to eight weeks, which was the critical period?  I compliment it on the work it was doing.  It was a little bit ahead of the curve.  It anticipated the things that were going to happen with a little bit more precision because it was working on the issue earlier.  <\/p><p> I have a question for Dr. Kavanagh.  The Minister was depending heavily on Teagasc to get the predictions right.  It is an inexact science.  The weather could change tonight.  It has changed in the last 24 hours.  Neither Teagasc nor ICOS nor anybody else can predict the weather.  Nor indeed can the Minister.  We cannot lay that with anybody.  Had it not been for the wicked period at the end of January and into February, would there have been adequate fodder in the country if it could have been transported from the south or the east to the west or north west?  Did Teagasc believe there was adequate fodder?  We were given to understand that there was adequate fodder but that then the whole thing blew up and the equations and calculations went out the window.  Was that Teagasc's best guesstimate?  It has a very widespread network of advisers who work at ground level and at the coalface who would be able to give it their best estimates in that regard.  Was Teagasc thrown out of kilter by that sudden event?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#N00300","speaker":"1370","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":55,"content":"<p>Deputy Deering will be back in a couple of minutes.  I want to pass a couple of comments myself because I have to go to the Chamber to talk on a Topical Issue debate.  First of all I compliment both Teagasc and ICOS for their co-ordination efforts during the fodder crisis.  They were never more wanted.  We are here now in the second week of May and it will be a huge battle to get enough fodder in place for the winter of 2018.  There is still some tillage ground that has not been sown.  We can put in crops in those areas which would greatly aid the establishment of fodder for livestock farms for the winter of 2018 to 2019.  People should be advised to take up that option rather than putting in a late crop of spring barley.  The economics of it could be very marginal.  There will be a significant market for fodder beet or whatever other fodder crop is sown.  Perhaps there could be a bit more focus on that.  It might be a common-sense approach for tillage farmers.  Instead of putting in a crop the viability of which would be questionable at best, they might put in crops like that.<\/p> <p>  The other thing that must be looked at is the infrastructure on dairy farms.  An awful lot of our farms are fragmented.  The stock of cows can be in different places.  They all have to be brought to the milking platform in mid to late spring.  There was a practice that the cows would be out for a certain period of the day and there was not the same pressure on the infrastructure.  This spring raised huge questions.  If there are problems, the infrastructure on a dairy farm has to be adequate to cater for the numbers one is dealing with.  In late March and April there was huge pressure on the infrastructure.  How that can be overcome without huge capital investment is a question.  The way it is handled in New Zealand would not satisfy welfare requirements in this country.  The cows there are really just let fend for themselves.  <\/p> <p>  It is going to be a challenge and, as I said, I do not think eight weeks is attainable.  Advising non-livestock farmers to play a significant role in putting that fodder in place would be a major step forward.  I am going to the Chamber.  Deputy Deering is here to resume the Chair.  It is not that I do not want to listen to the gentlemen, but I have to go to the Chamber for a Topical Issue debate.  I will be back in a few minutes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#O00200","speaker":"1350"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1525788000,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Deering resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses today.  In regard to Teagasc and the advice it was giving, I know that in my part of the country people like Tom Coll and Ben Wilkinson were magnificent in assisting and working with farmers.  Teagasc gave advice from very early stages when people began to see that a crisis was developing.<\/p><p>When it did not stop raining from the end of August onwards, it was obvious that there was going to be a crisis or at least some element of a problem, that farmers would need to use whatever silage they had and that there would be a problem around feed concentrates.  One of the criticisms we have of the Minister is that when he did something about the situation, he did not focus on the feed concentrates.  He focused on moving fodder around the State.  Most of us thought that this was almost in contradiction to what was being advised on the ground.  As a result, we now find a situation in parts of the south and the east where the seven of eight weeks of fodder that was a buffer was sucked up into the north west.  When the bad weather continued further into the spring, the crisis was not just in one part of the State but all over the place.<\/p><p> This throws up a problem.  We say to farmers to make sure they get enough silage, enough fodder and extra to do for the winter. The truth is that there are always some farmers who buy fodder every year, and in general most farmers are able to work it out adequately.  Usually in a parish they know the farmer who has a few extra bales every year and the farmer who is a few short and they work it out among themselves, but this year was particularly bad because most farmers did not get a second cut of silage, especially in the north west, because of the rain and the wet and because they were not able to travel on the land.<\/p><p> I am interested to hear the comments on the potential for drainage schemes, where appropriate, for meadow land and in particular on more marginal land.  If that land is drained, at least when there is a break in the weather for a week or ten days, the farmers could get out to cut their silage a little bit later.  When spring time comes, the land would soak away a bit quicker and grass would come on a bit earlier.  I referred to this type of scheme being introduced where appropriate because there are parts of the country where it would not be appropriate.  It would be quite appropriate, however, to have such a drainage scheme in many areas.<\/p><p>Reference was made to the problems with tillage this year.  We have had a very late spring and an awful lot of the grain will not be got in.  What will happen later on?  I understand that some mills are already finding it difficult to source grain and to buy forward because it has not been sown.  What will happen next year?  This will feed into the next possible problem that we will need to look at down the road.<\/p><p> I am aware that Teagasc advises every farmer, as do the people who work in the dairy co-ops, to focus on their inputs and keep their input costs as low as possible.  While farmers are told to keep their input costs as low as possible, there is a difficulty because they rely, as a result, on cheap, imported grain.  This has a negative impact on Ireland's tillage sector which cannot compete with these imports.  If the tillage crop is not going in because the tillage farmer cannot get the price because he is being advised that the other farmer who buys the grain is being advised to keep his or her inputs as low as possible, obviously this has an impact.  There has to be a step back to look at the big picture.  It comes down to the issue with regard to all our products that we try to sell throughout the world.  Origin Green has a big impact on it, but a large portion of the feed that goes into our dairy and beef sectors and into many other sectors is not Origin Green because it is low-cost imports.  This aspect needs to be reassessed and looked at because it will have an impact down the road.<\/p><p> Deputy Penrose referred to stock going up.  More than anything else, stock has gone up with the pressure from expansion in the dairy sector, and this has also had an impact on the tillage sector.  Many dairy farmers expanded to the extent that this has expanded the sector, and it has caused a difficulty and a shortage of fodder.  This has happened even in areas where traditionally they would have been able to meet the fodder demands.<\/p><p> The Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, performed a great service by importing fodder and stepping up to the mark.  The co-ops were there when they were needed, but from our perspective it was unfortunate that we did not have as good or as quick a response from the Minister or the Department to try to resolve the issue faster.  If there had to be an intervention and if it had happened at an early stage, then the crisis would not have spread so much as we would not have had as large a problem.<\/p><p> The lesson to be learned from this is that we need to stand back and look at the big picture.  We cannot keep expanding without understanding that we must provide for the expansion.  We also cannot continue to suggest to farmers that they must keep their inputs at a low cost if it has an impact on another sector of the farming community.  We need to look at the bigger picture to come up with solutions that will work for everybody.  We are all dependent on one another and each of us in the agrifood sector is dependent on Ireland's reputation around the world for the food we produce.  There is an opportunity to ensure that Origin Green means what it says, and if we intend to make it mean what it says, that it will provide a solution for the farmers everywhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#O00400","speaker":"1345","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":59,"content":"<p>I welcome the witnesses today and I thank them for their contributions and the work they have done through the crisis.<\/p> <p>  My initial question is to the witnesses from Teagasc.  I ask that they do not get me wrong.  We are where we are and it is not about a blame game.  Perhaps they would consider this as constructive criticism.  When we took the Minister on, from as early as last October, he referred always to Teagasc's good advice and the advice of the standing committee.  He was, however, in denial that the situation was a fodder shortage.  He almost blindly walked from a fodder shortage into a fodder crisis.  At all junctures the answers we got back from the Minister were based on the advice he received from Teagasc.  As I have said, I am not in the blame game, and while we are a long way from solutions or back to normality, based on experience we are out through the other side.  I presume that Teagasc has had a debriefing and has analysed everything that has happened over the past six or seven months.  What would it do differently if we were to face a similar situation at the next harvest?<\/p> <p>  Other members have commented on the suggested ideal of an eight-week reserve.  It was pointed out here, and it is as obvious as the day is long, that we are now in the middle of May and there are still cows and cattle grazing on what would normally be silage ground and which would normally be cut in the next two to three weeks.  This ground is still not stripped due to the fact that the cows had to be turned out because there was no feed left in the yard.  Farmers are currently at a minus one situation as they start out to build up that reserve.  What advice or plans would Teagasc give to its advisers to help the farmers?  I cannot see how we will build up a reserve.  I am familiar with the exact situation of some farmers on the ground and I cannot see how they will get to a situation where they will have enough fodder going into next winter, even if it turned out to be a short winter, let alone have an eight-week reserve.  What advice is Teagasc giving to farmers to try to overcome this deficit?  Other members have said, quite rightly, that it is due to stock density and that numbers may have become too big.  The numbers are there, however, and we will not get rid of them between now and September.  Has Teagasc a plan of action for farmers who are in deficit with regard to fodder and who are now two or three months behind when it comes to forage requirements for next year?<\/p> <p>  Do the representatives from ICOS see a major credit crisis coming down the tracks?  While we have turned a corner and the grass is growing, the 30, 60 or 90 days on the ICOS accounts will start to show regardless of whether farmers will be in a position to pay the money they owe for the extra feed and fodder they needed to get through the crisis.  What will be the knock-on effect of this come next September and October when the 2018-2019 winter commences?  How will ICOS help in that regard?  I compliment ICOS on the support it has provided to date.<\/p><p>I have stated previously that unless we handle this situation properly and manage it correctly for the next four to six months, we will be at the commencement of the fodder crisis of 2018-19 and both organisations here today will have a major role in trying to avert and avoid that.  We are depending on the imponderable, which is the weather.  We have no idea, as we could be lucky next year.  It could be a short winter and people might be able to get their feet back on the ground.  The situation with farming and weather is that we have to plan for the worst and hope for the best.  Can the witnesses envisage many farmers being able to turn the corner and get the reserves, both financial and fodder wise?  I know of farmers who are in far greater credit difficulties with the organisations before the joint committee than they normally would be or would have had any intention of being in at the start of the year.  They have no way of paying the extra money they owe to them.  While they would have planned for X amount of fodder or meal, in some cases they had to purchase twice as much but their income will not double.  Do the witnesses foresee a major crisis when it comes to the dates for those payments being due with the merchants?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#P00200","speaker":"1383","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Like Senator Paul Daly, I thought the writing was on the wall for this issue last October and I raised it in the D&aacute;il in October, November, February and March.  The Minister stated that based on Teagasc figures, there was sufficient supply within the country but obviously, that was not evident because everybody knew otherwise.  Even in the area where I come from, there are cows that still are not out yet, believe it or not.  Thankfully, the co-operatives unquestionably played their part and that must be recognised.  The marts where hay was imported also helped.  Up to last week it was still coming into the north west, where people in Manorhamilton could not keep it in.  Mr. Martin Keane will be aware of that harsh reality.  What has happened has happened and there is nothing much we can do about it.  I believe a meal voucher system certified by Teagasc people on the ground would have been a much more prompt response.  While &euro;1.5 million is available, where farmers were under severe pressure and stress the meal voucher system would have been more effective and could have been introduced much quicker.  It is something we should watch for next year.  There will be no surplus; we can all accept that.  I know farmers who gave silage to their neighbours to get them over the hill and had to turn around and buy fodder themselves afterwards to keep going.  That is the harsh reality.  From what I can see on the ground I do not think there will be any surplus this year but we need to be more careful next year.  Whatever has to be done next year, needs to be done in time rather than waiting until there is a complete disaster.  A lot of cattle have died.  I know people in the dead animal collection business and they have three lorries running flat out to meet demand.  That is partly as a result of bad feed, fodder and weather.  It is not all one issue but there is no doubt but that people are at their wit's end.  There is no question about that.  I agree with the mention of high costs.  There should be a system put in place in the budget where a taxation measure should allow a farmer to carry on from a good year into a bad year because if there was ever evidence of that, this is one year that can be used as an example.  It should be looked at and it should be proposed in the budget.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#Q00200","speaker":"1344"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":62,"content":"<p>Before we go back to the witnesses I must apologise, I had to step out for a while earlier on.  I welcome the witnesses to the meeting.  I have a few questions on the issue.  It is ironic that the sun is shining at the moment and we are talking about fodder, which is the time to plan for the future.  The most important point from the last number of months concerns the lessons that we have learned.  I have often heard that an opportunity to develop on what mistakes have been learned from the past should never be wasted and it is important that whatever is learned, there must be structures put in place for the future, be it from an advisory point of view or a co-operative point of view.  A lot of good work has been done and everybody has to be complimented on that for getting a lot of guys over the hump and some guys have unfortunately still not got over the hump from a farming point of view.  In my neck of the woods, I saw two loads of fodder coming through Tullow today.  Professor Boyle would know well where I am talking about.  That would not be perceived or known to be a difficult area but today I saw two loads of fodder going through the town.<\/p> <p>  Stocking levels need to be looked at for the future.  It is a huge issue.  In the past we were talking about getting better before bigger.  In the past number of years, rightly or wrongly, we have got bigger before better but I am open to correction on that.  That is an issue that needs to be addressed.  I ask the witnesses for their opinions on an issue that I raised here before, namely, the idea of Food Wise 2025.  Agriculture in general has huge positives but there are very ambitious targets in Food Wise 2025 - creating 25,000 extra jobs and increasing exports by another 50% up to &euro;18 to &euro;19 billion.  We also must take into account the cost in all of that, be it from a farming or the costing point of view.  Agriculture is resilient but resilience can stretch.  This will be a difficult year.  In my opinion, it will take a number of years to get over this year.  Last year, 2017, was probably the first good year since 2013 and we are probably back to square one now or minus one.<\/p> <p>  I ask Teagasc what structures it would like to see planning-wise to build up the reserves that were mentioned earlier on?  Grass growth has been quite good in the last number of days and it is amazing the amount of time that can be gained and Teagasc will know more about that than me.  There appears to be extra stock in the country at the moment that will require extra feeding.  How will we get over that balance?<\/p> <p>  The other issue I will ask about is that a lot of huge bills are outstanding at the moment.  They are bigger than they were in 2013 and Revenue bills are coming down the line.  The year 2017 was quite good.  This is an issue that has not been much discussed and it needs to be factored into the overall planning going forward.  Revenue bills are obviously something one cannot get away from and must be paid when they fall due.  How will those be planned for?<\/p> <p>  I refer to the plan for the eight-week reserve and how we could best be doing that.  We could be lucky this year, it could be a short winter and a long summer and there could be lots of growth.  We could have built up natural reserves but in the event that it is a fairly difficult year, how will we plan for that in the future?  Professor Boyle might lead off or before he starts, Deputy O'Keeffe has come in late so I will take a question from him before I go back to Professor Boyle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#Q00300","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I welcome the presentation by the witnesses from Teagasc and Professor Boyle.  I am concerned with the eight weeks Professor Boyle mentioned.  Is eight weeks even enough?  What have we learned?  I am not too <i>au fait <\/i>with the north west of the country but when the fodder crisis moved down to the south, if it is closely looked at, the farmers on the good ground were in a bigger crisis situation than the farmers on the wet ground.  They seemed to have a better management system in place with fodder storage over a longer winter period.  We were all great at driving on the process of increasing milking capacity and the national herd in the last number of years but was there enough focus done on the management of the herd?  What I am trying to say is that it was all about getting from calf to cow out to grass and the emphasis on that is why we have yards with no stock or fodder.  The farmers had the idea of getting the cow out to grass straight away and not even having some straw in the yard, just having a clear yard.  Should we be changing our focus on that farming practice on good land because the major problems seem to have arisen during the fodder crisis on the good land?<\/p><p> Deputy Willie Penrose has mentioned that we have to consider reducing herd and stocking rates, but the Chairman will realise 100 cows will do the same damage as 300 in a paddock.  I, therefore, ask the Teagasc officials if we need to review the eight-week fodder reserve for the future?<\/p><p> Tillage farmers always play second fiddle when it comes to farming practices and a crisis.  It was mentioned that mills were working 24 hours a day to get feed out, but some of them had problems in getting raw materials at the ports.  If we had produced more grain in the country, the mills would have had more grain.  The emphasis seems to move from any type of farming to milking, but that affects dairy farmers because those farmers who move into dairying do not have proper raw materials at source.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#Q00400","speaker":"1278","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I call Professor Boyle to respond to members' comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#R00200","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":66,"content":"<p>I will ask my colleague Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kavanagh to comment on a few points, if that is in order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":67,"content":"<p>That is fine.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#R00400","speaker":"1268"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputies and Senator Paul Daly for their questions and observations.  <br\/><br\/>One point concerned what would happen next winter taking account of fodder stocks which I believe Mr. Keane mentioned in his presentation.

All of us involved in the business tend to look at growing conditions.  We all try to anticipate weather conditions, although we are not very successful at it.  It is difficult to do, but we always live in hope things will improve.  In so far as weather information was available which we mined as best we could, we are fairly happy the assessment we made at different times of the year - on a regular basis - was as good as it could have been.  However, what we did not have an adequate handle on was the actual stocks of fodder on farms.  I advise Senator Paul Daly that it is certainly a lesson we have learned.

We can observe extreme events and a couple of years of heavy rainfall in the winter and the spring, but this is an issue we will have to examine closely  Until we get a firm handle on it, we will not be able to move to the next stage of assessing what it means for the farming system, turnout dates, fodder reserves, etc.  That is a critical point.  <br\/><br\/>I strongly agree with Deputy Willie Penrose on the farm management issue.  It is a farm management problem.  Ultimately, each farmer has to make his or her own decision on stock numbers relative to feed capacity.  I can speak for myself in a different context.  At times we can take the odd risk, particularly in a good year.  We can say the next one will have to be as good, or if it is a bad year behind us, that the next one cannot be as bad.  Unfortunately, such wishful thinking is not adequate for any of us.  It goes back to the basic point that every farmer needs to engage in adequate budgeting and we will be there to help them in that regard.  <br\/><br\/>I take on board Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe's point about fodder reserves.  As everyone here has attested to or most others have said, having an eight-week reserve is not possible this year.  Of course, it is not.  That is the target in a normal winter.  One could disagree with it, but that is the rule of thumb we are using.  As it transpired after the fact - we do not have full evidence on this but are looking into it - unfortunately, many farmers, probably those who recently expanded their farms, as well as those in the more commercial farming region, did not have adequate fodder supplies.  They were nowhere near having an eight-week reserve.<br\/><br\/>A specific question was raised about PastureBase Ireland.  It is a hugely important tool.  We believe it will be extremely valuable for the future.  It is a slow burner in terms of the uptake.  Approximately 2,000 farmers, mainly dairy farmers, are using it, but that is nowhere near the number I would like it to be.  We have made a substantial investment in the system.  It is a very useful tool that provides us with growing information across the country.  It is a national service.  We provide the information, just like a weather forecast, every day on our website which anyone can check it.  However, the real benefit will be gained on individual farms by farmers who follow the system.  It is not easy; I would not say it is an effortless system., as it is not.  It requires considerable skill for a farmer to be able to use it, but there is a pay-off economically in maximising grass utilisation, but, as we now know, there is also a pay-off in managing a fodder reserve.  A modification we are making to the PastureBase Ireland tool is the inclusion of fodder conservation and budgeting as part of the package.<br\/><br\/>Both Deputy Willie Penrose and Senator Paul Daly raised the issue of the prediction of the crisis and whether Teagasc had been somewhat conservative in calling the fodder crisis that developed.  Certainly, as I said, our emphasis on understanding the actual fodder reserves on farms was insufficient.  Understanding them would have made a big difference.  We were following the prevailing weather conditions at which we were looking very carefully from last August.  We instigated the internal committee in August and I had regular reports, virtually every week, on my desk.<br\/><br\/>There is talk about stock numbers.  Nationally, we have lower cattle numbers now compared to the peak at the end of the 1990s, but it is not a national problem.  There were difficulties nationally in getting fodder from areas where there was a surplus to areas in which there was a deficit.  Some small amounts of imports helped.  Nationally, there was not a problem, but the fodder was not in the right place.  That was the issue.  We all know that we are understocked nationally.  The problem is on specific farms.  Some farms have expanded rapidly.  We have had extraordinary growth on dairy farms during the past three years, as the Chairman will be aware.  That is a positive development, but, as someone said, the eye was taken off the ball in matching growth in the numbers of animals on individual farms with the growth in the fodder available.  If budgets had been made, it would have been anticipated.  It is a basic point for a farmer to know precisely the amount of fodder he or she is carrying into the winter relative to the number of animals he or she has, but with expansion, I can understand how matters could get out of kilter for some farmers.  They may have intended to cull cows but they did not do it for one reason or another and carried on with the same numbers.  Perhaps they had more heifers than they had anticipated and neglected to make adequate provision.  We have to go back to basics and recognise that farmers cannot carry more stock than for the number for which they have feed.<\/p><p>It is not prudent from an economic, an animal welfare or an environmental point of view.  That is one of the basic messages.  I agree that eight weeks is going to be very difficult.  Deputy Cahill made that point.  I do not disagree with him.  However, he also made the point that there is an opportunity here.  I have been saying for a number of years that we have a very serious problem in our tillage sector.  I do not think it is widely or sufficiently appreciated.  However, this is an opportunity.  There is no doubt about that.  Our assessment is that it is going to require contractual arrangements.  It cannot be expected that a tillage farmer will grow fodder without getting a guaranteed price for doing so.  It just will not happen.<\/p><p> That is more difficult to deliver than not.  A dairy farmer will look at a tillage farmer and probably say that he is in the same position.  Both have to take risks on price.  The dairy farmer might ask why he would have to enter into a contract.  It will not happen, however, except on that basis.  I consider the establishment of contracts that can be enforced as important infrastructural development.  We have developed a template and we agree that there is an opportunity here for farmers to get together and, in particular, for dairy farmers to contract.<\/p><p> I appreciate the comments made by Deputy Martin Kenny regarding my ICOS colleagues.  This has been a difficult winter for every adviser working with farmers on the ground.  There is doubt that people have been under stress.  We have found that it was nearly as important to deal with the stress situation as it was with the technical deficits that some farmers were achieving.  I was heartened by the way farmers responded.  The reserve that we established was a kind of a neutral ground for farmers to offer fodder for exchange and for people to lay out their preferences.  It was a tremendous community effort.  There were, of course, commercial transactions but there was also a very strong community response.  That will not happen year in and year out.  There is no question of that.<\/p><p> The focus on input costs was also raised by Deputy Martin Kenny.  Our message is always that money is a scarce resource and that people should minimise input costs.  Farmers, millers and so on will always tend to go for the same quality but at a lower price.  It has to be the same quality on a like-for-like basis.  That is perfectly understandable.  We would all do the same.  We are not going to pay over the odds for diesel or petrol in our cars.  None of us is any different.  I do take the point - and it is something we have said repeatedly - that our grain sector needs support now.  It is very dependent on direct payments.  There have been several bad harvests.  It is not within our remit but I also agree strongly on the point about the Origin Green label.  I have said that publicly before.<\/p><p> There has been a certain pressure on dairy expansion.  An expansionary situation is a very dynamic one and it is very easy to cut corners.  We have always said to farmers that they have to put efficiency before expansion.  It is the less risky strategy.  Young farmers in particular have massive ambition to grow their herds.  That is understandable.  We always tell them to do their farm plans, pause and then ask where they are relative to their peers in the context of efficiency.  It is a far less risky strategy to plan for what can be managed.<\/p><p> I take Senator Paul Daly's point on what we might have done differently.  The main lesson for me is to focus on the fodder storage and to determine and assess whether that is adequate.  Looking at the prevailing climatic conditions and the data, it was - if the Chair will forgive the pun - an extraordinarily perfect storm.  Right up to the middle of March, grass growth was on par with last year.  The conditions on the ground were very poor but grass was growing.  Then, over a relatively short period, we went into a meltdown situation.  I am not sure that anyone can predict that.  I return to my earlier point that we have to understand - and farmers need to understand - what fodder is available on the ground relative to their stock.  I agree that is difficult.  We are sticking with the eight weeks at the moment as a prudent guideline but we cannot be definitive about that.<\/p><p> On Deputy Deering's point, there are lessons for all of us.  I do not think that we should waste an opportunity.  An important point was made in respect of Food Wise.  We cannot grow one sector of agriculture without it being interdependent on others.  That is a sophisticated and complex relationship.  As I was listening to the discussion, it was very obvious that a sector cannot be grown without there being adequate fodder.  That means dairy farmers are going to be more and more dependent on others to produce fodder and to contract to rear cattle.  That will enable other sectors to generate good stable incomes, which is a positive.<\/p><p> I make the same point about the environment.  Dairy farmers are now dependent on people growing trees.  That is an example of the complex interdependency we are now facing.  As we think about this, perhaps those interdependencies might need to be fleshed out much more in the future.  I think I have answered most of the questions.  Perhaps Dr. Kavanagh might come in on some of the points I missed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#R00500","nonspeaker":"Professor Gerry Boyle","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":70,"content":"<p>On the eight-week reserve, I think we will find that very difficult to do this year.  Our main aim at the moment is to try to maximise forage production.  We are probably in peak growth at the moment or we are heading into it.  We are putting out messages at the moment to get farmers to close as much silage ground and get out as much fertiliser as possible to get a decent first cut.  It is hard to make up ground on the second cut if there is not a decent first cut.  That is our main focus now.<br\/><br\/>As Professor Boyle said, we will carry out a fodder census in the first week of July.  That will give us a fair idea of where we stand in respect of the remainder of the year.  Silage yields will be back maybe 20% to 30% on where they would be at normally.  There is ground to be made up.  Many dry stock farmers are reliant on a very good first cut and may not make a second cut.  They will now have to rely on a second cut to make up that deficit.  The first focus will be to try to maximise forage production within the farm gate, whether that is a first, a second and possibly even a third cut in some cases.  We will do the fodder budgets in early July and then at least the farmers can make up their minds.  Some grains may be an option also as the Chair mentioned.  Whole crop grains could be an option as well as on-farm storage of grains, and some of the brassica crops may also be an option for some people.  Kale will be gone at that stage but there will be other options such as rapeseed, tyfon stubble turnips and some of these other grazing <i>in situ <\/i>crops that may help to reduce the demand.<br\/><br\/>Outside of the farm gate, we are looking at those type of options or buying in grain off the combine and storing it on the farm, where that is possible.  It will come back then to stock numbers when people are doing those budgets.  The initial budget will be based on a normal winter.  If there is a facility then, the eight weeks will be put in.  I do not believe that we will build it.  I think that will have to be done over the next two years.  The hope is that next winter will not come bad and that we will not be not in the same situation.  However, it is not realistic to try to build it over the coming winter.<br\/><br\/>Some people will have to look at stock numbers.  On drystock farms, they may have to look at selling weanlings in the autumn rather than waiting until next spring.  Cull cows may not be held on farms.  In the context of dairy farms, we are looking at a relatively small number that are at these very high stocking rates.  The typical stocking rate on dairy farms is 1 livestock unit per hectare.  We grow approximately 11 tonnes of dry matter on dairy farms.  That is roughly enough to sustain 1.8 to 2 livestock units.  I refer to the guys above that.  We have about 7,000 farmers in derogation.  We do not have accurate figures on them but we are probably talking about half of them being at these very high stocking rates.<\/p><p> One lesson relates to the reserve and that is for everybody.  The lesson for those with high stocking rates is that they should try to match grass-growing capacity with those rates.  Our message has always been that one cannot expand unless one has the grass-growing capacity.<\/p><p> Professor Boyle mentioned soil fertility.  Many more farmers will have to focus on this.  We still have a problem with soil fertility.  Some 13% of farmers have good soil fertility in terms of pH, phosphorus and potassium.  That is still a major issue.  The grazing block might be fine but many outside blocks are still struggling with soil fertility.<\/p><p> We are going to see more contract growing of feed for the heavily stocked farms.  That will raise questions.  Once one goes outside the farm gate to buy in feed, one is exposing oneself to high feed costs.  In a low-milk-price scenario, one is more exposed and the system is less resilient.  We are working on this, however.  We have contracts in place.  There are sample contracts for people to examine.  We have done a little bit of work in that area.  In my region - Wexford, Wicklow and Carlow - the take-up rate has not been great but we are going to have to build on that in the coming years.<\/p><p> There are two sides to the demand for fodder, namely the supply of fodder on the farm and the demand.  I refer to the stock numbers.  I am not sure that heavily stocked farms will reduce their numbers but they might look to outsource the contract-rearing of heifers and take them off farm.  There has been some take-up on that but there is probably potential to do more.<\/p><p> With regard to grazing infrastructure, we saw the farms that are well set up this year in this regard and where it was possible to get out between the showers to do some grazing.  Work needs to be done to improve the grazing infrastructure in order that stock can get out and graze more easily in between spells of bad weather.<\/p><p> Deputy Cahill mentioned farm infrastructure.  The issue became very evident where stock had to be housed for long periods.  We need to examine this.  We need to do so in any event under the nitrates directive but, aside from that, the question of having adequate facilities to store feed must be borne in mind.  We have seen dairy farmers who have expanded but who might not have expanded their silage pits to match.  Therefore, an investment will be required.  That will require money.  The machinery required to spread fertiliser must be considered.  I saw a response about farmers who manage to spread fertiliser earlier in the year.  There was a big question as to whether there was value in it but the reality is that there was a good response.<\/p><p> The lesson for everybody is that we will have to put this reserve in place.  It will not happen overnight.  It will take a year or two to do it.  On the other side, for the heavily stocked farms, winter feed budgeting will need to be done on a yearly basis.  We are going to be charged with the job of running a campaign on this annually to get people to budget.  This is always in the background when we are hosting discussion groups or dealing with clients, but perhaps we have not pushed for annual budgeting as hard as we should.<\/p><p> With regard to an early warning system, the likes of PastureBase will be a very useful tool for us to try to predict where we are going to have a fodder deficit.  There is a little work done on satellite mapping so that grass covers, etc., can be mapped to try to predict a problem coming down the line.  As Professor Boyle said, one of our problems is trying to establish exactly what stocks are on farm.  I do not believe I have anything else to add.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Siobh&aacute;n Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":72,"content":"<p>Is there any analysis in respect of those in the dairy sector, the beef sector or elsewhere who were most severely affected in the past?

They just have not grown the grass to match their stocking rates.  This is the group we will try to target with advice to make sure the issue is addressed.  They will not reduce their stocking number but should improve their grass-growing capacity on-farm and then look to reducing demand by outsourcing heifers and avail of contract-grown feed.

He is accurate enough in the assessment there is room for some improvement in farm management, but significant progress has been made in recent years.  The Deputy said we have too much ruminant stock.  The bovine number for 2017 was 6.6 million.  It is worth noting that the bovine number in 1996 - 20 years ago - was 7.4 million.  The sheep numbers were 8.9 million in 1992 and 3.9 million in 2017.  There was a reduction of over 60%.  Therefore, to say there is a considerable amount of extra stock is an invalid assessment.  There might be extra stock in some places but, overall, from 2013 to 2017, the bovine numbers have gone up by 5.7% and production has gone up 30%.  Farm management practices and all that goes with them have improved immensely over the period.  We are now getting much more return from the resources that exist.<\/p> <p>  There is universal agreement here on the necessity to create some headroom.  It is a matter of how we go about that.  Deputy Cahill, before he left, made some very valid observations on the use of tillage ground.  I am certainly not an expert on tillage and do not purport to be.  The people to my right are much more qualified to speak on that.  The sowing of crops that are suited to this time of the year could help, assuming there is a contractual arrangement between the tillage farmer and the likely user of the product, thereby giving room.<\/p> <p>  The use of catch crops might play a role later in the summer.  A tillage farmer who was sowing corn last week said to me that there is a certain risk but all is not lost if the overall season, and not just the sowing date, turns out to be late.  I refer to where crops do not come in too quickly.  This comment was from a very substantial grain grower, which shows that there is some room.  Certainly, we will not make up all the deficit.  I welcome the fact that there will be an assessment at two points in time, in the summer and early autumn, to establish the facts and let us know exactly what will be required for what would be expected to be normal.<\/p> <p>  To say that people could predict and have management practices in place to deal with the extraordinary challenges of the past six or eight weeks would be stretching it.  No matter how good one is, one cannot predict that it will be -4&deg; Celsius or -5&deg; Celsius on Easter Sunday.<\/p> <p>  I echo exactly what Professor Boyle said when he referred to climate change and the fact that we need to establish much more scientific evidence.  It is not a matter of questioning whether climate change is happening but of determining the immediate effect.  We cannot plan for what we cannot measure.  Right now, no one is able to tell us exactly what is involved other than that we might have a particular kind of climate in 50 years' time.  A more immediate assessment is required.  Extraordinary events seem to be more frequent.  Met &Eacute;ireann would not exactly say that what happened recently is directly linked to climate change because we have always had extraordinary events.  The years 1984 and 1985 were extraordinarily challenging.  It could be a little over-simplistic to look at this solely in terms of climate change.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Martin Kenny is very well informed.  I would not disagree with anything he said.  The advice to feed concentrate and stretch fodder and roughage was very important.  To a degree, that advice was followed.  What seemed to have happened in the latter part of the spring, however, was related to the availability of fodder from the south, where short winters are normally expected.  Deputy O'Keeffe referred to this.  Extraordinary weather events from mid-March onwards took farmers in the south by surprise to a great degree.  They would normally be in a relatively comfortable position.  Some people exported fodder north and west and then found themselves short later on.<\/p><p>It may not be that it did not exist.  That made the position worse.  <br\/><br\/>Deputy Kenny spoke about land drainage.  Drainage of any land used for agricultural production, as distinct from other types of production, should be encouraged.  The point was made about mills having difficulty.  There were pinch points.  It is not that the product was not available internationally but delivery dates might have been tight.  Mills might have experienced a certain tightness in the delivery of some of their raw materials. <br\/><br\/>Keeping costs down was mentioned.  All of us, the co-ops included, would echo that point.  Keeping costs down and ignoring the reality is a very different thing.  One has to farm the circumstances.  One cannot farm the book.  One has to farm the circumstances that present.  In a difficult time, one has to adjust one's strategy.  It does not mean that one flitters money away but one has to adjust to the reality and ensure that keeping costs down in the short term may not be the right answer.  One might need to take a longer term view.  <br\/><br\/>The Chairman referenced the issue of expansion only.  We have to get better before we get bigger.  The Chairman is absolutely on the money.  We have to ensure people do not just expand because they can.  They have to be sure they are optimising efficiency and their returns.  Huge work has been done in this area.  Reference was made to Food Wise 2025.  We have a huge opportunity as a country.  The consumption of dairy products is increasing by 1.5% to 2% globally.  Globalisation is here and we are seen as a very efficient producer of food.  We have to protect that image.  Reference was made to Origin Green.  It is absolutely essential that no damage is done in any way to our image or our green image.  The fact that 85% or 90% of our production is from grass is important.  That does not mean there will not be the odd blip for a month here or there.  We would not want to panic and lose all sense that we have a very natural product that we are exporting to a huge number of countries.  We have to congratulate Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia for the work they do in helping to promote Irish products.  They need to stick with us as an industry and ensure we have people on the ground in emerging markets to bring as much of the product to full value as we possibly can.  We need to get full value and at the same time keep our costs to a minimum.<br\/><br\/>Senator Paul Daly asked whether more could have been done earlier.  The committee might have thought I would say this anyway as I represent the co-op industry.  A very simple measure around a voucher system on buffer-type feed would have had a role to play.  I could not disagree on that.  The evidence was there that there was a difficulty facing into the winter.  No one could have predicted how severe it turned out to be and that we would arrive at a situation where on 1 May, we see it out in the sun and are not used to it.  <font color=\"#FF42F9\"> <\/font><br\/><br\/>The co-ops and credit were mentioned.  It will take a number of months before the full extent of this will fully materialise.  My anecdotal evidence is that the increased debtor books on co-ops is there.  I should not speak for the banks but I imagine they would say the overdraft facilities look okay right now and there is not a big increase.  I am sure they would say that because I have heard it said before.  I would not be totally surprised by that because the first port of call for a farmer for credit is the co-ops rather than the financial institutions.  I would call on them, as the year progresses, to show forbearance particularly in the area of extending overdraft facilities because it will be necessary.  As the Chairman said earlier, the November period will be a challenge in light of the fact that 2017 was a good year for price and yield and people will be facing into big tax commitments, all of which will have to be discharged.  None of us is here to argue against that.<br\/><br\/>I refer to what I said earlier.  We missed an opportunity in the past two years - Deputy Scanlon referenced this - to have some form of income deferral.  If we had done that in the past two years, the result may not have materialised too much in 2016.  However, in 2017 if the opportunity had been there and if from a cashflow perspective farmers had deferred a proportion of their receipts, they would be in a better position now facing into the November period to deal with their tax liabilities.  Credit and short-term credit will manifest as an issue.  The banks have a role to play.  We saw earlier today the launch of the MilkFlex fund.  It goes back to an earlier point about infrastructural development that is required.  I think Deputy Cahill mentioned the need for infrastructural development before he left.  We will call for more imaginative funding mechanisms such as the MilkFlex fund.  It will only satisfy some of the demand but it is very innovative.  The repayments fluctuate with the milk price.  It is a unique tool and we welcome it.  The banks have a role to play and they have to be more flexible around short-term credit.  The cost of credit is always an issue.  That is why MilkFlex is there.  It is because the cost of credit here is higher than it is for our competitors.  It is not for me to go through the exigencies of why that is the case but banks, because of their historical performance, have a necessity to rebuild balance sheets.  A certain amount of forbearance might be required on their behalf, as was required by all of us as taxpayers over the past number of years.  <br\/><br\/>The Chairman asked about the lessons to be learned.  There are huge lessons to be learned.  We have to do things better before we get bigger.  We have to plan.  The initiative around the fodder and how we fix next year and how we assess where we are before we go into next year is absolutely critical and essential.  <br\/><br\/>From an ICOS perspective, all of our co-operative members will endeavour to afford extended credit terms while at the same time all of the boards involved will have a huge responsibility to protect the balance sheet because a co-operative in a weak position will not be much good into the future.  While there will be a facility to help, I do not think we should be burdened with the total responsibility of it ourselves.  We have to protect the balance sheets of the business to allow it to continue to grow and develop.  <br\/><br\/>Mr. Flanagan or Mr. Farrell might want to add something.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#T00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Keane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":76,"content":"<p>For clarity on the fodder that moved and the support the co-ops provided, as Deputy Kenny will know, well before Christmas there were substantial volumes of fodder moving into and around the north west in response to the particular problems that were there last year.

We do not have the numbers for it yet but we will say a few thousand tonnes moved supported by that.  We do not have the numbers yet.  Then there was the import scheme that came after the realities that hit us over Easter weekend.  We think around 18,000 tonnes were supported for import then.  In parallel to that, there was probably close to twice that volume of fodder moved into the south of the country from down around the east and from Northern Ireland.  There was a lot of maize silage and grass silage moved as well and that was all brokered by co-ops without any support.

A number of the co-ops are putting themselves in as a broker to reassure the tillage farmer that he or she will get paid.  I reiterate the point about the last opportunity as last year, notwithstanding the disaster in parts of the country, was very good for most dairy farmers.  Volumes were up 9%, the milk price was up 9 cent per litre and constituents were grown consistently.  However, people were hit with a large tax bill.

We attended a meeting of the joint committee in private session on 30 January, at which point we had a useful discussion on the issue and how it relates to some of the key financial supports operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We also offered to come back to brief committee members in public session on any further developments on the issue of the burning of land, and I will outline today some of the main issues in that regard.  As I outlined to members of the committee in January, the range of area-based schemes available to farmers, such as the basic payment scheme, BPS, greening and the areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme, are vital supports which help to underpin the continued development of a competitive and sustainable agrifood sector in Ireland.  These payments also provide a significant financial boost for individual farmers and the wider rural economy.<\/p> <p>  To ensure that these payments continue to issue in an efficient and effective manner, it is essential that the Department continues to implement a range of administrative verification checks to underpin the payment of &euro;1.6 billion annually under these schemes.  It is in this context that the issue of the burning of land is so important.  The Department will continue to ensure that the verification checks required by EU regulations are fully in place and that we can continue to build on our strong record of delivering payments to farmers under these schemes.<\/p> <p>  When I updated the joint committee in January, I outlined the position regarding the ongoing investigation of cases of burnt land outside the permitted timeframes in 2017.  At that stage, a number of cases had been identified and processed and the appeals process was under way.  I am happy now to be able to update the committee on where this process now stands.  In general terms, where the area on a given holding determined to have been burned exceeds 3% of the eligible area declared on that holding, an administrative penalty of 1.5 times the area burned is applied.  In reviewing the appeals received to date, the Department has decided that, where an applicant has proven to the satisfaction of the Department that she or he was not in any way involved in the burning of the affected lands, this administrative penalty only is waived.  The land remains ineligible, however, and thus no payment issues in respect of this land.  This is the position which I outlined at our previous meeting.  This is due to the fact that where land has been burned, it is not in a state suitable for agricultural activity such as grazing or cultivation and cannot then attract a payment under the basic payment scheme.<\/p> <p>  To date, 100 farmers have submitted appeals to the Department regarding burnt land.  Sixty-nine of those appeals have been internally reviewed and accepted.  In these cases, the administrative penalties have been reviewed but the burnt land in question is not payable for 2017.  The farmers have been written to, notifying them of the outcome.  The administrative penalty reimbursements due have issued to 51 of the 69 cases to date, with &euro;67,321 being reimbursed.  The remainder will be reimbursed as appropriate in the near future.  The remaining 31 appeals are under review by the Department.  Some farmers have been requested to submit additional information.  Should any applicants wish to pursue these decisions further, they can lodge an appeal with the independent agriculture appeals office.  It is also worth noting that, all other things being equal, the burnt land in question should be eligible for inclusion in 2018 BPS applications.<\/p> <p>  At our previous meeting, I also updated the committee on the communication initiatives the Department had put in place in 2017 regarding this issue.  Given the importance of this issue and how it impacts on key scheme payments for farmers, I am in agreement with the committee&rsquo;s view at the time that every effort should be made to ensure that farmers are aware of the rules and regulations in this area and, most important, of the impact that the burning of land outside of the permitted timeframes can have on their payments.  As part of the annual cycle of applications for BPS, all farmers receive an application pack early in the year.  This pack includes the terms and conditions for the BPS which set out, among other things, the main elements that farmers need to be aware of relating to land eligibility.  As we discussed in January, the burning of land can impact on the eligibility of land for payments under schemes such as the BPS and thus this important document outlines the relevant rules in this regard.  These terms and conditions are also available to all stakeholders on the Department&rsquo;s website.<\/p> <p>  I am conscious that the terms and conditions of the BPS contain a large volume of important information for farmers.  With this in mind, the Minister, Deputy Creed, issued a specific press release in March of this year explicitly to draw farmers' and advisers' attention to the closed season during which it is illegal to burn land.  This communication set out very clearly that the illegal burning of land in the period between 1 March and 31 August could have a number of implications for farmers.  It set out that farmers who burn land after 1 March should be aware that they risk prosecution; such land is not eligible for payment under the BPS; the inclusion of illegally burned land in the 2018 BPS application may also result in reduced payments and penalties in other area-based schemes such as the areas of natural constraint scheme; the illegal burning of land can also render the land of neighbours ineligible for payment; and the identification of lands that were burned during the closed season may result in such land being inspected by the Department.  The purpose of this communication was to be as clear as possible about the rules surrounding the burning of land and to alert farmers to the impact it may have on their payments and so on.  The press release was timed to coincide with the closed period for burning while also allowing farmers plenty of time to ensure that they reflected accurately their eligible land in their BPS applications.<\/p> <p>  The Minister also urged farmers and the wider public to be mindful of the damage that burning can cause and to take appropriate care.  To reinforce this message and to ensure that the communication was received and understood by as many farmers as possible, the Department also issued a text message to farmers in March.  The Department regularly uses text messages as a means of getting succinct messages directly to farmers on key issues.  In this case, the text issued to remind farmers of the closed season and to draw their attention to the possible impact of burning on their payments.  In addition we have also held discussions with farmer representative bodies to ensure further a clarity of message around this important issue.<\/p> <p>  On the current position, the Department keeps the situation in relation to the burning of land under review.  While there have been some isolated reports of burning recently, I am glad to report that we have not witnessed any evidence of burning on the scale witnessed at this stage last year.  I reiterate that farmers and the wider public should remain vigilant in this regard.  This will be especially important as weather conditions change in the coming weeks.  The Department will continue to investigate matters related to the illegal burning of land as they arise.  I am confident, however, that the rules around burning and the impact on payments have been clearly communicated to all the major stakeholders.  We also continue to prioritise the processing of scheme payments as a matter of the utmost priority in the Department to ensure that those vital financial supports are paid to farmers in the most efficient and effective manner possible.  My colleagues and I are happy to discuss the matter in more detail and we will do our best to answer any queries.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#W00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Dillon"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":94,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Dillon.

We are all aware that much of this burning happened through no fault of the farmer.  It was not malicious.  It was not that they were burning out of season.  It was maliciously started in many cases and they had no control over it.  If land is burned in April, that land will be grazing again in June.

The very tiny proportion of people we are talking about feel highly aggrieved that this is happening to them and that they are the ones being punished for it.  I just do not see how this land can be taken out of the picture when it is not the farmers' fault at all.  If a farmer had something to do with it, fair enough, but when it is not their fault it is just so unfair.  It flies in the face of everything we are trying to do to encourage farmers and help them survive.

It is a part of the 50 km Sligo Walk.  Some 5 km of the walk goes across that mountain.  It is a very successful development, supported by the Sligo Leader programme with the permission of the landowners and the users of the mountain, who allow people to traverse the designated walkway.  There was a <i>camino<\/i>there in May 2018, during which 1,000 people registered and walked across that stretch of the mountain.  Perhaps as many as 50 or 60 people walk this route every day, before, during and after May.  There are 30 farmers there.  In fairness to the people concerned, the Minister said that where there is burning people will be fined.  The question, however, is who started this fire.  Farmers are very much aware of the rules and regulations around payments and how they are drawn down.  They will not do anything to jeopardise that, because they cannot afford to.  They need every cent that they get to survive, especially in that particular area, where the land is very poor.  These people are now technically being accused of starting a fire, which they did not.  It could have been any one of the 60 people a day who walk that walk, who could have thrown a cigarette butt or a piece of glass.  We must remember that the weather was very dry in May of last year.  It was the best weather we had for the whole year, and a lot of people were using this walk.  It is very unfair that these farmers are presumed guilty straight away and money is deducted from them.  It is very wrong that this should happen.  There is no proof of who started the fire, quite honestly, and I genuinely do not believe that any of those farmers did it.  They know the rules and they have to live within them.  None of them would jeopardise payments to anybody else.  I feel very strongly about this.  The decision here is very wrong, particularly when nobody knows.<\/p><p>I can understand this on closed and fenced mountain land, where there is not pedestrian traffic of this kind.  In this case, the support of the local farmers allows a facility which is very beneficial to the community from a tourism point of view.

That is the type of activity that takes place across that route, and I think it is terribly wrong that farmers are found guilty of starting a fire with no proof.

I see that the Minister appealed to farmers and the wider public.  How can the farmers who are being penalised be responsible for the wider public?  As I understand the commonages that I am dealing with, the farmers did not set the fire.  I am very sure about that.  One man who has been penalised has a severe handicap.  He cannot see.  He has received no payment at all yet.  He did not get any for Christmas, and he has not got any now.  To me, that is repulsive.  It is very wrong.  In another instance, the man who has been penalised had just come through cancer and several trips to Cork on a bus for radium treatment.  He did not set the fire.  In fact, his brother rang the fire brigade and did everything possible to quench the fire himself, as did other farmers, who put their own lives in danger.  I know they did, because I have been involved in trying to control fires at other times.  That is the worst place you could be for your health.  Afterwards, one can get pneumonia.  Anything is possible after trying to stop a fire.  It is very wrong.<\/p> <p>  One of these mountains is a location where people walk.  The public goes to the top of these mountains and enjoys this wonderful amenity.  I refer to the Paps Mountains in Rathmore.  Some of these farmers have received some money but they have been told they will get no more and their green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payments are affected.  This is not good for tourism or it will not be if this is to be the way.  It seems that farmers are going to be penalised because of the wider public.<\/p> <p>  I do not know how the fire started but in one of the commonages it definitely came in from outside.  The farmers saw the fire coming onto the land but could not stop it.  For the farmers to be penalised for the fires that commonage is very high-handed action and I very much feel for them.  It is totally wrong.  It is like putting someone who did not commit a robbery in jail because he was related or had some connection to the person who did.  That is not the way to do business.<\/p> <p>  I am asking the departmental officials to go back and look at these cases again.  They know about the cases from Kerry as we have been making representations on their behalf.  They should ensure that this never happens again.  The farmers called the fire brigade and did what they could themselves to stop the fire.  They did not start it.  I am asking the Department to look at what it is doing before it does this to people who had to go without their payments for their Christmas dinner.  To hell with ye, the Department seems to say; manage on your own.  It will not give the payments to them.  That is not fair.  I raised this with the Minister the D&aacute;il, as did Deputy Scanlon and others.<\/p><p>It is the wrong way to go about business just because the Green Party or some other group here says we should not burn any lands at all.  It is wrong to take this high-handed action against good people.  We should remember that these payments are merely compensation for failing to get adequate prices for the stock they are rearing.  They are not Christmas gifts.  It is not Santa Claus over in Europe sending over these moneys.  Farmers are entitled to these payments because they are not being properly paid for the produce they produce.  The Department needs to get its methods right and deviate from this action of penalising people 100% where the level of commonage is greater than the rest of the enclosed land they have.  It leaves them with nothing.  I am glad to have had this opportunity to raise my concerns on behalf of people on commonages and in inland parts of Kerry who have been penalised so heavily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#X00400","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":101,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for attending today to address the issue and giving us an opportunity to ask a few questions.  Reading what has been said, the first obvious question is as follows.  The mountain was burned in April last year.  By mid-summer it would have well grown back.  In fact, within three or four weeks, it would have been getting quite green.  In some cases, it will have grown back a great deal greener than it was before.  The Department would pay on turlough land even if one got a very wet year with a lot of flooding when it might be very late in the year before the turlough dried out completely.  My understanding is that the Department pays on those turloughs even in a wet year.  I take it the reason for the disqualification has nothing to do with the fact that the land was burned.  Perhaps the witnesses could clarify that.  My understanding is that the disqualification was due to the fact that it was burned illegally.  There is a difference.  If it were a simple matter that it was burned and was not green for a very short time in the year, it would still be likely to be green in that year for as long as, oftentimes, many turloughs are.<\/p> <p>  That brings me to the second issue, which is that people were penalised because someone carried out an illegal act.  If someone broke into one's house and did damage, one would not expect the State to double the damage by penalising one for something over which one had no control.  In most of these cases, there is no evidence whatsoever that any of the farmers had any connection with the burning.  In fact, as the officials opposite know, most of them were able to produce significant evidence from the only people who can decide whether to take a prosecution.  All the evidence was that these people were not suspected of having had any hand, act or part in any illegality.  What we have been doing, therefore, is penalising people for something they can prove they had nothing to do with.<\/p> <p>  I move to the next issue.  On a lot of these commonages, one might have 300 ha with 250 legal owners.  Of those, only 50 or 60 may have stock on the hill.  The reality, however, is that their legal share in the commonage is very small.  Therefore, the payments to a lot of these people are very small and they do not have huge resources to pay planners for appeals.  Many of these farmers are in the older age bracket, but they have a legal right to continue to farm.  The level of stress involved in getting affidavits from solicitors and obtaining independent evidence from law enforcement agencies to show they are not suspected of wrongdoing can be enormous and totally disproportionate to any alleged issue.  The witnesses are saying that even if someone proves he or she had no connection with the fire, they will still penalise that person.  The penalty is imposed not because the land could not be grazed but because someone did something illegal on it.<\/p> <p>  I was very surprised at the Department.  It presumed everyone was guilty.  In the case of anyone whose land was burned and who claimed for it, the Department not only imposed a deduction of the amount of land that was burned, it also imposed a penalty of 1.5 times the land involved.  That is what happened last autumn according to what is before us here.  Is that 1.5 times penalty irrespective of the percentage of the land one holds?  In other words, if the land is more than 20% of one's total landholding, does the administrative penalty increase or is one disqualified from the scheme on the basis that one had an over-claim of over 20%?  The Department might say that if 20% of a farm burned, it would be a hell of a lot of land but that is not so.  If I have 100 ha of land, 20% of that is 20 ha and that is a lot of land to have burned as an individual.  However, if I have 5 ha of land, as with some of the cases which were sent to the Department, and 1 ha of my share is burned, I have a 20% over-declaration.<\/p> <p>  I note to the Chairman that, coming from Kildare, one might laugh at 5 ha farmers.  However, there are a lot of much smaller farmers in Poland.  There are huge numbers of very small farms, as well as some enormous farms in Poland.  As such, we are not an outlier in having very small farms.  In reality, most people who farm in Kildare were born there.  Most people who farm in Connemara were born there.  They did not choose to be born there.  It was an accident of birth.  They will have other ways to make a bit of their living which would be strange in Kildare, namely, some seaweed harvesting and fishing.  They make out fairly well in their own way by adding up all the bits of income along with a job.  Each part of that income adds to the total household income.  If that farmer only had the job, he or she might be on the subsistence side but a bit of farming, seaweed harvesting and fishing added in changes things.  The other big industry in our neck of the woods is teaching Irish to those who do not have it.  When one adds it all up and looks at the houses people have, one realises that these are the most creative people on earth.  Given the hand they were given to play in terms of land, they have made the best of things.  We should also recognise, however, that this &euro;2,000 or &euro;3,000 is the icing on the cake that makes the difference between pure subsistence and some comfort.<\/p> <p>  To summarise, is the reason for the deduction because it was an illegal act or because the land was burned and the forage was unavailable?  How does the Department answer the turlough analogy in circumstances where the effects of the burning lasted only a short time?  Why did the Department penalise people first when it was obvious that none of these people had been questioned or summonsed for an illegal act and the presumption of innocence therefore applied to them?  Did the administrative fine increase where the over-declaration was above 20%?  Did it increase even further if it was over 50%, which could happen in respect of a very small hectarage of hillside and did in a lot of these cases?<\/p> <p>  We want to exploit all of our resources in the west of Ireland.  What we might lack in agricultural land, we certainly have in recreation land.<\/p><p>Farmers allow it to be accessed for free.  There are very few things in this world free anymore.  If I went to Leitir M&oacute;ir, M&aacute;im&iacute;n, Leitir Meall&aacute;in, Creag O'Duibh and Glean Eidhneach and headed up the mountain, most people would welcome me with open arms because it is an important source of wealth generation in the area, even though individual farmers do not gain from it.  The likelihood is that it was not farmers who started the fires.  I do not know who did, but it could have been young people or they could have started spontaneously or lit by strangers.  The obvious danger that would stop a really super and growing industry - the recreation industry into which we have all put so much time - is that farmers would react by saying they would not risk their payments, as someone could go up the hill and might be careless in using a match or having a picnic and leaving a bottle behind which would be enough to light up the hill.  We have to look at the big picture and say if that were to happen, the very successful work which has been ongoing since 2003 to rebuild the hill walking industry would be set at naught again.  I hope the Department will reverse its view on this issue and tell the European Union that it has to cop on and provide for a reasonable application of the rules.  We have an Irish Commissioner for agriculture who understands conditions in this country and I am sure it is not beyond him to ensure the rules will be applied in a realistic way, not in a way that has a lot of negative effects on communities, the economy and individuals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2018050800002#Y00200","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":103,"content":"<p>I return to Mr. Dillon.

When we carry out an investigation, we find which land has been burned and which has not.  Every application is looked at individually.  There are other reasons also.

Deputy Charlie McConalogue had asked for the burden of proof to be outlined.  The relevant articles are Articles 77 and 97 of EU Regulation No. 1306\/2013.  Article 97 relates to cross-compliance, while Article 77 refers to eligibility checks.  We took a lot of advice on this issue from our legal services.  They gave us very comprehensive advice.  Members will also be aware that we are subject to continuous audit, particularly by the Commission.  It can impose very harsh and draconian penalties on Ireland if it deems that it has been remiss.  The regulation was examined by our legal services which gave us the following advice.<\/p><p>There was scope for an administrative penalty where the burden of proof was lesser.

That makes a difference from a tourism point of view.  Perhaps those landowners should consider their position and close off the land given how farmers are being treated.  There is no proof whatsoever of anybody starting a fire.  I accept the point that has been made that issues arise and penalties are in place, but in all honesty farmers generally obey the rules because they know they have to do so.  Up to 60 people a day are walking across commonage on a mountain.  This is supported by the Sligo Leader programme through the provision of timber walkways across bogs and other facilities, on which a lot of money was spent, and because of farmers agreeing to allow it to happen.  Anybody could have thrown away a cigarette butt or a bottle.  We had the best weather at that time in 2017.  As an indication of how popular walking in the area is, 1,000 people registered to walk on that camino over the May bank holiday weekend in 2017.  In fairness to the farmers, they are doing everything they can to support their local area, but because of what has happened they are being deprived of a substantial amount of money without there being any proof whatsoever of any of them having started a fire.

Deputy Scanlon knows about it.  The main area that got burnt in Connemara for which people were penalised is a very small commonage with an enormous number of shareholders.  The Department said the fines should have been deducted from the payment.  I do not believe that should have happened because the shareholders had nothing to do with burning it.  This has very little to do with the fact that the land was not available for a month or two and more to do with the fact that somebody carried out an illegal activity.<\/p> <p>  Let us suppose the shareholders had decided to reduce the commonage and follow the Department's instruction.  If the total payments were approximately &euro;1,000, how much would it have cost for one year to pay somebody to walk the hill and measure it so that it was known what deduction to make?  Let us take the average planner in Galway or Athenry coming out to Connemara to measure it all up carefully.  It would probably have cost 30% of the total payments the farmers would have got.  That is outrageous and unfair.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe there was not a legal way out of this.  When I was in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I always admired that when something needed to be done, a clause, a way and a means would always be found.  The departmental officials who are present are very fair-minded people.  They tell us that it is the law.  I have heard about EU auditors forever and, as the man says, they do not frighten me.  Unless there is big cheating, I presume even a European auditor would not fine Ireland for paying farmers for something they did not do.  I presume the Commissioner would not allow that kind of bad publicity to fall on his head.<\/p> <p>  If this situation cannot be corrected retrospectively, I am sure the Department can get the Commissioner to change his mind now and say that where land was burnt, it was not caused by the landowner and there is no suspicion on him or her, he or she gets paid.  Is it possible to get the Commissioner to change that rule going forward so that this crazy anomaly is addressed?  I am not the expert on this but if it has to be changed in Europe, let us tell the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, who understands this scene better than most because he had responsibility for hillwalking before he hillwalked to Brussels.

Everyone accepts that, yet the farmer is being punished.  There is a clear injustice in that which everyone accepts.  Is the interpretation of the regulation the problem?  Is it being interpreted very strictly?  We have all come across situations where EU regulations are interpreted in Ireland differently from how they are interpreted, for example, in France, Italy or Spain.  The slight variation may make the difference.  If it is a question of interpretation we should be able to work out a solution.  Everyone accepts the farmer is not the guilty party, but it seems there is a fear that if the land is burnt and the farmer is let away with it, next year or the year after a lot more land will be burnt and farmers will say they did not do it.  Is there a concern that if the door is left slightly ajar, there will be more fires?  Honestly, I do not think there will be.  I do not think there are any farmers who want to burn land outside of the legal provision to do so in limited circumstances.<\/p> <p>  I do not understand why there is such a very strict interpretation of this rule.  From talking to people in Brussels, it is my experience that they understand there must be exceptions to the rules.  They live in the real world.  They understand that there will be times when things happen, and in such situations it is more than appropriate to look after the interests of the farmer who is doing a public good by allowing people onto the mountain.  Most of the payments are payments for a public good rather than for productive farming because in general they are not productive areas for farming.<\/p> <p>  The interpretation of the rule is one point.  Is it being interpreted too strictly?  If the officials feel that is the only way they can interpret it, let us see what we need to do to change it.  If that is the conclusion they come to, we need to seek to make the change straight away.  I am inclined to take the view that a solution must be found in the meantime for those farmers who have been denied their money in respect of this situation.  In fairness to them, they are doing a public good and that is the same in most places, and they are not the guilty party.<\/p><p>There is an injustice in it.

It is a great pleasure to be here.  <\/p> <p>  In my brief opening statement I will outline the objectives of the ESRI's study of the environmental impact of fiscal instruments, the approach used and the findings, particularly in respect of the taxation of motor fuels.  I was the lead author of the report which was completed while I was still at the ESRI.<\/p> <p>  The research which was funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, sought to assess the extent to which fiscal instruments in Ireland, particularly those not specifically aimed at achieving environmental goals, had environmental impacts.  The premise for the work was that while the fiscal implications of taxes, tax expenditures and subsidies were usually well understood, other potential impacts were sometimes ignored.  This is important, given that the fiscal system, by adjusting prices, can play a significant role in changing behaviour.  Overall, the findings confirm that a large number of fiscal measures have some effect in at least one environmental domain and that specific tax changes can make a significant contribution to achieving environmental objectives.<\/p> <p>  The approach used in the analysis was, first, to conduct a simple assessment of the potential environmental impacts of a large number of existing and potential fiscal instruments.  This considers the incentives a particular measure sets, the likely resulting behaviour and the consequent expected environmental impact.  The environmental impacts considered covered the main domains of climate change, air quality, water quality and land but did not include resource intensity.  In total, 142 measures were considered, for which 246 impacts were identified, which implies that, on average, measures have an impact in more than one domain.  The most widespread impact is on climate change emissions, with 98 measures having impacts.  The least common impact is on water quality, with 23 measures having impacts.  Just over half were assessed to have a likely positive impact on the environment.<\/p> <p>  The nature of the initial assessment of environmental impacts of the 142 measures does not identify the size of the environmental impact.  It also does not provide a definitive assessment of the effects.  To achieve this, a more thorough analysis is necessary.  Therefore, a more thorough analysis was conducted in four case studies, including of the difference in diesel and petrol excise rates.  The choice of case studies was influenced by the importance of specific sectors in generating  environmental impacts and data availability.<\/p><p>The choice of the case studies in the report was influenced by the importance of specific sectors in generating environmental impact and by data availability.  Agriculture and transport are the two largest contributors by sector to overall GHG emissions in 2015, so measures affecting those were chosen.  As an example of measures that we would have liked to have looked at, a lack of data on the number and type of company cars prevented us from analysing the tax treatment of company cars.  In future, that is something the committee might be interested in.<\/p><p> It is important to note that the changes in the tax system in Ireland introduced in 2008 have had a significant effect on CO2 emissions as they incentivised the purchase of more efficient vehicles - from a CO2 perspective at least.  In 2009, just 13% of new cars registered were in the lowest emission category but by 2016 that had increased to 78%.  However, the rising stock of new vehicles was accompanied by longer travel distances and somewhat larger cars, so that on average the efficiency improvements have been more modest than one might expect.<\/p><p> Research has shown that the increasing dieselisation due to the motor tax changes introduced in 2008 resulted in lower reductions in nitrous oxide, NOx, emissions than would otherwise have been the case.  Furthermore, diesel vehicles produce significantly higher levels of particulates, PM, impacting significantly on air quality.  That and the vehicle emissions testing scandal have raised the awareness of these emissions.  The higher level of emissions compared to those claimed by manufacturers combined with growing traffic volumes have resulted in poor air quality in many European countries.  As a consequence, and given the need to meet EU air quality regulations, many cities are now considering diesel bans or at least bans on diesel vehicles that do not meet the Euro 6 standard.<\/p><p> In order to assess the potential impact of raising the excise rate for diesel to that of petrol a simple simulation was conducted.  This involved assessing the response of motorists to a change in the price of diesel resulting from excise equalisation, which was based on estimates of the price responsiveness from the academic literature.  These calculations take the current composition of the vehicle stock, which have been significantly determined by the tax changes introduced in 2008 as given - that is important as the results would be very different if they were calculated using the 2008 car stock as a basis.  The simulations do take into account that some motorists might switch to petrol vehicles.<\/p><p> The analysis shows quite broadly that an equalisation of excise rates of petrol and diesel to the current rate for petrol would reduce fuel consumption, drive down vehicle-related emissions and provide a revenue boost to the Exchequer.  The simulation results suggest that NOx emissions would be reduced by 3.8% and PM emissions would be reduced by 4.1%.  Tax revenue could increase by more than &euro;500 million.  It is important to note that these simulation results are not precise predictions, but indicate the broad magnitude of the effect holding other factors fixed.<\/p><p> Overall, the analysis shows that the environmental impact of the fiscal system should be studied more carefully as some measures have significant environmental costs.  The appropriate reform of these measures could make a significant contribution to reducing Ireland's GHG emissions and reduce local pollution.  I again thank the committee.  I am happy to take any questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#A00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Morgenroth for his opening statement.

Has he seen any research to consider the long-term effects of vehicle taxes on petrol or diesel vehicles and the evolving development of electricity as a fuel transport system?  The Government has said that by 2030 we will have a ban on any new vehicles with internal combustion engines.  I presume it will still take a couple of decades after that for the lifecycle effects to take effect but one would hope that by 2040 or 2050 we will have a 100% electric fleet.  Is Professor Morgenroth aware of any work done by a government to look forward in such a timeframe at how it will replace its tax revenue base from excise duties on diesel and petrol and VRT?  How do we start to plan for that phase out or how could we encourage or accelerate it by adjusting our tax system?  There is an impetus there that we want to maintain given that it is not an insignificant chunk of our revenue base.  No finance Minister will want to undermine his long-term viability.  Has Professor Morgenroth or anyone else done any work on excise duties or tax changes on petrol and diesel as part of a long-term strategy rather than a short-term reaction to variations in diesel prices?<\/p> <p>  My next question is a broader more philosophical one.  I am on the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment and we recently had officials in who are looking at the next iteration of our evolving response.  We have to formulate a policy document on climate and energy for the European Union by the end of the year along with a mitigation plan, the national planning framework and so on.  My understanding of the comments they made before the committee is that they are looking at tax now as one of the next main policy instruments in how we reduce emissions.  Given some of the analysis he has done does Professor Morgenroth have any advice on the effects of the 98 or so possible fiscal instruments that might affect climate policy?  Are there any recommendations in terms of what the Government's approach should be?<\/p> <p>  In the past I have been in favour of the introduction of carbon taxes, among others.  Does Professor Morgenroth agree that to a certain extent the difficulty with using tax measures is that an over-reliance on them as a policy instrument brings the risk that by their nature they tend to bring marginal change?  They can act as a nudge in a certain direction when a lot of the decisions we will have to make in the climate change area relate to systemic change, for example, an end to the extraction of peat or the creation of a national land use plan, changes to CAP supports or changes to the transport budget.  They are all policy decisions that require a system change, as it were, rather than relying on marginal tax signals so that one gets a marginal change over time.  They will not deliver the sort of systemic change we need for the scale of emissions reductions that are required.  Does Professor Morgenroth have any thoughts on that last broad philosophical point on how we use tax measures for environmental gain?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#B00300","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525791600,"counter":162,"content":"<p>I will take them in turn.  On the first point, I think the issue the Deputy raises is very important.  My estimates are that in or around 10% of our tax revenue comes from transport, which is very significant.  When one compares that to other countries, by a margin, it is the highest that I have been able to calculate.  In the UK it is in or around 4% to 5%, so it is less than half.  In Germany and the Nordic countries about 2% of tax revenue comes from transport.  The international literature has looked a little bit at environmental tax reform where one essentially taxes pollution and subsidises anything that does something good to the environment.  The scale of the tax revenue is so significant that if people behave rationally and reduce the pollution they cause, which is dependent on that level of pollution, one automatically reduces one's tax revenue.<\/p><p>It is impossible to design a scheme where one keeps one's tax revenue as it is while simultaneously achieving the desired behavioural response.  While the tax measures are very effective, as shown by the fact that otherwise one would keep getting the same revenue, they will eventually cause other issues for revenue generation in the State.  One has to be very careful about how far to bring this and a plan is needed because if tax revenue from transport is entirely dependent on taxing the bad things that come with transport, such as pollution, when that goes the revenue goes too and it will need to be replaced.  That is a real challenge and it is more of a challenge in Ireland because the share here is so high.  Other countries have looked at it, though I am not aware of any analysis.  Given the scale of revenue from transport, however, simply using fiscal measures would have significant revenue implications.<\/p><p> The measure we picked in the report is quite nice and, at least in the short and medium run, it results in higher rather than lower revenue.  If all motorists choose to go for electric vehicles, however, we will get no money from excise rates on fuel.  Eventually, behavioural change will have an impact on revenue.  The evidence shows that fiscal instruments have a big effect and the growth of diesel has been a direct consequence of the changes introduced in 2008.  These changes reduced our CO2 emissions but they have left us with other issues.  Things such as PM and NOx emissions were not part of the considerations in 2008 and people were mainly talking about CO2 because that is what we wanted to address.  On their own, however, these measures are not enough and more needs to happen than just tax changes.<\/p><p> The ESRI has done some work on the potential market penetration of electric vehicles.  Clearly, the type of vehicle needs to broaden to have a wider appeal and if one drives long distances the current set of electric vehicles is probably not ideal because, without recharging stations, a driver might be too limited.  Similarly, an electric vehicle is not really suitable for towing big loads.  In certain segments of the market the industry has not provided suitable solutions to enable us to get the penetration we require.<\/p><p> In respect of our general over-reliance on tax, one should always think of having a mix of policy measures, with taxes playing a role within that.  I have written about spatial patterns of land use and if we allow the sprawl to continue that will have transport implications, as well as implications for the way we deliver public transport.  We need a wider set of measures to achieve our goals.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#B00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":164,"content":"<p>It is a fascinating debate.  Professor Morgenroth hints that he will return to the subject and that further analysis is needed so I look forward to hearing more.  I feel sorry for the diesel people.  The report points out that a measure was taken to address a matter in 2008 but, in the meantime, it caused something else, meaning we need to change it and introduce excise parity as between diesel and petrol.  What does Professor Morgenroth say to all the diesel car owners who made the switch, in good faith and for environmental reasons, but will now be penalised?  The professor said the measures had an impact on CO2 but the people who switched to diesel bought bigger cars with bigger engines, a development which was impacted by the treatment of motor tax.<\/p> <p>  The mayor of Paris is trying to ban cars and there are movements in this area.  I am alarmed that 10% of our tax revenue comes from transport.  I was not aware of that and I wonder how it compares internationally.  The professor also raised a concern for the future, which is that if there is a switch from conventional combustion engines to electric cars it will have an impact on excise.<\/p> <p>  Ireland is largely dependent on fossil fuels for its energy, even for electric cars, and the more electric cars we have the greater the reliance on fossil fuel.  Can Professor Morgenroth comment on that?  We were told the switch from leaded petrol to unleaded petrol, 30 years ago, would reduce emissions and that there would be other consequences.  If there was a dramatic shift in motor tax changes and people returned to petrol, what would the consequences be for CO2 emissions?  It seems people are drifting back to petrol at the moment and those who thought they were doing the right thing in 2008 now realise they are causing more pollution in the city.<\/p> <p>  The emissions scandal has never been addressed here.  Drivers made a switch in good faith and we do not even know if this led to a reduction in emissions.  We have not really reported on this in Ireland, and though I put down a couple of parliamentary questions about it I only got a curt response.  Does the ESRI have something on that?<\/p> <p>  The paper is very thought provoking and necessary as the first step of many.  I look forward to further outputs.  However, as demonstrated by the excise changes in 2008, consumers are quite prepared to make changes if they think there is an environmental good.  However, they have been codded by the industry in this regard.<\/p><p>Has Professor Morgenroth any comment to make on that?  To repeat my first question, what would he say to diesel drivers who made the switch in good faith in the belief they were doing something environmentally good?  They may have a 15 D, 16 D, 17 D or 18 D registration and he is now saying the ESRI will recommend increasing the excise rate on diesel as a budgetary measure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#C00200","speaker":"1311","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525791600,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for the compliment.  If it stimulated some thought, that was very much what we tried to do with the report.  The Deputy is quite right in saying that we focused on CO2 emissions.  The way the tax system was changed at the time - it was not only the excise duty as the Deputy rightly pointed out - generated reduced CO2 emissions but we did not think about the other emissions.  We know at this stage that the other emissions are pretty important.  It is probably a more important issue in some other jurisdictions where, for climatic reasons, the emissions of particulates cause a bigger problem.  It is typically windy here and we are lucky to get rid of the emissions but, nevertheless, the concentrations when one measures them, particularly at peak traffic times, are significant and they have negative health consequences.  We have this knowledge now and it would not be right to ignore that.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked what we would say to consumers who made a choice in good faith.  I have to admit I drive a diesel car.  If we consider it in terms of  CO2 emissions, for certain types of drivers it continues to be the exact right choice because there is nothing better for them on the market.  That was the point I made to Deputy Ryan, namely, that the industry also has to develop vehicles that suit all types of drivers in terms of journeys.  Many of the electric and hybrid vehicles tend to be more suited to urban traffic.  In Ireland we have much more cross-country traffic.  Those things also need to happen.<\/p> <p>  I appreciate that the average diesel vehicle owner would not be happy to be facing higher taxes.  There is no doubt about that.  The question is what the right thing to do is in terms of measures and how quickly we want to do something about it.  We took a very simple approach here.  We simply said let us do an assimilation of changing the excise rate all at once.  As a policymaker one might think a more gradual change might be more appropriate because there are other criteria one needs to be concerned about.  We simply looked at only the environmental issues.<\/p> <p>  The impact of changing not resulting in a reduction in CO2 emissions as one might expect is something that is called the rebound effect in economics.  We see that in many different areas.  If people insulate their homes, they end up turning up the heat a little bit.  They get some of the benefits through comfort in the end and they waste some of it.  We find the same thing happens in this case.  If one has a more efficient vehicle, one is more inclined to go a bit further, and that is what we have seen.  It is not surprising that this has happened.  It is a question of whether we will see a similar trend if we return to having more petrol-based vehicles.  To answer the Deputy's question, that would probably end up with us having higher CO2 emissions.  The idea would be to go from consumers moving from diesel to electric or hybrid vehicles and, it is hoped, not having higher CO2 emissions.  It is a question of exactly how one structures the tax system to enable the right change to be made rather than going in the wrong direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":167,"content":"<p>If half of the motoring population converted to a hybrid or electric car in the morning, I asked what impact of that would be in terms of CO2 emissions.

Getting to zero emissions is quite difficult.  If we could achieve that, it would be quite a feat for humanity.  Lower emissions is what we would get.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the issue of the emissions scandal.  There are a variety of issues around this.  It is not only that there was software used to hide the emissions that were coming out.  We know that in typical driving conditions the vehicles are not achieving anything close to the stated manufacturers' emissions.  We know from international evidence that the gap between the theoretical emissions that are produced in a laboratory and the emissions achieved with standard driving has been increasing.  It also varies systematically by manufacturer.  There is evidence to that effect.  The fact that gap has been increasing is quite important.  It is ultimately a matter for the EU which sets the standards, including the way those tests are generated.  That needs to be addressed at EU level so that we do not end up with theoretical laboratory condition emissions and fuel consumption values.  Many consumers tend to focus on the fuel consumption of the vehicle.  They buy the vehicle and end up finding that the fuel consumption is 20%, 30% or 40% higher in practice.  That is also not satisfactory from a consumer protection perspective.  That is something that the European Commission certainly needs to deal with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":169,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Morgenroth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#D00500","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":170,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Broughan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#D00600","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I welcome Professor Morgenroth.  This is a very interesting report.  I recall proposing last year that we should start the equalisation process which would have given an additional yield of approximately &euro;40 million.  Page 31 of the report sets out steps to equalisation.  The first step in 2018 would have yielded &euro;68 million and so on.  Does that take into account the fact that people will move from having a diesel vehicle or possibly returning to having a petrol vehicle because of the damage caused by diesel?  I do not accept the mantra we have had from 2008 that people were not aware of this.  I remember 25 years ago Volvo, in particular, drew attention to the PM10 emissions.  A former Green Party colleague was Minister for the environment during that period and we had a had a major campaign about getting more particulate matter, PM, stations around the city.  We only had three, one located in Stephen's Green and two others.  We were well aware of the damage diesel can do in terms of carcinogens and so on.  Nonetheless, the industry may have been facilitated from 2008 onwards.  Many people are caught now with having vehicles that may be worth much less as time goes on.<\/p> <p>  When the UK opted for equalisation, how did it deal with it both in terms of excise rates and the motoring public?  Should we take a step-by-step approach or go for a big bang approach?  What would make more sense?<\/p><p>In his research, has Professor Morgenroth evaluated the harm diesel may be doing in terms of carcinogens in the cost benefit analysis of the two fuels?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#D00700","speaker":"1361","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525791600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>The Deputy is right.  Particulate matter, PM, was known about.  That is for sure.  At the time the debate was very much about CO2.  That is the point I am making.  It is not that we did not know about it but it was not the No. 1 priority.  In some ways it was almost allowed to happen because we knew that diesel vehicles were and have always been \"dirtier\".  PM was known about decades ago.  We had some evidence of the carcinogenic effects.  We know a lot more now about how this happens exactly and we also know a lot more about the kinds of concentrations that one sees in heavily frequented routes.  There has been a lot of research done in Europe.<\/p> <p>  On health damage, in the study we did not do a full cost benefit analysis.  It would be a very interesting exercise because then we could use it to determine what the right level of excise might be.  It might be equalisation; it might be more or less.  This is the first step.  That is what the report was aimed at.  It was to raise awareness that fiscal measures can play a really important role and have played an important role in some areas.  There are areas where fiscal measures are in place where we have not considered the environmental impacts at all and really have not thought about it.  There are areas where we probably should where we know there might be an issue.  The issue of company car taxation is an example.  The UK made a change a number of years ago when it went from a similar system to our own, a mileage driven system, to one that was based on CO2, which has changed quite dramatically the composition of the company car stock.  Fortunately in Ireland, we do not know much about company cars at all.  One cannot find out the number, how far they travel or what engine size they have.  That means one cannot do any research.  It is something that ought to be addressed because there is scope to change the vehicle fleet much more quickly on the company car side than on the private car side.  The typical privately-owned vehicle tends to be kept for a much longer period than a company car.  When a company car is written off it tends to be passed on so there is a much quicker turnover.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>A feature we have become aware of with the onset of Brexit is that we have a massive number of used car imports from the UK.

It seems a better deal could be done in those circumstances by the people who are promoting this.  Does that have implications?  Are we unique in the transport-related tax we have?

That has a serious implication for the Exchequer as there is a reduction in income just at the time when there is an increase in expenditure.  It is quite a volatile tax as well, which is something that we have not really looked at.  I have done some research on related areas on other taxes but not on motoring taxes.  The issue of imports is interesting.   We may not see it but in Germany one cannot sell a second-hand diesel car.  The values have absolutely plummeted.  The reason is in Germany individual cities are contemplating bans.  The market is not sure what will happen so the risk-averse thing is to not buy a diesel car.  They are going in that direction.  They are now going towards petrol cars and will probably end up with higher CO2 emissions, which is not really what we want either.  In the meantime car dealerships are sitting on a very large stock of second-hand diesel vehicles that they cannot sell.  Given they are left-hand drive, they are less likely to come here.  If there was a similar situation in the UK for example, one could easily see them coming here if the market here was open for those vehicles.  It could backfire having this back door into the Irish market of second-hand vehicles.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#E00600","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>May I ask a follow-up question?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#E00700","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#E00800","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":180,"content":"<p>Did the impact in the States of the emission scandal cause a dramatic switch?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#E00900","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525791600,"counter":181,"content":"<p>In America?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#E01000","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":182,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#E01100","speaker":"1311"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525791600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>What we are finding currently - it is something one can read about - is Volkswagen has hired very large areas in Texas that are full of cars it either cannot sell or had to take back.

Fuel prices in the US are much lower than here and consequently there are much bigger engines.  There is more of a market for petrol vehicles anyway.  I do not think this will have helped diesel at all.  It has not had the same sort of effect in Ireland as it would have had in Germany, which is much closer.  It really is quite dramatic but that is because they are talking about banning cars.  If one is living in a city that is going to ban the car one owns, it is a real conundrum for people.

One of the most interesting things I took from his briefing and the questions he answered is that we are caught in a bind of our own making.  As Deputy Broughan and Deputy Lahart alluded to, as a State we have historically used motor taxation as an effective revenue driver by having it so high at 10% of revenue raised.  Our ability to influence environmental change through taxation is limited because if it is successful there is a major problem in that something we rely on as a revenue stream is compromised.<\/p><p>There seems to be a body of work.  If future Governments want to incentivise an environmental regime of change through taxation then we will have to come up with another way.  I am not saying that we give up taxing transport as a sector in terms of when people buy cars or whatever.  However, the traditional model of collecting duty on fuel, road taxes, etc., will have to be considered.<\/p><p> I wish to advise members that we will invite representatives of the road haulage industry and various other people to meetings.  I am struck by the fact that the Irish model means we will need diesel vehicles for a long time, and we will still require some diesel vehicles even with the 2030 situation.  Am I correct?  One reason is that the technology to produce a pure electric vehicle has not reached an advanced stage.  Hybrid technology is effective when one uses it in a city or urban environment at a low speed and drives in a city or urban area.  A hybrid car would use an entire tank of petrol if one drove from Dublin to Cork or a similar length of journey.  Therefore, hybrid vehicles do not provide a real environmental gain when driven outside of an urban area.  Am I correct?<\/p><p> I want Professor Morgenroth to clarify a contradiction for me.  We talk about how effective changes can be but we, as a country, have shifted to using diesel vehicles in the 2008 period more than any other European country.  Some countries now have their own issues with diesel.  Certainly, from my experience of countries ranging from Spain, Portugal and up to Germany, the number of vehicles that use diesel is less than Ireland.  Professor Morgenroth has said that the ability to have an effect through taxation is limited because of the high amount.  If so then why has the taxation measure been so effective in this country?  Can we learn from what we did in 2008 to re-engineer the system?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#E01300","speaker":"1310","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525791600,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I shall deal with the first and last questions together because they are related.

Some readjustments have been made to the tax rates since 2008.  Clearly, it is not easy to find the right spot where one can achieve revenue goals while simultaneously achieve environmental goals.  We probably went a little too far in incentivising CO2 emissions as it lost us some revenue and increased the diesel fleet.  We might always have a larger diesel fleet in Ireland because a diesel vehicle is more suited to travelling longer distances.  On average, our cars travel somewhat longer distances than other vehicles in other countries.  Diesel is worthwhile because the purchase price is typically a little bit higher than an equivalent petrol vehicle.  A diesel vehicle is only worthwhile once one travels a certain mileage and with higher miles one will always have a little more diesel.  In addition, the tax change makes diesel vehicles more favourable.  Therefore, one ends up with a larger diesel stock than one would have otherwise.  I believe I have answered the first and third questions.<\/p> <p>  The Chairman asked if we will always need diesel.  We still lack vehicles that suit every driver and every type of journey.  Hybrid vehicles have been mentioned.  Practical tests are more important than laboratory-based tests.  In practical driving tests one does not tend to get much more than 40 km on a purely electronic charge in hybrid vehicles.  That distance is adequate in an urban setting but not if one wants to travel from Dublin to Cork where one must switch the petrol engine on and, therefore, at that point one has a less efficient engine, from a CO2, than a diesel vehicle.  We will probably end up with diesel being a more significant aspect of our vehicle stock than other countries where the average mileage is lower and hybrid vehicles are more likely to meet the demand of a larger section of the population.  It will be a little bit different for Ireland and, again, land use patterns, etc. drive demand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#F00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Edgar Morgenroth"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":189,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Morgenroth and call Deputy Lahart.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CBO2018050800002#F00500","speaker":"1310"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":190,"content":"<p>Traffic bans and diesel car bans have been mentioned but they are not going to happen for the foreseeable future.

Remarkably, in many cities, even in Germany, diesel has increasingly been used as a fuel for many years even though suitable technologies were available.  Let us take electricity, as an example.  I grew up in a city that had electric buses.  The buses were powered using overhead lines and no tracks thus making them cheaper than a tram system.  Such buses existed back in the 1960s and maybe before then.  Many larger cities in Germany have a good public transport system that includes trams, which are powered by electricity.  They have also invested in electric buses and compressed natural gas.  The latter is being trialled in this country at present.  There are cities in Germany where vehicles, particularly municipal vehicles such a buses, are run on gas.<\/p> <p>   I wish to note an interesting development.  The German post office could not find a suitable vehicle so it ended up buying a company and now manufactures electric vans really cheaply.  A professor who worked in the University in Aachen developed a cheap electric van.  He wanted one of the big manufacturers to produce electric vans but he got no offers.  The German post office wanted such a vehicle and as it could not buy one it ended up buying the professor's company.  Now the German post office manufactures and sells electric vehicles.  It is a rather strange story but it shows that the market does not always supply what is needed to make a change.

The purpose of the group is to monitor the ongoing cost of residential waste collection to homeowners across Ireland as the flat-rate structure is being phased out in line with Government waste policy to incentivise the prevention and segregation of household waste.  The most recent report was in April 2018 in respect of data gathered in March.  The reports monitor 26 service providers, which is made up of 19 individual companies with several of those being monitored in more than one area.  Those companies made 39 different service offerings available in March 2018, down from 41 in February and from 45 in the first report of the price monitoring group in December.<\/p> <p>  There are nine types of price models on the market.  Examples of price models include: service charge plus per kilogram weight charge; E-tag; service charge plus charge per lift per bin plus per kilogram excess charge; and flat rate.<\/p> <p>  With regard to green bin charges, it is widely acknowledged that the decision by China to restrict its intake of recycled waste has resulted in the cost of recycling increasing worldwide as more companies on an international scale jostle for access to a reduced number of outlets.  Some providers have already informed their customers they will be either increasing or introducing charges for recyclate from April.  This is not a new concept.  Since we began gathering data, various service offerings contained visible fees for recyclate, as can be seen in the data analysis published by the price monitoring group.<\/p> <p>  With regard to consistent disclosure of prices, an issue of concern to the price monitoring group has been the ongoing difficulty obtaining clear price information over the phone with prices having to be confirmed online in a number of instances.  I am aware this information is not always available online and that not everyone has Internet access.  In our last market comment the group called on waste management companies to provide better training for staff answering calls to ensure pricing data is clear, complete and consistent and provided quickly and efficiently.  <\/p> <p>  The group has considered seven months of data to date.  While fluctuations in prices and service offerings have been observed, the overall trend is relative price stability.  The most popular service offering now is the service charge including weight allowance plus per kilogram charge for excess above allowance.  The availability of this price model has increased from seven offerings in the first round of data collection to 16 offerings in the most recent round of data collection, down slightly from a peak of 18 in series six, which is the previous month.<\/p> <p>  The group comprises: representatives from the waste policy and resource efficiency division of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; an economist from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment; a statistician from the Central Statistics Office; Shelfwatch, an independent price monitoring group; and me.

Customers are asked to go online and if one does not have Internet access or is older and not comfortable using the Internet, serious issues arise as a result of that.  Why is it not mandatory for waste collection companies to have transparent pricing models?  Does Mr. Conway feel the Department has adequate powers to ensure the customer is getting value for money and can see the price difference?  <\/p> <p>  I will bring in a number of my colleagues so the witnesses might take note of the questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018050800002#B00500","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":203,"content":"<p>I welcome the opportunity to speak to Mr. Conway and Mr. O'Donoghue about the price monitoring group.  We have been waiting for nearly a year to look at what is happening in the waste collection market.  I have read the report in detail and it is clear there is very little transparency in household waste collection and there is almost no regulation of it.  It looks to me like a bit of a free-for-all.  I note there were 41 different offerings which is now down to 39.  That is hugely complex.  If one compares it to the gas and electricity market, one looks at one's bill and can see the exact breakdown of how it is made up, what components are in it and how it is calculated.  Why is that not being considered?<\/p> <p>  The other question I had is about the model.  The model we are using is very complex.  If one looks at the issues raised about the reduction of 41 offers to 39, with nine different models, it shows how difficult it is.  This side-by-side competition is unique in Europe.  In the housing estate I live on in Portlaoise, there are three refuse collection companies that come into the small part of the estate where I live and that does not make sense.  It is not regulated to any great extent and there is a history of skews in the market and various different things happening.<\/p> <p>  It is not just about the competition; it is about the way it is structured.  Has the group looked at side-by-side competition, where a local authority, for example, Dublin City Council, Galway County Council or Laois County Council, would offer a three-year franchise to companies and that companies would bid for it and the council would get the best deal.  There is a very clear similarity in how the companies are operating in terms of the pricing structure.  There is very little difference.  They all tend to move at the same time.  It appears there is a carve-up of areas in some cases.  In some estates there are three, four or five companies operating.  In larger areas, it appears there has been a carve-up.  There may not have been.  A way of getting a better outcome for the householder might be through a franchise.<\/p> <p>  My first question was on transparency and my second one was on the model we use.  My third question is on the bin collection.  I have raised it with the Minister.  The brown composting bin is not available to all customers.  Some of the collectors are not providing it.  I do not know how much of an examination has been done of that.  The purpose of the price monitoring group was not strictly to look at this issue but the Department needs to take it on board.  Collection companies are being licensed through the lead authority, which is Offaly County Council.  It is the lead authority in issuing licences for refuse collection.  It needs to be looked at.  If a refuse collection company is getting a licence, it should provide a compost bin, which in most counties is brown.  It is brown where I live.  It is not available in some places.  Parts of the town of Portlaoise do not have brown bins at the moment.  Has the group looked at that?  <\/p> <p>  Is there resale of waste?  For collectors in the North at one stage there was a resale value on it.  Local authorities were getting back some funding from it.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018050800002#B00600","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":204,"content":"<p>I have a number of questions for Mr. Conway and Mr. O'Donoghue.  I thank them both for attending.<\/p><p>I note in the opening statement the Department mentioned the change in China's policy in terms of not accepting recycling to the same extent it had previously, and the knock-on effect to costs for consumers and for the waste sector.  On a related note, since that development I understand there have been changes to what materials are allowed in what bin and there has been some confusion about that among the public.  Perhaps that is outside of the officials' scope.  If it is in their scope, to what extent has there been consumer education providing clarity?  Have the operators exploited that in any sense?  There was fear at the outset that consumers may be fined, etc., for putting the wrong item in the wrong bin in good faith.  Has there been any evidence of that?  Is the Department proactive in this regard?  Is part of its role to monitor that and help educate the consumer?<\/p><p> Looking in general at the statement and supplementary documentation, it reminds me of the health insurance sector.  That might appear an odd comparison.  I am not suggesting that waste is on the same level on one's health but the health insurance sector has a proliferation of products from multiple providers and the HIA has a role in drawing up a matrix to inform and educate the public as to how it can navigate the offerings.  Naturally, it was found that it was difficult for the providers to be objective about their own product offerings and the HIA took on the role of intermediary in advising on that.  I would say it is a more complex market, although looking at the appendices it is fairly complex here as well.<\/p><p> I commend the officials on drawing up the documentation.  Is the appendix publicly available?  Is there an awareness of that?  If I was changing my bin service in the morning, would I be able to go online to a particular portal to look at the different options out there along the lines of the detail provided to the committee today?  If that was an option, it would be useful.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018050800002#B00700","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":206,"content":"<p>I thank the officials for taking note of the questions.

Has the Department any figures on its price implications for the recycling market?  Indeed, I understand that in the paper market there is for whatever reason almost no price for paper recycling so that it is a cost rather than a revenue stream for any company.

For example, the remit of the group is to monitor the market.  Twelve months ago, nobody understood what prices were being charged.  In the interim, it was to establish whether or not companies all had flat-rate charges, for example.  What we found out in the interim is that there is a range of different pricing models.  This is to inform Government.  Government, at the end of the day, is getting the information.  We also make it available to consumers, which we will come on to in a minute.  That also came up in one of the questions.<\/p> <p>  Our remit is to ensure that we are publishing the information.  That information can be used.  Whether or not it is, is a policy decision down the line.  We do not have any policy powers.  We do not have enforcement powers, for example, but we are informing the Department and the Government of the prices out there and whether or not those prices have shifted over the past six months.<\/p> <p>  There are a couple of bits of analysis we have looked at.  One piece which I have looked at over the past couple of days is about price.  For example, on a month-by-month basis, we are not finding that prices have gone up.  Equally, over the four months, we also have not found that prices have shifted.  That is a piece of work we are doing on an ongoing basis.<\/p> <p>  We have two meetings and two more reports to issue.  Those reports will come out, one next week and one the following month.  That will be the end of the group to inform whether or not prices have changed.<\/p> <p>  The central issue was whether or not there was gouging in the market.  We are not finding any evidence of that right now.  We are finding that prices have remained quite stable.  In fact, what we have found is that even where there were green bin charges in place last December, those prices have not shifted.  I expect we will begin seeing new prices coming in because some companies have announced that they would be introducing those fees from April and May onwards.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018050800002#C00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Conway"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":212,"content":"<p>There were a variety of questions and I will do my best to cover off all of them.  If there are any I miss at the end, I would be happy to take them again.  I can only apologise if I miss them as we are going through.<\/p> <p>  The model is complex.  Deputy Stanley raised that and that is true.  The role of the price monitoring group is to try to explain that to consumers.  The market here was always complex but it was not widely understood.  The price monitoring group has played a good role in trying to educate consumers.  That is why the reports of the group are published online as well.  That is why the Department's website has them - to try to let consumers see what is happening within the market.<\/p> <p>  The group is due to finish in June of this year.  It is a matter for the Minister to determine whether that should be extended.  In a situation where the idea of phasing out flat fees will run until October, there is probably merit in the price monitoring group continuing its work so that it would do a sweep in November, pick up the last of the charging structures from October and report in December, but that is a call for the Minister.  I would be more than happy to take back the views of the committee to the Minister, if it felt that was of value.<\/p> <p>  Competition for the market certainly has been looked at previously.  On the decision last year to set up the price monitoring group and to ask the CCPC to do a review of the waste market, the idea is that both of those would feed into any future decisions in relation to the market.  The CCPC report is due mid-year.  They are talking about that being done in July.  At that point, we will have the report from the CCPC and a year's worth of reports from the price monitoring group, and it is then that future decisions on the market will be taken.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Stanley quite rightly stated that the brown bin is not available to all customers.  The current regulation stipulates that it is for agglomerations of greater than 500 and the waste operators have to roll it out to anything greater than that.  The Department would like to see that being reduced over time.  Even the compost sector itself has concerns about a universal roll-out because one-off housing or difficult areas to reach within the country will push up the cost of the brown bin which is not what we are trying to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018050800002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>There is a housing estate in Portlaoise which does not have it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018050800002#C00900","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":214,"content":"<p>If that housing is within an agglomeration of 500, then that is a matter that could be taken up.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018050800002#C01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>There is a population of 23,000, according to the most recent census.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018050800002#C01100","speaker":"1232"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":216,"content":"<p>I would have no problem in taking that up then.  Certainly, that is an enforcement issue that we can take up.<br\/><br\/>The rule, through the national waste collection permit office, that the Deputy referenced in terms of permit conditions, is that the operator must roll it out to an agglomeration greater than 500.  If the agglomeration is of that size and the brown bin is not rolled out, that is something we can certainly take up.<br\/><br\/>As for whether waste has a resale value, most of it at this point is negative.  It costs to move it.  In November last, the Minister announced the national recycling list.  It is the same materials go into the so-called &quot;green&quot; recycling bin no matter where one lives in the country.  That has had an effect in that we were always hearing concerns from those managing a parent's bin or whatever where one operator would allow different materials into the bin than another.  To simplify the entire process, it is now a national recycling list.  <i>Recyclinglistireland.ie<\/i>has the list.  It is the same materials that go into the bin right throughout the country.  Some of those are higher value materials, such as bottles and aluminium cans, that may still have an outlet but much of the material that the Chinese market is closed to has a zero or negative value at this point and it is costing operators to move that material on.<\/p><p> I have covered the issue of consumer confusion.  We also have a recycling ambassadors programme as part of the education and awareness.  We have 650 of those taking place throughout the country.  We hope to do an outreach to 15,000 people.  That programme is starting to pay dividends in terms of people's understanding of what goes into what bin.  On the fines issue, it is very minor at present in terms of the companies that have tried to do this.  They are looking at installing cameras on the back of the lifts so that as the bin is tipped one can see which household is doing it.  However, it is an education issue to try to make people aware that contaminating material in the green bin means the entire load is useless.  We must get away from the position where there is still 36% contamination in parts of the country.  That cannot continue.  The markets are very tight for moving these materials on and anything we can do to help consumers increase their awareness of that is where our focus will be.<\/p><p> Frank Conway will comment on the appendices.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018050800002#C01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Donoghue","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":218,"content":"<p>All the information we have put out to date is publicly available.  We do it in a couple of ways.  We put the information out through the media, for example, to make people aware that they can access the information.  We issue a comment on the report itself and we keep it as simplified as possible.  We identify where prices have gone up.  In odd cases prices may have gone down but more often than not we are seeing shifts upwards in pricing.  The second way is that we provide all of the data.  I can go through it line by line.  When we started this reporting process we wanted to ensure that consumers could access the information, compare it and make a decision on it.  The question always is about the homeowner who might be looking at pricing down in Kerry, for example, to refer to the HIA website example.  The provider might not be available in that market but the homeowner can see what is being charged down there.  Broadly, what we are seeking to do is to make the Government and key decision makers aware that we are looking at the pricing to ensure gouging is not taking place and to ensure that the consumer can access information both from a data perspective and from a comment perspective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018050800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Frank Conway"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525788000,"counter":219,"content":"<p>I will respond to the last few questions relating to the market, incineration, landfill and recycling.  The price monitoring group does not look at those prices.  It is looking at the prices waste operators are charging consumers rather than the back end.  Regarding the implications of the Chinese decision, the waste market in Ireland has transitioned a great deal over the last while.  We were putting 92% of our municipal solid waste in landfill in 1995.  That was down to 42% in 2012 and to 21% in 2014.  We are going in the right direction and moving away from landfill.  The number of landfill sites has reduced from 125 at one point to five commercially accepting waste last year.<\/p> <p>  The education piece about what goes into what bin is critical in respect of educating the consumer about what happens.  It is also important to realise that some of the messaging is a little confused.  People were talking for a while about a free green bin, but it was never free.  The packaging waste collected by waste operators gets a subvention from Repak.  Every tonne of household waste packaging collected yields &euro;65 to the waste collector from Repak.  It was always the case that it cost.  That is how the green bin was dealt with previously.  However, when the material now has a zero or negative value and it is costing operators to move it, something else has to change in that regard.  That is important information to try to convey to the general public, to make people aware that it costs to collect and move this material.  Somewhere along the way we have to ensure that the materials being collected in that area are as clean and uncontaminated as possible.  That will only help the operators as they are trying to move the material on to the next phase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22018050800002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin O'Donoghue"},{"type":"speech","time":1525788000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I have a query about the bill being detailed for the householder to some extent, presumably in terms of the volume.  Can there be a detailed breakdown to let citizens and householders - I cannot use the word \"consumer\" - see exactly what their dry recyclables, the composting part and the non-recyclables are costing?  It would be a good thing in terms of incentivising people to try to move them along.  It would be a basic breakdown, similar to the electricity bill which gives information on fixed charges.  It would be useful if people could get that.  I accept what Mr. Conway said about putting the information on websites but there is a huge amount of information there.  There are still 39 different offers.<\/p> <p>  My other question relates to the franchise, which was mentioned briefly.  Is the pricing group looking at the franchise model?  For example, a local authority, such as Galway City Council or Laois County Council, would go with the franchise model on a two or three-year basis so it could get the best value for householders in its district.  It would remove that side-by-side competition and stop three and four lorries racing into some estates.  More importantly, it could provide greater price stability.  The picture that emerges is very complex, and I am sure the witnesses got a better look at it when doing the report.  It is a complex issue on which to produce a report.  It was not an easy job.  It is a complex, almost chaotic, situation.  There are hundreds of moving parts in it.  The removal of waste from households is more complicated than it was previously.  At one time it all went into the back of one lorry and was brought out to a landfill.  It now goes to different places.<\/p> <p>  I believe the franchise model would simplify it and make everything clearer.  Most of the rest of Europe, including the North, uses the franchise model.

The Government has committed that it will look at it again once both of the reports are available on the future of the waste collection market here.

I am joined by my colleague, Jenny Foley, solicitor and clinical claims manager, and we will be happy to answers members' questions shortly.<\/p> <p>  It is important that I set out the details of the agency's role in the Vicky Phelan case.  This is clearly a tragic case that has had dreadful consequences for Ms Phelan and her family.  I assure the committee that at every stage of our involvement in this case, we have been acutely aware of the consequences, trauma and pain Ms Phelan and her family have suffered and continue to suffer.  In carrying out our statutory role in managing this case, we have been mindful of the need to ensure that, wherever possible, nothing that we did would add to the suffering of Ms Phelan and her family.<\/p> <p>  In managing personal injury litigation taken by persons against the State, we never forget that our work frequently involves the management of difficult, complex and traumatic cases taken by persons who have suffered injury, sometimes of a catastrophic nature.  We have a duty, when managing personal injury claims, to manage any individual claim in a humane, ethical, professional and sensitive manner.<\/p> <p>  Our role in Ms Phelan's case arose because one of the parties she took a case against was the Health Service Executive, HSE, which is one of our clients.  The HSE was not the only party.  Ms Phelan's case was also against the United States laboratory that had carried out her smear test.  It was called Clinical Pathology Laboratories.  In every case with multiple parties, each party conducts its own defence independently of the other parties.  We managed the case on behalf of the HSE but the US laboratory had separate legal representation and a separate legal strategy.<\/p> <p>  The primary legal issue in this case centred on the alleged misreading of Ms Phelan's original smear test.  The US laboratory accepted that legal liability for that issue rested with it alone and that the HSE was not legally responsible for the misreading.  As part of the US laboratory's defence of this issue, its lawyers sought a confidentiality clause that would have restricted Ms Phelan from disclosing details of the settlement or the case.  The State Claims Agency opposed the use of a confidentiality clause in Ms Phelan's case and no such request was made by our agency.  The request by the US laboratory was not supported by the agency.  Our view is that the US laboratory's insistence on a confidentiality clause was a significant factor in the failure to resolve the claim through mediation.  Mediation is our preferred route for resolving cases of this nature as it would have eliminated the need for court hearings or a contested court action.  A settlement, consequent upon mediation, would have made it unnecessary for Ms Phelan to go to court, personally give evidence and experience all the stress and anxiety that a court hearing entails.<\/p> <p>  A total of 98% of all cases managed by our agency are resolved without the need for a contested court hearing.  It was not possible to resolve this case through mediation, but that was for reasons outside our control, and I have referred to those reasons.<\/p> <p>  I would like to make a number of points about the way we manage cases.  I am conscious that the committee asked us here today specifically to discuss this issue.  In Ms Phelan's case, it has not been reported by the media generally that the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Cross, praised the manner in which the case was managed by the State Claims Agency and the other parties.  While some cases can take up to between two to three years to be concluded, Ms Phelan's case was settled within ten weeks of the summons being lodged.  The judge said the case was handled in an efficient and humane manner, with all sides pulling out the stops to get the matter ready for hearing quickly.<\/p> <p>  We have heard commentary from some observers in recent days suggesting that the State was in some way trying to place obstacles in the way of settling this case.  The judge's comments, being those of an independent party, demonstrate that the opposite was the case.<\/p> <p>  I will now update the committee on the current number of cases we are managing which are similar to Ms Phelan's case.  In addition to Ms Phelan's now concluded case, we are managing nine other similar cases, and we are aware of one additional case where a formal claim has not yet been made.  We have received an indemnity from the independent laboratories in three of the nine cases to date and we have sought indemnities in all others.  We will manage all of these cases in the same way we managed Ms Phelan's case, namely, carrying out our statutory role by placing a high priority on treating the people who have made the claims, and their families, with the dignity and compassion they deserve.<\/p><p>We have no intention of mounting a full defence in any case of this nature where responsibility is substantially or completely that of the State.  In any such case, we will pursue other options, including mediation or settlement.<\/p><p> We have a statutory duty to act in the best interests of the taxpayer.  We also have a duty, however, towards injured persons who have suffered a medical negligence related injury, including following a misdiagnosis, and who take legal actions against the State or State bodies.  We never lose sight of the fact that in many cases the injured parties, together with the families, have suffered significant trauma and pain.  Recognising this, the agency aims always to act fairly, ethically and with compassion in its dealings with these people and their families as well as in the management of all cases which fall within our remit.<\/p><p> In cases of medical negligence, our policy is to admit liability as soon as the expert medical evidence becomes available to indicate there has been a breach of duty.  The agency takes every step it can to ensure that litigation is handled sensitively to ensure no additional distress is caused to the person who has made the claim or to his or her family.  The agency is required, however, to operate in accordance with its statutory mandate to investigate claims thoroughly and to manage litigation in a professional manner.  I am not suggesting to the committee that it is an easy task to get this balance right when carrying out our statutory role, knowing the often devastating personal consequences for persons who have suffered injury, nor would I suggest that we always get this balance right to the satisfaction of all the parties in the case.  However, we make every effort to do so.  I hope the facts, such as those put on the court record by Mr. Justice Kevin Cross in Ms Phelan's case and by the same judge in two other cases last week bear this out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018050800002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":240,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Breen and Ms Foley to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Vicky Phelan is a neighbour of mine.

When it became known that there was an incorrect reading of a smear test in 2014 and which was not given to Ms Phelan until 2017, three years later, surely at best it was gross incompetence.  Mr. Breen is speaking about the whole issue of intent.  Surely, as the officer charged with legally advising the HSE, Mr. Breen should have said on the issue of non-disclosure - that is the key issue here - a wrong was done.  At that stage Mr. Breen should have been advising the State to accept liability.  Furthermore, he should have ensured the State Claims Agency and the laboratory in America, CPL, Clinical Pathology Laboratories Inc., accepted liability, offered a settlement to the Vicky Phelan and not have dragged her through court for four days.  Instead, she was dragged through the court and had to put her condition in the public domain.  It was offensive to the public and grossly unfair to Vicky Phelan and her family.  As the chief legal officer advising the State, Mr. Breen should have said on non-disclosure that we accepted legal liability.  It should not have happened.  Instead, it resulted in Vicky Phelan being told at the end of 2017 of the difficulty she has with her health.  This would not have arisen if she had been told of the incorrect smear in 2014.<\/p> <p>  When I read this opening statement, the State Claims Agency still does not appear to be admitting that the issue of non-disclosure was culpability on the part of the HSE.

We are aware that if some of the women who are now unfortunately deceased had been aware in 2014 that there was a misdiagnosis and had been informed at the time that they had options for treatment, then the outcomes could have been different.  They could have taken part in clinical experiments and so on.  Does Mr. Breen not think that has value in itself?

That is the point.  All due attention is given after the summons is served but prior to that, for example in asking for information from the HSE, not all the files are provided.  In fact, I heard a solicitor say on the radio the other day that it is only when a legal firm representing the client goes to the HSE that the full disclosure will be made.  I find that quite shocking, and it annoys me that it would be the case.  In other cases the HSE was asked for the reports and files and it was provided with pages missing and then when it came to the stage leading to the court case the missing pages miraculously appeared on the files of the other side.  The impression I get from talking to a number of people who have been through the system with the SCA is that they find it frustrating and hugely costly.<\/p> <p>  One individual told me he had to put up &euro;100,000 to be able to take part in the game, and to fight for his case, and that it dragged on for years.  The messages that are going out from here are mixed.  Mr. Breen said the agency shows compassion and humanity, yet people on the other side tell us that the State Claims Agency appoints solicitors to represent it and that they find it difficult to deal with the State Claims Agency and those who take cases find it hugely difficult and the process takes years.  In fact, one individual told me that he felt that there was no honesty in the system, that people do not meet face to face and that there is a wall of silence within the HSE, in particular, in relation to these matters.<\/p> <p>  I am just pointing this out because some of the commentary would lead one to believe that everything is hunky dory but it is far from it.  My first question is what Mr. Breen has to say in response to that.  My second question is what he says to the HSE, that has failed to report this and whose own system has failed to flag this.  Will he stand with those affected who will be going through the courts with the American company?  It would seem to me that the original contract was flawed; that it was the case that the Department put it in place to wash its hands of it so that it would not affect it.  I believe the HSE and the State Claims Agency have a role to play.  What assistance will they give to people affected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018050800002#L02900","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525782600,"counter":592,"content":"<p>In response to what you said, Chairman, about people finding us difficult, the fact of the matter is that tort law, which is the law that applies to personal injury, is just that - it is adversarial.  That is why, over the years, we have done different things to try to make that better.  One of the things that we did on our own initiative entirely was to bring forward the periodic payment orders, PPO, that we are making for catastrophically injured victims.  We are allowing them to be paid for a period of time so that there will be absolute certainty and that families to not have to worry about money running out.  That was one of the things we did.<\/p> <p>  I personally sat on the medical negligence working group in 2010.  We advocated PPO legislation.  We advocated the pre-action protocol.  If we had the pre-action protocol tomorrow my colleague, Ms Foley, and I believe it would transform the behaviour and the way we handle these cases.<\/p><p>It has been in the UK for a very long time and it stops the adversarial element.  People do not have to issue proceedings.  They simply issue a letter of claim and we would issue a letter in response to that.  The idea is that we narrow down the issues to those that are really between the two parties and then mediate them.  I have advocated for this position for a very long time and despite the fact that the Legal Services Regulation Act has brought that into play, subject to the making of the regulations, we do not have that even now.  It would be of considerable assistance to us if we had that tomorrow.<\/p><p> To come back to the HSE, medical records and the supply of same, when a patient looks for records from a hospital obviously we are not involved.  Therefore, the experience of the patient in that context is one that is beyond the State Claims Agency.  Clearly, if we were asked to furnish a copy of medical records to a plaintiff we would make sure that we are furnishing all of the relevant records.  Plaintiffs' solicitors will say that we are difficult to deal with and I understand that.  They will say that we delay but the one thing that they will not say is that very often, when we try to settle cases at pre-defence stage or prior to a trial, the sums of money they are looking for in settlement of their clients' claims are so overstated that we have no choice in many instances but to go to the steps of the court and sometimes, to trial.  I am reminded of one example where we were asked in a catastrophic injury case to pay &euro;26 million in damages and we ended up paying &euro;13 million after three days of trial.  Clearly we could not pay out &euro;26 million and the plaintiff's solicitor in the circumstances understood that &euro;13 million was the value of the case ultimately.  That is what we face.  It is not that we want to be in court with medical negligence victims.  In fact, as I said previously, if we had the pre-action protocol in place, much of what the Chairman has described in terms of frustrations would be relieved.

I suspect that within the original contract that was signed by the CervicalCheck and the HSE with the American laboratory, they subcontracted the legal responsibility for the smear as well.  We now know that the ten cases involved American laboratories.  We now have a situation where the women are effectively being told that they are dealing with faceless American laboratories whose employers are the HSE, not the individual women.  Based on what has now happened and the fact that there are ten cases, does Mr. Breen believe that settlements will be made out of court?  Alternatively, does he believe that they will drag these women into court, or drag their families, three of the women having lost their lives?<\/p> <p>  The witness mentioned non-disclosure. On reflection, does Mr Breen believe that he is taking a purely legal reading of it rather than looking at it on a moral level?  Take the instance of a case of someone like Vicky Phelan.  If Vicky Phelan had known in 2014, she may have gone on the drug she is on now.  We have to go back to the source.

What it boils down to is the role that the HSE can play in suing the laboratory and not putting the women through all of the court cases that will emerge out of this.  It is to examine the documentation, the agreements between the HSE and the laboratories, the State Claims Agency's role in all of this, and to try to find a way of protecting the women and getting their rights at the same time rather than have them go to court.  I know this may not be Mr. Breen's area, but it is a point that was made, and I think it is worth considering.  Every effort must now be made by the State to work with the women and ensure that they get what they are entitled to, and not to have protracted court cases with this American company making life difficult and adding further cost in human terms to the individuals and the families concerned.

Insurance Ireland has followed the work of the committee over the past six months.  It has noted the detailed submissions made by other witnesses before the committee, particularly relating to the cost of insurance.  The defining issue in general insurance, including liability insurance, is the cost of insurance claims.  Insurance Ireland has been active on the issue of claims volatility in personal injuries since September 2015, when we published a policy reform document, Driving Change, the benefits of which would apply to motor and liability insurance.<\/p> <p>  The need for reform is clearly established by the trends in the market.  According to the 2016 annual report of the Courts Service, the average Circuit Court award increased by 48% between 2013 and 2016, from &euro;11,941 to &euro;17,722.  The report of the working group on the cost of insurance, which was published in January 2017, makes it clear that there was an increase in the number of new personal injury cases issued in the courts, including employer, motor, public liability and medical negligence cases, between 2010 and 2015.  According to a document published by the National Competitiveness Council, Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2017, legal service prices were 10.4% higher in the third quarter of 2016 than they had been in the comparable quarter in 2013.  It is clear from the annual reports of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, that the average employers liability award made by the board increased by 30% - from &euro;27,102 to &euro;35,159 - between 2011 and 2016 and the average employers liability claim dealt with by the board increased by 35% - from &euro;3,866 to &euro;5,241 - in the same period.  According to the same annual reports, the average PIAB personal liability award increased by 17% - from &euro;22,686 to &euro;26,562 - between 2011 and 2016 and the average personal liability claim dealt with by PIAB increased by 23% in the same period.  The figures are set out in the documentation I have provided to the committee.  On 20 April last, PIAB published figures which show that the number of personal injury claims submitted to it last year represented a decrease of 942 on the previous year.  The figure in question decreased from 34,056 to 33,114.  There was a reduction in the number of motor claims and public liability claims, but the number of employers liability claims increased.<\/p> <p>  The Government's working group on the cost of insurance has acknowledged that \"there is a significant issue in relation to the cost of personal injury awards in Ireland for some commonly occurring personal injuries, particularly those of a less severe nature\".  I would like to mention as evidence of this that a minor ankle injury can lead to an award of up to &euro;54,000 in Ireland, which contrasts with a figure of &euro;12,554 in the UK.  This situation is made all the more dramatic when the legislative reforms that have been proposed in the UK are factored in.  Insurance Ireland has provided data on our claims costs on five occasions over the last two years.  We are working in co-operation with the Personal Injuries Commission to facilitate the international benchmarking of our awards data.  We have made a number of submissions to the Central Bank and the Department of Finance on how information flow to policy holders can be improved.  We have also provided for a methodology to allow returning emigrants to benefit from their foreign driving experiences.<\/p> <p>  Our well-established commitment to reform is apparent from our actions to date.  Insurance Ireland recognises and empathises with the concerns of business owners.  We are determined to bring sorely needed reform to Irish claims costs.  We believe there is a significant opportunity to bring about structural reform in 2018.  All stakeholders should redouble their efforts to ensure this occurs.  What needs to happen?  We are pleased that the Personal Injuries Commission will publish a report that internationally benchmarks Irish personal injury awards against other jurisdictions.  When this has been completed, the Government needs to provide a timetable to address the rise in the cost of claims.  The PIAB legislation needs to be passed into law.  Four years have passed since the consultation process on this legislation commenced.  The design of the book of quantum needs to be addressed.  More effective deterrents need to be put in place to combat fraud.  If these steps are taken as a matter of urgency, the accelerating cost of claims will be addressed in an effective manner and the insurance costs which are having an impact on businesses and motorists will be managed as a consequence.  I thank the committee.  We look forward to discussing these issues in more detail with members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#D00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":775,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Thompson.

This important topic goes to the core of the socioeconomic well-being of our country.  It is the key to competitiveness, sustainable jobs and sustainable housing.  We hear a lot about costs in Ireland.  Several years ago, Eddie Hobbs presented a television programme called &quot;Rip Off Republic&quot;.  In 2005, Phil Hogan made an impassioned speech to the D&aacute;il on competition law reform.  He said his motion on the issue was inspired by &quot;the complete refusal of the Government to deal with rip-off Ireland, its complete inability to tackle the vested interests [and] its complete antipathy to consumers and small businesses as a result of the flourishing anti-competitive practices it is happy to ignore&quot;.  It is now 2018 and we are still talking about high costs, but we are not doing anything.<br\/><br\/>I have noted the contributions of the many other groups that have contributed to this discussion.  I will take a more generic approach to the cost of doing business in Ireland.  I will consider the issue from a macroeconomic point of view because I believe there are significant misconceptions about price and costs.  Price, in itself, does not determine profit.  Instead, profit is determined by price minus costs.  Importantly, price determines competitiveness and we are not good at competitiveness in Ireland.  As a country, we owe a lot to Whitaker and Lemass for setting the foundation for our incredibly successful foreign direct investment programme.  Perhaps we have overcooked it.  When Deputy Enda Kenny became Taoiseach in 2011, we wrote to him to argue:<\/p><blockquote>Our high cost base is the reason why our corporate tax rate is so crucial to economic recovery.  We should not have put ourselves in this position .... we in Ireland must act swiftly to radically reduce our cost base.<\/blockquote> <p>These words have turned out to be prophetic.  In the past seven years, our foreign direct investment policy has come under heavy and sustained attack.  The US and the UK have committed to very significant cuts to corporate tax rates.  The EU is moving towards a federal tax regime.  The OECD is working to create a fairer corporate tax environment by aligning profits with economic activity.  The European Commission's decision in the Apple tax case has put a spotlight and even more pressure on Ireland's corporate tax model.<br\/><br\/>We can no longer rely on our decades-old foreign direct investment policy as a panacea for providing mass employment.  We will have to place a greater focus on our indigenous economy, which has often been neglected even though it has massive potential.  For example, there is potential for exponential growth in added value in the agriculture and aquamarine sectors.  A whole new industry can be created by effectively processing the fifth quarter from the beef, pig and sheep sectors.  The shoe-making sector can be revived.  We have seen what competitiveness has done for the craft brewing sector.  I admit that the competitiveness in this example is somewhat false, given that it is driven by substantial excise credits, but it shows that competitiveness works.<br\/><br\/>I would like to draw the attention of the committee to Article 45 of the Constitution, which is dedicated to competition.  Our forefathers crafted Article 45 because they understood competitiveness.  Even though Article 45 is a cornerstone of how we are supposed to be running our country, it continues to be ignored by the body politic at large.<\/p><p>Why have we let a small number of large corporations dominate so many key sectors?  Why do we give them monopoly and duopoly market power when they constantly abuse it?  Perhaps Transparency International nailed it.  It stated, &ldquo;Legal corruption played a role in the poor regulation and weak oversight of financial institutions which led to Ireland&rsquo;s banking crisis&rdquo;.  It went on to describe &ldquo;legal corruption&rdquo; as taking many forms, including &quot;cronyism, patronage and state 'capture&rsquo; - when powerful groups manipulate policy formation to serve their own interests rather than the public interest&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>We have the view of an expert.  In 2004 the former head of the Competition Authority Dr. John Fingleton told the Committee of Public Accounts that there was a considerable shortfall in what the economy needed in terms of competition and that cartels amounted to theft because people met to decide that the customer was the enemy and the competitor their friend and to make an agreement to charge artificially high prices.  He said there were wide sectors of the economy in which there were serious competition problems and that we were not putting enough resources into enforcing competition relative to the historical legacy.  He also said private enforcement of competition law had absolutely failed and that it would not be until judges decided to convict people who were members of the same golf clubs, of which they themselves were members, that we would really see white collar crime being tackled.  He then estimated that anti-competitive practices were costing, in today&rsquo;s terms, more than &euro;5 billion per year.  That equates to <i>circa<\/i>&euro;3,000 per household per year.  We believe this figure to be very conservative.<br\/><br\/>Article 45(2)(iv) of the Constitution states, &ldquo;That in what pertains to the control of credit the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole&rdquo;.  We all know that is not what happened in the banking sector.  Why do we continue to give the pillar banks a monopoly in the creation of credit?  Pumping up the balance sheets of the pillar banks by allowing them to charge artificially high interest rates that far exceed those in other EU member states is entirely incompatible with driving the indigenous economy.  It is worth looking at how German industry is structured, which I have outlined in Appendix 2.  Germany&rsquo;s economy is 70% funded through public and community banking.  Ireland committed to introducing competition to the banking market as a prerequisite for the bailout but no such competition has been introduced.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland is a manifestly flawed and expensive approach to re-banking Ireland.  The real answer then, as now, was to introduce public and community banking.  Currently, there are huge concerns that a potential competitor, the post office network, is set to be captured by the pillar banks in what would be an extraordinary setback in the quest to lower the cost base, while credit unions are subject to a host of anti-competitive restrictions that prevent them from offering competition to the pillar banks.<br\/><br\/>In short, the core issue is that the economy is riddled with cartels and other market abuses which have, in turn, created an artificially high cost base, thus eroding our competitiveness.  For example, beef farmers are being squeezed out of existence by excessive input prices and unviable trade terms for their end product, primarily due to the structure and behaviour of the market.  There are very significant cost issues in the banking, agriculture, legal, housing, construction materials, insurance and pharmaceutical sectors, to name but a few, together with a decidedly unhealthy dominance in the media sector.  The main problem is that Ireland&rsquo;s competition law enforcement regime has been an abysmal failure in its 27 year life.  It lacks independence, power, competence, adequate resources and, most of all, the culture to carry out its statutory function in any meaningful way.  I have no doubt that we can turn Ireland into the best little country in the world in which to do business, but we must tackle the culture of high costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Maye","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":778,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Maye.  The cost of insurance has been a common theme among the delegates who have appeared before the committee to discuss the cost of doing business, a topic on which we have spent a substantial amount of time.  It was raised as an issue of significant concern in the majority of submissions received from business organisations during the summer of 2017.  Many organisations highlighted the significant increases in the cost of public and employers' liability insurance facing their members.  At our last meeting we heard from representatives of the Retail Jewellers of Ireland and the Irish Pharmacy Union who because of the nature of their businesses had very serious concerns about insurance costs.  Their members are open to a lot of abuses by way of theft, shoplifting and even, in some instances, vandalism.  The cost of public liability insurance has been particularly problematic.  Reports of claims tourism have also been made to the committee.  The delegates might factor it in when giving us some of their answers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#E00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":779,"content":"<p>I welcome the representatives of both groups and thank them for their presentations.  We have seen recurring themes in our discussions on the cost of doing business.  As the Chairman said, the cost of insurance is a major issue.  Rates and the cost of finance are others.  Therefore, I am very interested in what Mr. Maye said about pumping up the balance sheets of the pillar banks.  We are very interested in community banking.  We have had representatives of the bank Sparkasse before the committee and are very interested in pursuing the introduction of that model of bank in Ireland in order to create real competition.  It is based on community, interaction with the client, knowing what a client's business is and understanding its needs and the risks involved.  To emphasise Mr. Maye's point, I was only just talking to someone who had been comparing notes at a social event in France.  While she pays 3.3% interest on her mortgage, her cousin is paying 1.1% in France.  We are supposed to be in the European Union and fail to see why there should be such a disparity.  By the way, the cousin's mortgage is over 20 years, while the mortgage of the Irish person mentioned is over 30 years.  That is an issue with which we have to deal and which we are going to pursue, but on the cost of doing business and insurance, in particular, we heard an excellent presentation by the Alliance for Insurance Reform.  Not alone did it highlight the problems the delegates and the insurance industry have highlighted, it also came up with specific proposals which certainly received a lot of support here.  One of its suggestions was the creation of a Garda fraud unit specifically to tackle insurance fraud.  I would like to know the views of both parties on that suggestion.  Would they support it?  <\/p> <p>  The allliance also raised concerns about the dual responsibilities of the Central Bank in prudential supervision and consumer protection in the industry.  It was of the view that there was a conflict in that regard.  I would like to hear views of the delegates on the appropriateness of the Central Bank doing both jobs.  <\/p> <p>  The alliance expressed concerns about the liability insurance market, 90% of which is controlled by eight underwriters.  Some 90% of the insurance industry is controlled by just six underwriters.  In some instances, when people look for insurance, there are really only two.  <\/p> <p>  To come back to the issue of a Garda fraud unit, one of the other things that interested me was the suggestion there be an automatic referral to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na if a claim failed in court and was found to be vexatious.  Such claims fall to be dealt with under sections 25 and 26 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004.  It was suggested there be a relationship between the two and that such claims be automatically referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for further evaluation because there needed to be consequences for those who engaged in insurance fraud.  I would like to hear the views of the delegates on that suggestion.<\/p> <p>  There was one other issue.  In his report Mr. Thompson mentioned that the number of claims was increasing.  There were many good statistics included in the report.  One of the things his organisation would like to see is legislation being brought forward to demand that a judge explain why he or she was not adhering to the book of quantum.  Nobody wants to interfere with the independence of Judiciary, but if an award is made in excess of the guidelines in the book of quantum, judges should be under an obligation to explain why.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#E00300","speaker":"1421"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525791600,"counter":780,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.  I will take each of his points.  <\/p> <p>  On an independent Garda fraud unit, we support the suggestion in principle at a very high level.  We have been working with Departments to draft a straw man in terms of at what it might look.  It is a model which has been implemented in the United Kingdom between the Association of British Insurers and the City of London Police.  What makes it effective from their point of view is that the industry funds it, but the City of London Police has total operational independence.<\/p><p>It decides what it wants to do and how to do it and the industry has no input into it.<\/p><p> The second question was about the Central Bank of Ireland and the adoption of the prudential as against the conduct approach.  The Central Bank has been heavily involved in the implementation of Solvency II and the industry has worked very closely with it.  That is very positive as we see adequate solvency as the correct form of policy holder protection.  The Central Bank has restructured to have a conduct and a prudential directorate.  It has been heavily involved on the conduct side.  It has brought forward many consumer protection regulations which we have adopted and implemented extensively.  We do not see the need to split the two functions and fear the setting up of another regulatory arm would drive further cost into the system.<\/p><p> Another question was about liability insurance and the fact that only two of eight insurers in the market might quote.  It is difficult to comment on situations in which companies will or will not quote, but there are 13 providers in the marketplace, with eight substantially writing liability insurance policies.  The cost of insurance working group focused on employers' and public liability insurance and its report contains a graph which shows that freedom of services carriers, that is, insurance companies which are not domiciled here but which have passports have been writing more and more liability insurance policies, which we see as positive.<\/p><p> I wholeheartedly agree on the consequences of fraud.  If somebody is proved to have committed fraud, there should be serious action and a criminal prosecution.  <\/p><p> The question about a judge's explanation in respect of the book of quantum goes back to the good work of the cost of insurance working group and the Personal Injuries Commission to benchmark awards against those made in other countries.  That is the first step in bringing about a reduction in the level of awards.  We would welcome anything that would bring transparency to the reason an award at a particular level was made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":782,"content":"<p>Mr. Maye is founder and chairman of the International Small Business Alliance and joint chairman of the Public Banking Forum of Ireland.

In the United Kingdom there is a competition Act which is virtually the same as the Irish Act, but there is also in place the Enterprise Act 2002 which gives the Competition and Markets Authority the power to follow in-depth market analysis procedures.  It also gives it sweeping powers of reform.  We simply have not got to the start of the process here.

They have been quite informative.<\/p> <p>  Insurance Ireland outlined the rise in costs and how it has tried to associate them back to claims.  Some of the claims are noteworthy.  From the figures they have given here, claims have risen from 6% to 12% per annum.  They are not off the scale.  I am trying to figure out how the sector can reconcile 2.5%, the lowest one I see here, to maybe 12% per annum, the highlight figure, with a rise in some insurance costs which are just jumping off the pages with consumers.  Where is the correlation here?  We have a plethora of figures on the rise in costs to the insurance sector which are beautifully correlated here.  Mr. Thompson might explain.<\/p> <p>  Maybe consumers are not in the real world when they talk about insurance costs.  I am sure the witnesses read the newspapers and everything else.  Every second article is about how the cost of insurance has gone up, talk of cartels, competition and lot of stuff we heard here earlier.  We had Mr. McCambridge, a retailer in Galway, here at our second last meeting.  I am sure the witnesses have heard of him.  He gave a detailed presentation of how his insurance premium went from &euro;25,000 to &euro;50,000, to &euro;80,000 and it is at &euro;100,000 now in the space of three and a half years, and he had no claim in this time.  Maybe these are one-off cases.  Maybe it is the one-off case that is being trumpeted in the media.  It is certainly not my experience and what I am hearing from people on the ground.  I myself can give a couple of examples.  I am involved with a GAA club.  I accept it might not be a run-of-the-mill case but its insurance has gone up nearly 300% in three years.  That is a massive increase.  It is more than doubling every year for the past three years.  If I worked it out exactly, I would say it is higher than that.<\/p> <p>  I am curious about the correlation.  These are all sad figures.  I appreciate they are going up and the costs are going up.  We wish they were not.  Even blaming it all on the solicitors and associated costs, there does not seem to be a correlation between these figures and what consumers pay in premiums.  Either that or we are getting the red herring cases instead of the truth.  I feel many are telling the truth.  It is not the red herring cases that are out there.  I am curious on Mr. Thompson's thoughts on that firstly.  I might talk to Mr. Maye afterwards, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#G00200","speaker":"1411"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525791600,"counter":798,"content":"<p>The Senator asks a fair question.  First, I acknowledge that consumers have incurred serious premium increases.  We hear it every day and we sympathise with them.<\/p> <p>  I will try and draw some correlation because I take the Senator's point that there are a lot of statistics there.  The easiest statistic to look at is the gross incurred claims.  According to the blue book, there was a 44% increase in the gross incurred claims from 2012 to 2015.  That will show the Senator the level of claims occurrence that we have had within the market place over that period of time.  Equally, when one tries to narrow it down, from example, to employer liability, we had net incurred claims in 2016 of &euro;408 million, up 39% on the previous year.  Unfortunately, we have seen jumps in the cost of claims and that is borne out by those high-level figures.  In the figures we have quoted, we have tried to give a bit of insight on where claims are settled.<\/p> <p>  There has been an upward trajectory in terms of the cost of claims and that is very much one part of the story.  That is why we as a sector are heavily committed to the ongoing work on the two Government reports on the cost of insurance working group for motor insurance and the most recent one on employer liability and public liability.<\/p> <p>  What will also help to bring some transparency to it is that one of the recommendations of the cost of insurance working group is to set up the national claims information database, which will be under the remit of the Central Bank.  That database will capture the details of all claims and their associated costs.  We are fully supportive of that and we want that to be implemented as quickly as possible.  That will, in time, allow the Senator and other policy makers have real time information to allow them formulate policy which can alleviate this situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":799,"content":"<p>I would like to flesh that out.

There is a reasonably good correlation between the cost of claims and the cost of premiums.  That is not surprising because the main determinant of premiums is claims cost because they are by far the biggest amount of expenditure insurance companies have.  We have seen a lot of volatility over the last number of years in the cost of claims, largely driven by the underlying personal injury claims environment.  There are well known problems such as the increase in the monetary limits in the courts.  Those have retrospective effect in the sense that they affected claims that had already been made but had not been settled so those insurers had to increase their reserves for those claims.  That was the backdrop to the whole situation.  Now we are in a situation where premiums in motor have fallen over the last 12 months or so but at the same time I do not think the underlying reforms that are necessary to the personal injury claims environment have happened yet.

Mr. Thompson quoted some figures that I do not really understand.  The CSO figures we were given had an increase of 57% in insurance premiums from 2011 to 2016.  Mr. Thompson did quote from 2012 so I assume there is a slight difference there but from 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015 there did not seem to be an increase of that amount from premiums that were being taken in when he was quoting &euro;3 billion or &euro;4 billion.

The question following up from that then is how many members do Insurance Ireland have and do all members have access to these?  What criteria are set down for the companies access to these databases and do insurance companies have access to pricing information through any of the above databases or through other databases?  Insurance Ireland will be aware that their offices were raided by investigators last July, they called that an unannounced inspection.  In relation to an ongoing investigation into alleged price fixing of motor insurance premiums, has this been the only times investigators or inspectors have visited their offices?  Does Insurance Ireland accept people's frustration with rising insurance costs and the lack of transparency in premium prices?  That was an issue raised by a number of groups who have come before the committee.  I want to finish by saying that many people get quotes that vary by thousands of euros and because of the lack of transparency and detail as to where the price has come from, people get really annoyed by random prices but they cannot seem to do anything about it.

We have never been visited before or since.<\/p> <p>  On the databases we have, I am more than happy to explain every single one of them.  The market intelligence portal is not InsuranceLink and it does not record claims information.  Insurance link is the database which holds claims information.  On the IIDS, it is a system which is a portal, not a database.  It can be imagined as an electronic pipe which runs from Insurance Ireland to the national fleet data centre in Shannon.  That is supported by the road traffic legislation.  That pipe allows insurers who choose to access it to verify people's penalty points at the point of disclosure and to verify their no-claims discount.<\/p><p>The important point about the pipe we have to the national fleet database in Shannon is that we do not have exclusive access to it.  Any insurer can access it.  We established it for our members, but a non-member of Insurance Ireland can access the pipe.  That is what the insurance information database does.<br\/><br\/>On the market intelligence portal and the article by Peter O'Dwyer in the Irish edition of<i>The Times<\/i>, it was related to an interview last week on RT&Eacute; Radio One between me and another person.

The question put to me was whether the market intelligence portal had form 8s, which are detailed regulatory returns to the Central Bank.  My response was that we did not hold market intelligence and to suggest we did was a misnomer and factually incorrect.  The answer to the question as to whether we hold form 8s in the market intelligence portal is that we do not.  We have no pricing information whatsoever within it.  Any information we hold within it is published in our fact file, a copy of which I have in front of me.  Anybody can go to our website and download it to see the information contained in it.

I missed the statement made by Insurance Ireland because I was attending another committee meeting, but I have read it and have a number of questions.  I wish to discuss some of the cost figures presented.<\/p> <p>  A variety of legal costs seem to be to the fore in the headline figures on the first page.  One of the claims made is that there has been a 48% increase in the average Circuit Court award, from &euro;11,800 in 2013 to &euro;17,700 in 2016, according to the annual report of the Courts Service.  That makes perfect sense because the jurisdictional limits of the court were increased in 2014.  Therefore, we would expect awards to be higher.  However, the corollary is that we expect costs to be lower because a person can take a case to the Circuit Court which previously had to be taken to the High Court to be litigated.  By definition, therefore, awards should be higher, while costs should be lower.  I am not sure I accept that as a ground, but I am interested in hearing the delegates views on it.  <\/p> <p>  The same could be said on many of the other points made about legal services.  I am a lawyer, but I am not currently practising and do not work in the area of personal injury claims.  However, I have friends and colleagues who do.  I made the point to another group which appeared before the committee recently that there was no gravy train.  If there is, it is a closed circle in terms of lawyers receiving lucrative personal injury claims work.  Someone is making money, but I am not convinced that lawyers are.  I know that being a lawyer is not a popular profession, no more than being an insurer, but I am not convinced that many lawyers are running down the quays with briefcases full of personal injury claims.<\/p> <p>  When the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, was established, it took all personal injury cases out of the courts.  I am interested in hearing the views of the delegates and whether there has been a retrenchment from that position.  Is the PIAB no longer dominating assessments?  Are the courts becoming more involved?  I am hearing anecdotally that insurers are settling very quickly and easily and, in many cases, not going to the courts or the PIAB.  I have been told that defendants such as employers or workplaces dealing with trip and slip cases often want to fight a case with evidence, including CCTV evidence, because an employee is chancing his or her arm.  They want to take on litigants, but insurance companies agree to settle and tell workplaces not to worry because they have the matter covered.  That is what is leading to increasing costs according to businesses in my constituency or former legal colleagues.  It seems to be a major issue.  If cases are being settled, rather than going to the PIAB or the courts, that will increase costs.  Is that the case and, if so, why?  <\/p> <p>  I have other questions, but perhaps the delegates might answer those first.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#J00800","speaker":"1323"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525791600,"counter":840,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy James Lawless.  On the first question about changes to jurisdictional limits, I draw him back to the first cost of insurance working group which examined the issue.  On page 109 of its report it is stated, \"There had been an underlying growth in cases across all courts\".  I accept that some cases which would have been heard in the High Court are now being heard in the Circuit Court or the District Court.  Unfortunately, the figures from the Courts Service show that there has been growth across all courts.  Unfortunately, that is driving the cost of claims.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked about insurers settling cases very quickly.  This is always a charge put to insurers, but we have a duty and a responsibility to all claimants to treat them fairly under the consumer protection code, within which one of the abiding principles is that we settle claims quickly, fairly and satisfactorily for the claimants.  Insurers will make a decision on whether to settle based on the evidence put in front of them.  They do not want cases to drag on.  If people are due money at the point of making a claim, they will wish to have the claim settled quickly, but there has been a far tougher approach within the sector to what we consider to be dubious or fraudulent claims.  That will continue to be the case.  On behalf of honest policy holders, as a sector, we make no apology for this.  Our members are getting very tough in this area.  The downside is that it is costly to defend such claims.  Where we have a suspicion of fraud and want to take a case through the courts, it will cost money.  Unfortunately, that feeds through to the cost of claims.  Whether a claim is legitimate, honest policy holders have to fund that cost.  <\/p> <p>  Regardless of what people think, we have been strong advocates of the PIAB from the time it was established.  Following the consultation process which started in 2014, we believe the issue needs to be revisited.  The board needs to be given more powers in order that it can deal with more claims.  We know from its annual report that the annual cost associated with settling a claim was about 6.5%.  That is what the figure should be and we have no problem with it whatsoever.  We are very supportive of doing whatever we can to address the heads of a Bill to increase the powers of the board in order that legislation can be passed quickly.  Unfortunately, when cases do not fall within the remit of the board and are taken to the steps of or into the courts, it is expensive.  It is also expensive for us to defend fraudulent claims and that expense has been borne.  A report from the Department of Finance from the cost of insurance working group stated that for every &euro;100,000 claim, there were additional legal and other costs of over &euro;42,000 which, by any stretch, is expensive.  As an industry, we will do our bit and feed into the establishment of a national claims information database which would bring transparency to awards and associated claim costs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":841,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Thompson.  I have questions about motor insurance.  The opening statement outlines the situation for returning immigrants.  I have raised this issue with the Minister.  It seems very unfair that someone who has driven abroad with a full clean licence for a period of time, be it elsewhere in the European Union or elsewhere, is back to square one when he or she returns home.  I have engaged on the issue previously and know that the delegates are aware of it.  They have said they have put methodologies in place.  What is the next step?  Is it up to the Department to take it?  I ask for clarification on the issue.<\/p><p> Another point is that the cost of motor insurance for younger people in particular is astronomical and prohibitive.  I imagine this has been well-aired in many hearings.  My colleagues possibly raised the point before I came in.  It seems very unfair.<\/p><p> We all remember when we were at the age of getting our first cars.  It was difficult to get on the road.  The difficulty now, however, seems to be of a magnitude or order that puts it out of reach.  Moreover, unfortunately, our public transport is not what it needs to be in many parts of the country and it is not an option for many young people.  They need a car to get to work, college or to their first job.  What can be done?  We could spend all day and all night on the subject.  Is there any light on the horizon?<\/p><p> My next question relates to motor insurance as well.  It goes back to the discussion on fraud and accommodating fraud.  A Deputy hears many interesting and shocking stories from his constituency.  People come to me with all manner of different revelations.  I had a conversation with someone in the vehicle disposal industry.  One issue was raised as being rife, namely, the practice of cars involved in collisions or accidents being used.  Different categories are designated, including cars deemed recoverable and repairable.  I think the categories were designated A, B, C and D.  Some cars may be at end-of-life stage.<\/p><p> Let us suppose a car is considered to be sufficiently damaged that it is not worth repairing.  The insurance company would pay out for a replacement car.  That may make things better for the claimant but it may drive up the cost as well.  The person I spoke to was concerned that some of those cars are re-entering the market through the back door.  These cars could have been involved in fatal collisions.  All manner of terrible damage could have been done to a car and it may not be obvious.  What if those cars are back on the road 12 months later?<\/p><p> The argument was made for a certified end-of-life facility where these vehicles would go.  They would be registered and off the road once and for all.  The chassis numbers would be logged and so on.  Some insurers were looking at the idea and thinking of going down that road while others were not so keen.  Clarity on that question would be helpful, if possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#J01000","speaker":"1323","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525791600,"counter":843,"content":"<p>The question of returning immigrants was raised.  Our sector has been keenly aware of the issue for some time.  I know the issue is difficult for people who many have had time abroad.  They may come back only to find that the previous no-claims bonus did not apply.  In essence, from an underwriting perspective, this means in some cases they were treated as new drivers, which was quite difficult.<\/p> <p>  A number of actions arose in the cost of insurance working group relating to left-hand drive and right-hand drive and various other things.  When we got to the core of the matter around this time last year, however, the essence was around proof of driving experience.  It was about being able to demonstrate that a driver had driving experience in his own name for the period abroad.  This means if someone is not driving for a period of over two years, then the risk profile changes from an underwriting point of view.  It is different if it can be demonstrated and verified.<\/p> <p>  We put in place a protocol with the Department of Finance.  It allows for people to be aware of the facts before they go away.  They can use some of the diaspora contact points while they are away and prior to returning.  This can allow them to get the information to show what they need to bring to the country of temporary origin and what is needed when they come back.  That seems to be working although it is not working flawlessly.  We are still encountering some cases.  There is awareness and a methodology to start addressing it.  For us, success arises when people talk to their insurance company before they go so they have an awareness of what they have to do.  That is starting and it is working.  It needs improvement in certain areas but demonstration of verifiable information is important.  If anyone wants more detail, we are happy to provide it.<\/p> <p>  Drivers need to show continued driving experience.  It is difficult where there have been breaks in the driving experience of a person.  The driver will be treated in a similar way to someone who might be at home who has a break and cannot demonstrate insurance cover.  This arises because the person is not driving day in, day out.  By and large, I believe we have a methodology that, while not perfect, is becoming more effective.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#K00200","nonspeaker":"Dr. Declan Jackson"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525791600,"counter":844,"content":"<p>Deputy Lawless asked about end-of-life vehicles.

Some of my questions are around motor insurance.<\/p> <p>  My first question is on emigrants.  Mr. Thompson and I were on a television programme a month ago.  He mentioned that there was a 50% drop in the premiums for emigrants returning home.  Does Mr. Thompson have data that he can share with the committee around that claim?  Is there any truth to the story that emigrants are putting themselves as named drivers on the policies of their parents before they go?  This allows them to hold a policy for the three or four years while they are away.  Mr. Jackson mentioned that emigrants should talk to the insurance companies before they go.  Some emigrants go abroad but may not be coming back.  If they do come back, it might be for four or five years.  It has an impact on their rights as consumers if they are tied to a particular insurer before they go.  They should be recognised for their driving credentials and they should be allowed to shop around.  I would appreciate clarification on that point.<\/p> <p>  My next question relates to sales representatives on the road.  I have heard of this anecdotally from the market.  Let us imagine a sales representative is on the road in a company car for ten or 15 years but has not had a car insured in his or her name.  Such a person is now getting hit for high premium policies as well.  The approach of the insurers is that this is the first time the driver has had a policy.  I want clarification and a statement around that and whether it is happening in the market.<\/p> <p>  I am getting the same feedback anecdotally with regard to cars that have had more than five owners.  Again, it is anecdotal evidence and I am not suggesting otherwise.  I am simply getting this back from constituents.  Let us suppose a car has had five or more owners or is ten or 11 years old.  Then it seems the premium increases as well.  I would like clarification on that point.<\/p> <p>  The remaining question relates to the presentation by Insurance Ireland.  Can I get some detail from the stakeholders of information on how premiums are calculated?  I know we have the national information claims database.  Are the bodies here satisfied that there is enough transparency between the insurance companies and the businesses that they insure?  The question is especially relevant for businesses.  I am removing myself from the motor insurance question.  This relates more to where a business or livelihood is at stake.  Businesses are providers to the community.  Will the witnesses comment on claims that are under way?  I have heard comment to the effect that many businesses may not be aware of claims happening.  It seems it is only when they go to renew their insurance policies that they are told their insurance costs have been hiked because a claim has come in or because a claims process has started.<\/p> <p>  There are enough questions there.  I am seeking some clarity on those points.  I am happy to repeat the questions.  There is no problem with that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#K00600","speaker":"1328"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525791600,"counter":848,"content":"<p>I can probably spread some of these questions between myself and my colleagues.<\/p> <p>  I was asked about the 50% figure mentioned on \"The Pat Kenny Show\".

Mr. Maye is very supportive of the German model, as in his statement he said that the pillar banks are \"entirely incompatible with driving our indigenous economy.  It is worth looking at how German Industry is structured.\".  We looked at the German model in detail and we were very supportive of it, especially  as they were really focusing on the midlands.

We have worked quite closely with Sparkassen in the past.  In fact our group, The Public Banking Forum of Ireland, brought Sparkassen into Ireland initially.  We are talking to the credit unions, the Credit Union Development Association and the Irish League of Credit Unions.  Our indigenous economy cannot and will not thrive until we lower our interest rates and until we have a model something similar to Germany.  Where the Public Banking Forum of Ireland slightly differs is that we do not see that it is sensible to bring in a standalone public banking model into Ireland because we already have two, the credit unions and the post offices that are right throughout every community in the country.  What we would like to see happening is a working group that would bring the Sparkassen, the credit unions and the post offices together.  Let me give an example, New Zealand had a post office bank for 150 years and then they corporatised it and eventually sold it in1989.  In 2002 New Zealand realised they had made a terrible mistake and they set up the Kiwibank, and the post offices became the Kiwibank.  In the past 15 years, that bank has taken 20% of the market.  The people love it, it is a people's bank and it has brought competition into the marketplace.  There is absolutely no reason we cannot turn our post offices into a similar model to the Kiwibank.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2018050800002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus Maye"},{"type":"speech","time":1525791600,"counter":887,"content":"<p>May I interject at this point, as Mr. Maye is aware we did have a post office bank at one stage but the post office bank failed?

America is very good at handing down prison sentences.  To all intents and purposes we have zero competition law enforcement in this country.  We need it.  We should start.  We should also bring in rewards for whistleblowers.  That is essential.  It is very difficult to prove cartels are in place.  We need to bring in rewards for whistleblowers, which we have campaigned on for years.  We need to bring in an act like the British Enterprise Act 2002.  We need to get serious about competition law enforcement.  Let me put it this way.  We have a man or woman working for &euro;400 a week and they are looking for a 20% increase, to which they feel entitled as everything is expensive.  There are two ways we can pay that increase.  We can give them another &euro;80 a week or we can increase the purchasing power of their &euro;400, so that they get &euro;480 worth for their &euro;400.  We do that by driving hard against costs.  I have only touched on certain costs.  There are any other costs that are affecting the indigenous economy, such as lack of infrastructure in parts of the country.  We will not go into it now.

I will not go through all the various reports.  I reiterate the point made in our earlier Committee Stage discussion.  We are in an ecological crisis with the loss of biodiversity across the country and across the world which requires urgent action.  In effect maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>is not a viable option; we need to engage in a range of new initiatives to protect wildlife which is being lost at a frightening rate.  I wish we had a Bill before us where all the stakeholders were brought in to consider how we develop our hedgerows, how we make them safe definitely for road users, but also how we use them in a way that promotes good farming practice that protects wildlife, improves tourism amenities and provides structural supports around a field.<\/p><p>Instead we have this very simple and confusing freeing up of the regulations to allow for cutting on the basis of a judgment of someone who owns a field.  We think it will add to further confusion and further threat and stress to Irish wildlife, particularly certain bird species which are still nesting in the hedges in August.  We do not believe that the provision that someone cutting the hedgerow would see if there is a nest would work.  We do not believe the National Parks and Wildlife Service has the resources to police this in any effective way.  The approach is completely wrong.  It should look at a new management strategy for hedgerows rather than weakening existing regulations and adding further confusion to what is a very uncertain system of protecting that ecosystem.<\/p><p>Our amendment is simple in that it replaces the key section in page 12 of the Bill with allowance for regulations giving the local authorities real control.  They would decide if a hedge needed to be cut back for road-safety reasons and would set out the regulations and approach, rather than having a free-for-all which is the direction the Bill proposes.  I ask the Minister to change tack even at this late stage.  We need to be proactive in protecting wildlife, not loosening regulations and allowing for more widespread destruction of habitat, which is the last thing we need to be doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#B00500","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":912,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach as an deis labhairt faoin rud seo.  We are probably entering a period where awareness is increasing radically throughout society with regard to what is actually happening to the ecosystem which we all share.  Programmes such as \"Blue Planet\" have really brought to people's attention that the range of species throughout the world is collapsing at a radical rate.  We even see that in our country.  The Minister has mentioned that the objective of the State is the protection of our natural heritage.  However, the protection of our national heritage has not been successful so far.  It is not just me who is saying so.  With every generation the range of species is collapsing and is in freefall.  There is no doubt that we are on the wrong course currently.  We are not passive observers; the Government has a role in this.<\/p> <p>  By reducing the habitat in which species live throughout their lifecycle, we then reduce the opportunity for that species to live.  People have major problems with the Government giving the go-ahead for the physical habitat to be reduced at key periods for these different species.<\/p> <p>  I understand the logic to part of the objective the Government is trying to achieve and I grant that the Government is not doing this out of recklessness.  The Government has regard to road safety concerns and other Deputies will also have road safety issues.  About three months after the Bill had been published I contacted the Road Safety Authority and asked if the Department had contacted it with regard to this road safety issue and was told that had not happened.  I then contacted the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - one would figure that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport would be partners on this matter - but it had not been contacted about the Bill.  In other words the drafting of the Bill as published had not been done in partnership with the Road Safety Authority, whatever about any contact after that.<\/p> <p>  I believe we can achieve both objectives - the objective of road safety and the objective of ensuring we do not reduce the habitat in which species already under threat exist.  One way to do that is to balance the two objectives, which is what I have sought to do in amendment No. 21.  I have sought to balance the agricultural needs and the safety needs with the environmental needs.<\/p> <p>  I know that some Members who have tabled amendments, including Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, cannot attend this particular meeting.

I was brought up on a farm and was brought up to love animals and love nature, as I do.  No one can ever say otherwise.<\/p><p>I was brought up not to leave animals go hungry and to treat them right at all times.<\/p><p> Some Deputies are complaining that roadside hedges should not be cut because to do so would destroy habitats for nesting birds and so on.  I do not believe that birds are so foolish as to make their nests on the side of a busy road or any road.  They have the entire countryside.  I will not say anything about when hedges inside roadside ditches should be cut.  I have no view on that and have nothing against any proposal on it, but I must make it known that there are narrow roads along which hedges are not being cut.  People cannot walk or cycle safely.  Lives are being put at risk.  Roadside hedges should be kept cut all year round for the safety of people using those roads.  Look at what the prohibition is doing.  It is moving people out past the yellow line on roads that are only 3 m wide.  A number of pedestrians and cyclists are being killed each year.  This is why.  That is the truth.  The other side of the issue is that, because bushes and briars are out on the road, drains are getting blocked and water is flowing down and tearing roads.<\/p><p> I have nothing against birds or the like.  As I stated at our previous meeting, much more damage is being done to ground-nesting birds by animals and birds of prey, for example, magpies, mink and foxes, yet no word at all is being said by members about that or how we might protect those birds.  There is a type of hawk that cleans out every nest.  If, like me, members are interested in and serious about nature, including birds, then that is the route we should be taking.  We could save many more birds.  To claim that our roadside hedges should not be cut is preposterous, though.  I cannot agree with it.  These roads are a part of the infrastructure people need to access their homes, and it is the last inch that makes the difference when an accident happens and someone is killed or seriously hurt while out walking or cycling on a road.  People in cars cannot see as far around bends and accidents occur.  Many farmers cannot get up and down their roads now.  I know of milk lorries and school buses that are having severe difficulties getting around.  That is not fair.  Those people are paying their motor and property taxes, most have their own water supplies and they are costing no one anything.  They only want a road to their doors.  Each and every one of them is entitled to as good a road as people in Dublin 4 have.<\/p><p> Regarding gorse burning, I agree with the extra month that is being added in March.  In some cases, the North allows burning up to 15 April.  Ours is a small country and we should have the same facility.  If gorse is not burned for one or two years, which has happened previously due to bad weather lasting until February, someone somewhere will set it alight anyway.  I am not saying that farmers do that.  In fact, I am trying to support farmers and to have payments returned to them that were wrongfully taken because their lands were burned by fires that started elsewhere.  Neither God nor man could have stopped those fires.  These farmers rang the fire brigade and put their own lives in danger, but they have been left without any payment or the greater part of their payments even though they did not start the fires.  When there is too much gorse, it cannot be controlled.<\/p><p> I plead with members not to undermine what is being done by the Minister.  I support these two aspects of the Bill.  I would like my amendment on cutting roadside hedges all year round to be agreed.  Deputy Ryan referred to how local authorities had the facility to cut hedges all year round where they deemed them unsafe.  I was a member of Kerry County Council for a long time and I highlighted the situation on many roads, but for one reason or another, those dangerous hedges were never cut.  The council barely cut a few junctions.  It may be doing so again shortly.  The dangerous spots on narrow roads are left alone.  The council has the facility to do this, but I cannot explain why it does not.  It does not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#B00700","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":915,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#C00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":916,"content":"<p>That is why I am supporting the Bill's measures.

There are provisions under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 which oblige landowners to ensure a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on their land is not a hazard to road safety.  In addition, there is a provision which allows a local authority to serve notice on landowners to undertake works such as hedge cutting and clearance for safety purposes along public roads.  These provisions apply all year round.  Accordingly, I cannot consider the Deputy's amendment to be necessary, but I understand his concern about road safety and the difficulties faced by farmers.  However, I am happy that the scenario he describes is covered by section 8.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 23 was tabled by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, but she is not present.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 33 in the name of Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n contains three proposals, each of which I will deal with separately.  He proposes to insert a provision into section 40(2) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1976 to make the notice made by a local authority to a landowner on the cutting of hedges under the Roads Act an exempted activity.  Section 8 of the Bill provides for the harmonisation of the Wildlife Acts with the Roads Acts in that the provision contained in section 70(2) of the Roads Act 1993 which obliges landowners to ensure a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on their land is not a hazard to road safety, as I mentioned, will be an exempted activity, as will the provision in section 70(2) which allows a local authority to serve notices on landowners to undertake works such as hedge cutting and clearance for safety purposes along public roads.  I must, therefore, oppose that part of the amendment as it is unnecessary.<\/p> <p>  The second part of amendment No. 33 provides that public bodies would have to notify me, as Minister, of all exempted works undertaken during the period from March to August.  I do not consider that it should be mandatory for public bodies to notify me of all such works as that would be an onerous task which could delay the carrying out of urgent work on health and safety grounds.  I have existing powers under section 40(3) of the Act to request details of such works from public bodies with a statement of the public health and safety factors involved.  These powers have been used on several occasions in recent years.  For that reason, I believe my existing powers are sufficient and request that the committee reject the amendment.<\/p> <p>  The third part of the amendment relates to a proposed amendment to the Roads Act 1993 relating to the placement of structures which may interfere with public roads.  These are matters outside the remit of the Bill and more appropriate to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.  Accordingly, it is not possible for me to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#D00300","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":929,"content":"<p>There is a fundamental difference.No one disagrees that we must be attentive to the need for road safety.  In that regard there are existing provisions in the Roads Act that allow us to attend to situations which involve a safety problem.  The provisions in amendments Nos. 20, 23 and 27 that we have put forward aim to give clarity to and strengthen such powers and make it clear that it is the responsibility of the local authority to address a road safety issue or direct a landowner to do so.  That is needed as part of a wider range of measures aimed at good hedgerow management.  In many instances, people do not cut hedgerows during the preferred period from September to March when there is a need for their proper management in that way.  However, central to the legislation brought forward by the Minister is that landowners are left to make that decision and decide whether to cut hedges in August in a way that we believe will be deeply damaging to wildlife and impossible to police in comparison with the approach we suggest, where it would properly be done by the local authority.  The Minister stated this would only apply to roadside hedges.  They do not make up a minute fraction of hedgerows, as was suggested in previous discussions on the Bill but rather I understand, approximately 19%, according to the latest or best hedgerow studies.  We are talking about giving landowners <i>carte blanch<\/i>e to decide if one fifth of hedgerows should be cut.  It would be fanciful for us to believe they will be able to assess ecological risk in dealing with issues such as whether there is a nest in a hedgerow.<\/p><p>The Bill will lead to a loosening of regulations when we should be tightening and clarifying the existing regulations which are not being applied.  If road safety is the real issue, as it is in some instances, we want there to be the cutting of hedgerows but it to be done under the control of local authorities and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, rather than handing control over to landowners such that it would be impossible to police, which is what the Minister is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#D00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":930,"content":"<p>Road safety was mentioned by another Deputy who lives in a rural area.

Our car was shunted back ten feet, leaving it stuck in the ditch.  All those in the car were injured, with some of the injuries lasting for approximately six months.  I am acutely aware of the necessity for road safety on minor roads.  The individual who was driving the other car was still over the limit having been drinking the previous night.  The policing of roads to prevent drink-driving is one of the key tools we can use to ensure roads will be safer for everybody.<\/p> <p>  I am glad that Deputy Danny Healy-Rae admitted that there is a tool to fix some of the problems we face.  He has rightly stated section 70 is not used enough, but that issue could be resolved and we could use the section to achieve his objectives in that regard.  Interestingly, in responding to his amendment the Minister stated it was unnecessary as we already had section 70 to resolve the question with which we were dealing.  She is using my argument against the Deputy, but it does not apply solely to certain months but to the entire year, including the months about which we are speaking.  If it is valid in April and May, it is valid in March and August.  It cannot be invalid in those months if it is valid in others.  It is a matter of achieving the objectives for farmers and road safety and this becoming the generation that will put a line under the retreat of nature in our society, but that will not be the case if we eradicate habitats for animals in certain months of the year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#D00500","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":931,"content":"<p>I was very interested in what Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n stated about the RSA having no input into the Bill.

It has no interest at all in what is happening on the roads in terms of overgrowth and hedges and people having their eyes picked out or being killed.

Many people are killed while walking and cycling along our roads.  Considerable pressure is being applied by cyclists to have their safety improved.

I have been vocal on this issue since 2004.  I had to fight to save my council seat because another councillor made a serious remark that I sought to get hedges cut because I wanted to get that work for myself.  I had to fight like I had never fought before to hold my seat in that election.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.  I wanted to get hedges cut to allow school buses to bring children to schools.  The hedge cutting tender process was open to everyone else as well and the hedges in question were miles away from me.  It was in September 2004 and it cost me a great deal of money to save my seat.  I paid people to help represent me, yet it was not them who helped but another poor, honest man who put the matter in perspective and allowed me to defend my seat rightfully.

I do not believe the Minister would say this is a proposal to improve the protection of wildlife.  It is being introduced to address road safety issues.  The argument being made in amendment No. 27 is that if that is the Minister's intention, the best approach is to ensure the local authority can act to direct a landowner to address a road safety issue or take action itself.  Section 70(2)(b) of the Roads Act 1993 allows a local authority to issue a direction to a landowner.  Section 70(9) of the same Act allows a local authority to take action.  I mention this as a means of outlining the purpose of the amendment.  I return to the question that is at the centre of my argument: why are we giving people the freehold ability to cut hedgerows in August?  It is being done to address a road safety issue when it could be addressed by the local authority directing the landowner to take action or taking action itself in circumstances where there is a clear road safety issue.

I have already addressed the issues related to hedgecutting in the month of August.  I have explained the reasons and rationale for that decision.  I do not propose to go into them again.  It is important to say that under section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, hedgecutting cannot be engaged in by individual landowners during the closed season from March to the end of August.  Section 8 of the Bill provides that works to be undertaken by landowners along public roads under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 for safety purposes will be considered to be an exempted activity under section 40 of the 1976 Act, as amended.  The Deputy's proposal would align the Wildlife Acts with a specific subsection of section 70 of the 1993 Act.

The nesting season now occurs earlier, as reflected in the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 which provided for an earlier start to the closed season.  That Act should also have provided for the closed season to end on 31 July in line with nesting patterns.  As Deputies will be aware, August is a busy farming month.  As many farmers harvest crops, spread soil nutrients and transport livestock in August, they need access to the roads.  Therefore, the decision to allow them to cut hedges during August is a practical one from the perspective of the safety of road users.  August is also the peak month for tourism, with many tourists travelling in cars on unfamiliar regional and secondary roads or walking on such roads.  For road safety reasons, it is sensible to allow hedges to be cut during August.  In recent years the unpredictable winter weather has typically resulted in the hedge cutting season being reduced by one third.  The agricultural machinery involved in hedgerow trimming is very expensive.  Many operators work long hours during the open season to ensure work is completed.  August is a month during which we have between 12 and 14 hours of daylight.  The amount of daylight continues to reduce when August is over.  In the interests of the safety of machinery operators and motorists, hedge cutting should be allowed in the month of August.  Fly-tipping which is a growing problem in the countryside is another issue that should be taken into account.  Community groups that voluntarily clean roadside ditches have noticed that ditches which are regularly cut and maintained are less likely to be used as a dumping ground.  The earlier opening of the hedge cutting season will facilitate earlier cutting and maintenance of hedges.

Growth and nesting periods deviate radically from year to year.  Fly-tipping is a national disaster.  Anyone who lives in the countryside will agree that it has become radically polluted in recent times.  This is not good for tourism or the ecosystem.  The causes of fly-tipping include bin charges, the cost of recycling and our inability to provide for bottles to be returned in exchange for 10 cent a bottle.  Reducing the functional habitat of animals is probably not one of the raft of positive actions could be taken to reduce the level of fly-tipping.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#H02100","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":981,"content":"<p>The reality is that the amount of hedge-cutting that is likely to take place in August is actually quite limited.  This section limits it to roadside hedge-cutting but many fields do not come to the roadside.  Any fields that do come to the roadside also have three sides of hedges that do not come to the roadside.  In fact, on the narrow roads and especially on the boreens into houses, the tourists constantly complain about visibility, particularly those tourists who would normally drive on the opposite side of the roads.  There are constant complaints about lack of visibility on rural roads over the summer and specifically in August when we get the most visitors.  It is a problem.  I do not see wholesale cutting of roadside hedges but to be able to do it without having to go through a very convoluted process of getting permission from the local authority in August is a proportionate proposal.<\/p> <p>  There is a need to look at what is causing the decrease in our bird population.  It is a lot more complicated than the possibility of being able to cut a few hedges in August.  There is another problem when verges overgrow with grass that technically one can cut anyway.  The local authorities are highly adverse to doing even that, although we get major problems because of it.<\/p> <p>  I happened to be travelling on very narrow roads on Friday in a certain part of the world that does not have a lot of hedgerows but with very high walls along the narrow roads.  I said to the driver to keep 1 m out from the cyclists, but if he had done so we would have been in the ditch on the other side of the road or would have knocked against the walls.  It must be recognised that a lot of the boreens of rural Ireland - not the regional roads - are exceptionally narrow.<\/p> <p>  There are many heavy goods vehicles, milk trucks, timber trucks and every kind of vehicle going down very small roads.  I have often travelled from Mallow to west Cork taking the byways and they are very twisted with a lot of hedges.  It is fine until one comes around a corner and is up against a 40 ft articulated truck, whose driver might have seen one but one will not have seen the truck.  If the car is driven by a tourist it is an absolutely extraordinary situation.  I believe that what is proposed in the amendment is very proportionate and limited.  It is much more limited than original proposals for the wholesale cutting of hedges by professional contractors in August.  I believe this proposal is proportionate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#J00100","speaker":"1312"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":982,"content":"<p>I promised Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n that he could make a brief comment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#J00200","speaker":"1263"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":983,"content":"<p>As we are discussing the group of amendments Nos. 24 to 28, inclusive, together, Deputy Catherine Connolly has asked that we ensure amendment No. 28 is discussed on Report Stage.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#J00300","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":984,"content":"<p>Section 7 mainly deals with August provisions and section 8 provides for hazards all year round.

They are the oldest, they are the boundary hedges, they have the most diverse wildlife within them and they are the most sensitive to disruption.  This is not an insignificant 2%.

When I was at school, one twelfth of 100% equated to approximately 8%.  I don not believe it would be even that in this case, though.  Where I live, unless the corners are very bad, it is normally the local authority that undertakes hedge cutting, so the figure is probably one tenth of that again.  As such, fewer than 1% of hedges will be trimmed on the outside.  What is more likely to happen is something that happens all of the time anyway.

I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Chris Kane who is the principal officer with responsibility for contracted employment services, including the local employment service, LES, and JobPath, and Mr. Jim Lynch who is principal officer with responsibility for operations in the south west.<\/p> <p>  I am aware that the committee and its predecessor, the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, received numerous presentations on JobPath from the Department and others.  I am also conscious that the main purpose of the meeting is to give committee members an opportunity to hear directly from JobPath providers.  However, I would like to make some comments on activation in general.  I will also address a number of issues which were raised by committee members at the meeting on 8 March.<\/p> <p>  Many, if not most, developed states provide an integrated public employment and welfare service.  The purpose of the service is to provide an income support for persons who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed and, in addition, employment services to assist people in securing and sustaining employment.  Typically, employment services, sometimes known as active labour market programmes, ALMPs, are categorised in four groups: job advisory and job search assistance services such as are provided by Intreo, the LES and JobPath; employment and recruitment incentives such as JobsPlus; access to and support during training and education programmes such as those facilitated via the education and training boards, ETBs, and the back to education allowance; and placement in State employment schemes such as the community employment scheme and T&uacute;s.<\/p> <p>  There is a considerable body of research that examines the effectiveness of these programmes.  In general, their effectiveness is assessed in terms of whether they reduce the overall rate of unemployment at the macro level and, at the micro level, by the extent to which they reduce the duration of unemployment and improve the progression into employment of individuals.  It is fair to say the results of these evaluations are mixed.  In general, the research shows no or only a modest impact on unemployment at the macro level.  However, when the evidence from Ireland in recent years is reviewed in years to come, it will show a more significant effect.<\/p><p>At the micro level the research is somewhat more positive.  In most studies active labour market measures are shown to contribute to improved employment outcomes and reduced unemployment durations for individuals.  Employment advice, job search assistance and employment incentives are shown to have the most positive impact, particularly where receipt of welfare payments is contingent on participation in such activities.  The impact of training and education appears to depend on the duration of the programmes and the linkages between them and employers.  Generally, short job-specific programmes have positive outcomes.  The research indicates that participation in education programmes of long duration and State employment schemes can, owing to what is known as the \"lock-in\" effect, have a negative impact on employment outcomes.<\/p><p> Although these results should not be interpreted in a simplistic manner, they suggest the State should ensure all unemployed jobseekers have access to and receive tailored employment advice and that this advice should inform both job search and the selection of other interventions such as referral to training and State employment programmes.  Unfortunately, in the past that was not the case.  As demonstrated in studies conducted by bodies such as the OECD and the Economic and Social Research Institute of Ireland, Ireland&rsquo;s public employment service was, prior to the recession, under-resourced and overly focused on referring people to training programmes.  This position became particularly acute during the recession when the ratio of jobseekers to case officers, or caseload, exceeded over 1,000:1 compared with international norms of 200:1 for unemployed persons generally and 100:1 for long-term unemployed persons.  As a result, many jobseekers, in particular, long-term unemployed jobseekers, never received the advice and support of a case officer.<\/p><p> It was for this reason that it was decided to increase significantly the capacity of the public employment service as part of the Pathways to Work strategy, both by doubling the number of case officers directly employed by the Department and increasing its contracted resource capacity.  The use of contracting as a method of providing additional resources is in line with approaches adopted in most other countries.  It reflects the requirement to have a flexible resourcing component that enables the Department to adjust capacity in response to variations in demand levels over a medium-term time horizon.  The contracting model used which we termed JobPath was designed following an extensive process of research and consultation.  Its key feature is that it is a payment-by-results model.  This ensures some of the risk associated with expanding the service is borne by the service providers and that costs incurred are directly linked with employment outcomes.<\/p><p> It was also decided that the service would focus on providing support for long-term unemployed persons.  In this way it complements the work of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo staff which is focused on short-term unemployed persons, as the best approach to reducing the level of long-term unemployment is to reduce the rate at which people who are short-term unemployed transition into long-term unemployment.  Focusing JobPath on long-term unemployed persons also augmented the activities of local employment service providers, enabling those providers to reduce their caseloads and, together with JobPath, expand coverage in order that those long-term unemployed persons who never had access to an employment adviser or case worker would, in time, receive a referral to a case worker.  That is important.  Contrary to what some commentators have suggested, JobPath does not compete with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service or the local employment service; expenditure on and staffing in those services have not been reduced.  The introduction of JobPath has augmented our resource capacity, reduced pressure on Intreo and the local employment service and enabled both services to provide an improved service for their clients.<\/p><p> The Department has provided the committee, under separate cover, with further information on some matters where information was not to hand or could not be covered in the time available at the last committee meeting.  I hope the information addresses the questions of interest to the committee, but I will be pleased to take further questions or follow up with further clarification, if required.  There are a number of points I would like to address.<\/p><p> At the last meeting committee members inquired, based on the data available to them, if it was accurate to say JobPath cost &euro;13,000 to &euro;14,000 per job.  It is not.  JobPath is not a job creation initiative that is to be assessed on a basis similar to Enterprise Ireland, for example.  It is, as I stated, an advisory and support service to help unemployed jobseekers to compete for the job opportunities available in the labour market.  Therefore, the correct metric to use is the cost per jobseeker supported by the service.  To the end of December 2017, approximately 150,000 people had accessed the service at a cost of &euro;84 million.  This equates to a cost of approximately &euro;600 per client.  This compares more than favourably with the costs of the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service and those of the local employment service.  For example, the local employment service has been contracted to serve 20,000 clients in 2018 with a budget just short of &euro;20 million.  This gives an average cost per client served of approximately &euro;1,000.<\/p><p> Committee members also expressed an interest in the contractual arrangements and individual fees paid to each of the two service providers.<\/p><p>The Department has not disclosed this level of detail as to do so would breach the confidentiality of the agreements with the service providers and place the State at a disadvantage in any future procurement that may be undertaken.  I can confirm, however, that fees are paid on client registration and on successful and sustained job outcomes.  Sustainment fees account for approximately 90% of the total fees paid in respect of any individual jobseeker who secures employment.<\/p><p> A sustained job outcome is one which involves employment of at least 30 hours per week for a period of at least 13 weeks.  Up to four job sustainment fees may be made over a 12 month or 52 week period.  The level of the sustainment fee paid varies depending on the prior duration of unemployment of the jobseeker concerned and the contract year in which he or she was referred to the JobPath provider.  As part of the tendering process, bidders were asked to bid separate prices against 120 price points, that is, registration fees plus a separate fee for each year of the contract against six different client cohorts based on the duration of unemployment and for each period of sustainment, namely, 13, 26, 39 and 52 weeks, respectively.  It was suggested at the most recent meeting that as the Department had published the overall cost of the JobPath service, each provider could reverse engineer the fees charged by the other provider and fee confidentiality was not, therefore, an issue.  Given the fee structure I described, the reverse engineering of fees is not possible using the information provided.<\/p><p> I emphasise that to protect the interests of the State and of jobseekers and protect against an excessive level of profits, the fees paid to the service providers are subject to downward adjustment only, based on the level of employment growth in the wider economy.  Prices have been reduced by 8% on this basis.  Fee reductions can also be applied if providers do not achieve performance targets with respect to the level of employment outcomes or achieve a satisfactory score in independent surveys of customer experience.  To date, providers have exceeded their performance targets and scored highly in customer satisfaction research.  As such, the question of retention fees has not arisen.<\/p><p> The joint committee also queried how effective the JobPath service was in helping people secure sustained employment.  It was suggested that the published performance data was not impressive.  In fact, job outcomes among jobseekers referred to JobPath are significantly higher than job outcomes of jobseekers of similar unemployment duration who were not referred to JobPath.  They are up to 59% higher for people who have been unemployed for three years or more.  While these data are not controlled for factors other than unemployment duration, the fact that referral to JobPath is random suggests the inclusion of other control variables should not significantly alter the results.  A full econometric review of the service has commenced and will be completed later this year.<\/p><p> Members also inquired as to the nature of the research carried out in developing the contract model.  Internationally, contracted models similar to JobPath were first developed in the 1980s and are now commonplace in many OECD countries.  Accordingly, the Department drew on international experience in developing JobPath.  In addition, the Department commissioned and took advice from experts who advised and prepared reports for the European Union, the OECD, the United Kingdom Government, the UK Houses of Parliament select committees, the National Audit Office in the UK, the Northern Ireland Government and the Trade Union Council, TUC.  The Department also took informal advice and input from the former director general of employment policy and services in the OECD, canvassed the opinion of Irish labour market experts in the NESC, the ESRI, the Geary Institute in UCD, and the National University of Ireland in Maynooth, and took input from members of the Labour Market Council.  Finally, the Department held a number of public briefing events which involved participants from advocacy groups, local development companies and trade unions, among others, and sought feedback from participants.  There is further detail on the research approach taken in the material provided under separate cover.<\/p><p> Members also queried if personal progression plans were a type of service contract that must be signed by jobseekers.  A personal progression plan is a structured document which seeks to assist people in identifying barriers to employment and the steps that need to be taken to achieve their employment goals.  It is developed by the case officer and the jobseeker working together.  It is not fixed but is updated and revised over the course of the engagement period.  A personal progression plan is used in all of the Department's activation services &ndash; Intreo, local employment schemes and JobPath - and is also a standard feature in all other public employment services in developed countries.  A similar plan is also used in all community employment engagements.<\/p><p> We ask all jobseekers to sign the personal progression plan as a means of ensuring that it is an agreed document.  The customer signature is also an important control feature in determining whether registration fees are due to be paid under the JobPath contracts.  Therefore, we strongly encourage all jobseekers to sign the form.  For most people this is non-contentious, with the number of jobseekers who refuse to sign assessed as being less than 1%.<\/p><p> With regard to community employment and T&uacute;s, members will be aware of the Minister's recent announcement that customers who are engaged with the JobPath service and those who may be referred in future will, from 1 June 2018, have the option of applying for community employment and T&uacute;s placement while continuing to engage with JobPath.  We hope this addresses the concerns raised by members, among others, regarding access to community employment and T&uacute;s.<\/p><p>I am conscious that some of the discussion at the last committee meeting seemed to suggest JobPath was an unnecessary imposition on jobseekers and that most participants in the service felt oppressed.  I dispute that contention strongly.  The Department and its staff work with unemployed jobseekers every day.  We come from and live and work among the communities we serve.  I believe we are more sensitive to and aware of the needs of these citizens - our clients - than any other service organisation in the country.  Our customer feedback and research indicate that the overwhelming majority of customers value and approve of the service we provide.  They believe they are treated in a friendly, respectful and considerate manner.  They also believe the service improves their employment prospects.  The same is true of research into customers of the local employment service.  I do not suggest our service is perfect.  Neither the JobPath service nor the local employment service is perfect.  There will be process failures, individual lapses and system failures.  In any service in which eligibility and selection are determined of necessity by the use of thresholds and bands there will be people on either side of the thresholds and bands who feel disadvantaged.<\/p><p> Like the public representatives who are present at this meeting, as Secretary General of the Department, I hear about failures more often than I hear about the vast majority of positive examples of good service and outcomes.  We should be open to these challenges.  We should constantly look for ways by which we could do better.  In correctly highlighting the flaws we should not lose sight of the good.  To use a cliche, we should not let the pursuit of the perfect get in the way of the good.  This is a balance that needs to be struck.  As Accounting Officer for the Department, I am acutely conscious that all commercial contracts carry risk.  I know that these risks are of concern to the committee.   I contend that the existence of risk should not inhibit action.  We need to seek ways to manage and mitigate risk.  In JobPath we have learned from the experience of other jurisdictions and are seeking to limit risk through careful contract design that incorporates price discounting, payment penalties, customer satisfaction tracking, on-site inspections and tight performance targets and monitoring.  I will not refrain from taking the appropriate action if these control mechanisms indicate that any provider is not delivering the service in the manner or to the standard required.<\/p><p> It is notable that in its recent country report on Ireland the European Union commented favourably on JobPath, which it identified as the main reason for the faster than anticipated reduction in the level of long-term unemployment.  Long-term unemployment rates in Ireland have decreased faster than short-term unemployment rates.  This is a notable exception to the trend in all other countries.  As the European Union has observed, this is at least partly attributable to the reforms undertaken by the Department, including the development of Intreo and JobPath.  With my colleagues, I will be happy to address questions committee members may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1059,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Donnery to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#J00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525778100,"counter":1060,"content":"<p>On behalf of Turas Nua, I thank the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to address it and provide further details of our organisation, as well as our services.  I am joined by Ms Mary Moss who is our head of operations.  She has been working with Turas Nua for over two years and has extensive experience of running large customer-focused organisations.  I am a director of the company and have over 20 years of experience in the recruitment, training and employability sectors.  I am also a board member of Macra na Feirme and a former president of the National Recruitment Federation of Ireland.<\/p> <p>  Since Turas Nua began its operations in 2015, our entire focus has been on helping people to find work, to prepare for the difficulties presented by the jobs market, to increase their knowledge, to improve their skills and find jobs they can sustain, thereby giving them and their families greater financial security and stability.  The official vision of Turas Nua is \"Together we help people on their journey into work and beyond, fulfilling the aspirations not only of those we help but also of their communities and wider society\".  That assistance is delivered through a comprehensive service provided at 40 community-based offices across the south of the country.  We provide a local reach, while maintaining high national quality standards.  Our service focuses on the needs of the persons with whom we work.  They are at the centre of everything we do.  Every person is different and requires a service that is built around his or her needs.<\/p> <p>  I would like to tell the committee about a typical customer journey.  Brian who is from Mallow, County Cork is 45 years old.  He has been unemployed for just over four years.  His background is in the construction industry, but he has not been in sustained employment since the recession hit.  He has been offered short-term jobs in different parts of the country, which would mean he would have to travel away from his young family.  He has experienced regular periods of sustained illness in recent years.  He wanted a long-term job, but when he was looking for employment in other sectors, he was simply getting nowhere.<\/p><p>He received a Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection notice inviting him to attend an information session to explain how the JobPath service would work for him.  This letter as followed up by a call from one of our contact centre agents to offer Brian an opportunity to have any queries about the service answered and to confirm his attendance. <\/p><p> At the information session, representative of the Department and a member of Turas Nua outlined the purpose of JobPath, giving Brian details about the service and the guidance available.  Immediately after that session he was introduced to his personal adviser.  Brian told his adviser about his employment history and his career goals.  In turn, the personal adviser told him about the information and support he could expect to receive.  He was also told about the travel expenses we provide to cover public transport costs in attending required meetings at Turas Nua.  Brian then discussed his desired job goals, which were in general construction or plastering.  He also mentioned that he had worked in a shop as a teenager, and might be willing to consider a retail role.  He wanted to avoid travelling too far from home or being away from his family overnight.  We then took Brian through our unique diagnostic tool, catalyst.  Catalyst measures a person's perception of their circumstances, and is a special offering provided by Turas Nua.  It captures both objective and subjective information and identifies barriers and potential solutions, while measuring the personal distance travelled over time. <\/p><p> Brian's full assessment helped build a holistic view of his situation, including information on his qualifications, work experience, existing skills and barriers to employment, as well as his ambitions.  His personal progression plan was then updated to include his goals and the agreed actions required to help him on his journey towards sustainable employment.  Additional appointments were arranged and the plan was then printed and signed by both Brian and his adviser to illustrate their mutual commitment.  Brian was given a copy to take home.  Over the following weeks, Brian worked with his adviser to create a professional-quality CV.  The catalyst analysis had highlighted Brian's poor motivation levels.  A weakness in his basic IT skills had reduced his confidence, while his illness had impacted on his ability to hold down a strenuous job.  Initially, Brian's focus was on construction work.  Often, Turas Nua helps candidates in this area to update their skills and qualifications, for example by providing a safe pass certificate.  During his meetings with this adviser however, it became clear that Brian had other barriers to address before being ready to take up a physically demanding role.  Brian's personal progression plan was amended to incorporate his participation in some employability training through our workit training suite.  This involved a number of courses addressing Brian's motivation and helping him to learn about identifying and unitising transferable skills.  He was among the 48,000 participants in a workit training course last year.  In fact, there are 38 short courses on offer from Turas Nua-qualified tutors.  <\/p><p> Over time, Brian realised that construction was no longer his primary goal, so other options were discussed with his adviser.  As Brian's needs evolved, we adapted our service and helped him to amend his individual personal progression plan to take new career goals into account.  He then attended our offices twice a week to complete a basic IT skills course.  After 13 weeks Brian undertook a full review of his plan.  The second catalyst assessment highlighted the great strides he had made and his growth since his first appointment.  A meeting was arranged with a local Turas Nua employer services consultant to discuss some employment opportunities in Brian's area.  The consultant informed Brian about the relationship that had been developed with a local hardware shop which was looking for in-store sales agents.  That store is just one of the 14,000 businesses that Turas Nua works with, ranging from large companies to small, independent local businesses.  This role immediately appealed to Brian.  He was invited to attend retail training in our Cork office to learn some of the key skills.  When this was complete, our consultant arranged for some mock interview preparation, another core part of our service.  Brian was then encouraged to update his CV to bring his retail experience and transferable skills, such as customer service, to the fore before the formal application was submitted.  <\/p><p> The owner of the hardware shop was immediately interested in Brian's application and lined up an interview, with a meeting taking place in our Mallow office as his shop floor did not have any suitable space.  All our offices regularly accommodate employers who are undertaking job interviews with candidates.  Brian impressed the owner with his enthusiasm, his knowledge of the construction industry and his practical DIY know-how.  He was offered an initial three-month contract pending his obtaining a manual handling certificate.  This training was arranged by Turas Nua, and we also advised the store owner on how to apply for the JobsPlus grant.  Brian started his new job and his personal adviser maintained regular contact.  It soon became clear that Brian was progressing well in his new role, and we were delighted to learn through our in-work support service that after the initial three months the store owner had offered Brian a permanent role.  Brian's progress has not stopped there.  He recently began some advanced training, learning about stock-keeping and basic book-keeping.<\/p><p> Brian's story is just one example of how Turas Nua works with thousands of people every day.<\/p><p>It is evident how much our support means to people.  We receive dozens of \"thank you\" cards every week.  We are delighted that 34% of the people who have the completed JobPath programme with Turas Nua have attained a job.  To date, some 70% of the people who progress beyond 13 weeks maintain employment for a full year.  We have placed almost 19,000 people in jobs across a range of sectors and industries.  We are pleased to note independent research that indicates that 82% of the people with whom we worked in 2017 were satisfied with our service.  Proactive engagement with the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, other stakeholders and our regular customer listening groups backs up the high levels of satisfaction.  Our success is due to the hard work, dedication and professionalism of the 330 people who work for Turas Nua in 40 offices in 13 counties.  We have diverse teams that are doing outstanding work with people from all strands of society who are seeking our help to move into work.  Our employees receive significant in-house training when they join our team, gaining skills and extensive expertise.  Further growth is delivered through continuous professional development training.  A total of 14% of our workforce were hired from the live register.<\/p><p> A key strength of Turas Nua is localised delivery via our 40 offices.  We have provided in the written submission to the committee county by county details of the work we undertake.  It is worth noting the spread and scale of our service provision.  For example, in County Cork we employ 64 people who are working with over 4,000 customers and almost 2,400 employers.  These staff are based in ten offices across the county.  In County Limerick in which we employ 30 staff we have offices in the city and Newcastle West.  The headquarters is located in Roscrea, County Tipperary, in which we employ 69 people in five offices.  We have extensive operations across the south east, in counties Kildare and Wicklow, as well as across the south midlands.  As I said, we employ 330 staff in 40 offices nationally.  We are working with over 23,000 unemployed persons and have developed relationships with over 14,000 employers.<\/p><p> In recent years we have welcomed many public representatives to our offices to witness our facilities and services for themselves.  We would be delighted to arrange visits for members of the committee and other Deputies, Senators and local public representatives.  We would welcome the opportunity to show public representatives the excellent work being done in their localities.<\/p><p> All aspects of our work revolve around people.  They include the tens of thousands we have helped to upskill and find jobs; the hundreds we have employed; the thousands of employers and business owners we have helped to fill roles; and the countless families and communities who have benefited from the services we provide.  This experience has shown us just how important JobPath is.  Its impact is being felt at the most local level possible in reaching individuals, their families, employers and communities.  We consider it to be a substantial achievement to have established our comprehensive service within such a short timeframe and that process has involved no upfront cost to the taxpayer.  Our high quality service offers great economic value, while making a real difference.  We look forward to continuing to deliver the JobPath programme across 13 counties and help over 1,000 people per month to find jobs.  <\/p><p> We thank the committee for giving us the opportunity to make our presentation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#J00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colin Donnery","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1063,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Donnery.

I am a director of Seetec and before the committee with my colleague, Mr. Karl Milne, who is operations director for Dublin.  I was involved in the original tendering exercise, as well as being responsible at board level for our operations in Ireland.  Mr. Milne has worked with Seetec since the beginning of the contract.<\/p> <p>  Seetec Employment and Skills Ireland delivers the JobPath programme in the top part of the country, including Dublin, through a network which encompasses 54 locations, of which a total of 17 are operated by our subcontractors.  The group comprises five Irish organisations selected for their skills, expertise and ability to work within the community.<\/p> <p>  One objective of JobPath was to build additional capacity in the market.  This was one of the reasons we decided to deliver our contract using both direct and subcontracted delivery.  We have made a significant investment in setting up our office infrastructure, information technology solutions, outreach services in rural locations, subcontractors and building our establishment.  We employ 246 people directly and 80 through our subcontractors.  Our employees come from a wide range of backgrounds, but they all share the same purpose - to make an impact on the lives of our clients.<\/p> <p>  Seetec was established in 1984 in the United Kingdom as a private public partnership.<\/p><p>Since then it is has grown into one of the leading providers of high-quality skills, employment and justice services to thousands of individuals and businesses every year.  While it is a private company, the work we tender for is built around improving lives and communities.  In 2016, we achieved B-Corp status, joining a worldwide community of private sector businesses which focus on social value and the corporate social responsibility agenda.<br\/><br\/>Our approach to service delivery is to be extremely client focused and as flexible as possible.  Commissioned surveys by the Department demonstrate that our overall satisfaction rating has increased from a mean score of 4.09 out of five in 2016 to 4.26 in 2017.  Since the start of the service, we have only had 204 complaints.  To put this in context, that is less than one quarter of 1% of the total number of individuals who have started their JobPath journey with us.  While we appreciate that not every individual will welcome being referred to JobPath and there are occasions where a client has an issue with the service, we use this feedback to continually improve our delivery.  We are very proud of the quality of service that our staff deliver.<br\/><br\/>We are exceeding our contractual performance targets and our approach of right job, first time ensures we work with individuals to ensure the right job match resulting in sustainable jobs.  Our clients reflect a wide range of experiences of unemployment from those who have never worked to those who are qualified and highly skilled.  More than 40% of our referred client base has been unemployed for between two and five years.  Another 24%, however, have been unemployed for between six and ten years.  Unsurprisingly, our client base is relatively mature with more than a quarter of our clients over the age of 50.  Many come to us with low expectations and poor experience of the labour market.  One client from the west told us on day one that we had no hope of finding him a job.  He is now working successfully in sales in a car dealership.<br\/><br\/>These are the kind of success stories that drive our teams.  In talking to our clients to date, they aspire to work in a range of sectors from construction and trades, to catering and hospitality, healthcare and retail, as well as roles in professional services, tech, IT and the pharma and life sciences sectors.  These generally reflect previous working experience and a desire to re-enter the labour market in a similar sector.<br\/><br\/>However, many say to us that, without the intervention and assistance of Seetec and JobPath, they would not have had the confidence to pursue the role in which they are now.  We have delivered or facilitated more than 200,000 training interventions for our clients.  These include workshops delivered in our centres, further education or training through the education and training boards across our contract area, as well as other State-funded or private training purchased by us linked to clients specific job goals.  This ranges from Safe Pass for those wanting to work in construction to more specific training like Java programming which are all linked to a particular job opportunity.<br\/><br\/>Our work would not be possible without partnerships.  We have sought to build links with a range of organisations which support and engage with our clients in the communities in which we operate.  One of the most important partnerships is the one with employers.  We have placed individuals with more than 9,000 employers in a wide range of roles in all sectors of the economy, including the top consulting firms, pharmaceutical roles, banks, accountancy firms and public service jobs of all types.  However, the majority are small employers across both rural and urban locations which value the service we provide at no cost to them.  These small employers have limited time and in some cases expertise in recruiting employees.  Employers tell us they value the pre-employment training which we organise and that our service is fast and responsive.  Many comment on the fact that we are paid by results as something they welcome.  They know we want to ensure our clients are a good match for the role and are better prepared for the transition into sustained employment.<br\/><br\/>This is a sentiment mirrored by the Labour Market Council which stated:<\/p><blockquote>We need a labour market activation strategy that is flexible, that is seen to mirror the needs of employers and job seekers and can respond to challenges in periods of economic difficultly, as well as exploit opportunities in periods of economic recovery.<\/blockquote><p>Before I conclude, I want to tell the committee about two clients with whom we have worked.  The first client had left school before his leaving certificate.  When he came to us, he had no experience of the workplace.  He was smart and loved computers but had low confidence.  His adviser encouraged him and gradually built his confidence.  She worked with him on his CV until he was more confident in sending it to employers.  Based on his interests and capability, she suggested he apply for a technical support role with a major international company.<\/p><p>With support from our employer services team, he completed the online application process and although a leaving certificate qualification was required for the role, our intervention secured him his first ever interview.  With intensive support in his interview preparation and some financial support to buy new interview clothes, he was successful and was offered his first job.  He sustained 12 months' employment and was promoted to a supervisory position.  He remains in employment with this company today.<\/p><p> A 44 year old client in the midlands who had been out of work for four years told us he was \"mad to work\" but he thought employers wanted a younger man.  He had many years of groundswork experience and a great attitude but no information technology, IT, skills.  This impacted on his job search capability.  He also lacked self-confidence due to his period of unemployment.  We worked with him, increasing his confidence and improving his basic IT skills.  We carried out mock interviews and supported him in contacting employers.  He was delighted to be offered a position.  We provided him with Safe Pass and manual handling training and purchased new workwear for him.  The client stated he was thankful for the time we spent with the new employee who is working as a general construction operative.<\/p><p> These two clients are very different but their experience is very similar.  Both wanted to work but felt unable to achieve this objective on their own.  Our team empowered and supported them to address their barriers to work and reach their personal goals.<\/p><p> Based on our experience here and in the United Kingdom, we believe the Department has used learnings from other international models to develop a contract that delivers value for clients, employers and the taxpayer.  Payment by results contracts transfer risk to the private sector, create flexibility and capacity through the economic cycle and encourage contractors to invest and innovate to deliver results in the most efficient and effective way.  Most important, they boost the chances of the hardest to help finding employment.<\/p><p> The JobPath contract is constructed with the client at the centre and in a way in which we, the contractors, are accountable for delivering quality performance.  We welcome the econometric review in progress.<\/p><p> The employment market has changed significantly since JobPath was first introduced, and we are approaching levels of employment that would not have been contemplated a few short years ago.  This does not mean, however, that the need for a range of labour market activation services disappears.  Beneath the headline figures, we see some real gaps and areas of need emerging and we have an opportunity with the capacity and expertise that has been built to impact on the lives of more individuals and the communities in which they live.  These are the people we must not leave behind.<\/p><p> We look forward to building on the work we have done, impacting on the lives of people in some of the most rural communities in Ireland and making a difference to people&rsquo;s lives by supporting them into quality, sustainable work.  I sincerely thank members for their time and I will be pleased to answer any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Alison Bunney","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1067,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Bunney and the other witnesses for their opening statements.

Mr. McKeon stated there was a need to ratchet up the number of staff in the Department to deal with high levels of unemployment.  We have heard this argument time and again.  Did the Department discuss with organisations providing employment schemes then and now whether they had the capacity to upscale, either from their own resources or with limited additional resources and funding from the Department?<\/p><p> On the term long-term unemployed, there seems to be a good deal of confusion about that term.  Can Mr. McKeon define it?  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures indicate that in January, 65,000 people were determined as long-term unemployed.  In July 2017, some 73,122 people were referred to JobPath.  In his opening statement, Mr. McKeon said the scheme was specifically devised to deal long-term unemployed people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#N00300","speaker":"1252","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1070,"content":"<p>Does the Deputy want Mr. McKeon to address those questions now?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#O00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1071,"content":"<p>If he wants to come back in, yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#O00300","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525778100,"counter":1072,"content":"<p>When we were developing JobPath, we looked at the existing capacity, particularly whether we could ramp up the Intreo service, but it was not feasible to do that.  There are consequences from ramping it up in that, generally, it becomes a fixed cost which we cannot wind back when we come into a boom period.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the other constraint on us, we spoke to other providers.  We had three or four fora to which we invited the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, and others to come in to talk to us.  We have separate meetings with the ILDN.  Some ILDN and LES companies tendered for the contract but one of the constraints was that because of the scale of this procurement, it had to be done under European Union procurement rules.  There was no option to simply expand.  We have to remember that the local employment services, which I presume the Deputy is talking about, are private limited companies.  We are talking about a contract where we are spending &euro;50 million a year.  We simply could not spend that type of money without going through the EU procurement process.  However, we did speak to the ILDN and the local employment services.  We canvassed our views on what the contract should look like.  We had Enterprise Ireland support capacity building workshops for them so that they would be in a position to compete.  All of that was done, and some of them did compete.  That is the position on that.<\/p> <p>  On the long-term unemployed, the definition of long-term unemployed is someone who has been unemployed more than 12 months.  The number of people who are long-term unemployed on the live register differs from that in the quarterly national household survey, QNHS, formerly the labour force survey.  The QNHS asks people about their perception of the duration of time they have been unemployed and that might be different from the amount of time we have been paying them.  It also differs in that not everybody who is on the live register would be counted on the QNHS.  For example, we count people in part-time work on the live register but they are not counted on the QNHS.<\/p> <p>  At this point in time we have 92,000 or 93,000 long-term unemployed people on the live register.  In addition to that, we have 30,000 to 35,000 people who are on programmes such as community employment, CE, T&uacute;s and so on.  In aggregate, therefore, the number is approximately-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#O00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1073,"content":"<p>I am conscious that I am limited on time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#O00500","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1074,"content":"<p>Yes, you are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#O00600","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1075,"content":"<p>Regarding local employment services, LES, Mr. McKeon said some of those companies were spoken to.

In 2017, that number reduced to just below 18,500.  That contradicts evidence Mr. McKeon gave in his opening statement that there has been no impact whatsoever on LES since the formation of JobPath.  The figures show clearly that there has been an impact.  I will give Mr. McKeon an opportunity shortly to answer that point.<\/p> <p>  While I am dealing with the LES, there was a constant thread throughout the statements that both providers - Seetec and Turas Nua - had exceeded the performance targets that had been laid down.  For the record, will Mr. McKeon state what were those targets?  Was it 14%?  What is the performance target for LES?<\/p><p>I will talk about the local employment services first.  I said in my opening statement that we have not reduced the number of employment mediators we pay for in the local employment services.  We have not reduced our payments to the local employment service.  I was very specific and clear that we have reduced the number of clients referred to local employment services.  This is good because, prior to JobPath, we had local employment services that were operating with caseloads of 500 jobseekers to one mediator and, in some cases, over 1,000 jobseekers to one mediator.  That is not a sustainable caseload.  Internationally, when the caseload exceeds 200:1, people raise their eyebrows.  I had to sit in rooms with representatives from the OECD, European Commission, troika and other bodies and I was challenged very strongly on why we operate with such extraordinarily high caseloads.  I was told we had to get the ratio to under 200:1.  For long-time unemployed jobseekers, the target and upper limit is generally agreed as being 120:1.  In Germany, they operate with a ratio of 60:1.  In the Netherlands, the ratio is 80:1.  We are currently operating with a ratio of 120:1.  We do it through the local employment services and JobPath.  We would not have been able to reduce the caseloads in the local employment services if the capacity for JobPath was not available.

As such, it was never considered by the court.  The Department's policy is that only it can determine whether a person's payment can be cut.  The process is that if Turas Nua, Seetec, a local employment service, a community employment scheme or our own Intreo staff find a jobseeker is not engaging with the process, the matter is referred to a deciding officer in the Department.  The deciding officer calls the individual in, has a conversation with him or her and provides a verbal warning.  If he or she does not respond to that warning, he or she is given a written warning.  If, after a written warning, he or she does not comply with the service, he or she will then have a reduced rate of payment.  In doing that, the deciding officer will assess whether it is a case of genuine non-compliance.  It is not the case that every jobseeker referred to the Department by an Intreo or JobPath case officer will have a penalty or reduced rate of payment imposed.  The deciding officer will form a view.  If someone has not signed a personal progression plan but the evidence is that he or she is turning up for meetings and engaging in CV courses and mock interviews, a reduced rate will not apply.  A reduced rate can always be lifted as soon as someone starts to comply, which is important.  We noted in our supplementary information that the penalty rate among JobPath clients is approximately 0.6%, which is exactly the same as the penalty rate among Intreo clients who are not with JobPath.

In respect of long-term training, we would work with education and training boards, ETBs, for instance, to put people into long-term training.  We have what is called a stop the clock measure.  People can go into training for up to six months and can then come back to us and work with us further.  They may find a job while in that training or they can come back to us and we can work with them for the duration.  Ultimately, to get back to precarious jobs, there is no point in us putting people into precarious jobs.  We need to sustain people in jobs.  That is the way JobPath is set up and that is what we endeavour to do.  We try to build on the jobseeker's skills, traits and abilities.

I noticed in the presentation from Seetec that it is mentioned that 40% of its customers or clients have been unemployed for between two and five years, 24% between six and ten years.  Are we then to understand that 36% of Seetec's clients are not in that two to ten year period of unemployment?<\/p><p>Are we to understand that 36% have been unemployed for less than two years?  Is that the case?  Perhaps the same question could be answered by Turas Nua.  We have had increasing reports of persons who are very new to the live register, to jobseeker's allowance, for example, persons who may have come out of periods of caring and elsewhere, who find themselves being referred very early to JobPath.  That is something the Department could answer, with regard to increasing referrals from those who are not in the long-term unemployed bracket.<\/p><p> Will the witnesses clarify the random selection?  There is a real concern about the suitable measures.  Will the witnesses deal with that question about whether people are randomly selected and about the referrals back?  This is the procurement section of my questions.<\/p><p> To follow up with Mr. McKeon, we are not speaking about job creation or clients served.  Neither of those metrics might be the correct metric.  I suggest that the correct metric in a jobseeking service might be considered to be the numbers of jobs found.  I do not think anybody was suggesting that jobs need to be created but jobs need to be found.  Is it still the case, as was suggested at a previous meeting, that we are looking at approximately &euro;13,000 per job found as opposed to per client served or job created?<\/p><p> The issue of flexibility was put forward as a key rationale for taking this route at a particular time.  Is there perhaps a danger for flexibility, that when we tie into a contract which requires us to refer 60,000 cases a year, or 240,000, that we may be looking at a lack of flexibility?  For example, it could be that local employment services and others, perhaps even tailored and specific services, are not getting the referrals because there is an obligation to ensure 60,000 clients move through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#X01700","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1221,"content":"<p>Allow the witnesses to address-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#Y00200","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1222,"content":"<p>I will.

We have heard repeatedly about brilliant pilot schemes which have not been scaled up, but it seems that the decision was to scale this up very substantially and quickly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#Y00300","speaker":"1405"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525778100,"counter":1223,"content":"<p>On the long-term unemployed, we do not refer anybody to JobPath who does not have a duration of 12 months on the live register.  We just do not.  It does not happen.  There will be and are clients on other schemes.  For example, they might be on another scheme and then go on to the live register.  We have always counted them.  For example, if they want access to the back to work enterprise allowance or back to education allowance, there are 12 month conditionalities around those.  Those conditionalities already existed.  The duration was counted for those schemes and is counted for JobPath too, which is of benefit to the people concerned.<\/p> <p>  I would maybe challenge the thinking on it.  The implication is that they should not have to go because they are not at 12 months.  For most people, overwhelmingly, it is a positive experience and the outcomes are positive.  The Senator needs to think about that.<\/p> <p>  On the random nature, we do the random selection.  We do it from our IT systems and it is entirely random.  That is the situation.  We have a mix of clients in six different cohorts, of one to two years unemployed, two to three, three to four and so on.  We have to make sure that when it is picked, it is reflective of the overall live register, but within each cohort it is entirely random.<\/p> <p>  I might ask Mr. Christopher Kane to take the question on flexibility.  The Senator referred to the question of the correct metric.  The correct metric, from my perspective, is whether going on JobPath results in improved employment outcomes for people.  Overwhelmingly, the evidence is yes.  There is a 59% higher chance of being in employment where a person who has been unemployed for more than three years has been on JobPath compared with him or her not having been on JobPath.  That is the most important metric.  If the Senator wants to divide that by a cost, she can do that, but then that needs to be done like for like.  What is the equivalent metric for the local employment service or for the Intreo service?  Around the world, the metric used is the cost per client served because there is recognition of the value of employment advice, personal progression planning and so on.<\/p><p>The primary objective is to move into employment but it is of benefit to that in moving somebody further along a continuum.  That might be a continuum into community employment or some other scheme.  Around the world, it is the cost per client served.  I am quite happy that people want to construct another.  Let us do it across all our services.  That is what I would say.<\/p><p> On exclusion in the procurement guidelines for health and social services, all I can do is repeat what I said earlier.  In procurement of this scale, a contract of &euro;50 million or more a year requires procurement.  My understanding and our interpretation of the EU procurement rules is that it is absolutely essential.  Leaving that aside for a moment, I have to go into the Committee of Public Accounts and account for spend.  The Committee of Public Accounts would challenge me very strongly if I signed off on a contract of &euro;50 million a year where there was no tendering involved.  It would correctly challenge me very strongly.  The best practice for procurement is to tender.  The exceptions are exceptions from best practice, not the rule to be applied for certain services.  It is not a case of saying that we like a group, so let us not try to discommode it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#Y00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1225,"content":"<p>I do not think that is what has been suggested.

I will follow up on personal progression plans, which have been raised, perhaps with the two companies that are here.  It is important that we are clear that personal progression plans are not the same if it is in Intreo or if it is a public service that has been signed and it is a private company.  We know that people have objected to signing.  It was perhaps misleading to say that there was no judgment found.  No judgment was found because the case was reassessed and the person no longer had a penalty applied.  It was recognised as a mistake in the assessment by the Department.  There is that clarity around personal progression plans and people's rights to not necessarily agree to them.  That is where the random issue comes in.  There is a question of data protection and people's private data being transferred from the Department to a company.  Does there need to be a clear point of permission relating to that?  How is that managed?  What if somebody says that he or she chooses to be in the public service rather than not?  We know that biometric data are moved back and forth.  There is a situation, in the context that the Department has put out, where photographs and things such as previous history of disability payment, if people are moving off it, are looked at.  What I mentioned is a real concern.  Mr. McKeon mentioned those on long-term payments.  The case I heard, for example, was somebody who was a caregiver.  Somebody who had been in a caregiving situation was very keen to move back to education and restart their life, but found themselves selected and thrown into JobPath very soon after leaving caregiving because the person they were caring for had died.  There is a question about exit routes.  I know Mr. McKeon has mentioned the community employment, CE, scheme but none of the presentations here has mentioned education or activation into education.  The six month stopping of the clock does not allow for persons to choose to enter a long-term route out of unemployment into education.<\/p> <p>  I have specific questions on education for the organisations but my other question relates to personal progression plans.  How much of it is standard text?<\/p><p>Does it still include standard text that requires people to share information about the circumstances or situation of their family members or the people with whom they live? Does it still include standard text asking people to share information about an employer they may find, separate to Turas Nua, and for permission to contact that employer? We were told that people could take the personal progression plan home with them.  Is it clear that people can take the personal progression plan, the PPP, home with them to seek advice on it before agreeing to sign it?  What is the Turas Nua mechanism if a person is not willing to sign it but seems interested?  Is there a protocol for moving a person back into the Intreo system in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#Z00900","speaker":"1405","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1234,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator.

We hear the hard stories.  The Senator must look at the overwhelming evidence in the customer satisfaction survey included in the data pack we forwarded to the committee.  Just 4% of the people who had used the service had a problem with their personal progression plan.  When clients were asked to score the effectiveness and value of their personal progression plan, it scored 4.57 on a scale of zero to five.  Therefore, we have to be really careful about throwing the baby out with the bath water.  In every OECD country that has employment counselling, personal assistance, Intreo, local employment service network and community employment schemes a personal progression plan or a variant of it is a key part of the client journey.  During that process advisers will ask a person about his or her personal circumstances because it helps to identify what the barriers to employment are and to get an holistic view.  It is a good, not a bad, thing to do.  If people do not want to provide the information, they do not have to do so, but that does not mean that the question should not be asked.  It will, however, help to inform a good personal progression plan.<\/p> <p>  A question was asked about data.  JobPath providers are agents of the Minister, in the same way that our branch office and local employment service staff are her agents.  The data they collect are the Department's data which they hold while clients are with them.  At the end of the process they come to us and we own them.  We have a data protection agreement with the two providers which has been drafted to ensure they will meet all data compliance requirements.  It has been audited by two individual firms who have given it a clean bill of health.  The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner has conducted two audits of each company and I understand given them a clean bill of health.

First, it was a specific requirement of the contract that the providers recruit at least 10% of their staff from the long-term live register.  Known as a social clause in a contract, this practice is permissible.  While other things being suggested are not permissible, the social clause element is permissible and we insisted on it.  The providers must comply with this clause.<\/p> <p>  Second, the payment rates to contractors are contingent on them hitting performance targets.  The performance target we set was to achieve 60% above what was then the counterfactual level of approximately 8% of long-term unemployed persons moving into employment in a 12 month period.  We set a target of 14%, as it was 60% higher than the counterfactual level.  The reason we set such a high uplift was we knew that in the case of some of those who would move into employment, it would not be directly as a result of JobPath intervention.  The uplift has been applied for this reason.  It also captures the issue about which the Deputy is concerned, that is, the provider must hit the 60% target if it is to be paid.  While some of those accounted for in the 60% uplift figure will be people the providers recruited, many of them are not included in this figure.  That is the way in which we try to control it.  It would be very strange if were to ask Mr. Donnery of Turas Nua or anyone in Seetec to try to get local shops and businesses to recruit people from the live register, while directing that they should not, under any circumstance, recruit their own staff from this cohort.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#CC01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1276,"content":"<p>I fully understand that.

The first is that the work of an employment counsellor, whether with Intreo or JobPath, is to advise people on how to draft a CV, conduct a job search and do interviews.  If they subsequently use those skills to secure employment, that is great and it is not something we should be concerned about.  Distinguishing between people who are able to do that before they go on JobPath or because they were on the scheme is difficult.  It is not the case that only jobs where a JobPath provider says employer A is looking for someone are counted.  We have built that into our contract design because we knew 8.6% of people would secure employment anyway.  That is why we set a target of 60% and the pricing was based on hitting that.  However, it includes all jobs; it does not only include the uplift.  The contract design and the pricing, therefore, accounts for what one might think is dead weight.  It accounts for the people who would have got a job anyway.  If we only focused on those who would not have got a job, the pricing would have been higher.  We have captured that in the pricing model.<\/p> <p>  Parking and creaming was one of the big concerns that came up during the consultative process.  This concern applies to all activation services, including Intreo and LES.  Case workers by their nature want to work with people who want to be worked with and they try to keep those who do not want to be worked with or who are more difficult away.  It applies, therefore, to contracted and non-contracted services.  In the contracted space, we try to manage this.  I do not say it is perfect.  Nothing is perfect but we have done our best.  We are the only people who get the select referrals.  The JobPath providers have no say in who they get to work with.  Different pricing levels are set for people, depending on their level of duration, which is a proxy for the people who are more difficult to find a job for and those for whom it is easier to find one.  Incentives are built in to work with the more difficult unemployed cases.<\/p> <p>  There are also customer satisfaction surveys.  If we get feedback from customers that they are not meeting satisfactory scores, there are payment penalties.  We track that the personal progression plans are in place and that all the milestones are being hit in the engagement with the employers in our IT systems and, therefore, we know the individuals are being worked with.  I do not know if people are trying to game this at the fringes but we have done our best and we could not have done better.  It is notable that other public employment services are copying what we have done.  Officials from a number of foreign services have come to Ireland because they heard about this and they said we had done it better than elsewhere.  I am not trying to blow our own trumpet but we have done what we can to address it.<\/p> <p>  With regards to returning to the Intreo system, all the data come back when the person comes back.  If somebody wants to go into education rather than JobPath, once he or she is selected for JobPath, the policy is he or she must work with the JobPath adviser and he or she is must stay with JobPath for the next 12 months.  That does not exclude exceptions from time to time but they are not the norm and we do not want to create a situation where they become the norm.  Employment outcomes from job search assistance and employment advice are superior to employment outcomes from education.

I do not approach this with a certain view; I ask what the data say and I am relating that to the Senator.  There are problems and challenges with Intreo, JobPath and LES.  None of us is, or ever will be, perfect.<\/p><p>One has to look at what the overwhelming data say both in terms of the performance outcomes that we published and made available to the committee and customer satisfaction.  For example, we have spent a great deal of time discussing personal progression plans at the meeting.  We ask people to what extent they agree with the statement that their personal adviser helped them to develop their personal progression plan to set goals and focus on a job.  Only 4% disagreed with the statement.  When they were asked to rate their plan using a scoring system of zero to five, the average score was 4.57.  We have to examine the data.  I appeal to the committee to do that.  It is easy to take anecdotes and stories and try to design the general out of the exception.  By and large, the stories I hear are the exception, not the general, and we have to be careful in how we apply ourselves to the data.  If we are serious about evidence-based policy, we have to use the evidence.  From day one on this project, we have produced voluminous evidence and we have published voluminous research.  Nobody has challenged the research or the data but what I have heard is stories.  Do we make policy based on stories or on evidence?  I submit that we must make it based on the evidence.  The evidence in this respect is strong.  If there are cases where JobPath employers do not live up to the standard, I will not refrain from killing them.  If they are not doing what they are meant to do - one Deputy mentioned fraud and so on - I will not stand for it as a civil servant.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#EE00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1291,"content":"<p>Have any cases been brought to Mr. McKeon's attention?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#FF00200","speaker":"1252"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525778100,"counter":1292,"content":"<p>No.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McKeon"},{"type":"speech","time":1525778100,"counter":1293,"content":"<p>We must conclude but I would like to afford the two company representatives an opportunity to comment as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/SPJ2018050800002#FF00400","speaker":"1298"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525778100,"counter":1294,"content":"<p>I echo the Secretary General's remarks, particularly in respect of the construction of the contract.
