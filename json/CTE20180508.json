I am joined by my colleague, Jenny Foley, solicitor and clinical claims manager, and we will be happy to answers members' questions shortly.<\/p> <p>  It is important that I set out the details of the agency's role in the Vicky Phelan case.  This is clearly a tragic case that has had dreadful consequences for Ms Phelan and her family.  I assure the committee that at every stage of our involvement in this case, we have been acutely aware of the consequences, trauma and pain Ms Phelan and her family have suffered and continue to suffer.  In carrying out our statutory role in managing this case, we have been mindful of the need to ensure that, wherever possible, nothing that we did would add to the suffering of Ms Phelan and her family.<\/p> <p>  In managing personal injury litigation taken by persons against the State, we never forget that our work frequently involves the management of difficult, complex and traumatic cases taken by persons who have suffered injury, sometimes of a catastrophic nature.  We have a duty, when managing personal injury claims, to manage any individual claim in a humane, ethical, professional and sensitive manner.<\/p> <p>  Our role in Ms Phelan's case arose because one of the parties she took a case against was the Health Service Executive, HSE, which is one of our clients.  The HSE was not the only party.  Ms Phelan's case was also against the United States laboratory that had carried out her smear test.  It was called Clinical Pathology Laboratories.  In every case with multiple parties, each party conducts its own defence independently of the other parties.  We managed the case on behalf of the HSE but the US laboratory had separate legal representation and a separate legal strategy.<\/p> <p>  The primary legal issue in this case centred on the alleged misreading of Ms Phelan's original smear test.  The US laboratory accepted that legal liability for that issue rested with it alone and that the HSE was not legally responsible for the misreading.  As part of the US laboratory's defence of this issue, its lawyers sought a confidentiality clause that would have restricted Ms Phelan from disclosing details of the settlement or the case.  The State Claims Agency opposed the use of a confidentiality clause in Ms Phelan's case and no such request was made by our agency.  The request by the US laboratory was not supported by the agency.  Our view is that the US laboratory's insistence on a confidentiality clause was a significant factor in the failure to resolve the claim through mediation.  Mediation is our preferred route for resolving cases of this nature as it would have eliminated the need for court hearings or a contested court action.  A settlement, consequent upon mediation, would have made it unnecessary for Ms Phelan to go to court, personally give evidence and experience all the stress and anxiety that a court hearing entails.<\/p> <p>  A total of 98% of all cases managed by our agency are resolved without the need for a contested court hearing.  It was not possible to resolve this case through mediation, but that was for reasons outside our control, and I have referred to those reasons.<\/p> <p>  I would like to make a number of points about the way we manage cases.  I am conscious that the committee asked us here today specifically to discuss this issue.  In Ms Phelan's case, it has not been reported by the media generally that the presiding judge, Mr. Justice Cross, praised the manner in which the case was managed by the State Claims Agency and the other parties.  While some cases can take up to between two to three years to be concluded, Ms Phelan's case was settled within ten weeks of the summons being lodged.  The judge said the case was handled in an efficient and humane manner, with all sides pulling out the stops to get the matter ready for hearing quickly.<\/p> <p>  We have heard commentary from some observers in recent days suggesting that the State was in some way trying to place obstacles in the way of settling this case.  The judge's comments, being those of an independent party, demonstrate that the opposite was the case.<\/p> <p>  I will now update the committee on the current number of cases we are managing which are similar to Ms Phelan's case.  In addition to Ms Phelan's now concluded case, we are managing nine other similar cases, and we are aware of one additional case where a formal claim has not yet been made.  We have received an indemnity from the independent laboratories in three of the nine cases to date and we have sought indemnities in all others.  We will manage all of these cases in the same way we managed Ms Phelan's case, namely, carrying out our statutory role by placing a high priority on treating the people who have made the claims, and their families, with the dignity and compassion they deserve.<\/p><p>We have no intention of mounting a full defence in any case of this nature where responsibility is substantially or completely that of the State.  In any such case, we will pursue other options, including mediation or settlement.<\/p><p> We have a statutory duty to act in the best interests of the taxpayer.  We also have a duty, however, towards injured persons who have suffered a medical negligence related injury, including following a misdiagnosis, and who take legal actions against the State or State bodies.  We never lose sight of the fact that in many cases the injured parties, together with the families, have suffered significant trauma and pain.  Recognising this, the agency aims always to act fairly, ethically and with compassion in its dealings with these people and their families as well as in the management of all cases which fall within our remit.<\/p><p> In cases of medical negligence, our policy is to admit liability as soon as the expert medical evidence becomes available to indicate there has been a breach of duty.  The agency takes every step it can to ensure that litigation is handled sensitively to ensure no additional distress is caused to the person who has made the claim or to his or her family.  The agency is required, however, to operate in accordance with its statutory mandate to investigate claims thoroughly and to manage litigation in a professional manner.  I am not suggesting to the committee that it is an easy task to get this balance right when carrying out our statutory role, knowing the often devastating personal consequences for persons who have suffered injury, nor would I suggest that we always get this balance right to the satisfaction of all the parties in the case.  However, we make every effort to do so.  I hope the facts, such as those put on the court record by Mr. Justice Kevin Cross in Ms Phelan's case and by the same judge in two other cases last week bear this out.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018050800002#A00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Breen and Ms Foley to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Vicky Phelan is a neighbour of mine.

We indicated that in the absence of malice, the claim would not be made out.

When it became known that there was an incorrect reading of a smear test in 2014 and which was not given to Ms Phelan until 2017, three years later, surely at best it was gross incompetence.  Mr. Breen is speaking about the whole issue of intent.  Surely, as the officer charged with legally advising the HSE, Mr. Breen should have said on the issue of non-disclosure - that is the key issue here - a wrong was done.  At that stage Mr. Breen should have been advising the State to accept liability.  Furthermore, he should have ensured the State Claims Agency and the laboratory in America, CPL, Clinical Pathology Laboratories Inc., accepted liability, offered a settlement to the Vicky Phelan and not have dragged her through court for four days.  Instead, she was dragged through the court and had to put her condition in the public domain.  It was offensive to the public and grossly unfair to Vicky Phelan and her family.  As the chief legal officer advising the State, Mr. Breen should have said on non-disclosure that we accepted legal liability.  It should not have happened.  Instead, it resulted in Vicky Phelan being told at the end of 2017 of the difficulty she has with her health.  This would not have arisen if she had been told of the incorrect smear in 2014.<\/p> <p>  When I read this opening statement, the State Claims Agency still does not appear to be admitting that the issue of non-disclosure was culpability on the part of the HSE.  Vicky Phelan is an incredible woman.  She came out when she was not well and stood up for women and the truth.  We still have the situation, however, whereby Mr. Breen is advising the State, the HSE and the Minister for Health, that the issue of non-disclosure was something for which the State should not accept liability.

We are aware that if some of the women who are now unfortunately deceased had been aware in 2014 that there was a misdiagnosis and had been informed at the time that they had options for treatment, then the outcomes could have been different.  They could have taken part in clinical experiments and so on.  Does Mr. Breen not think that has value in itself?

That is the point.  All due attention is given after the summons is served but prior to that, for example in asking for information from the HSE, not all the files are provided.  In fact, I heard a solicitor say on the radio the other day that it is only when a legal firm representing the client goes to the HSE that the full disclosure will be made.  I find that quite shocking, and it annoys me that it would be the case.  In other cases the HSE was asked for the reports and files and it was provided with pages missing and then when it came to the stage leading to the court case the missing pages miraculously appeared on the files of the other side.  The impression I get from talking to a number of people who have been through the system with the SCA is that they find it frustrating and hugely costly.<\/p> <p>  One individual told me he had to put up &euro;100,000 to be able to take part in the game, and to fight for his case, and that it dragged on for years.  The messages that are going out from here are mixed.  Mr. Breen said the agency shows compassion and humanity, yet people on the other side tell us that the State Claims Agency appoints solicitors to represent it and that they find it difficult to deal with the State Claims Agency and those who take cases find it hugely difficult and the process takes years.  In fact, one individual told me that he felt that there was no honesty in the system, that people do not meet face to face and that there is a wall of silence within the HSE, in particular, in relation to these matters.<\/p> <p>  I am just pointing this out because some of the commentary would lead one to believe that everything is hunky dory but it is far from it.  My first question is what Mr. Breen has to say in response to that.  My second question is what he says to the HSE, that has failed to report this and whose own system has failed to flag this.  Will he stand with those affected who will be going through the courts with the American company?  It would seem to me that the original contract was flawed; that it was the case that the Department put it in place to wash its hands of it so that it would not affect it.  I believe the HSE and the State Claims Agency have a role to play.  What assistance will they give to people affected?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018050800002#L02900","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1525782600,"counter":363,"content":"<p>In response to what you said, Chairman, about people finding us difficult, the fact of the matter is that tort law, which is the law that applies to personal injury, is just that - it is adversarial.  That is why, over the years, we have done different things to try to make that better.  One of the things that we did on our own initiative entirely was to bring forward the periodic payment orders, PPO, that we are making for catastrophically injured victims.  We are allowing them to be paid for a period of time so that there will be absolute certainty and that families to not have to worry about money running out.  That was one of the things we did.<\/p> <p>  I personally sat on the medical negligence working group in 2010.  We advocated PPO legislation.  We advocated the pre-action protocol.  If we had the pre-action protocol tomorrow my colleague, Ms Foley, and I believe it would transform the behaviour and the way we handle these cases.<\/p><p>It has been in the UK for a very long time and it stops the adversarial element.  People do not have to issue proceedings.  They simply issue a letter of claim and we would issue a letter in response to that.  The idea is that we narrow down the issues to those that are really between the two parties and then mediate them.  I have advocated for this position for a very long time and despite the fact that the Legal Services Regulation Act has brought that into play, subject to the making of the regulations, we do not have that even now.  It would be of considerable assistance to us if we had that tomorrow.<\/p><p> To come back to the HSE, medical records and the supply of same, when a patient looks for records from a hospital obviously we are not involved.  Therefore, the experience of the patient in that context is one that is beyond the State Claims Agency.  Clearly, if we were asked to furnish a copy of medical records to a plaintiff we would make sure that we are furnishing all of the relevant records.  Plaintiffs' solicitors will say that we are difficult to deal with and I understand that.  They will say that we delay but the one thing that they will not say is that very often, when we try to settle cases at pre-defence stage or prior to a trial, the sums of money they are looking for in settlement of their clients' claims are so overstated that we have no choice in many instances but to go to the steps of the court and sometimes, to trial.  I am reminded of one example where we were asked in a catastrophic injury case to pay &euro;26 million in damages and we ended up paying &euro;13 million after three days of trial.  Clearly we could not pay out &euro;26 million and the plaintiff's solicitor in the circumstances understood that &euro;13 million was the value of the case ultimately.  That is what we face.  It is not that we want to be in court with medical negligence victims.  In fact, as I said previously, if we had the pre-action protocol in place, much of what the Chairman has described in terms of frustrations would be relieved.

We now know that the ten cases involved American laboratories.  We now have a situation where the women are effectively being told that they are dealing with faceless American laboratories whose employers are the HSE, not the individual women.  Based on what has now happened and the fact that there are ten cases, does Mr. Breen believe that settlements will be made out of court?  Alternatively, does he believe that they will drag these women into court, or drag their families, three of the women having lost their lives?<\/p> <p>  The witness mentioned non-disclosure. On reflection, does Mr Breen believe that he is taking a purely legal reading of it rather than looking at it on a moral level?  Take the instance of a case of someone like Vicky Phelan.

What it boils down to is the role that the HSE can play in suing the laboratory and not putting the women through all of the court cases that will emerge out of this.  It is to examine the documentation, the agreements between the HSE and the laboratories, the State Claims Agency's role in all of this, and to try to find a way of protecting the women and getting their rights at the same time rather than have them go to court.  I know this may not be Mr. Breen's area, but it is a point that was made, and I think it is worth considering.  Every effort must now be made by the State to work with the women and ensure that they get what they are entitled to, and not to have protracted court cases with this American company making life difficult and adding further cost in human terms to the individuals and the families concerned.

I will not go through all the various reports.  I reiterate the point made in our earlier Committee Stage discussion.  We are in an ecological crisis with the loss of biodiversity across the country and across the world which requires urgent action.  In effect maintaining the <i>status quo<\/i>is not a viable option; we need to engage in a range of new initiatives to protect wildlife which is being lost at a frightening rate.  I wish we had a Bill before us where all the stakeholders were brought in to consider how we develop our hedgerows, how we make them safe definitely for road users, but also how we use them in a way that promotes good farming practice that protects wildlife, improves tourism amenities and provides structural supports around a field.<\/p><p>Instead we have this very simple and confusing freeing up of the regulations to allow for cutting on the basis of a judgment of someone who owns a field.  We think it will add to further confusion and further threat and stress to Irish wildlife, particularly certain bird species which are still nesting in the hedges in August.  We do not believe that the provision that someone cutting the hedgerow would see if there is a nest would work.  We do not believe the National Parks and Wildlife Service has the resources to police this in any effective way.  The approach is completely wrong.  It should look at a new management strategy for hedgerows rather than weakening existing regulations and adding further confusion to what is a very uncertain system of protecting that ecosystem.<\/p><p>Our amendment is simple in that it replaces the key section in page 12 of the Bill with allowance for regulations giving the local authorities real control.  They would decide if a hedge needed to be cut back for road-safety reasons and would set out the regulations and approach, rather than having a free-for-all which is the direction the Bill proposes.  I ask the Minister to change tack even at this late stage.  We need to be proactive in protecting wildlife, not loosening regulations and allowing for more widespread destruction of habitat, which is the last thing we need to be doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#B00500","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":545,"content":"<p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an gCathaoirleach as an deis labhairt faoin rud seo.  We are probably entering a period where awareness is increasing radically throughout society with regard to what is actually happening to the ecosystem which we all share.  Programmes such as \"Blue Planet\" have really brought to people's attention that the range of species throughout the world is collapsing at a radical rate.  We even see that in our country.  The Minister has mentioned that the objective of the State is the protection of our natural heritage.  However, the protection of our national heritage has not been successful so far.  It is not just me who is saying so.  With every generation the range of species is collapsing and is in freefall.  There is no doubt that we are on the wrong course currently.  We are not passive observers; the Government has a role in this.<\/p> <p>  By reducing the habitat in which species live throughout their lifecycle, we then reduce the opportunity for that species to live.  People have major problems with the Government giving the go-ahead for the physical habitat to be reduced at key periods for these different species.<\/p> <p>  I understand the logic to part of the objective the Government is trying to achieve and I grant that the Government is not doing this out of recklessness.  The Government has regard to road safety concerns and other Deputies will also have road safety issues.  About three months after the Bill had been published I contacted the Road Safety Authority and asked if the Department had contacted it with regard to this road safety issue and was told that had not happened.  I then contacted the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport - one would figure that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport would be partners on this matter - but it had not been contacted about the Bill.  In other words the drafting of the Bill as published had not been done in partnership with the Road Safety Authority, whatever about any contact after that.<\/p> <p>  I believe we can achieve both objectives - the objective of road safety and the objective of ensuring we do not reduce the habitat in which species already under threat exist.  One way to do that is to balance the two objectives, which is what I have sought to do in amendment No. 21.  I have sought to balance the agricultural needs and the safety needs with the environmental needs.<\/p> <p>  I know that some Members who have tabled amendments, including Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, cannot attend this particular meeting.

I was brought up on a farm and was brought up to love animals and love nature, as I do.  No one can ever say otherwise.<\/p><p>I was brought up not to leave animals go hungry and to treat them right at all times.<\/p><p> Some Deputies are complaining that roadside hedges should not be cut because to do so would destroy habitats for nesting birds and so on.  I do not believe that birds are so foolish as to make their nests on the side of a busy road or any road.  They have the entire countryside.  I will not say anything about when hedges inside roadside ditches should be cut.  I have no view on that and have nothing against any proposal on it, but I must make it known that there are narrow roads along which hedges are not being cut.  People cannot walk or cycle safely.  Lives are being put at risk.  Roadside hedges should be kept cut all year round for the safety of people using those roads.  Look at what the prohibition is doing.  It is moving people out past the yellow line on roads that are only 3 m wide.  A number of pedestrians and cyclists are being killed each year.  This is why.  That is the truth.  The other side of the issue is that, because bushes and briars are out on the road, drains are getting blocked and water is flowing down and tearing roads.<\/p><p> I have nothing against birds or the like.  As I stated at our previous meeting, much more damage is being done to ground-nesting birds by animals and birds of prey, for example, magpies, mink and foxes, yet no word at all is being said by members about that or how we might protect those birds.  There is a type of hawk that cleans out every nest.  If, like me, members are interested in and serious about nature, including birds, then that is the route we should be taking.  We could save many more birds.  To claim that our roadside hedges should not be cut is preposterous, though.  I cannot agree with it.  These roads are a part of the infrastructure people need to access their homes, and it is the last inch that makes the difference when an accident happens and someone is killed or seriously hurt while out walking or cycling on a road.  People in cars cannot see as far around bends and accidents occur.  Many farmers cannot get up and down their roads now.  I know of milk lorries and school buses that are having severe difficulties getting around.  That is not fair.  Those people are paying their motor and property taxes, most have their own water supplies and they are costing no one anything.  They only want a road to their doors.  Each and every one of them is entitled to as good a road as people in Dublin 4 have.<\/p><p> Regarding gorse burning, I agree with the extra month that is being added in March.  In some cases, the North allows burning up to 15 April.  Ours is a small country and we should have the same facility.  If gorse is not burned for one or two years, which has happened previously due to bad weather lasting until February, someone somewhere will set it alight anyway.  I am not saying that farmers do that.  In fact, I am trying to support farmers and to have payments returned to them that were wrongfully taken because their lands were burned by fires that started elsewhere.  Neither God nor man could have stopped those fires.  These farmers rang the fire brigade and put their own lives in danger, but they have been left without any payment or the greater part of their payments even though they did not start the fires.  When there is too much gorse, it cannot be controlled.<\/p><p> I plead with members not to undermine what is being done by the Minister.  I support these two aspects of the Bill.  I would like my amendment on cutting roadside hedges all year round to be agreed.  Deputy Ryan referred to how local authorities had the facility to cut hedges all year round where they deemed them unsafe.  I was a member of Kerry County Council for a long time and I highlighted the situation on many roads, but for one reason or another, those dangerous hedges were never cut.  The council barely cut a few junctions.  It may be doing so again shortly.  The dangerous spots on narrow roads are left alone.  The council has the facility to do this, but I cannot explain why it does not.  It does not happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#B00700","speaker":"1320","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":548,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#C00200","speaker":"1235"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":549,"content":"<p>That is why I am supporting the Bill's measures.

There are provisions under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 which oblige landowners to ensure a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on their land is not a hazard to road safety.  In addition, there is a provision which allows a local authority to serve notice on landowners to undertake works such as hedge cutting and clearance for safety purposes along public roads.  These provisions apply all year round.  Accordingly, I cannot consider the Deputy's amendment to be necessary, but I understand his concern about road safety and the difficulties faced by farmers.  However, I am happy that the scenario he describes is covered by section 8.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 23 was tabled by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, but she is not present.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 33 in the name of Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n contains three proposals, each of which I will deal with separately.  He proposes to insert a provision into section 40(2) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act 1976 to make the notice made by a local authority to a landowner on the cutting of hedges under the Roads Act an exempted activity.  Section 8 of the Bill provides for the harmonisation of the Wildlife Acts with the Roads Acts in that the provision contained in section 70(2) of the Roads Act 1993 which obliges landowners to ensure a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation on their land is not a hazard to road safety, as I mentioned, will be an exempted activity, as will the provision in section 70(2) which allows a local authority to serve notices on landowners to undertake works such as hedge cutting and clearance for safety purposes along public roads.  I must, therefore, oppose that part of the amendment as it is unnecessary.<\/p> <p>  The second part of amendment No. 33 provides that public bodies would have to notify me, as Minister, of all exempted works undertaken during the period from March to August.  I do not consider that it should be mandatory for public bodies to notify me of all such works as that would be an onerous task which could delay the carrying out of urgent work on health and safety grounds.  I have existing powers under section 40(3) of the Act to request details of such works from public bodies with a statement of the public health and safety factors involved.  These powers have been used on several occasions in recent years.  For that reason, I believe my existing powers are sufficient and request that the committee reject the amendment.<\/p> <p>  The third part of the amendment relates to a proposed amendment to the Roads Act 1993 relating to the placement of structures which may interfere with public roads.  These are matters outside the remit of the Bill and more appropriate to my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross.  Accordingly, it is not possible for me to accept the amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#D00300","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":562,"content":"<p>There is a fundamental difference.No one disagrees that we must be attentive to the need for road safety.  In that regard there are existing provisions in the Roads Act that allow us to attend to situations which involve a safety problem.  The provisions in amendments Nos. 20, 23 and 27 that we have put forward aim to give clarity to and strengthen such powers and make it clear that it is the responsibility of the local authority to address a road safety issue or direct a landowner to do so.  That is needed as part of a wider range of measures aimed at good hedgerow management.  In many instances, people do not cut hedgerows during the preferred period from September to March when there is a need for their proper management in that way.  However, central to the legislation brought forward by the Minister is that landowners are left to make that decision and decide whether to cut hedges in August in a way that we believe will be deeply damaging to wildlife and impossible to police in comparison with the approach we suggest, where it would properly be done by the local authority.  The Minister stated this would only apply to roadside hedges.  They do not make up a minute fraction of hedgerows, as was suggested in previous discussions on the Bill but rather I understand, approximately 19%, according to the latest or best hedgerow studies.  We are talking about giving landowners <i>carte blanch<\/i>e to decide if one fifth of hedgerows should be cut.  It would be fanciful for us to believe they will be able to assess ecological risk in dealing with issues such as whether there is a nest in a hedgerow.<\/p><p>The Bill will lead to a loosening of regulations when we should be tightening and clarifying the existing regulations which are not being applied.  If road safety is the real issue, as it is in some instances, we want there to be the cutting of hedgerows but it to be done under the control of local authorities and the National Parks and Wildlife Service, rather than handing control over to landowners such that it would be impossible to police, which is what the Minister is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#D00400","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":563,"content":"<p>Road safety was mentioned by another Deputy who lives in a rural area.

Our car was shunted back ten feet, leaving it stuck in the ditch.  All those in the car were injured, with some of the injuries lasting for approximately six months.  I am acutely aware of the necessity for road safety on minor roads.  The individual who was driving the other car was still over the limit having been drinking the previous night.  The policing of roads to prevent drink-driving is one of the key tools we can use to ensure roads will be safer for everybody.<\/p> <p>  I am glad that Deputy Danny Healy-Rae admitted that there is a tool to fix some of the problems we face.  He has rightly stated section 70 is not used enough, but that issue could be resolved and we could use the section to achieve his objectives in that regard.  Interestingly, in responding to his amendment the Minister stated it was unnecessary as we already had section 70 to resolve the question with which we were dealing.

It is the same group that is pulling in new lorries on the side of the road and taking them to test centres, even though they are only a few months old.  That is what the RSA is doing.  It has no interest at all in what is happening on the roads in terms of overgrowth and hedges and people having their eyes picked out or being killed.  As I stated, although local authorities may have the power, as I believe they have, to cut dangerous hedges that pose a health and safety risk, it has not been happening in Kerry or any neighbouring county in which I travel, including west and north west Cork and parts of Limerick.<\/p><p>People's lives are important and if someone is killed, there is no return.  Many people are killed while walking and cycling along our roads.  Considerable pressure is being applied by cyclists to have their safety improved.  To be honest, they are being pushed out among cars travelling behind them.  If two cars meet, cyclists are shoved into a ditch because the drivers are coming around a turn or the like and cannot see in time that another vehicle is coming.  That is how accidents and fatalities happen.<\/p><p> It was not out of malice but for every good reason that I tabled my amendment on allowing roadside hedges to be cut all year round.  It has not been happening.  The Minister stated she was not in support of my amendment.  It hurts me greatly that we cannot get my provision into this Bill, since we have been waiting for so long.  I have been vocal on this issue since 2004.  I had to fight to save my council seat because another councillor made a serious remark that I sought to get hedges cut because I wanted to get that work for myself.  I had to fight like I had never fought before to hold my seat in that election.  Nothing could have been further from the truth.  I wanted to get hedges cut to allow school buses to bring children to schools.  The hedge cutting tender process was open to everyone else as well and the hedges in question were miles away from me.  It was in September 2004 and it cost me a great deal of money to save my seat.  I paid people to help represent me, yet it was not them who helped but another poor, honest man who put the matter in perspective and allowed me to defend my seat rightfully.  That is what I have gone through where cutting hedges is concerned.  I almost lost my seat trying to get them cut.<\/p><p> This is a serious matter.  I would have liked to succeed but I now realise that I will not.  I do not have the support of this room.  When the Bill returns to the Seanad, I am sure I will not have the support there either.

I do not believe the Minister would say this is a proposal to improve the protection of wildlife.  It is being introduced to address road safety issues.  The argument being made in amendment No. 27 is that if that is the Minister's intention, the best approach is to ensure the local authority can act to direct a landowner to address a road safety issue or take action itself.  Section 70(2)(b) of the Roads Act 1993 allows a local authority to issue a direction to a landowner.  Section 70(9) of the same Act allows a local authority to take action.  I mention this as a means of outlining the purpose of the amendment.  I return to the question that is at the centre of my argument: why are we giving people the freehold ability to cut hedgerows in August?  It is being done to address a road safety issue when it could be addressed by the local authority directing the landowner to take action or taking action itself in circumstances where there is a clear road safety issue.

I have already addressed the issues related to hedgecutting in the month of August.  I have explained the reasons and rationale for that decision.  I do not propose to go into them again.  It is important to say that under section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, hedgecutting cannot be engaged in by individual landowners during the closed season from March to the end of August.  Section 8 of the Bill provides that works to be undertaken by landowners along public roads under section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 for safety purposes will be considered to be an exempted activity under section 40 of the 1976 Act, as amended.  The Deputy's proposal would align the Wildlife Acts with a specific subsection of section 70 of the 1993 Act.  If it were to be accepted, the Wildlife Acts would continue to contradict the remainder of section 70.  That is really the reason for this provision.

The nesting season now occurs earlier, as reflected in the Wildlife (Amendment) Act 2000 which provided for an earlier start to the closed season.  That Act should also have provided for the closed season to end on 31 July in line with nesting patterns.  As Deputies will be aware, August is a busy farming month.  As many farmers harvest crops, spread soil nutrients and transport livestock in August, they need access to the roads.  Therefore, the decision to allow them to cut hedges during August is a practical one from the perspective of the safety of road users.  August is also the peak month for tourism, with many tourists travelling in cars on unfamiliar regional and secondary roads or walking on such roads.  For road safety reasons, it is sensible to allow hedges to be cut during August.  In recent years the unpredictable winter weather has typically resulted in the hedge cutting season being reduced by one third.  The agricultural machinery involved in hedgerow trimming is very expensive.  Many operators work long hours during the open season to ensure work is completed.  August is a month during which we have between 12 and 14 hours of daylight.  The amount of daylight continues to reduce when August is over.  In the interests of the safety of machinery operators and motorists, hedge cutting should be allowed in the month of August.  Fly-tipping which is a growing problem in the countryside is another issue that should be taken into account.  Community groups that voluntarily clean roadside ditches have noticed that ditches which are regularly cut and maintained are less likely to be used as a dumping ground.  The earlier opening of the hedge cutting season will facilitate earlier cutting and maintenance of hedges.  In addition, the closed period should not apply where local authorities and landowners identify road safety issues such as the need to improve sight lines.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/RG12018050800002#H01800","speaker":"1243"},{"type":"speech","time":1525782600,"counter":611,"content":"<p>I worked in tourism for 15 years.

Anyone who lives in the countryside will agree that it has become radically polluted in recent times.  This is not good for tourism or the ecosystem.  The causes of fly-tipping include bin charges, the cost of recycling and our inability to provide for bottles to be returned in exchange for 10 cent a bottle.

This section limits it to roadside hedge-cutting but many fields do not come to the roadside.  Any fields that do come to the roadside also have three sides of hedges that do not come to the roadside.  In fact, on the narrow roads and especially on the boreens into houses, the tourists constantly complain about visibility, particularly those tourists who would normally drive on the opposite side of the roads.  There are constant complaints about lack of visibility on rural roads over the summer and specifically in August when we get the most visitors.  It is a problem.  I do not see wholesale cutting of roadside hedges but to be able to do it without having to go through a very convoluted process of getting permission from the local authority in August is a proportionate proposal.<\/p> <p>  There is a need to look at what is causing the decrease in our bird population.  It is a lot more complicated than the possibility of being able to cut a few hedges in August.  There is another problem when verges overgrow with grass that technically one can cut anyway.  The local authorities are highly adverse to doing even that, although we get major problems because of it.<\/p> <p>  I happened to be travelling on very narrow roads on Friday in a certain part of the world that does not have a lot of hedgerows but with very high walls along the narrow roads.  I said to the driver to keep 1 m out from the cyclists, but if he had done so we would have been in the ditch on the other side of the road or would have knocked against the walls.  It must be recognised that a lot of the boreens of rural Ireland - not the regional roads - are exceptionally narrow.<\/p> <p>  There are many heavy goods vehicles, milk trucks, timber trucks and every kind of vehicle going down very small roads.  I have often travelled from Mallow to west Cork taking the byways and they are very twisted with a lot of hedges.  It is fine until one comes around a corner and is up against a 40 ft articulated truck, whose driver might have seen one but one will not have seen the truck.  If the car is driven by a tourist it is an absolutely extraordinary situation.  I believe that what is proposed in the amendment is very proportionate and limited.  It is much more limited than original proposals for the wholesale cutting of hedges by professional contractors in August.
