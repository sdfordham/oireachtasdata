When we receive that note, we can comment on it further.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.2 is correspondence received from Mr. Joe Hamill, Secretary General of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht re funding at Pointe Pier, Connemara, County Galway.  It is to be noted.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence received from an anonymous source re corruption and cover up in the Health Service Executive, HSE, County Meath.  This is to be noted and forwarded to the HSE for a note on the issues raised.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.4 is correspondence received from Mr. Sean Martin re Mater hospital debt collection.  It is to be noted and forwarded to the Department of Health and the Mater hospital for a note on the serious issues raised.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.5 is correspondence received from Mr. William Treacy re wrongdoing in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is to be noted.<\/p><p>  No. 3B.6 is correspondence received from Brendan T. Muldowney &amp;amp; Co. Solicitors reporting to the committee.  This relates to the special investigation unit and the fact that this person is now anxious to come forward and speak to the committee regarding the costs and so forth.  It is an issue I raised last week.  Perhaps we could list the names of individuals who have asked to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts to raise certain issues, and we can decide on it later when we see the extent of their interest.  It is something the committee would be interested in because it is taxpayers' money and it is very hard to get a handle on how much was spent in respect of these matters, particularly when the court cases were stood down or the charges were dropped.  A considerable amount of money had been spent in one case over ten years.  We will gather the information, bring it to the next meeting of the committee and perhaps decide on a date for a hearing with these individuals.<\/p><p>  No. 3C is correspondence relevant to today's meeting.

The board was established in 2007 to oversee the development of a national hospital for children on a site at the Mater hospital.  As members are aware, following the decision of An Bord Plean&aacute;la on the proposed development there, a Government decision was taken in November 2012 to discontinue the project at the Mater site and to relocate the development to a site at St. James's Hospital.  The term of appointment of the original board members expired in December 2012.  Interim appointees to the board served between January and July 2013.  The current board members were appointed in August 2013.<\/p><p>  Between 2007 and December 2012, the board incurred costs totalling just under &euro;40 million.  Funding for the board's expenses was provided by the Health Service Executive.  The cumulative expenditure by year is shown on the screens before us in figure 1.  The profile of expenditure is influenced by the rate at which the project advanced with most of the expenditure incurred in the years 2009 to 2011.  The breakdown of total expenditure to the end of 2012 is shown in figure 2.  Expenditure of &euro;24.5 million was incurred on the business services team, which has responsibility for business and health care planning and overall programme management.  Expenditure of just over &euro;6 million was incurred on the integrated design team whose responsibilities relate mainly to development of architectural designs, engineering and quantity surveying activities.  Cumulative expenditure on the project management team amounted to &euro;3.2 million.  This related to project planning and management, management of design quality and procurement management.  A further &euro;6.2 million was incurred in relation to administration costs including support staff salaries.  I am sure the board representatives will be able explain if I have got any of the assignments of responsibilities incorrect.  It should be noted that the board has not incurred site acquisition costs either at the Mater site or at St. James's.  I understand that the HSE and St. James's have incurred costs for site assembly.  <\/p><p>  Since the board exists solely to develop a major physical asset, all of the expenditure incurred was capitalised and recognised as a construction work in progress asset in the board's balance sheet.  That persisted from its establishment.  Accounting standards require that if circumstances or events indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable an impairment review should be conducted.  The carrying value of the asset at 31 December 2012 was impacted by the Government decision of November 2012 to change the location of the hospital.  Given that the required impairment review had not been completed, the audit certificate on the 2012 financial statements drew attention to the uncertainty in relation to the value of the main asset included in the board's balance sheet at the year-end.  Following its appointment in August 2013, the board commenced a review of asset values in relation to all costs incurred up to July 2013.  The review took account of the extent to which the outputs produced could be used on the project at St. James's and was completed in August 2014.  The resulting write-down of the asset will be reflected in the 2013 financial statements.  The audit by office of the impairment exercise and its impact on the draft 2013 financial statements has been completed and our views on the matter have been communicated to the board.<\/p><p>  I understand the board has now considered the impairment review and the audit comments and wrote to the Department of Health on 16 October detailing the process and its outcomes.  I believe the Department is considering the matter in consultation with the HSE and with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As soon as the board presents signed financial statements in relation to 2013, we will be in a position to close the audit and issue the audit opinion. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300009#H00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1414059000,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. McCarthy and invite Mr. Pollock to make his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300009#H00800","speaker":"965"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1414059000,"counter":165,"content":"<p>We have been invited to attend the Committee of Public Accounts to assist the committee in its examination of the annual accounts of the national paediatric hospital development board for the year ended 31 December 2012.  As set out in the accounts, a number of significant developments took place in 2012 which impacted the work of the development board and the Comptroller and Auditor General has referred to some of these.  In particular, these were the refusal by An Bord Plean&aacute;la of the planning application for the children's hospital on the Mater site, which took place in February 2012, the subsequent decision by Government to locate the children's hospital at the St. James's site in November 2012, and the expiry of the term of appointment of the members of the national paediatric hospital development board in December 2012 and their replacement in January 2013 with a transitional board.<\/p><p>  The total expenditure for the year 2012 was &euro;3.36 million.  This can be summarised under the following headings.  The business services team received &euro;1.47 million, the project management services team received &euro;0.13 million, the integrated design team received &euro;0.34 million and administration and other costs including payroll were &euro;1.42 million, giving a total expenditure of &euro;3.36 million.  The board had 1.5 whole time equivalence at the end of 2012.  Other than these, the day-to-day work of the board in 2012 was carried out through the business services, project management and integrated design teams rather than through additional, directly hired staff.  The 2012 balance sheet includes asset values at &euro;39.98 million in regard to the planning and development work for the children's hospital plan for the Mater hospital campus.  This value relates to a cumulated expenditure in the period 2007-12.  <\/p><p>  The current board of the national paediatric hospital development board chaired by Mr. Tom Costello was announced in August 2013 and commenced familiarising itself with the overall project details including the 2012 accounts.  On page 14 of the 2012 accounts, note 3, identifies that arising from the refusal of planning on the Mater site and the Government decision to change the location to St. James's Hospital site, that the board is of the opinion that the assets of the development board are now impaired and that a detailed asset impairment review process is required.  The development board initiated a process in 2014 to review and analyse the asset impairment.  This work is nearing completion and is part of the 2013 accounts.  A draft has been submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General, as he has alluded to, for approval.  On 16 October, the development board wrote to the Department of Health and the HSE setting out details of the process that was undergone for their consideration and sanction.  A response is pending.  This is in accordance with public financial procedures.  We hope to have concluded the asset impairment process and to be in a position to finally sign off and submit the 2013 accounts to the Minister for Health within the next few weeks.  <\/p><p>  As requested by the Committee of Public Accounts, we set out in our briefing document details of expenditure since 2012 which can be summarised as the expenditure in the year ending 2013 was &euro;1.7 million and the expenditure in the current year to August 2014 is &euro;1.76 million.  The current project status is that, as of August 2014, the design team for the new children's hospital at the St. James's Hospital campus led by BDP architects has been appointed.  A separate design team will be appointed for the design of the two satellite centres in regard to emergency, urgent care and out-patient services.  One of these is at Tallaght Hospital on the south side of Dublin and the other at Connolly Hospital on the north side.  A planning application for the main children's hospital and both satellite centres is scheduled to be submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in June 2015 and, subject to a positive decision, construction will commence in early 2016.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300009#H00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock"},{"type":"speech","time":1414059000,"counter":166,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Pollock.

One of the key pieces of work done on the Mater was the design brief.  When one goes to design a hospital one must decide how many beds to put in, how many theatres, how large the out-patients department should be, how large the emergency department should be and how large the imaging department should be.  The design brief on the Mater side cost approximately &euro;4 million to &euro;5 million to develop.  It looked at the activity, operations and procedures taking place at the existing three hospitals - Tallaght Children's Hospital, Temple Street Children's Hospital and Crumlin hospital - and future-proofed the project for inflation growth between now and 2025.  It projected the child population looking at current activity and modelling the number of operations to determine how many broken legs will be treated and heart surgeries undertaken.  That whole activity was then converted into a design brief for the hospital setting out a need for 480 beds, 14 theatres, an out-patients department of a certain size and determining the size of the two satellite centres at Tallaght and Connolly and the level of clinical activity to take place at those hospitals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300010#J01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock"},{"type":"speech","time":1414059600,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Mr. Pollock may correct me if I am wrong, but that money and work had more to do with the internal workings of how this hospital will work by bringing the other three campuses together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300010#J01500","speaker":"1041"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1414059600,"counter":184,"content":"<p>It is both.  Regarding the internal workings of how it is going to work, one must look at the manpower resourcing of the new hospital also.  In looking at that when one merges three hospitals into one, one will look for efficiencies in terms of how the hospital is staffed and in terms of procurement of consumables, materials and drugs with greater buying power.  One is looking at how the hospital will be run.  However, one must also tell the design team how large a hospital it must design.  We have told our design team the hospital will be approximately 65,000 sq. m of net clinical space.  That is purely clinical space and when one grosses it all up for communications and circulation, one ends up with a gross hospital space of approximately 110,000 sq. m.  We must provide this information to the design team in advance.  It is design information we provide to the BDP team in terms of saying to it that is the hospital we want it to design.  It is very similar to what was planned at the Mater in terms of scale and when one moves to a new site there will be some synergies in terms of what can be shared on the St. James's campus that will be different to what might have been shared at the Mater.

That is an interesting point that the Deputy raises.  When the Dolphin review was carried out it identified moderate risks on the site of St. James's Hospital.  Again the development board, in conjunction with St. James's and the HSE and the Department, addressed.  Even though the site was much bigger than was proposed on the Mater site and fundamentally the Mater failed because the site was too small in terms of development, which is why it was to be a 16 storey building.  From what was originally proposed to the Dolphin group, the site has been enlarged.  What we have now is a 4.86 hectare site which is 12 acres.  12 acres in any terms in the inner city is a huge site.  It is three times the size of the site we had at the Mater.<\/p><p>  As part of the lessons learned, the development board has been stress-testing the site.

We can work within those guidelines so that we will not be in breach of the development guidelines, which are different from those that were on the Mater site.  We can work within those guidelines and An Bord Plean&aacute;la will take cognisance of that.  We certainly have enough space for it.  We stress-tested the site so that if a decision is made to place a maternity hospital on the site that can be accommodated as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300011#K05600","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock"},{"type":"speech","time":1414060200,"counter":253,"content":"<p>This project has been going on for a number of years but the board has changed a substantial number of times.

I support what John said.  Even in terms of the size of the site, for example, we went to so far as to carry out site investigations on the site to ensure there was nothing in respect of contamination, archaeology or rock.

One sends out the marking to the unsuccessful candidates to show them how they scored in terms of the technical and financial evaluations and how they compared with the successful candidate.

Over recent years, because of extremely low-cost tendering, there has been a move towards evaluation and awarding contracts based both on quality and cost.  Nowadays with most public contracts it is not only about price.  It is important that it would not be based on price only because low-cost and under-cost bidding has caused major problems on a number of projects because whether it is design teams or contractors they are not resourced to do the job and one ends up with mismanagement, which costs more at the end of the day.

The price is still a big part of the evaluation but there is a technical evaluation as well.  The important thing is to ensure that people have the technical skills.  Within the HSE there are guidelines on the selection of panels.  We gave much thought to ensuring first that the people were competent.  After that one relies on people to declare a conflict of interest.

Reference has been made to philanthropy, philanthropic funds and so on and I do not have the scope to ask about that, but the lion's share of this is public money.  What are the board's plans in respect of social clauses?  I introduced legislation last Friday on the issue of social clauses in public procurement contracts.  As the witnesses are probably aware, this is something that has been done in Grangegorman, for example, and the Dublin docklands signed up to it, but it is very <i>ad hoc<\/i>and it is not yet based in statute.<br\/>It would be remiss of me not to ask what the plans are, given that this is a big project in the heart of the inner city and that, like many inner-city communities, the area has very serious issues in terms of long-term unemployment, significant training and apprenticeship needs and so on.  Could the witnesses tell the committee what their plans are to leverage the best that the public euro can get in terms of constructing the hospital but also in accordance with EU law, because we are aware that there are constraints and that it must be done in a particular way but it is still entirely possible to do?

We have begun engaging with the community and the regeneration groups in the area.  We made a visit to the NHS hospital in Glasgow, where they seem to have been very successful in particular in delivering on the community gain.  One of the people there, Mark McAllister, came over to meet with the community groups and ourselves - not just the development board but also the group board, which will be running this hospital.  Yes, we absolutely must deliver on the community gain.  To date we have been looking at the model that was delivered in Glasgow, which places emphasis on being proactive right from the off, in terms of engaging with social protection as regards who are the unemployed in the area, finding out their skillsets and getting their CVs.  We have not done this yet, but the plan is to upgrade their CVs, to give them training so that when a contractor comes on board, one will be able to go to the contractor and tell them who is available in the area and what the skillsets are, whether they are carpentry or steel-fixing, so that they start to procure people.  One makes the contractor's life easy, because we cannot compel the contractor to give jobs to locals, but we can make things easy for it.<\/p><p>  We must start gathering a database of local suppliers - whether it is someone who supplies doorknobs, meals, or joinery - one creates that database.  That seems to have been quite successful in Glasgow.  We must set hard targets for the contractor.  That is the lesson we learned in Glasgow.  They must not be soft targets, they must be real metrics - \"You will deliver X% of jobs\".  We cannot guarantee them locally but we can craft the documents in the right way and make it user-friendly for the contractor to promote this.  We met with the contractor in Glasgow, Brookfield Multiplex, which explained to us how it engages in that process and yes, it did provide apprenticeships and locally-delivered training schemes.  It must go further so that when the hospital opens, the kids in the area have an ambition that they want to be a manager, a doctor, a nurse in this hospital.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300015#O02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock"},{"type":"speech","time":1414062600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Pollock for his answer and I feel encouraged by that, provided that they are, as Mr. Pollock describes, hard targets and not pl&aacute;m&aacute;s to keep the locals happy, because there will of course be a level of nuisance also associated with such a big-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300015#O02400","speaker":"1008"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1414063200,"counter":378,"content":"<p>Yes, there would.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300016#P00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Pollock"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1414063200,"counter":379,"content":"<p>Can I come in on that?

I accept that the Deputy is right in what she is saying about EU procurement, etc.  We have to come up with some system, not only to support the local population and its hospital but also to ensure there is a flow of apprentices coming through the system.  I know I am going a little bit left here altogether.  Many of the best people in the industry have left the country.  It is expected that the level of activity in the construction industry will increase.  We hope that will happen.  If it does, there will be a shortage of skills.

Given that it has an opportunity to safeguard the assets, corporate governance involves assessed risks.  I am sure it is a fundamental element of the board's macro considerations in regard to its handling of the project.  Mr. Pollock has already indicated that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is independent.  There is a chance that it will refuse planning permission.  I do not think anyone in this room can answer that question.  The application will not be submitted until next summer, or some time in 2015.  This committee's role is to assess the board on how it manages risks.  I ask Mr. Pollock to outline the procedures in place if planning permission is not granted.  It would be reckless not to consider that possibility.  Everybody wants the children's hospital to be built, but it is a possibility.  If the board has not considered that risk, it would not be doing its job.  What plans are in place to cope with that risk and where does Mr. Pollock see the board going if it does not get permission?  I am not asking about the construction of the children's hospital.  The key job of the board's directors is to manage risk in the organisation that they lead.  I know Mr. Pollock has examined this risk because he should not be here if he has not done so.

The project is associated with hundreds of risks, and planning permission is one of them.  The board was appointed just over one year ago, and before we committed to expenditure on the design team we went through a due diligence process to ensure the site was suitable and to fully understand the issues arising.  A planning report that was carried out as part of the decision making process and the selection of the St. James's Hospital site highlighted all the issues and potential risks arising in the short-listed sites.  A number of issues were raised in regard to the St. James's site.  Prior to employing the design team we set out to interrogate and understand these issues.<\/p><p>  The fundamental issue was, of course, the size of the site.  The site that was offered initially was similar in size to the Mater site.  In the deliberations that took place prior to the selection of St. James's Hospital, that site was significantly expanded.  We carried out further due diligence in order to get a high degree of satisfaction or comfort that we were working within the planning guidelines.  One of the major issues in this regard is the height of the building.  The site would easily accommodate a building under the 28 m limit, with capacity for future expansion.  In order to be satisfied in that regard, we insisted on St. James's providing a large site.  The site that is now being provided is three times the size of the Mater site, at 12 acres.<\/p><p>  Our first concern is to plan for success and to address the issues identified as part of the planning report.  We have the benefit of two planners on our board, one of whom was previously a member of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This means we have good internal advice on planning.  We are building a degree of confidence in this regard.  At the end of the day An Bord Plean&aacute;la will make the decision, but we are making sure all the potential issues are addressed as we proceed.<\/p><p>  If we are unfortunate in not getting planning permission, Government policy as it stands is to build a children's hospital at St. James's.  I envisage that the board would attempt to understand the issues arising.  We are sure it will not be due to the site being too small and we will continue our efforts to deliver on Government policy by building a children's hospital at St. James's.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300018#R00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello"},{"type":"speech","time":1414064400,"counter":466,"content":"<p>By the time the planning process is complete, which the board hopes will be at the end of December 2015, what investment will have been made other than the &euro;40 million set out in the accounts up to the end of 2012?

I will follow Deputy Fleming's train of thought as it was very valuable towards the end in regard to the impairment expenditure and the current procurement contracts.  At this point in time, we are effectively talking about &euro;40 million that was spent on the previous process in regard to the national paediatric hospital on the Mater site and in the region of &euro;30 million to &euro;32 million in regard to the current tenders that have been acquired, so it is a considerable amount of public money.  Deputy Fleming asked whether there is a liability whereby the board can be sued, on the one hand, and, on the other, whether there is any insurance mechanism in place.<br\/>I was very closely involved with the original project around the Mater hospital, which is in my own constituency.  Effectively, this project came to the current location at St. James's Hospital not because of a decision of the Government, but because of what I believe to be reckless planning by the previous board.  It was very clear from the An Bord Plean&aacute;la inspector's report that the planning application, which was for 16 storeys high, was, first, in breach of the statutory local area plan for the Phibsborough area, and, second, in breach of the Dublin City Council development plan for the period up to 2017.  On those two statutory considerations, there was a reckless breach in the planning application that was put forward, with the result that it was pointed out to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by local residents and others that this planning application could not be granted because it was invalid in the manner in which it was presented.<br\/>An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision states that the proposal failed to:<blockquote>...comply with the specific objectives for this site as set out in the Phibsboro\/Mountjoy Local Area Plan. ... The proposal would contravene Policy SC18 of the Dublin City Development Plan 11-17...<\/blockquote>It found it was incongruous and grossly out of kilter with either the city development plan or with the local area plan.<br\/>How in God's name could so much design work and planning work be done, with almost &euro;40 million being spent, and then this totally inadequate presentation be made?  Of course the inspector rejected it.  Within a few weeks of the rejection by An Bord Plean&aacute;la's inspector, the board presented another plan to make the hospital nine storeys high but, already at this point, the Minister of the day was fed up with what was going on and he made the decision that we should go to an alternative site entirely.  This is despite the fact there had been an independent review that had decided that the optimum site was, in fact, the Mater site.  That does not tie in with what Mr. Costello or Mr. Pollock said, namely, that the Mater site failed because the site was too small.  The Mater site did not fail because the site was too small.  There had been two independent reviews that had determined the Mater site was adequate but, for some reason, there was a presentation to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for 16 storeys, which could not even allow a helicopter to land, although that was necessary for a children's hospital.  This is what was presented to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and then, within a few weeks, it had been cut down to nine storeys because other areas within the confines of the Mater hospital were being utilised in a new planning application that was all of a sudden put forward.<br\/>There are serious questions with regard to the use of public money in a situation of that nature, where a planning application is so out of kilter with the statutory guidelines already in place.  I have serious questions.  The previous board consisted of a number of developers, some of whom are now in NAMA, whereas the current, entirely new board seems to be much more representative.  Where does responsibility lie if the current board's planning application receives anything like the response from the inspector of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that the previous application received?  It cost the State almost &euro;40 million, most of it impaired at this time.  We now have another &euro;32 million of taxpayers' money being spent and, as Deputy Fleming pointed out earlier, what guarantee do we have that this is going to be successful?  Who takes oversight of a board's planning application?<br\/>I do not know if the witnesses have read the planning application that was put forward for the Mater hospital.  Part of the reason there has been so much impairment is due to the design work that was done.<\/p> <p>It was obviously not in the real world and it is, therefore, impaired.  This is the real reason so much is impaired and cannot be brought forward to this project.

What we are doing has been informed by the decision on the Mater hospital but it is also informed by the local area plan and the Dublin City Council development plan for the St. James's Hospital area.  We are working strictly to the rules, limits and guidelines set down in the plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300020#T00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Costello"},{"type":"speech","time":1414065600,"counter":510,"content":"<p>I am not aware that there is a local area plan for the St. James's Hospital area.

How will lessons be learned?  How can the witnesses be sure that what they are doing will not result in the same situation that occurred at the Mater hospital?  Can the witnesses break down the reasons for the impairment that occurred and the waste of taxpayers' money?  These are the statements from 2012 and I think we must seek greater clarity on how the decision was made to put forward a planning application that anyone could have seen had no chance of success - there were too many question marks.  The report says that formal processes were established to identify and evaluate risks associated with the planning.  Did the previous board do this?  There are planning expenses of &euro;1.5 million and this is separate to the figures given for the four bodies - the business service, the integrated design team and so on.  It states on page 14 that, arising from the Government decision to change the location of the new children's hospital to the St. James's Hospital site, the board is of the opinion that there are certain elements of the business project management services and design works procured to date that are unlikely to retain their full value as assets for the future hospital.  It also says the board will complete a process to review the matter.  This is the process I want to see.<\/p><p>  The witnesses have said such issues are unlikely but have not detailed the reasons for this and I believe serious questions must be answered on why there has been total impairment.  Why is it not possible to carry the value of these assets into the work that is currently being done?  I request a detailed account from the witnesses based on the history of the project.  If they do not read the relevant documents, get the background information on the decisions that have been made and see why An Bord Plean&aacute;la categorically refused the planning application after years of work and high expenditure, they will not understand how the impairment of assets occurred.<\/p><p>  The accompanying letter from the Comptroller and Auditor General states that on 31 December 2012 the financial statements included assets valued at &euro;40 million.  This is with regard to planning and development costs for the national paediatric hospital.  The letter goes on to state that, arising from the Government's decision to change the location of the hospital, it is likely that these assets are now impaired.  I contend that is not correct - the impairment arises not from the Government's decision, but from a reckless planning application.  The Government had no choice but to make its decision and this should be clarified.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300020#T00900","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1414065600,"counter":513,"content":"<p>I was drawing attention to a change in circumstances that prompted and necessitated the review.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300020#T01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1414065600,"counter":514,"content":"<p>The Comptroller and Auditor General goes on to say there is uncertainty as to the value of the assets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300020#T01100","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1414065600,"counter":515,"content":"<p>Yes, I point out that there was a process to go through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300020#T01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1414065600,"counter":516,"content":"<p>There was a process to go through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2014102300020#T01300","speaker":"1006"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1414065600,"counter":517,"content":"<p>The point made by the Acting Chairman is a good one.

Section 24 deals with the issue of visitor registration; section 28 with the certificate of registry and section 64, summary penalties.<br\/>Amendment No. 2 proposes technical amendments to section 23(8) and (9).  The amendment to subsection (8) makes it clear that the certificate of registry of temporary registration must be carried on board a ship to which the certificate relates.  When a vessel is temporarily in Irish waters and its owner has registered it in the register that the Bill is enabling and updating, the amendment makes it clear that the certificate must be carried on board the ship and that it must refer to the ship for which it has been granted.  The wording of subsection (9) is being revised in the interests of clarification to provide that the penalty on summary conviction is a class C fine, that is, a fine not exceeding &euro;2,500.  This approach is consistent with the provisions in relation to non-compliance with the certificate of registry requirements generally, as contained in section 28(12) of the Bill which also provides for a class C fine on summary conviction.  For all of the potential convictions in respect of the temporary registration of craft, we are ensuring a similar sanction will apply, that is, a class C fine.  <br\/>Section 23 allows qualified persons who normally live on the ship and purchase a recreational craft under 24 m in length outside the State to register the recreational craft on a temporary basis for the purposes of bringing it from abroad to a port in the State.  This provides a facility for ship owners as they may be required to be registered when operating in certain waters.  Subsection (8) requires that the certificate be carried on the ship at all times.  Subsection (9) provides that where this does not happen, the owner or master of the ship will be held responsible for the offence.  <br\/>Amendment No. 3 refers to section 24(6) and clarifies that the penalty for an offence in this area is a class C fine.  Amendment No. 15 amends section 64 to add references to section 20(9), section 23(9) and section 24(6) to the saver provision.  This provides that, except when provided otherwise in particular sections of the Bill, summary conviction for an offence under the Bill will result in a class A fine.  These sections listed in brackets in section 64 provide for fines other than a class A fine.  They provide for class C or D fines, &euro;2,500 or &euro;1,000, respectively, on conviction or higher fines on indictment.  Amendment No. 15 adds references to sections 23(9) and 24(6) which provides for a class C fine on summary conviction and a fine not exceeding &euro;50,000 on conviction on indictment. <br\/>Amendment No. 4 is a technical amendment which reinforces the meaning of the word &quot;ship&quot; in section 28(2) to make it clear that it is the owner of the vessel or ship, in respect of which the certificate of registry has been granted, who may apply to the Minister for an extension of the certificate concerned.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52014102300003#B00400","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069200,"counter":589,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069200,"counter":590,"content":"<p>Section 23, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069200,"counter":591,"content":"<p>SECTION 24<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1414069200,"counter":592,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 3:<blockquote><br \/>In page 28, to delete lines 1 and 2 and substitute the following:&quot;(6)  Where there is a failure to comply with <i>subsection (5),<\/i>the owner or master of the ship concerned commits an offence and is liable on summary <br \/>conviction to a class C fine.&quot;. <\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52014102300003#B00800","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069200,"counter":593,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069200,"counter":594,"content":"<p>Section 24, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069200,"counter":595,"content":"<p>Sections 25 to 27, inclusive, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069200,"counter":596,"content":"<p>SECTION 28<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1414069200,"counter":597,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<blockquote><br \/>In page 30, line 29, after &quot;ship&quot; to insert &quot;to which it relates&quot;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52014102300003#B01300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069200,"counter":598,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1414069200,"counter":599,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, and 16 are related and may be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52014102300003#B01500","speaker":"1089"},{"type":"speech","time":1414069200,"counter":600,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 5:<blockquote><br \/>In page 31, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:&quot;(5)  Where there is a failure to comply with <i>subsection (4)(a),<\/i>the owner or master of the ship concerned commits an offence.&quot;.<\/blockquote>These amendments to section 28 are of a technical nature.  Section 28 provides for the issuing of a certificate of registry by the Minister when a ship is registered in the Irish register of ships.  Provision is made for different types of certificate of registry for different purposes, as well as for duplicates and replacement certificates.  The section also imposes requirements in relation to the carriage of the certificate of registry on the ship and provides for offences relating to the use of the certificate.  I am proposing in amendment No. 5 to insert a new subsection (5) and a specific offence provision where there is a failure to comply with the general requirement in subsection (4)(a) to carry a certificate of registry on board a ship at all times.  The amendment clarifies that where this requirement is not complied with, the owner or master of the ship concerned will be held responsible for the offence.  The related amendment No. 6 amends the existing subsection (6) to ensure a specific offence provision for non-compliance with subsection (4)(b) and (c) and the renumbered subsection (6) is contained in the Bill.  <br\/>Amendment No. 7 is a further consequential technical amendment to the existing subsection (12) to include a reference to the new subsection (5) which will be inserted as a consequence of amendment No. 5 and make it clear that a person who fails to comply with the requirements of the subsections listed is liable on summary conviction to a class C fine.<br\/>Section 65 allows for the prosecution of both the owner and the master of a ship in the case of specified offences under the Bill where it is shown that the owner or the master, as the case may be, consented to, approved or connived in the commission of the offence.<br\/>Amendment No. 16 arises from the insertion of subsection (5) in section 28 and will add a reference to an offence under section 28(5) to the list of offences for the purposes of section 65.<\/p> <p>The offence in section 28(5) relates to failure by the owner or master of a ship to comply with the general requirement to carry a certificate of registry on board the ship at all times.  The inclusion of a reference to section 28(5) in the list of specified offences in section 65 brings consistency to the section, which already includes a reference to sections 23(9) and 24(6) where offences relate to failure by the owner or master of a ship to carry the certificate of temporary registration or a visitor registration, respectively, on board the ship at all times.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52014102300003#B01600","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069800,"counter":602,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1414069800,"counter":603,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 6:<blockquote><br \/>In page 31, line 5, to delete &ldquo;<i>subsection (4)<\/i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;<i>subsection (4)(b) <\/i>or <i>(c)<\/i>&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52014102300004#C00300","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069800,"counter":604,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1414069800,"counter":605,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 7:<blockquote><br \/>In page 31, line 39, to delete &ldquo;<i>subsection (6)<\/i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;<i>subsection (5)<\/i>, <i>(6)<\/i>&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52014102300004#C00500","speaker":"1007"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069800,"counter":606,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069800,"counter":607,"content":"<p>Section 28, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069800,"counter":608,"content":"<p>Section 29 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069800,"counter":609,"content":"<p>SECTION 30<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1414069800,"counter":610,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 30 stand part of the Bill.\"<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1414069800,"counter":611,"content":"<p>The ports of registration lists must be expanded.

To the best of my knowledge we do not have outstanding cases on this issue, but it would be horrible if Ireland became a state where people did not have to satisfy court judgments on payment of wages.

Nothing I say here prohibits him from tabling an amendment on Report Stage, but I will outline my current assessment of the issue.<\/p><p>  The Deputy's point about public access to the register is correct.  Many aspects of the register, which will have different sub-registers below it, will be available for public access.  It will also be possible to obtain a certified copy of particulars entered in a register book on the registry of a ship and to view or obtain copies of transcripts of registry for any registered ship at the general register and record office.  There might well be other aspects of it that are not available for public view, but many of the areas that would be of most interest to the public will be available for public access.<\/p><p>  The Deputy might be considering a potential amendment relating to the issue of judgments against ships and so forth.<\/p> <p>I draw the committee's attention to section 53 which provides the power for the High Court, on the application of an interested person, to make an order prohibiting any dealing with a registered ship or a share in a registered ship for a specific period and on terms and conditions that it decides.<\/p><p> Under section 53(2), a court order is binding when served on the Minister.  This means that a ship cannot be removed from the Irish register of ships while the order is in force.  I realise this does not address entirely the point the Deputy has made, but I am seeking to emphasise that, in circumstances in which an appeal is made to the High Court, the owner of the vessel is prohibited from doing certain things.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TR52014102300004#C02300","speaker":"1007","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1414070400,"counter":625,"content":"<p>I accept that.  When a person obtains a judgment, he or she has it.  I would prefer, however, if it was automatic that a person could enter a judgment in the registry.  In that way it would be automatic that the boat could not be de-registered before the judgment was satisfied.  It is cumbersome and very expensive to go to the High Court.  While it is good that the provision is in place, I would prefer if the onus was the other way around and that a person did not have to go to the High Court to stop someone de-registering a boat without having satisfied the judgment.  I am not suggesting we get rid of the power to go to the High Court.  For example, if a case was pending, a person could seek a declaration from the High Court that a ship could not be de-registered on that basis.  However, it seems onerous that an owner, having obtained a judgment, then has to go back to the High Court at some further point to seek a further order.  I am pleased section 52 is in place, but this is an addition I am proposing by way of an amendment.<\/p><p>  There is also the issue of the register being public.  It is welcome that the intention is to keep it public.  I do not mean this in the case of the Minister specifically, but sometimes I wonder why Ministers say they never intend to use certain provisions.  Numerous Ministers have come before us to obtain powers in legislation and said they would never use a given provision.  If a Minister does not intend to use them, why does he or she need them in legislation?

In the case of some smaller ships, for the purposes of registration in certain parts of the register, the owner may have difficulty in producing an actual bill of sale and it is proposed to accept a declaration of ownership.  The specific requirements and detail will be set out in the regulations to be made under the Bill.<br\/>Amendment No. 8, as drafted, inserts the words &quot;or by means of such other document of transfer as may be prescribed&quot;.  This means that if a given vessel is below a particular size or if, for some other reason, the owner does not have the bill of sale, the thrust of the amendments allow the Minister to say he will prescribe the details of another document to take the place of the bill of sale.  The idea is to ensure everyone who wants to participate in the register will have the ability to do so and will not be prohibited from so doing because of the absence of a bill of sale.  The amendment is proposed to recognise the fact that there will be exceptions to the requirement to have a bill of sale.  It will allow for the acceptance of alternative documents, for example, a declaration of ownership.  The details of such documents will be set out by ministerial regulations.<br\/>Amendment No. 13 arises as a consequence of amendment No. 8.  To remove any doubt, it confirms that any reference in section 49 to a bill of sale includes a reference to any document of transfer prescribed under section 49(1).  If the Minister of the day states an alternative document may be used, amendment No. 13 seeks to ensure the entire section is consistent.<br\/>Section 49(2) establishes requirements for a bill of sale which must contain a description of the ship that is consistent with its measurement particulars.  This usually involves consistency with the certificate of measurement for the ship.  However, it is proposed to allow for declarations of measurement in the case of some smaller ships to be registered in certain parts of the register.  This will remove the expense of a formal survey of the measurement of certain smaller ships.  As is the case with the bill of sale or a declaration of ownership, the specific detail and requirements will be set out in regulations to be issued by the Department.<br\/>Amendment No. 10 amends the wording of section 49(2) to recognise that the description of a ship may, in certain prescribed circumstances, be set out in a declaration of measurement rather than in a certificate of measurement.<br\/>Amendments Nos. 9, 11 and 12 are technical in nature.  Amendment No. 9 amends section 49(2) to clarify that the requirements in respect of a bill of sale or other document of transfer apply equally to such documents in respect of a share in a ship.<\/p> <p> Amendment No. 11 corrects the placing of the last comma on line 24 of subsection (2).
