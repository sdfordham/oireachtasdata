Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations. <\/p>  <p>  As it stands, active members of pension schemes (through their Trade Unions) regularly engage with the employer to attempt to reach a common position as regards changes to pension schemes whether as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise. In all such cases the outcome of that engagement can only be a collective agreement which cannot, of itself, change the pension scheme. Any proposed changes to the scheme are effected via the mechanisms set out in the trust deeds and rules of the scheme and are at the discretion of the parties so designated in the rules\/deeds of the scheme. In my view, it is within this framework that a collective approach would be most effective.<\/p>  <p>  It should be pointed out that the Trustees of a particular pension scheme are already required by law to act in the best interests of all the members. On that basis the trustees have to take account of the interests of the deferred and pensioner members on an individual basis in any proposals they make.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has been considering the issue of collective representation for pensioners and deferred members of occupational pension schemes with the Pensions Authority.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from this exercise, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has recently approved an amendment to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority and signed regulations on January 22nd to provide for the recognition of groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members of a pension scheme. <\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Pensions Authority has published the revised section 50 guidance.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the changes apply in the following situations:<\/p>  <p>  The trustees of a pension scheme will now be required to notify the groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members where the trustees of a scheme propose to apply to the Pensions Authority to restructure scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act. This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make a submission to the trustees of the scheme in relation to proposals to restructure scheme benefits. <\/p>  <p>  The Pensions Authority will now be required to notify groups representing the interest of scheme members where the Pensions Authority proposes to either issue a unilateral direction under section 50 of the Pensions Act to the trustees of a scheme to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme under section 50B of the Pensions Act. This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make representations to the Pensions Authority in relation to its proposals to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme. In such situations, the representative group will also have the option of making an appeal to the high Court on a point of law in relation to such proposals.<\/p>  <p>  On a separate but related matter, I am currently considering the introduction of access rights for individual retired workers to the industrial relations machinery of the State under the Industrial Relations Acts, where they have not referred their claim prior to their retirement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200052#WRA01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation Targets","counter":28,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200052#WRA01950"},{"type":"question","counter":29,"qnumday":19,"qnumall":"[6073\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200052#WRA02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which he expects to be in a position to facilitate-encourage-support indigenous job creation in both the manufacturing and services sectors, region by region, throughout the country in the course of 2015; the extent to which he expects to see a reduction in the numbers on the live register arising therefrom; if he anticipates further job creation arising through foreign direct investment in this period throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

A complementary report on the skills needs for the sector, which I had commissioned at the same time, was published by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, and it identified a series of actions to enhance skills in the sector.<br\/><br\/>Arising from the Manufacturing Strategy and the Skills Report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by relevant Agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the <i>Action Plans for Jobs <\/i>for 2013 and 2014.<br\/><br\/>Developing Manufacturing was adopted as a Disruptive Reform in the 2014 Plan. One of the key actions there is the delivery of a National Step Change initiative to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms engaged in manufacturing i.e. small and medium-sized firms and larger multi-nationals, particularly in higher-value sub sectors such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food.  In addition a wide range of training and educational initiatives are underway by the relevant providers, such as <i>Skillnets.<\/i>A suite of measures designed to support industry growth across a span of sectors are set out in the new <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2015 <\/i>which I launched recently, and include encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting start\u2010up activity, further improving our skills base, assisting our businesses to grow, improved access to finance by SMEs and developing and deepening opportunities from global investment. <br\/><br\/>As a small open economy, Ireland is impacted by global economic cycles and shifts in competitiveness worldwide. In the case of manufacturing, lower labour costs in Asia have, for many years had a significant impact on the production of lower value goods with high labour element, but Government policy has pursued the development of higher value areas. Since the advent of the recession, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved, as shown by our rise in International rankings, as various costs have been reduced. Overall trends are very positive. The Annual Employment Survey shows a rise in employment in Agency supported manufacturing companies of over 3,300 between 2011 and end 2013, (2014 sectoral data is not yet available). The latest data for Agency &ndash;supported Internationally Trading Services companies show a rise of over 14,000 in the same period. Other Services sectors in the domestic economy have shown significant growth in employment in recent years. <br\/><br\/>Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working with both existing and prospective new client companies especially in the manufacturing and services companies, with consequent job creation and retention, and several recent new job announcements have been in respect of companies engaged in these sectors.Just last week I officiated at the Combilift announcement which will bring 200 new skilled jobs to County Monaghan, and at the announcement of the provision of 100 services jobs in the SalesSense operation in Dundalk.  On Monday last I helped launch the Lakeland Dairies initiative in County Cavan which will provide an additional 81 jobs in their new milk processing facility.  The three initiatives are great examples of regional job creation. <br\/><br\/>2014 was a very productive year for expansion in both Foreign and Indigenous Agency-supported companies, with IDA having created a net increase of 7,131 jobs and Enterprise Ireland having created a net increase of 8,476 jobs in their client companies. <br\/><br\/>The Government have made great strides in addressing various issues impacting on costs for business over recent years. Maintaining and improving our competitiveness is an ongoing priority. <br\/><br\/>Innovation is a key characteristic of growing companies in both the Manufacturing and Services sectors. Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a range of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support. By way of illustration, in 2013 SFI had links to 65 per cent of the jobs announced by IDA in fields covered by SFI&rsquo;s legal remit.  <br\/><br\/>I am very conscious of the difficulty in attracting new industry to the regional centres. For this reason I have initiated the development of new Regional Strategies, to be rolled out this year and I am hopeful that this new approach will help to reinvigorate the industrial base of areas which are away from the main urban centres. The Government are therefore committed to strong job creation in all regions of the country. This policy is already working &ndash; for example the South East region, which has traditionally very high levels of unemployment has seen its unemployment rate reduced from 19.4% to 13.7% in the last 2 years alone. The overall National Unemployment rate continues to fall and now stands at 10.5%, a dramatic improvement on the position which pertained just a few years ago after this Government took office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200052#WRA02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":32,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200053#WRB00150"},{"type":"question","counter":33,"qnumday":20,"qnumall":"[5851\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200053#WRB00200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the measures he or the Industrial Development Authority have taken to ensure that a plant (details supplied) in County Tipperary will become a source of local employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1090","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":34,"content":"<p>I am informed by IDA Ireland that the former Johnson and Johnson\/Alza plant in Cashel is in the process of changing hands.

The 2015 Action Plan for Jobs was launched on January 29th.  The Action Plan process is working. Almost 80,000 more people are at work since the launch of the first Action Plan for Jobs in 2012. This increase has not been in &ldquo;precarious&rdquo; or temporary jobs.  While the proportion of Irish workers who are on temporary contracts rose slightly during the recession, reaching 10.5% in 2011, it has since fallen back to the pre-recession level of 9.5%, and remains significantly below the EU average of 14.4%. The CSO data for January 2015 indicates that the share of casual and part-time workers on the Live Register was down -11.0% on January 2014, equivalent to 8,873 workers. The cumulative decrease is 15,839 workers since January 2013. <\/p>  <p>  Indigenous exports and foreign direct investment are at all-time record levels. Our competitiveness ranking internationally has climbed to 15th. The rate of unemployment has declined from a peak of 15.1 per cent at the start of 2012 to below 10.6 per cent at end 2014. In 2014, client companies of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland created 8,476 and 7,131 net new jobs respectively; this represents the highest levels of net new job creation by agency client companies in over a decade and most of this employment growth was in full-time employment. <\/p>  <p>  The Action Plan for Jobs 2015 will be a further step along the way in meeting this medium-term goal for Ireland. The themes in this year&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs build on the reforms of previous years in the areas of competitiveness, innovation and entrepreneurship and in fostering new sources of growth for the economy.<\/p>  <p>  The 2015 Action Plan contains a suite of 380 actions to ensure we deliver the promised 100,000 additional jobs by 2016, with the target to create 40,000 jobs this year. Specifically, in 2015, Enterprise Ireland will target the creation of 13,000 gross new full-time jobs in indigenous firms. IDA Ireland will target the creation of 14,000 gross new jobs in multinationals. It is estimated that every direct job created in agency assisted firms indirectly supports another job in the wider economy thereby making a strong contribution to the overall target of getting to full employment in 2018.<\/p>  <p>  Existing legislation states that part-time employees may not be treated in a less favourable manner than a comparable full-time employee unless there are objective reasons for such treatment, provides specific protection for employees on zero hours contracts, and provides rights regarding equality of treatment to temporary agency workers, many of whom may be part-time workers.<\/p>  <p>  The vast majority of jobs created in tandem with the APJ process have been full-time and well paid. Nevertheless we are anxious to better understand instances where this is not the case.  In this regard, the Action Plan for Jobs for 2015 firstly sets commitments to establish the Low Pay Commission, which is to undertake analysis and make a recommendation on the appropriate level of the national minimum wage. <\/p>  <p>  Secondly, under the APJ, my Department has commissioned the University of Limerick a study on the prevalence of zero hour contracts and low hour contracts (contracts of 8 hours or less per week (LHC) among Irish employers and their impact on employees, and make policy recommendations to Government. The team from the Department of Personnel and Employment Relations in the Kemmy School of Business in UL is expected to report back within six months with its findings and also recommendations for policy change, should they be warranted. <\/p>  <p>  All sectors of the economy are expected to come within the scope of the study; however, a particular focus will be on the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors.

In such circumstances, the global IDA team and Enterprise Ireland coordinate their work to seek a new occupier for the former factory, and to highlight the skills-base of the affected workforce.

This Bill will see further enhancements to the CGS on foot of the review process including: extending a wider range of financial products to be covered not just traditional credit products (e.g. invoice finance, factoring, leasing, overdrafts); a wider range of providers of financial product to be eligible, i.e. not just banks who hold a licence under the Central Bank Act 1971; an increase in the level of guarantee on individual loans from 75% to 80%; an increase in the portfolio cap, i.e. the maximum a bank can claim in respect of its portfolio from 10% to 13%; and the removal of the annual portfolio cap and instead each bank will run a single Credit Guarantee Scheme portfolio.

It is expected that this reform will continue the momentum for entrepreneurship and sustained growth in job creation in each county and region across the country. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to Enterprise Ireland, the agency&rsquo;s client companies have continued to generate increased jobs growth, recording the highest overall rise in employment levels in the last decade, with 8,476 net new jobs at the end of 2014.

The question of whether it is appropriate that pensioner groups have access to the State&rsquo;s industrial relations machinery in pursuing pension scheme grievances is an issue to which I have given careful consideration, particularly in light of representations made to me in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, my Department also consulted with the industrial relations bodies under the auspices of my Department on the issues that arise in the context of collective representation of retired and deferred members of pension schemes in such circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  In this context, it is important to stress that the industrial relations system in Ireland is voluntary in nature both as regards access to the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court. Any change to that principle which would put in place a mandated right to be part of the process would alter fundamentally the conduct of industrial relations.<\/p>  <p>  As it stands, active members of pension schemes (through their Trade Unions) regularly engage with the employer to attempt to reach a common position as regards changes to pension schemes whether as a result of a crisis in the scheme or otherwise. In all such cases the outcome of that engagement can only be a collective agreement which cannot, of itself, change the pension scheme. Any proposed changes to the scheme are effected via the mechanisms set out in the trust deeds and rules of the scheme and are at the discretion of the parties so designated in the rules\/deeds of the scheme. In my view, it is within this framework that a collective approach would be most effective.<\/p>  <p>  It should be pointed out that the Trustees of a particular pension scheme are already required by law to act in the best interests of all the members. On that basis the trustees have to take account of the interests of the deferred and pensioner members on an individual basis in any proposals they make.<\/p>  <p>  The Department of Social Protection has been considering the issue of collective representation for pensioners and deferred members of occupational pension schemes with the Pensions Authority.<\/p>  <p>  Arising from this exercise, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has recently approved an amendment to guidance issued by the Pensions Authority and signed regulations on January 22nd to provide for the recognition of groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members of a pension scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the Pensions Authority has published the revised section 50 guidance.<\/p>  <p>  I understand that the changes apply in the following situations:<\/p>  <p>  The trustees of a pension scheme will now be required to notify the groups representing the interests of retired and deferred scheme members where the trustees of a scheme propose to apply to the Pensions Authority to restructure scheme benefits under section 50 of the Pensions Act.

This notification affords the representative group an opportunity to make representations to the Pensions Authority in relation to its proposals to restructure scheme benefits or to wind up a pension scheme. In such situations, the representative group will also have the option of making an appeal to the high Court on a point of law in relation to such proposals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200054#WRC01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Job Creation","counter":72,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200054#WRC01100"},{"type":"question","counter":73,"qnumday":33,"qnumall":"[5853\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200054#WRC01200","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his plans to create more manufacturing jobs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":74,"content":"<p>The Strategy for the Manufacturing Sector, which I commissioned, and which was published in April 2013, identified that an additional 20,000 jobs can be created in the sector by 2016.  A complementary report on the skills needs for the sector, which I had commissioned at the same time, was published by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs, and it identified a series of actions to enhance skills in the sector.  Arising from the Manufacturing Strategy and the Skills Report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by relevant Agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the <i>Action Plans for Jobs <\/i>for 2013 and 2014.  Developing manufacturing was adopted as a Disruptive Reform in the 2014 Plan. One of the key actions there is the delivery of a National Step Change initiative to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms engaged in manufacturing i.e. small and medium-sized firms and larger multi-nationals, particularly in higher-value sub sectors such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food.  In addition a wide range of training and educational initiatives are underway by the relevant providers, such as <i>Skillnets.<\/i>A suite of measures designed to support industry growth across a span of sectors are set out in the new <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2015 <\/i>which I launched recently, and include encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting start-up activity, further improving our skills base, assisting our businesses to grow, improved access to finance by SMEs and developing and deepening opportunities from global investment.<br\/><br\/>As a small open economy, Ireland is impacted by global economic cycles and shifts in competitiveness worldwide. In the case of manufacturing, lower labour costs in Asia have, for many years had a significant impact on the production of lower value goods with high labour element, but Government policy has pursued the development of higher value areas. Since the advent of the recession, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved, as shown by our rise in International rankings, as various costs have been reduced. Overall trends are very positive. The Annual Employment Survey shows a rise in employment in Agency supported manufacturing companies of over 3,300 between 2011 and end 2013, (2014 sectoral data is not yet available).<br\/><br\/>Both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working with both existing and prospective new client companies in the manufacturing sector, with consequent job creation and retention, and several recent new job announcements have been in respect of companies engaged in this sector.  Just last week I officiated at the Combilift announcement which will bring 200 new skilled jobs to County Monaghan.  On Monday last I helped launch the Lakeland Dairies initiative in County Cavan which will provide an additional 81 jobs in their new milk processing facility.  The two initiatives are great examples of regional job creation.<br\/><br\/>2014 was a very productive year for expansion in both Foreign and Indigenous Agency-supported companies, with IDA having created a net increase of 7,131 jobs and Enterprise Ireland having created a net increase of 8,476 jobs in their client companies.<br\/><br\/>The Government have made great strides in addressing various issues impacting on costs for business over recent years. Maintaining and improving our competitiveness is an ongoing priority.<br\/><br\/>Innovation is a key characteristic of growing companies in the Manufacturing sector. Enterprise Ireland, IDA and Science Foundation Ireland, provide a range of innovation and technology development programmes that deliver financial, technical and experiential support. By way of illustration, in 2013 SFI had links to 65 per cent of the jobs announced by IDA in fields covered by SFI&rsquo;s legal remit.<br\/><br\/>I am very conscious of the difficulty in attracting new industry to the regional centres. For this reason I have initiated the development of new Regional Strategies, to be rolled out this year and I am hopeful that this new approach will help to reinvigorate the industrial base of areas which are away from the main urban centres. The Government are therefore committed to strong job creation in all regions of the country.

Passage of the legislation also permits the introduction of earlier and more intensive engagement by INTREO with the young unemployed. Models for the engagement of young people through Intreo have been agreed and will form the basis of the national roll-out of the Youth Guarantee in 2015.

There are approximately 70,700 rent supplement recipients for which the Government has provided over &euro;298 million for in 2015.<br\/><br\/>Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department&rsquo;s relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant to assist them with their accommodation needs. There is no direct contractual relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme. However, social welfare legislation provides for the payment of a rent supplement payment to a nominated payee such as a landlord on behalf of the tenant. This arrangement is entered at the tenant&rsquo;s request and subject to the consent of the Department. The efficiency of the rent supplement scheme would be significantly affected if all payments were to be made directly to landlords for the provision of short term support. <br\/><br\/>It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the Department any instance where they suspect that a tenant is receiving rent supplement and is not paying their rent. Where the Department becomes aware that a person is not using rent supplement to meet the accommodation costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter investigated. Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s\/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board&rsquo;s dispute resolution process. <br\/><br\/>Under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP) responsibility for recipients of rent supplement with a long-term housing need will transfer from this Department to housing authorities. Under this scheme, HAP payments will be made directly to landlords by the housing authorities. HAP is currently being rolled out to selected housing authorities, with some 790 HAP recipients currently. There is a target to achieve 8,400 HAP cases in 2015 as set out in the &ldquo;Social Housing Strategy 2020: Support, Supply and Reform&rdquo;. The Department continues to support the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, and housing authorities to ensure the success of the HAP scheme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200056#WRE00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social Insurance","counter":128,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200056#WRE00650"},{"type":"question","counter":129,"qnumday":53,"qnumall":"[6485\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200056#WRE00700","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to allow self-employed persons pay extra voluntary contributions in order that they would be allowed access to social welfare entitlements; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":130,"content":"<p>Self-employed persons who earn &euro;5,000 or more in a contribution year are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4%, subject to a minimum payment of &euro;500, and are entitled to access long-term social insurance benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension (contributory) as well as guardians payment (contributory), maternity benefit and adoptive benefit. <\/p>  <p>  If income from self-employment falls below &euro;5,000 in a contribution year or a person is unable to work, he or she may opt to pay voluntary contributions.

However, a small minority is not and a range of measures are employed by the Department to ensure that social welfare fraud and abuse is minimised and that its control activity is appropriately focused.<\/p>  <p>  Since 2011 there has been a number of significant measures undertaken which have enhanced the prevention and detection of social welfare fraud.  These measures commenced as part of  the Fraud Initiative (2011 &ndash; 2013) and are being further progressed under the Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy 2014 &ndash; 2018, which I launched in April 2014.  The Compliance and Anti-Fraud Strategy builds on the approaches that have been successfully rolled out over the past couple of years.  These include the continued roll-out of the Public Services Card, enhanced data sharing with other Government Departments and Agencies and a number of significant legislative measures. <\/p>  <p>  The emphasis continues to be on preventing fraud and error from entering the system in the first place.   However, where fraud is discovered it is important that there are appropriate sanctions in place.  In this regard, the Department is proactively targeting persons with overpayments to ensure all persons who have a social welfare overpayment are making a contribution towards the repayment of the debt outstanding.  A number of legislative provisions have been introduced to strengthen the Department&rsquo;s capacity to recover debt and, in addition, a new debt management system went live in November 2014.  It is also the Department's policy to consider for prosecution cases of fraud against the social welfare system.<\/p>  <p>  The Department recognises that fraud investigation and control can be assisted through the application of a range of new technologies.  In this context, the Department has recently commenced a project utilising analytics technology to predict which claims are more likely to be fraudulent.  When this technology is in place, it will enable the Department to target higher risk cases for investigation and to do so faster.  <\/p>  <p>  A number of other measures should also be noted. From the beginning of Dec 2014, 20 Garda&iacute; have been seconded to the Department&rsquo;s Special Investigation Unit.  These officers will ensure a greater presence on the ground and will increase the investigative capacity of the Department to prevent, detect and deter social welfare fraud. <\/p>  <p>  The Department&rsquo;s control work is measured in terms of control savings.  Control savings are used as a performance indicator for year-on-year activities and are an estimate of the value of the various control activities across the schemes in payment.  They refer to future expenditure that would have been incurred but for this control work.  Without this control work the social welfare expenditure would increase by this amount over time.  The control savings target for 2014 was &euro;510 million and it will be maintained at this level for 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Fraud detection and control systems have been refined and enhanced in recent years and are subject to continuing review.  Overall, this is resulting in less opportunity to commit fraud and less chance of claims being in payment at an incorrect rate through fraud or error.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200056#WRE01000","answer":true,"speaker":"946"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Child Benefit Eligibility","counter":134,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200056#WRE01050"},{"type":"question","counter":135,"qnumday":55,"qnumall":"[6514\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200056#WRE01100","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"Minister for Social Protection","question":"the reason children's allowance is not paid for children beyond their 18th birthday, in respect of children who are still attending secondary school; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1182","askee":"946"},{"type":"speech","counter":136,"content":"<p>Child benefit is a monthly payment to assist with the costs associated with raising children.

A Value for Money Review of Child Income Support Programmes found that the participation pattern in second-level education supports the 18-year age limit for child benefit.

If the problems that have come to light were caused by unintended contamination as a result of diesel being inadvertently mixed with petrol at some point along the supply chain, there would be no Revenue offence involved. However, the Revenue Commissioners are vigorously investigating the possibility of tax fraud being associated with the identified problems.

It should be noted that the corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers is not captured in Revenue systems for 2013 in a manner that can be analysed in respect of this Question. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete a self-assessment tax return.<\/p>  <p>  The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax forgone at the 41% rate for 2013 in the case of individuals and 12.5% in the case of companies. The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of Income Tax and Corporation Tax. <\/p>  <p>  Corresponding data cannot yet be provided for 2014 as the tax returns for this year are not yet due.<\/p>  <p>  There are no property schemes or area based property incentives that could be considered active at the present time.

However, there remains a potential Exchequer cost from these schemes as capital allowances and other reliefs, which had previously been given, continue to be claimed or carried forward to be claimed in future years. These are the basis for the costing given above.<\/p>  <p>  There are also a number of statutory provisions, introduced in recent years, which can potentially affect the rate at which these allowances can be used and, in some cases, terminate the carry-forward of allowances altogether. These are: <\/p>  <p>  -\tThe High Earners Restriction, which was introduced to ensure that, in the case of certain individuals, a minimum effective rate of income tax of 30% is paid annually. This is achieved by restricting the rate at which certain reliefs, including property incentives, can be used to shield income. While the reliefs themselves are not lost, their use is spread out potentially over a much longer time period.<\/p>  <p>  -\tAn upper limit on the annual use of excess capital allowances to shield other income of taxpayers. This provision applies primarily to passive investors in such projects.<\/p>  <p>  -\tAn additional charge to Universal Social Charge (USC) for certain higher income individuals on their use of these property reliefs.<\/p>  <p>  -\tFrom 2015, it will not be possible for passive investors to carry-forward unused capital allowances beyond a building s tax life. Where the tax life has already ended, unused allowances have been lost since 1 January 2015. \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These measures, in particular the one which came into effect on 1 January last, will address the legacy issues relating to the Exchequer cost of these expired property incentive schemes.\u00a0I am further informed that currently there are 3 property related tax reliefs on the statute books which have not been formally commenced. These are:<\/p>  <p>  -\tRelief for Qualifying Specialist Palliative Care Units (enacted in 2008), <\/p>  <p>  -\tThe Living City Initiative (enacted in 2013), and<\/p>  <p>  -\tRelief for Certain Aviation Services Facilities (enacted in 2013).<\/p>  <p>  I have already stated my intention to commence the Living City Initiative and the relief for aviation services facilities as early as possible during this current year.

Within her independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.<\/p>  <p>  As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions. <\/p>  <p>  I have been informed by the Central Bank that it has been necessary to put lending restrictions in place in credit unions where there are regulatory concerns and resultant risk to members' savings. <\/p>  <p>  The Registrar of Credit Unions informs me that currently about 56% of all credit unions are subject to lending restrictions.  Lending restrictions are, in most cases, intended to be short-term in nature and kept in place until the credit union has addressed the issues giving rise to the particular concerns.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  There are two main types of lending restrictions:<\/p>  <p>  1. Monthly lending restrictions.  At this time less that 10% of all credit unions have this restriction in place which limits the total amount of lending within one month.  Therefore, over 90% of credit unions (i.e. over 350 credit unions) have no monthly lending restrictions.<\/p>  <p>  2. Maximum loan size.  The average loan size in the credit union sector is just above &euro;6,000.  Currently 10 individual credit unions have lending restrictions that limit the amount per loan to less than &euro;10,000.  Although there are individual credit unions with lending restrictions above &euro;10,000 per loan,\u00a0that the vast majority \u00a0of credit unions (over 95%) \u00a0can continue to make individual loans significantly greater than the average loan size for the sector.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  These restrictions\u00a0are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether or not they are still set at appropriate levels.  Reviews of individual lending restrictions are included within the planned 2015 supervisory work programme of the Registry of Credit Unions.  Where a\u00a0credit union\u00a0can evidence improvements in its credit management practices, and systems and controls which support prudent lending,\u00a0the Registrar\u00a0is open to removal of restrictions.

","asker":"1080","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":265,"content":"<p>Trade by Enterprise Characteristics (TEC) data is compiled by the OECD in conjunction with Eurostat and other national statistical institutions.  The TEC database aims to fill the information gap on actors involved in cross-border trade, and contains international annual trade data broken down by different categories of enterprises. However, comprehensive statistics answering all aspects of the Deputy&rsquo;s query are not readily available, particularly with regard to ownership categorisation within the available pan-European datasets.  The most recent year of analysis presented by the OECD is 2011, and outlines comparative data for exporting enterprises across a range of OECD member countries including European Union members. <br\/><br\/>As can be seen from Table 1 which follows, Ireland has a comparable number of exporting companies in the employment size category of 0-249 employees (equivalent to SME employment criteria.  One note of caution in interpreting the above data is that the categorisation relates to employee size class only, and does not represent Small and Medium Sized Enterprises as defined at European level (which includes further criteria related to turnover and balance sheet information)), to European countries such as Denmark, Hungary and Sweden, and significantly exceeds countries including Italy, Germany, Finland, the UK and France. <br\/><br\/>In terms of value per enterprise (0-249 employees), Ireland ranks among the highest in the OECD area (in fact only exceeded by New Zealand).  The figures also show that Ireland has higher than average numbers of large (250 + employee) firms that export as a percentage of the total enterprise base.  This is a well-established characteristic of the Irish enterprise base, related to the high degree of foreign direct investment attracted to the country, and the high proportion of total exports accounted for by highly globalised multinationals operating within Ireland&rsquo;s small open economy.<br\/><br\/>In relation to plans to increase the number of exporting firms in the economy, I as Minister have made the internationalisation of SMEs a major priority within the annual Action Plan for Jobs. <br\/><br\/>This effort is being driven by my Department, through Enterprise Ireland, the agency with responsibility for driving the growth of exports from Irish SMEs on world markets.  The agency reported record international sales from its client base in 2013, with exports exceeding &euro;17.1bn. <br\/><br\/>Scaling companies through exports is a key pillar of Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s 2014-2016 Strategy.  Following a weaker global environment than expected in 2014, global growth is expected to strengthen moderately (3.8%) in 2015 (Source: IMF).  Enterprise Ireland clients&rsquo; two biggest markets, the UK and US, are expected to continue to grow strongly.  However, increasing downside risks, including the ongoing weakness in the Euro area, could impact on global growth.<br\/><br\/>Increasing exports means more jobs, and in 2014, Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus was on helping clients build their positions in markets where they are strong and adding to the infrastructure and supports to maximise opportunities for Irish companies in key High Growth Markets (HGMs).<br\/><br\/>Special efforts were targeted at developing client exports in High Growth Markets and, in 2014 Enterprise Ireland received sanction for 20 additional staff in these markets to help grow exports to &euro;3bn by 2016.<br\/><br\/>Enterprise Ireland assisted clients secured more than 1,300 new customers and significant contracts (40% of new customers in HGMs), and its clients established 455 new presences in international markets (45% in HGMs).<br\/><br\/>In addition, Enterprise Ireland worked with early stage HPSU companies to help them secure 131 new international reference customers. Final export figures for 2014 are expected to be announced by Enterprise Ireland in Quarter 2 of this year. <br\/><br\/>Among the initiatives planned to further the internationalisation of SMEs in Ireland for 2015 are:<br\/><br\/>- Enterprise Ireland through its programmes and overseas office network will target support for clients to achieve &euro;19 billion in exports in 2015.<br\/><br\/>- A programme of 18 overseas ministerial-led trade missions and events will take place in 2015.<br\/><br\/>- EI will implement a targeted programme to attract senior level key inward buyer visits from key companies to match Irish supply capability in key sectors.<br\/><br\/>- Continued focus on the Potential Exporters in the enterprise base, by hosting nine Potential Exporter Awareness Events, and nine Potential Exporter Workshops across the country.  This will target over 700 companies to have significant engagement with the EI Potential Exporter Division during 2015.<br\/><br\/>I am confident that Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus on ensuring the right supports are available for clients at every stage of growth, coupled with its priority to develop strong, export-focused, ambitious Irish companies that can win new business abroad, will ensure that exports from indigenous SMEs will continue to grow.<br\/><br\/><b><i>Table 1: TEC Database &ndash; OECD &ndash; Comparison of OECD exporting entities 2011<\/i><\/b><table><tr><th>Country<\/th><th>Exporting Enterprises (0-249 employees) per 10,000 Population <\/th><th>Exporting Enterprises (0-249 employees) as % Total Exporting Enterprises (number)<\/th><th>Exporting Enterprises (0-249 employees) as % Total Exporting Enterprises (value)<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Estonia<\/td><td><div>89.11<\/div><\/td><td><div>99.1%<\/div><\/td><td><div>75.6%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Slovenia<\/td><td><div>82.49<\/div><\/td><td><div>98.8%<\/div><\/td><td><div>59.5%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Belgium<\/td><td><div>72.71<\/div><\/td><td><div>99.1%<\/div><\/td><td><div>69.5%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Slovak Republic<\/td><td><div>54.30<\/div><\/td><td><div>98.6%<\/div><\/td><td><div>38.3%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Austria<\/td><td><div>48.66<\/div><\/td><td><div>97.8%<\/div><\/td><td><div>49.9%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Denmark<\/td><td><div>45.91<\/div><\/td><td><div>97.5%<\/div><\/td><td><div>48.8%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Hungary<\/td><td><div>41.59<\/div><\/td><td><div>98.5%<\/div><\/td><td><div>46.5%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sweden<\/td><td><div>41.10<\/div><\/td><td><div>97.8%<\/div><\/td><td><div>37.7%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Ireland<\/td><td><div>40.16<\/div><\/td><td><div>93.7%<\/div><\/td><td><div>76.2%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Portugal<\/td><td><div>39.48<\/div><\/td><td><div>98.8%<\/div><\/td><td><div>57.3%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Italy<\/td><td><div>33.88<\/div><\/td><td><div>99.1%<\/div><\/td><td><div>56.2%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Germany<\/td><td><div>32.86<\/div><\/td><td><div>98.6%<\/div><\/td><td><div>48.6%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Greece<\/td><td><div>30.31<\/div><\/td><td><div>98.4%<\/div><\/td><td><div>51.9%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>New Zealand<\/td><td><div>28.06<\/div><\/td><td><div>100.0%<\/div><\/td><td><div>100.0%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Finland<\/td><td><div>24.22<\/div><\/td><td><div>96.6%<\/div><\/td><td><div>32.2%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>United Kingdom<\/td><td><div>21.15<\/div><\/td><td><div>97.6%<\/div><\/td><td><div>44.1%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Poland<\/td><td><div>17.86<\/div><\/td><td><div>97.1%<\/div><\/td><td><div>41.5%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>France<\/td><td><div>14.82<\/div><\/td><td><div>96.5%<\/div><\/td><td><div>42.9%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Canada<\/td><td><div>11.38<\/div><\/td><td><div>96.3%<\/div><\/td><td><div>38.7%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>United States<\/td><td><div>9.04<\/div><\/td><td><div>96.2%<\/div><\/td><td><div>29.6%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Turkey<\/td><td><div>6.86<\/div><\/td><td><div>97.1%<\/div><\/td><td><div>59.8%<\/div><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>Source: Data extracted on 09 Feb 2015 from OECD Stat<br\/><br\/>Source: OECD TEC by sector and size class; OECD Total population<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200060#WRJ01900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Regional Aid","counter":266,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200060#WRJ01950"},{"type":"question","counter":267,"qnumday":99,"qnumall":"[6366\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200060#WRJ02000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"his views on marketing or training for local enterprise offices to assist them in promoting areas included in the regional aid area, to encourage businesses to the area, and ensure all are aware of the available grants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

The key objectives of the study are:<br\/><br\/>- To fill the gap that currently exists in terms of the hard data and information that is available concerning the prevalence of zero hour and low hour contracts in the Irish economy and the manner of their use.<br\/><br\/>- To assess the impact of zero hour and low hour contracts on employees.<br\/><br\/>- To enable the Minister to make any <i>evidence-based<\/i>policy recommendations to Government considered necessary on foot of the study.<br\/><br\/>All sectors of the economy, both public and private, will come within the scope of the study, including the retail, hospitality, education and health sectors in particular. The study will examine how zero and low hour contracts operate in practice and how they impact on employees.

A complementary report on the skills needs for the sector, which I had commissioned at the same time, was published by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs and Forf&aacute;s, and it identified a series of actions to enhance skills in the sector.<br\/><br\/>Arising from the Manufacturing Strategy and the Skills Report, there are now a range of initiatives in hand by relevant Agencies to drive the 2016 target, with key actions from both reports having been incorporated into the <i>Action Plans for Jobs <\/i>for 2013 and 2014.  Developing manufacturing was adopted as a Disruptive Reform in the 2014 Plan. One of the key actions there is the delivery of a National Step Change initiative to strengthen Ireland&rsquo;s manufacturing base across all firms engaged in manufacturing i.e. small and medium-sized firms and larger multinationals, particularly in higher-value sub sectors such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and food.  In addition a wide range of training and educational initiatives are underway by the relevant providers, such as <i>Skillnets.<\/i><br\/><br\/>A suite of measures designed to support industry growth across a span of sectors, including both Manufacturing and Services, are set out in the new <i>Action Plan for Jobs 2015 <\/i>which I launched recently, and include encouraging entrepreneurship and supporting start-up activity, further improving our skills base, assisting our businesses to grow, improved access to finance by SMEs and developing and deepening opportunities from global investment.<br\/><br\/>As a small open economy, Ireland is impacted by global economic cycles and shifts in competitiveness worldwide. In the case of manufacturing, lower labour costs in Asia have, for many years had a significant impact on the production of lower value goods with high labour element, but Government policy has pursued the development of higher value areas. Since the advent of the recession, Ireland&rsquo;s competitiveness has improved, as shown by our rise in International rankings, as various costs have been reduced. Overall trends are very positive. The Annual Employment Survey shows a rise in employment in Agency supported manufacturing companies of over 3,300 between 2011 and end 2013, (2014 sectoral data is not yet available). The latest data for Agency &ndash;supported Internationally Trading Services companies show a rise of over 14,000 in the same period. Other Services sectors in the domestic economy, which are outside the remit of the Development Agencies, have also shown significant growth in employment in recent years.<br\/><br\/>It would not be appropriate to set individual targets on a county basis, so specific data for Kildare, as requested by the Deputy is not available. However, right across the country, both IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are working with both existing and prospective new client companies especially with manufacturing and services companies, with consequent job creation and retention.<br\/><br\/>2014 was a very productive year for expansion in both Foreign and Indigenous Agency-supported companies, with IDA having created a net increase of 7,131 jobs and Enterprise Ireland having created a net increase of 8,476 jobs in their client companies. In relation to developing the SME sector, in addition to the work of Enterprise Ireland, the new Local Enterprise Offices ( LEOs) are working to develop the smaller businesses and helping them to grow and prosper.<br\/><br\/>To ensure a better spread of industrial development in the regions, I have initiated the development of new Regional Strategies, to be rolled out this year and I am hopeful that this new approach will help to reinvigorate the industrial base of areas which are away from the main urban centres. The Government are therefore committed to strong job creation in all regions of the country. This policy is already working &ndash; for example the Mid-East region, which includes Country Kildare, has seen its unemployment rate reduced from 13.8% to 10.7% in the last 2 years alone. The overall National Unemployment rate continues to fall and now stands at 10.5%, a dramatic improvement on the position which pertained just a few years ago, after this Government took office.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200061#WRK00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Action Plan for Jobs","counter":281,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200061#WRK00950"},{"type":"question","counter":282,"qnumday":103,"qnumall":"[6549\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200061#WRK01000","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"to outline the extent to which he expects to be in a position to offer assistance and incentives to the indigenous business sector in the course of the next 12 months with a view to increased employment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"question","counter":283,"qnumday":105,"qnumall":"[6551\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200061#WRK01100","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"whether he is satisfied that all means of assistance available to the indigenous business sector here are readily available and accessible; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":284,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 and 105 together.<br\/><br\/>Since 2012, the Action Plan for Jobs has set a comprehensive set of measures agreed by Government to promote jobs opportunities and employment growth in all parts of the country. The 2015 Action Plan, which I recently launched, contains a suite of 380 actions to ensure we deliver not just the promised 100,000 additional jobs by 2016, but an additional 40,000 jobs this year alone. Specifically, in 2015, Enterprise Ireland will target the creation of 13,000 gross new full-time jobs in indigenous firms. It is estimated that every direct job created in agency assisted firms indirectly supports another job in the wider economy thereby making a strong contribution to the overall target of getting to full employment in 2018.<br\/><br\/>Enterprise Ireland uses a developmental approach across all aspects of clients&rsquo; needs, including business development, sales and marketing capabilities, innovation and R&amp;amp;D activity, technology development, continuous competitiveness and lean improvements, leadership and management development, and access to finance. EI supports are tailored to reflect companies&rsquo; stage of development. This ensures that all of its clients, from Entrepreneurs and Start-Ups, to exporting SMEs and scaling companies, can access the appropriate supports to help them to create and sustain jobs.<br\/><br\/>In January, Enterprise Ireland reported that its client companies created 19,705 new jobs in 2014. These companies continue to see year-on-year jobs growth in 2014 and they created 8,476 net new jobs - the highest net gain in the history of the agency. This employment growth demonstrates the direct impact that increasing exports has on jobs in Ireland. Enterprise Ireland supported companies now directly provide employment for 180,072 people, comprising 156,202 full-time and 23,870 part-time workers.<br\/><br\/>The outlook for new job creation in 2015 is positive and Enterprise Ireland&rsquo;s focus will remain on ensuring that its clients have access to all of the necessary supports required to build on this momentum.  This focus, coupled with EI&rsquo;s priority to support entrepreneurship across the regions, and develop strong, export focussed, ambitious Irish companies that can win new business, will mean more jobs for Ireland over the next 12 months.

Details on the LEOs and their offering to business are available at .<br\/><br\/>In terms of access to finance for SMEs, my Department introduced two credit schemes, the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) and the Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme, both of which have been in operation since October 2012. Both Schemes are novel in an Irish context and are continuing to develop a position in the Irish financial arena. Both represent a significant change in our enterprise supports, which primarily have been focused on the exporting sectors, since these supports are also available to the locally traded sectors, in view of their crucial role in job creation. Businesses can access details of these and other SME support schemes at .<br\/><br\/>My Department is actively reviewing and improving both Schemes and will take the necessary legislative steps to deliver changes to both Schemes, including a new CGS to allow for re-financing, a Credit Guarantee (Amendment) Bill and a revised Microenterprise Loan Fund Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200061#WRK01200","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"EU Funding","counter":285,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200061#WRK01250"},{"type":"question","counter":286,"qnumday":104,"qnumall":"[6550\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200061#WRK01300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"to outline the extent to which he expects European Union assistance by way of innovation and technology to directly benefit the indigenous business sector in this country over the next five years; and the likely effect on the economy here as a result.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":287,"content":"<p>Ireland&rsquo;s Partnership Agreement with the European Commission sets out the agreed framework for the use of European Structural and Investment (ESI) funds in Ireland.

The Programmes are expected to support more than 60,000 SMEs across the country with direct financial assistance or other support measures such as mentoring, management training and advisory services, creating over 9,000 jobs in directly-supported enterprises. A further 340 high-growth companies will benefit directly from R&amp;D and Innovation supports.<\/p>  <p>  The Programmes also aim to complement wider investment programmes in targeted high-growth and innovative sectors to support the creation of new quality jobs and boost innovation, as well as helping to grow the local economies, in these regions.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to grant assistance available to Ireland under the above Programmes, Irish researchers and businesses can also compete for funding under the EU Framework Programme for research and innovation.  The current EU Framework Programme for research and innovation, which is part of the drive to create new growth and jobs in Europe, is Horizon 2020. The Programme has a budget of close to &euro;80bn. and runs over the period 2014-2020.

As the Deputy is aware Ireland continues to perform well in the attraction of new investment and particularly so in recent years as FDI inflows to Europe have slowed considerably.<\/p>  <p>  Total employment at IDA client companies now stands at 174,488 people, the highest level in the history of IDA Ireland. The job performance took place against a particularly challenging European economic environment and changing corporate taxation landscape.  There were 197 investments in 2014, equating to a 20% increase on 2013.  There was a notable rise in new-name investment, with 88 new name investors in 2014.<\/p>  <p>  This highlights both the draw of large wealthy markets for FDI, particularly when the focus activities are sales and marketing, but also investor options across Central &amp;amp; Eastern Europe and Western Europe for manufacturing, R&amp;D and business support services. The range of countries competing for FDI in Europe demonstrates the intensity of the marketplace to secure investments for Ireland. In Ireland&rsquo;s case, cost competitiveness, the availability of a dynamic talent pool and targeted sectoral focus, was underpinned by the strong economic management and certainty on the 12.5% corporate tax rate.<\/p>  <p>  The US continues to be the largest single investor in Europe accounting for about 25% of all inward investment projects and job creation.  While Ireland is a very significant recipient of US FDI for contestable investments, competition with the UK, Germany and France, the major overall beneficiaries of US investment into Europe, is intense. The proposed TTIP currently under negotiation could be transformational in this area.  There are potentially many benefits for Ireland from a successful deal but we must also be aware that such trade deals can impact FDI flows.<\/p>  <p>  IDA Ireland constantly monitors competitor locations and the value propositions they offer potential mobile investment.  Competitor locations differ depending on the sector of the mobile investment.  In this respect, IDA Ireland is continuously working to ensure that Ireland is the most competitive, innovative and relevant to the investment being targeted.<\/p>  <p>  Multinational companies account for almost 10% of the Irish workforce and are of crucial strategic importance for the economy due to the quality of the jobs involved, their export focus and the massive knock-on impact they have on the wider economy.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s relative cost competitiveness, corporate tax regime and available direct firm level financial supports remain critically important - but in reality they are no longer aspects that will substantially differentiate Ireland&rsquo;s offering for FDI over the longer term.  So in addition to maintaining a competitive offering in these areas we must at the same time redouble efforts to develop and reinforce the aspects that truly differentiate Ireland&rsquo;s offering in a context of intensified global competition for mobile investment. With this objective in view, IDA Ireland is in the process of preparing a new corporate strategy for the years 2015 to 2020, which is currently being finalised and will be launched in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  We are determined to ensure that every region will benefit from the recovery.  Yesterday, along with the Taoiseach and the T&aacute;naiste, I announced the details of a comprehensive new strategy to support enterprise growth and job creation at regional level.  The Regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative seeks to build on the success of the annual Action Plan for Jobs process by developing locally driven plans that can build on the strengths and opportunities identified in each region.<\/p>  <p>  The strategy will provide up to &euro;250 million over five years in additional funding to support regional enterprise development.  This includes the roll out of a five year, &euro;150 million property investment programme by the IDA to attract foreign direct investment into the regions.  This programme will build on the recent investment by the IDA in a number of advance manufacturing facilities in regional locations.  A further sum of up to &euro;100 million will be available to Enterprise Ireland to support enterprises in the regions to start-up, grow and export, thereby creating more jobs in regional locations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200061#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Action Plan for Jobs","counter":293,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200061#WRK01850"},{"type":"question","counter":294,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[6553\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200061#WRK01900","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"to set out the extent to which it is expected that the skills available, through those on the live register, will be matched to the skill requirements of the workplace, in respect of the indigenous and foreign direct investment sectors, over the course of the next three years; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":295,"content":"<p>As part of the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s Action Plan for Jobs and Pathways to Work, there is a continuing focus on matching the skills of those on the Live Register with the current and future skills demands of both indigenous and foreign owned businesses.

Substantial progress has been made in terms of improving Ireland's competitiveness in recent years and we have climbed to 15<sup>th<\/sup>in the IMD competitiveness rankings. Cost competitiveness is an important aspect of Ireland's overall competitiveness. <br\/><br\/>The real Harmonised Competitiveness Indicator (HCI) is a measure of the trade-weighted exchange rate for Ireland, adjusted for relative price developments. In December 2014, Ireland's real HCI fell by 4.4 per cent year on year. A fall indicates an improvement in price competitiveness and leaves Irish-based firms better equipped to compete on the international market. Relatively low consumer price inflation over the last five years has meant that Irish price levels have fallen considerably relative to our euro area peers. A weaker euro has improved our cost competitiveness in non-euro area markets.<br\/><br\/>There has been a significant improvement in economy-wide cost competitiveness. The European Commission in its winter forecasts estimate that real unit labour costs in Ireland will fall by 2.0 per cent annually in 2015 compared with an increase of 0.3 per cent in the UK, and a fall 0.9 per cent in the euro over the same time period. Competitiveness has been achieved through wage moderation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>trading partners as well as productivity improvements. <br\/><br\/>We continue to monitor Ireland's cost competitiveness on a regular basis. This is specifically required under the Action Plan for Jobs 2015. Action 247 requires the National Competitiveness Council to &ldquo;Benchmark key business costs and publish a report highlighting areas where Irish enterprise costs are out of line with key competitors&rdquo;.<br\/><br\/>The report concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, energy, water, waste, communications and business services. The NCC note that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last four or five years. This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in. However, despite these improvements, the NCC note that it is essential that we continue to focus on reducing costs that comprise a significant percentage of business costs and that are out of line with those in competitor countries. <br\/><br\/>Addressing Ireland&rsquo;s international cost competitiveness, therefore, remains a key economic priority for Government.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200062#WRL00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":304,"content":"<p>Question No. 111 answered with Question No. 102.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Enterprise Ireland","counter":305,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200062#WRL00600"},{"type":"question","counter":306,"qnumday":112,"qnumall":"[6560\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200062#WRL00700","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the extent to which Enterprise Ireland has an adequate portfolio of industrial sites and buildings, available for leasing and letting through various entrepreneurs, in County Kildare; the extent to which enquiries continue to be made in respect of these sites and buildings; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"1016"},{"type":"speech","counter":307,"content":"<p>Enterprise Ireland is the agency under my aegis with responsibility for the development of Irish enterprise, deepening Ireland&rsquo;s footprint in world markets, and supporting employment creation in our economy. To support the delivery of property solutions for entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises nationally, Enterprise Ireland, working with other enterprise partners such as the Local Authorities and other local community organisations, co-funds the establishment of Community Enterprise Centres across Ireland. Since the launch of the first of four Community Enterprise Centres (CEC) schemes in 1989, &euro;46 million has been drawn on for the development of CECs across the country. There are 3 Community Enterprise Centres in Kildare (Athy Community Enterprise Centre; Allenwood Enterprise Park Naas; and Thompson Business Centre Clane).  Enterprise Ireland does not have the management of a portfolio of industrial buildings available for leasing and letting within its remit. From an industrial development perspective, IDA Ireland is the lead agency nationally with responsibility for property solutions. IDA Ireland has a dedicated property unit which is best placed to offer insight into the type, mix and grade of commercial accommodation needed nationally, and is cognisant of the needs of Irish exporting companies in addition to foreign investors, in this regard.<br\/><br\/>Earlier today the Government announced details of its 5-year, &euro;250 million Regional Strategy, aimed at accelerating the jobs recovery in every part of the country. Action Plan for Jobs - Regional - is based on the principle that the best way to support job-creation in towns and villages across the country is to support agencies and organisations within 8 regions, to build on the particular strengths and assets of their area and drive new job-creation strategies and projects. <br\/><br\/>The Strategy is based on the successful Action Plan for Jobs model of setting out lists of actions with timelines and responsibility allocated, and then monitoring implementation. <br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">As Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, I will lead the initiative. Each of the 8 regions will develop its own Action Plan. It is my intention that all Regional Plans will be published or in development by July 2015. <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">Under the Strategy, Enterprise Ireland will launch a series of new competitive funding initiatives in the areas of entrepreneurship, innovation, enterprise infrastructure and job creation. The objective is to bring forward fresh collaborative initiatives to boost enterprise and job creation in the region. An initial fund of &euro;50 million is to be made available for three competitive calls. <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The first of these competitive calls, with a budget of &euro;5 million, will focus on community-driven enterprise initiatives and how all the local players, public and private, can work together to maximise job creation.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The Community Enterprise Initiatives Fund call will be open to existing Community Enterprise Centres (CECs) and also to any other organisation or groups of organisations with innovative ideas to create jobs, promote entrepreneurship, boost innovation or enhance exports. It should be open to any credible and novel approach rather than simply replicating what has been done before.<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">The criteria in any such competition will be announced by Enterprise Ireland, but the typical criteria will include:<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Promoting a culture of entrepreneurship locally and regionally;<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Developing capacity to start up and scale companies; filling gaps in enterprise facilities; <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Building on existing strengths or opportunities, e.g. developing a sectoral opportunity where there is a competitive advantage; <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Devising a credible plan to deliver added value in jobs and start-ups and increased level of exporting \/ potential exporters;<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Commitment of matching finance; <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Bringing originality in approach, objectives, leverage of other stakeholders;<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Leveraging off other enterprise support (Mentoring, funding, networks);<\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">-Promoting public and private partnership, e.g. alignment\/collaboration with others players (e.g. LEO, ETB, HEIs, Chambers etc.) <\/font><br\/><br\/><font color=\"#2F2F2F\">I believe this is a significant challenge and a significant opportunity for the Community Enterprise Centres, in collaboration with others, to deliver new businesses and jobs in their locality.<\/font><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200062#WRL00800","answer":true,"speaker":"1016"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":308,"content":"<p>Question No. 113 answered with Question No. 106.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":310,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200062#WRL01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Payments","counter":309,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200062#WRL01000"},{"type":"question","counter":310,"qnumday":114,"qnumall":"[6349\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200062#WRL01100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"when a person (details supplied) in County Cork will receive an agri-environment options scheme 3 payment for 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In order to achieve these benefits, it is clear that the management of our commonages must be carried out in a cohesive and integrated manner.  The best mechanism to do so is a common plan, drawn up by one Advisor who takes the individual circumstances of each shareholder into consideration and assigns stocking levels appropriate to the individual farmer, within the context of the overall needs of the commonage.  I have met with various hill-farmer representatives on all of these issues, I have listened very carefully to their concerns and I am now very confident that we can deliver a successful implementation strategy for these commonages.  I have taken account of the issues raised and have now provided that a farmer may apply individually to join GLAS on the commonage or commonages on which they farm.  I also know that the question of being excluded from the Scheme because the 50% participation rate is not reached needs to be addressed .

The Greening Payment is an important part of the CAP following the Reform that was agreed during the Irish Presidency in June 2013.  The Greening Payment will amount to approximately 30% of the overall payment made to farmers under the new Regime.  The three main elements of the greening requirements are as follows:<blockquote>- Crop Diversification;<br \/><br \/>- Ecological Focus Areas;<br \/><br \/>- Protection of Permanent Grassland including sensitive grassland.<\/blockquote>As the protection of permanent grassland will be applied at national level, the main two measures that will impact on farmers are Crop Diversification and Ecological Focus Areas (EFA).  The farmers involved are arable growers, who will declare 10 hectares or more of arable land in 2015.  Bearing in mind the complex nature of the requirements, my Department has built an on-line application facility, which will assist farmers in applying for payments under the Basic Payment Scheme and Greening Payment.  Under the EFA requirements, I decided that the following landscape features and areas could be utilised by farmers in Ireland:<table><tr><th>Hedgerows <\/th><th>Nitrogen Fixing Crops (Protein crops) <\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Drains <\/td><td>Catch Crops <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Buffer Strips <\/td><td>Short Rotation Coppice <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Field copses <\/td><td>Land lying fallow <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>BPS Eligible Forestry <\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>The three landscape features are hedgerows, drains and buffer strips.  The others are area-related measures and can be declared as such by applicants, who select one or more of these options in their 2015 Basic Payment Scheme\/Greening Payment application.  My Department, using datasets from Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) and other software applications, established a database of hedgerows, drains and buffer strips for use by applicants in the on-line application.  As these features were identified by electronic means, they will, of course need to be checked and verified by applicants and their advisors \/ consultants.  When the data is verified, the on-line facility will provide applicants with the EFA contribution of each feature in all land parcels declared.  The on-line application will also inform farmers whether they are compliant or not with the greening requirements based on the area details declared by them.  In addition to the updating of the data by applicants and their agents, the database will be updated by the findings of eligibility inspection undertaken in 2015 and subsequent years.<br\/><br\/>With a view to assisting arable farmers and providing as much information as is possible to them before they submit their 2015 application, my Department will issue a complete set of maps outlining the landscape features in each parcel together with a comprehensive Guidance Manual to all arable farmers next week.<br\/><br\/>My Department has worked closely, and continues to do so, with the farming organisations, Teagasc and the Agricultural Consultants Association together with individual arable farmers in developing the application process in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200063#WRM02800","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Single Payment Scheme Administration","counter":355,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200063#WRM02900"},{"type":"question","counter":356,"qnumday":129,"qnumall":"[6454\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200063#WRM03000","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"in view of farmers who have about 90 acres and 34 cattle and who would be in receipt of single farm payments under &euro;10,000, his plans to assist these persons; if a national reserve could be built up; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1056","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":357,"content":"<p>The Single Payment Scheme introduced the principle of &lsquo;decoupling&rsquo; whereby the direct payment received by a farmer was no longer linked to his agricultural production.

Section 15 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in her absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation if satisfied certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. In particular, these conditions require that an applicant is of good character; has had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, has had a total residence in the State amounting to four years; that he or she intends in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisation; and has made a declaration of fidelity to the Irish nation and loyalty to the State in the prescribed manner. A foreign national who is married to, or is the Civil Partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law.<br\/><br\/>It would be inappropriate for me to indicate how specific offences will be considered in any future application as each application is considered on its merits based on the entirety of the case presented at that time. I can inform the Deputy that I am concerned to ensure that the threshold of what constitutes good character is, taking all things into account, maintained at an appropriate level and as such is fair to all applicants having regard to their particular<b><\/b>circumstances.<br\/><br\/>It is open to the person concerned to lodge an application for a certificate of naturalisation if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.<br\/><br\/>The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and I know the Deputy will appreciate that it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.<br\/><br\/>Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

However, the report itself points out that this increase in daily smoking was not statistically significant and that the trend for those aged 12&ndash;17 should be interpreted with caution due to a high relative standard error.<br\/><br\/>I find the report hugely encouraging in that it found that in Australia, 95% of 12-17 year olds have never smoked.  Of greater importance was the finding that there has been a statistically significant decrease in daily smokers aged 14 years or older in Australia, falling from 16.6% in 2007, 15.1% in 2010 to 12.8% in 2013.<br\/><br\/>The protection of children is one of the main themes of <i>Tobacco Free Ireland<\/i>.

In the survey, 12% of children aged 10-17 reported that they were current smokers; which again represents a decrease since the figure of 15% recorded in 2006.<br\/><br\/>The year 2025 has been identified as the date on which Ireland will become tobacco free, i.e. with a smoking prevalence of 5% or less.

SOLAS with the assistance of relevant experts such as the ESRI, employers and local and national organisations have published a five year strategy for the further education and training sector which provides us with a strategic roadmap for this crucial element of the education and training system. The strategy includes a vision of a flexible, quality-driven, labour market-relevant, integrated and responsive sector that supports learner progression, transitions into employment and personal development.<br\/><br\/>  One of the core objectives under the new Performance Framework for the higher education system is meeting Ireland's human capital needs across the spectrum of skills areas through both core funding and specifically targeted initiatives.  Higher Education institutions also engage with enterprise at a local level with a view to the development of programmes tailored to local enterprise needs as well as arranging appropriate work placements etc. <br\/><br\/>  The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) is funded by my Department advises the Irish Government on current and future skills needs of the economy. It has a central role in ensuring that labour market needs for skilled workers are anticipated and met. The expert group's membership is broad and specifically includes representation from enterprise. Its research provides an input to the development of course curricula and informs the selection of new targeted programmes designed to tackle the skills shortages in particular elements of the economy, such as Momentum, Springboard and the ICT skills conversion programme. A new call for Springboard 2015, to include the ICT skills conversion programme, issued on the 28th January.  A guidance document, prepared by EGFSN, on current and future skills needs of enterprise accompanied the call.

The results of the second National Employers Survey will be published shortly.<br\/><br\/>  As part of the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, my Department has committed to develop a new National Skills Strategy.

Over 11,000 resource and learning support teaching posts are now available.

The Department adopts a holistic and integrated approach to supporting the work of schools in promoting positive mental health and to supporting those with the broad range of problems, behavioural emotional and social. <br\/><br\/>  The processes span the curriculum in schools, whole-school ethos, quality of teaching, learning and assessment, student support and pastoral care and the provision of professional development for teachers.

My Department's advice is that schools in the first instance should implement the guidelines documents effectively and when considering collaborating with external agencies in doing work in the area of mental health promotion, schools should be cognisant of DES Circular 0023\/2010 which provide advice on best practice for Social Personal and Health Education. <br\/><br\/>I would nonetheless commend Suicide Aware for its initiative in this regard and wish them success in this venture.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200072#WRV02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Accommodation","counter":626,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW00150"},{"type":"question","counter":627,"qnumday":220,"qnumall":"[6446\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW00200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will provide an update on plans for permanent accommodation for the two schools in Firhouse, Dublin 24, currently being accommodated in temporary accommodation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1057","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":628,"content":"<p>This project to provide permanent accommodation for the two schools in Firhouse, Dublin 24 has commenced architectural planning and it is anticipated a planning application will be lodged in the coming months. <br\/><br\/>  It is envisaged that construction of the new permanent school buildings will commence towards the end of 2015, with a view to having accommodation in place for the academic year commencing September 2016.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Service Provision","counter":629,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW00350"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":221,"qnumall":"[6456\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW00400","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"her views on claims that the proposed new model being designed to allocate resources to children with special needs in mainstream schools has the potential to discriminate against so-called high performing schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1188","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":631,"qnumday":222,"qnumall":"[6457\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW00500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if it is the case that children with an assessed low-incidence-special-educational need will no longer be entitled to special-needs-teaching hours under the proposed new model of allocation; if at present, each child who receives resource-teaching has the legal right to a certain number of hours of such teaching, as determined by the guidelines, and provided by the special education needs organiser.","asker":"1188","askee":"1061"},{"type":"question","counter":632,"qnumday":226,"qnumall":"[6478\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW00600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"regarding the National Council for Special Education's proposed document entitled Delivery for Students with Special Educational Needs: A better and more equitable way, her views on concerns that if professional diagnosis is eliminated then children will be at the mercy of school staff that often have inconsistent levels of experience and training; her further views that without professional diagnosis teachers will be guessing at the problem which hinders the remediation process; and if it is not the case that if the learning difficulty is identified early on by a qualified practitioner the teacher has a much better chance to remediate with proven teaching strategies that meet the particular learning need. ","asker":"1188","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":633,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 221, 222 and 226 together.<br\/><br\/>  The Deputy will be aware that on Tuesday of this week I announced that I am not proposing to change the way teachers are allocated to schools for children with Special Educational Needs for the coming school year.<br\/><br\/>  In making this decision to retain the current model for allocating resource and learning support teachers for the coming year, I have been guided by the advice of the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) Working Group report, which recommended that sufficient time should be allowed for further consultation to take place with the education stakeholders before the new model is implemented in schools. <br\/><br\/>  Through consultations which have already taken place, there was a broad welcome for the proposed new model from parents, disability groups, schools and stakeholders.  However, while there has been significant consultation in relation to the proposed new model, there has not been sufficient time to address fully all of the concerns which have been raised in advance the September 2015 school year. <br\/><br\/>  In particular, a robust mechanism for identifying children with complex special educational needs has yet to be finalised.  Similarly it will be important to ensure that the concerns that successful schools continue to receive appropriate levels of support to ensure that their successes can be maintained are addressed. <br\/><br\/>  In relation to concerns about the removal of professional diagnosis as a basis for the allocation of teaching supports, the response from schools, parents, disability groups, and all other stakeholders who participated in the consultation process has been overwhelmingly positive to this NCSE recommendation.  The view from schools is that, while the professional diagnosis is important in determining whether a specific disability exists, it provides little assistance in understanding the actual learning needs of individual children.  In addition, the reliance on the professional diagnosis can often mean significant delays in providing access to additional teaching support. The proposed new model would eliminate this delay.  <br\/><br\/>  While the proposed new model is not proceeding for the coming year, it is not the case that the proposed new model would deny children access to additional support based on their needs. <br\/><br\/>  Under the current model which will be in place for the coming school year, schools will be allocated support calculated on the basis of the numbers of qualifying applications which are received by the NCSE.  The current model does not entitle an individual child to a quantum of hours as, under the model the allocation is  made to the school for the benefit of all children with special educational needs. <br\/><br\/>  Work will continue in the coming months to develop the proposed model and to address the range of concerns which were identified through the consultations which have taken place so far. <br\/><br\/>  I have asked my Department to design a pilot of the new model which schools could opt into on a voluntary basis.  Continuing consultation with stakeholders will be a vital part of the ongoing work.  <br\/><br\/>  The Deputy will also be aware that this week I also announced the establishment within the National Council for Special Education of a new Inclusion Support Service to assist schools in supporting children with special educational needs.  This service will include the Special Education Support Service (SESS), the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) and the Visiting Teacher Service for children who are deaf\/hard of hearing and for children who are blind\/visually impaired (VTSVHI) which until now have been managed by the Department.  This change is to take immediate effect and is consistent with recommendations of NCSE reports and with the review of the VTSVHI.<br\/><br\/>  This change will mean that schools will receive a better and more integrated service from this new Inclusion Support Service.  The Inclusion Support Service will build on the existing good work and support which NBSS, SESS and VTSVHI provide to children and their families as well as to teachers and schools and which will continue as normal as the new arrangements are put in place. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"School Enrolments","counter":634,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW00750"},{"type":"question","counter":635,"qnumday":223,"qnumall":"[6458\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason Glencullen, County Dublin is not in the catchment area for a proposed school (details supplied) in County Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"999","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":636,"content":"<p>School planning is carried out on the basis of school feeder areas.

However, in schools where there are more applicants than places available a selection process may be necessary.  This selection process and the enrolment policy on which it is based must be non-discriminatory and must be applied fairly in respect of all applicants.  However, this may result in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.<br\/><br\/>Existing equality legislation, which outlaws discrimination in relation to the admission of a student, makes provision for exemptions to apply in the case of single sex schools and in the case of schools where the objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values.  The Equality legislation provides that any primary or post primary school that has this objective may, where it has more applicants than places available, admit a student of a particular religious denomination in preference to other students.  The legislation also provides that a school whose objective is to provide education in an environment that promotes certain religious values can refuse to admit a student who is not of that religion only where the school proves that this refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school. <br\/><br\/>  Article 44.2.4 of the Constitution states that legislation providing State aid for schools shall not discriminate between schools under the management of different religious denominations, nor be such as to affect prejudicially the right of any child to attend a school receiving public money without attending religious instruction at that school.  In this regard, Section 30 of the Education Act (1998), provides that no student can be required to attend instruction in any subject which is contrary to the conscience of the parent of the student.  Therefore, parents have the right, if so desired, to ensure that their children do not receive religious instruction. <br\/><br\/>  It is my firm view that all schools should be inclusive.  It is with this spirit of inclusiveness that the proposed Admission to Schools Bill is designed.  Drafting of the Bill is currently at an advanced stage and the Bill is on the Government legislative programme for publication early in the Spring\/Summer session.<br\/><br\/>  The draft Bill does not propose changes to the existing equality legislation.  The draft Bill, while including provision for single sex schools and denominational schools to reflect in their admission policy the exemptions applicable to such schools under equality legislation, will provide for schools to explicitly state in the school's admission policy that it will not discriminate against an applicant for admission on the grounds of disability, special educational needs, sexual orientation, family status, membership of the traveller community, race, civil status, gender or religion.  The draft Bill will also provide for schools to publish an enrolment policy which will include details of the school's arrangements for students who do not want to attend religious instruction.<br\/><br\/>  The Bill and its associated regulations should see improved access to schools for all pupils and ensure there is consistency, fairness and transparency in the admissions policies of schools and in the service they provide to parents. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1061"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":643,"content":"<p>Question No. 226 answered with Question No. 221.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Further Education and Training Programmes Recognition","counter":644,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW01450"},{"type":"question","counter":645,"qnumday":227,"qnumall":"[6483\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200073#WRW01500","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the Further Education and Training Awards Council level equivalent to the National Vocational Qualification award in England.","asker":"1028","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":646,"content":"<p>FETAC was amalgamated with a number of other qualifications bodies in 2012 to form Quality and Qualifications Ireland (QQI).

The schemes operate by guaranteeing a minimum price for renewable energy generation over a 15 year period.There have been two REFIT schemes that provide support to onshore wind: the REFIT 1 scheme for which state aid approval was obtained in September 2007, and the REFIT 2 scheme which opened in March 2012.

The scheme has an investment cap of &euro;750,000 and may thus be suited to small industrial renewable energy projects.

I propose therefore to reply only in relation to hydrocarbons and mining which are in my remit.    Profits from Ireland&rsquo;s three producing gas fields are taxed at a corporation rate of 25% (double the standard rate of corporation tax for trading income) and royalties are payable to the State from two of these, the Kinsale and Ballycotton fields, at a rate of 12.5% of the fair market value of the gas at the well head. The combination of tax, royalties and rental fees currently provides for a State take of 40% of net income from these two fields. <\/p>  <p>  Royalties are not payable on production from the Seven Heads Gas field as Ireland moved away from a royalty based payments system to a tax based system in 1987. The rental fees figure for 2014 for the three gas fields totalled &euro;0.77 million. The royalties received in 2014 from the two gas fields, and attributable to production in the period 1 October 2013 to 30 September 2014, was &euro;1.98 million. The direct financial return to the State from the Corrib gas field, which is expected to come into production in 2015, will be through the 25% corporation tax on profits. <\/p>  <p>  There is no commercial production of oil in the Irish offshore.<\/p>  <p>  In June 2014 Government approval was received to revise Ireland&rsquo;s oil and gas fiscal terms along the lines recommended by international energy consultants Wood Mackenzie. A key recommendation of Wood Mackenzie was that tax rates in respect of new licences should be revised to ensure a higher share for the State from the most profitable fields. This would result in the application of maximum rate of 55% in the case of new licences. My Department is working with the Department of Finance and Revenue Commissioners to give operational effect to this approach.<\/p>  <p>  A report on the non-petroleum mineral sector carried out by independent economic consultants Indecon in 2013 showed that mineral exploration and mining companies contributed a total of &euro;56.6 million in tax and other payments to the Exchequer and to local authorities during 2012. In addition, the State benefits from payments made by mining and prospecting licence holders in the form of royalties, licence fees and other payments. The most recent figures availble for these payments are for 2014, when &euro;6.45 million was received in total, comprising Prospecting Licence fees of &euro;0.34 million, and royalties and rents from State Mining facilities totalling &euro;6.11million. Profits from mining are taxed at 25%. <\/p>  <p>  Several factors impact on the level of State take from a producing gas field or mineral mine, such as the wholesale price of gas and the global price of mineral commodities, which are subject to significant movement over time, as are production levels. As such attempting to accurately estimate future State receipts over the next ten years would be a speculative exercise. <\/p>  <p>The amount paid in taxation in respect of Ireland's producing mines or gas fields is a matter between the companies concerned and the Revenue Commissioners and not one in respect of which I have a function.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200076#WRZ02200","answer":true,"speaker":"1024"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Better Energy Homes Scheme Data","counter":726,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200076#WRZ02300"},{"type":"question","counter":727,"qnumday":257,"qnumall":"[6530\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015021200076#WRZ02400","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the annual cost of grants under the better energy homes scheme in each year from 2012 to 2014; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"1024"},{"type":"speech","counter":728,"content":"<p>The Better Energy Homes Scheme is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) under the Better Energy Programme.The table below details the number of homes that received energy efficiency measures under the scheme from 2012 to 2014 and the amount of Exchequer funding disbursed on grants to the homeowners.<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>-<\/th><th>2014<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Programme<\/td><td>Homes Grant Aided<\/td><td>Spend<\/td><td>Homes Grant Aided<\/td><td>Spend<\/td><td>Homes Grant Aided<\/td><td>Spend<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Better Energy Homes<\/td><td>26,426 <\/td><td>&euro;28.95m<\/td><td>13,710<\/td><td>&euro;13.16m<\/td><td>9,927 <\/td><td>&euro;9.9m<\/td><\/tr><\/table><br\/><br\/>Since the launch of the Better Energy Homes scheme in 2009 163,471 homes have received energy efficiency upgrades, with the payment of a total of &euro;171 million in grants.
