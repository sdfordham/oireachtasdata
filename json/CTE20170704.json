Members are well aware of the Government's decision of May 2011, which put new arrangements in place for the appointment of persons to State boards and bodies.  Reference to this arrangement is also made in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on appointments to State boards of November 2014.  In 2016, the programme for Government suggested that nominees for chairs of State boards will be required to engage with the relevant Oireachtas committee prior to their appointment.  This committee welcomes the opportunity to meet with the chairperson designate in public session to hear his views and we trust that this provides greater transparency to the process of appointment to our State boards and bodies.<\/p><p> I welcome Mr. Holden and invite him to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#A00400","speaker":"1315","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499184000,"counter":9,"content":"<p>I an honoured that the Minister has decided to reappoint me to the chairmanship of the board and I welcome this opportunity to explain to the committee something about the Digital Hub Development Agency and how I expect it to develop over the coming years.<\/p> <p>  The hub has a multi-faceted brief and three main ways in which it contributes to Irish society, namely, the enterprise development aspect, the urban regeneration aspect and the community development aspect.  Our role is to create an environment in which an enterprise cluster can develop.  A cluster attracts a variety of businesses of different sizes and different stages of development which are engaged in similar activities or complementary activities where, by virtue of their close proximity, they can learn from one another, help one another, buy and sell from one another or share facilities talent, ideas and costs.  Our job is to make this interaction as frictionless as possible.<\/p> <p>  The simple view of what we do is that we are just landlords, albeit extraordinarily flexible landlords on account of providing lease agreements which allow companies to expand easily and shrink when they have to shrink within the hub.  Beyond the simple view, we are also facilitators in a whole variety of ways.  We provide a world-class technical infrastructure for the companies we host.  We provide meeting rooms, as and when they are needed, an on-campus cafe and networking events, educational events and advice clinics.  We have a centralised reception and security facilities and all these are things which emerging companies would normally have to look after themselves.  It would cost them and distract them from their core business.<\/p> <p>  Our cluster currently has 95 companies, with 750 employees in total.  One of our most important achievements is that roughly half are Irish-owned, the other half being foreign owned, which presents great opportunities for learning from one another, supporting one another, trading among themselves and opening up geographical and sectoral markets in which they can help each other.  Clusters of this kind enable things to happen that would not otherwise happen, and faster than they would otherwise happen.  We envisage that the concentration of companies will attract to the area, though not necessarily to the hub itself, all sorts of specialist support services such as legal services specialising in intellectual property or in mergers and acquisitions, financial experts who are plugged into sources of finance, graphic designers, web designers, marketing experts, translators and so on.<\/p> <p>  Continued growth of the cluster ties in with the second aspect of our mission, which is urban regeneration.  When it was established, the agency was made custodian of a significant property portfolio, including 19 buildings spread over nine acres.  Many of these are listed buildings and are of architectural of historical value but many have been disused for a long period and are in a poor state of repair.  Our challenge is to treat them with the respect that such a heritage deserves while repurposing them and converting them into productive use.  Without very significant State investment, we have to do this in conjunction with the private sector and the project stalled for a number of years during the recession, when it was difficult to get private developers involved.  Things have begun to pick up in that respect.  At the end of 2015, we succeeded in securing the conversion of a grain storage facility, which once stored the raw materials for making whisky by the George Roe distillery, into modern offices.  In the 1800s, it was the largest distillery in the world and exported some 2 million gallons of whisky per year.  The building was a grain store but now it is a brain store - instead of being used for heavy industry it is being used for intellectual activity.  In return for the work carried out on the grain store we transferred title to a disused warehouse at the back of our campus, which had been in a very poor state of repair.  The developers constructed two blocks of high-quality, modern student accommodation, which are now fully operational and house almost 500 students.  This has brought a huge level of economic activity into the area.<\/p> <p>  We are currently engaged in a process to secure the redevelopment of a large site on the south side of Thomas Street, including a vat house which was formerly part of the Guinness facility.  It will be a very significant development that will revitalise a big stretch of Thomas Street that is currently very run down and unattractive.  It will bring employment and economic activity into the area and will have a positive impact on tourism, because it is just around the corner from one of the biggest tourist attractions in the country, the Guinness Storehouse.  Most important for us, it will significantly increase the amount of office space we have for our clients and allow us to expand the cluster further.<\/p> <p>  The third part of the digital hub's project is our integration into the local community.  It is located in the Liberties, where there is a very strong local community and a tradition of hard work and enterprise.  Our vision sees the digital hub as an integral part of that community, just as Roe's distillery was in time gone by and Guinness still is.  In partnership with the National College of Art and Design, we have been working with young people in the locality to help them to master digital technologies and become active producers of various things of which they would normally be passive consumers, such as graphic design, fashion design, video production, music production etc.  We have been working with local schools to help them derive maximum value from digital technologies and we have run programmes for older people parents and others who have had limited exposure to digital technologies.<\/p><p>We are working with local businesses to help them develop their web presence and realise the potential of online trading.  Together, these three aspects of the Digital Hub's project mean that the hub makes a contribution at many levels, not only economic but also social and cultural.  It is my hope that this will continue in the years ahead.<\/p><p> If any members wish to visit the Digital Hub to see what we are doing, they would be very welcome.  I am happy to answer any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#B00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Holden","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499184000,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Holden for his presentation.  I will start with my own questions before bringing in my colleagues.  I note a recent article in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>by the Digital Hub's CEO in which he describes trying to attract companies with 150 employees.  How does Mr. Holden see that fitting in with his current operation?<\/p><p>I understand that approximately 64% of the Digital Hub's revenue is self-generated, with the rest coming from State funds.  Are there plans to grow that revenue?  Does Mr. Holden believe that, in light of the way it is currently constituted, the Digital Hub Development Agency can be successful?  Finally, on economies of scale, can Mr. Holden see the Digital Hub taking advantage of linking in with the likes of Google?  I ask Mr. Holden to note those questions as I will call on my colleague, Senator Leyden, to speak next.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#C00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1499184000,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Holden and congratulate him on his appointment.  The Digital Hub was under enormous pressure during the recession.  The concept is brilliant; the hub utilises an area of the city which was run down and which it has regenerated.

Does it bear any relation to the development of further inward investment?  I presume the hub receives support from IDA Ireland.  I presume the agency is promoting the Digital Hub internationally.<\/p> <p>  In light of Brexit and what is going to happen, I imagine the Digital Hub should be focusing on the British market and hoping to attract small companies that would like to avail of a base in a central location in Dublin.  I think the hub is doing its best in a very difficult climate.  Temple Bar was a concept of the late Charles J. Haughey and has been very successful in regenerating that part of Dublin.  I am aware that the area in which the Digital Hub is located has architectural merit, with the development of the grain store and so on.<\/p> <p>  The Digital Hub is not confined to digital work in respect of developing the campus.  Nine acres is quite a lot of land in a very strategic location.  Mr. Holden made the point that the development agency worked with a private developer to develop student accommodation.  That is very practical work done with the private sector.  I have great time personally for State companies like the one of which Mr. Holden is chairman, which have the flexibility and imagination to develop.  They have the opportunity to go beyond what private developers can do because they have the support of the State in respect of finances, loans and so on.<\/p> <p>  I wish Mr. Holden and his board every success in the future.  I certainly have not come across any difficulties with the Digital Hub and I am delighted it survived.  During the recession, the troika and the rest would have been delighted to close down everything.  The Digital Hub is very lucky to have survived and can now only go from strength to strength.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#C00500","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speech","time":1499184000,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. Holden and apologise for being a little late.  I missed the very start of his presentation.  I have always been a sympathetic supporter of the Digital Hub.  I think it was in the late 1990s or early 2000s that it was initially conceptualised by, if I recall correctly, Mr. Ahern.  It seems that the Digital Hub has always had involvement with over 90 companies and has always had the same property deals in play.  It has always had good relationships with the local community.  The companies located there have been an important part of turning Dublin into a hub for start-up businesses.  However, the world has moved on.  We are now established as a venture capital and digital centre.  A lot of the activity is located by the docks south of Samuel Beckett Bridge in the quarter called SOBO District, especially for smaller companies.  Is it time for a rethink and recalibration?  While this is not to criticise, what I heard today sounds very similar to how one might have described where the hub was at seven or eight years ago, when I had more of a connection with it.  Perhaps that will change when the hub gets new office space and is able to expand.  Is it time for a strategic rethink?<\/p> <p>  Over the years there  consideration has been given to bringing the hub under Dublin City Council, while Enterprise Ireland and other bodies were considering other institutional structures.  The Chairman asked about the governance structure.  Is there blue-sky thinking about what comes next?  The answer may be for the hub to stick to what it is doing because that is working.  The hub is a valuable part of Dublin's and the national infrastructure.  Having listened to Mr. Holden's presentation, my overriding feeling is that it is very similar to what has been there for the past ten years in both scale and nature.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#C00600","speaker":"1294"},{"type":"speech","time":1499184000,"counter":16,"content":"<p>I invite Mr. Holden to go through those questions at his leisure.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#C00700","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499184000,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I will work backwards, if I may.  For the past few years, the Digital Hub has been host to over 90 companies.  That is true.  However, it is not the same 90-odd companies all the time.  We have a constant throughput of companies.  That is quite a difficult trick to achieve as we have to be able to manage the companies coming in and the ones going out in order to maintain our occupancy level, which is at virtually 100% at all times.  That brings us to the Chairman's question about room for expansion.  At the moment, we literally do not have any room for expansion.  However, we do have a property portfolio, which is the only asset we can leverage to develop additional office space and revenue and - to arrive at another of the Chairman's questions - become financially self-sustaining.  The ultimate objective is to use the assets we have to become financially self-sustaining and to continue to attract more businesses into the area.  The hub should be a magnet for businesses while supporting enterprise in the same area.  We can already see that happening as there are some support and service type businesses in the immediate vicinity of hub although they are not our clients.<\/p> <p>  In respect of governance structures and so on, as has been stated, the plan is to transition the hub under the aegis of Dublin City Council as soon as possible.  I understand that legislation is in preparation to do so.  That will change the governance structure.  The intention is that the hub will be created as a company controlled by the council.  That will allow it to get on with its business.<\/p> <p>  Senator Leyden asked about the level of Exchequer funding.<\/p><p>The State funded us to the tune of &euro;1.5 million last year for operational purposes.  This is down considerably from even a couple of years ago when I think &euro;1.7 million was available for operational purposes.  In that time, our commercial income has increased from &euro;1.5 million to &euro;2.7 million, so one can see that we are already making strong progress towards self-sufficiency.  Within our current envelope, we have cut our costs and increased our commercial income quite considerably but there is probably a limit to what we can do until we get further office space to generate income for us.<\/p><p> The Chairman asked about the possibility of getting bigger companies into the hub.  At the moment we just simply could not accommodate them.  However, the ideal mix would include some companies that are larger, and of necessity have sub-supplier requirements, and can buy in specialist expertise.  That will allow companies which have that specialist expertise to grow in their shadow.  That is the international experience.  Large companies tend to have a collection of smaller companies that survive by being sub-suppliers to them.  Our ambition would be to have some larger companies as almost anchor tenants so that we could encourage a sub-supply team to grow up around them.<\/p><p> The Senator asked about our relationship with IDA Ireland.  This week, the Minister announced the appointment of someone from IDA Ireland to our board.  We have had representation from IDA Ireland on the board for as long as I can remember.  IDA Ireland almost routinely, when bringing them into the country, bring FDI companies to visit the Digital Hub to see what is going on there.  Many of the FDI companies, even the largest ones, start off in the Digital Hub when they come to Ireland first.  It is what we call a sort of soft landing point where they can start their recruitment drives and do the groundwork to build up their team here.  On Brexit, attracting companies in from the UK is very much on our mind.<\/p><p> Senator Leyden asked whether we are restricted to just digital activities.  The Act specifies that we are a digital hub development agency.  The enterprises we are interested in developing are involved in digital business of some kind, be it digital content or technical application of some kind.  The benefit is in the clustering activity that I described.  They may be even taking or stealing staff from one another but they are bouncing ideas off one another, challenging each other in a whole variety of ways or assisting each other in co-operatively going after a market.  They can help each other in a whole variety of ways.  However, we are a digital hub development agency.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#C00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Paul Holden","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499184000,"counter":19,"content":"<p>I will bring in Senator Leyden who wants to ask a question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#D00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speech","time":1499184000,"counter":20,"content":"<p>The amount of money involved seems to be very low for something that has such potential.

This is our first engagement with it and I welcome Professor Pauric Travers, BAI chairman, Mr. Michael O'Keeffe, BAI chief executive, and Ms Stephanie Comey, BAI senior manager.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#E00200","speaker":"1315"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499184000,"counter":39,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to meet them today as part of the committee's series of meetings with regulators.  In these days of Wimbledon, our presentation will be a double-hander.  As chairman, I will give a brief retrospective on the recent work of the authority and Mr. O'Keeffe, our CEO, will outline some of the strategic priorities for the period ahead.<\/p> <p>  As the committee knows, the BAI regulates Irish broadcasting.  Our key functions include licensing, drawing up codes and rules in accordance with legislation, performance reviews, the provision of funding, monitoring and enforcing compliance, considering complaints from viewers and listeners, supporting development and fostering understanding of the media.  Last year, 2016, marked the final year of our three-year strategy and the preparation of a new strategy for the period 2017 to 2019.  Our annual report for 2016 is going to print.  We signed off on our accounts at the end of June and will forward that information to the committee in due course.<\/p> <p>  As part of the transition in 2016, we undertook an extensive review of the outcomes of our previous strategic plan, including market research on public and industry perceptions of the BAI.  This showed that the BAI is seen as a trusted and effective regulator.  It also identified a twin challenge, namely maintaining that trust while maintaining relevance in a rapidly changing media landscape.  In meeting those challenges and delivering our new strategy, we are committed to collaborating closely with broadcasters, the Department, other stakeholders and members of the joint committee.  Effective policy and practice requires research that is well focused.  Among several research projects supported by the BAI is Ireland's inclusion in the Reuters Institute for the study of journalism digital survey, which is a comparative longitudinal study.  The latest report, which was recently launched, confirms a rapid shift to mobile devices, customer resistance to paying for news and high levels of dissatisfaction with news sources internationally.  However, a welcome finding in respect of Ireland is that trust in news remains strong compared to other countries, especially trust in traditional media.  A major challenge in the rapidly changing environment is sustainability, in terms of business models and quality journalism.  There are some positive signs that concern about fake news is contributing to a demand for quality journalism.  The message seems to be that investment in quality can pay dividends.<\/p> <p>  The major challenge for Irish broadcasters at local, community and national level is to continue to produce quality content that is culturally relevant.  The BAI has sought to support broadcasters in responding to this challenge through a variety of initiatives.  These include: the sound and vision scheme under which &euro;27 million has been allocated to 286 projects over a two-year cycle; the commemoration of the 1916 Rising through support for radio and TV programming at local and national levels; the cultivation of an archiving culture with &euro;5 million invested to support archiving schemes; and collaboration with the Canadian media fund to promote joint Irish-Canadian projects.  This is a timely initiative, given the visit by the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Justin Trudeau.  It offers a potential model for other international collaborations.<\/p> <p> The Broadcasting Act 2009 imposes specific obligations on the BAI in the context of media literacy.  In December, we launched an ambitious media literacy policy aimed at empowering audiences to make informed choices about the media they consume.  We hope this will equip viewers, listeners and citizens with the capacity to access, critically evaluate and, if necessary, challenge media, in ways which are indispensable for the well-being of the individual and society.  Our work in this area will not seek to reinvent the wheel.  We recognise and affirm the work done by other agencies and we will seek to add value by creating and supporting a media literacy network.<\/p> <p>  I will now had over to my colleague, Mr. O'Keeffe, who will speak about the strategic plan of the authority for 2017-2019.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#E00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Pauric Travers"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499184000,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I thank Professor Travers.  I will provide a brief introduction and then go into some of the detail.  We launched the current statement of strategy in February.  It covers a three-year period and we are developing multi-annual work plans.  I want to discuss the five strategic themes that give us the focus for our work.  They are: promoting diversity and plurality; achieving excellence in accountability; communicating and influencing; empowering audiences; and enhancing innovation and sectoral sustainability.  There is a series of strategic objectives and outcomes within the document under each of these themes.<br\/><br\/>I will start with promoting diversity and plurality.  There are number of headings under this theme.  The first involves our broadcasting services, which capture much of the licensing work we do.  We are about to embark on a significant piece of research which will examine an environmental and economic analysis of the Irish marketplace to determine the potential, if any, for additional services or changes in the nature of the services we currently operate.  We have ongoing licensing plans and are running a plan for community radio.  We completed a fairly significant plan for commercial radio in the past number of years.  We license a range of services.  In addition to local and community radio stations, with which the committee will be familiar, we also have content provision contracts for services which are carried on cable and satellite platforms.  They come under section 71.  An interesting dimension to this is that, under the audiovisual media services, AVMS, directive, there is the potential for services which are licensed in the UK but which are currently seeking to base their operations in other jurisdictions as a result of Brexit to consider locating in this jurisdiction in light of the similarities in the regulatory regimes and language.  It may be an issue for us in the coming years.<br\/><br\/>On media plurality, we have supplied a copy of the Reuters report to which Professor Travers referred to the committee.  Some of the findings are quite interesting.  Professor Travers did not mention the rise of<i>the.journal.ie <\/i>to the top position in terms of people accessing news.  Its profile has steadily grown over a three-year period and it has now reached the pinnacle, which is an interesting development.  Under this heading, we will also carry out a three-year review for the Minister on changes in plurality across the period.  The report will be published next year, I understand.<br\/><br\/>We are due to review the ownership and control policy around Irish broadcast services.  The other element is media merger evaluations, which come on request from the Minister.  We do not initiate media merger evaluations.  Under the Competition Act we will do that work.  Under this heading, we will also examine the increased diversity in society and are placing a particular emphasis on gender and language in the current period.  One of the issues under the heading of the diversity and culturally relevant content is the sound and vision scheme, to which the Chairman referred.<br\/><br\/>The next area involves two strands.  One is external and will involve the compliance of broadcasters.  This covers their compliance with commitments they have given in their contracts and the compliance and commitments RTE and TG4 will give in respect of their services.  The other is internal and we have a robust record system which we need to develop further.  We have high standards in environmental governance and social practice, such as financial management, a code of corporate governance and initiatives in support of the environment.  We will develop those further over the period.<\/p><p> Our third area is communicating and influencing.  The major aspect here is the revision, at European level, of the AVMS directive.  That revision will, to some extent, change the nature of regulation.  In particular, it will bring some dimension of regulation to non-traditional, non-linear on-demand services such as Netflix, which will be subject to some form of regulation under this revision.  YouTube and other video-sharing platforms will also be subject to some elements of regulation.  We are playing a very active role at European level in conjunction with our colleagues in the Department on the revision.  I understand the committee will be covering the new broadcasting legislation next week so I will not go into it except to say we will be playing an active role with the Department and other regulatory bodies on that.  Finally under this heading is our communications strategy, which is around how we deal with public affairs and liaise and engage with the public.  In the past 12 months, we brought forward a new website designed to be more user-friendly in allowing the public to access what we do.<\/p><p> The fourth area relates to empowering audiences.  Professor Travers spoke about media literacy activities.  We have the first meeting of the network today.  We are also looking at developing codes and rules here.  These include: the general commercial communications code; a review of the access rules, which are the rules on subtitling and sign language; and the introduction of the short news reporting code of practice whereby broadcasters take extracts of major events.  Interestingly, it was the first time in all my experience of dealing with codes that there was absolute unanimity.  No one disagreed with any of the provisions we had in that.  It would be great if that were the case more often.  The other aspect of this area with which members will be familiar is the complaints process.  We have tried in the recent past to make it a bit more user-friendly so that it is easier for people to make complaints in respect of broadcasting matters.  A final element of this theme is the participation of the public in media.  We see that in particular in the communities sector where we seek to get more involvement from people there.<\/p><p> Our fifth and final theme comprises two strands.  One is the funding of broadcasters.  I will not go into too much detail on that, particularly as we are committed to attending the committee's forum on broadcasting.  We also made a presentation to the committee on the matter last November.  We look forward to Friday and what will emerge from that session.  One of the big pieces of work for us is the five-year review of public funding of both RTE and TG4.  We have started that process and hope to report to the Minister in the first quarter of next year.  The final element of that is linked back to the first slide I showed on the broadcasting services strategy.  The review process will look at the models we have in radio at present because of funding challenges and how sustainable services are.  That will look at the rules and regulations applying to the local and commercial radio sectors, in particular, where these challenges exist.<\/p><p> The second element of the theme is creativity and innovation.  We have, as Professor Travers mentioned, the Canadian joint fund, which is one of our sound and vision ancillary schemes.  We are meeting some other people to develop a separate one.  There are four projects in train as a result of the fund established by ourselves and the Canadians this time last year.  Creative Ireland is a recently established interdepartmental group to which we are contributing through our representative on it.  There is a whole range of things under sectoral learning and development.  We provide a great deal of funding and other supports to the various networks such as the Community Radio Forum of Ireland, CRAOL, the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, Learning Waves and others.  We also have a number of innovation schemes.  We have a training scheme for people who are involved in writing creative drama for which we provide funding.  We also have a media research funding scheme to which we have allocated &euro;50,000 for research projects.  We do those over the course of a number of years and they cover different topics.<\/p><p> That was a whistlestop tour of what we do and we are happy to answer any questions members have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Keeffe","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499184000,"counter":42,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.

That is important from the committee's point of view having regard to our oversight function in respect of the BAI.<\/p> <p>  When will the children's commercial communications code come up for review?  Is there an expected date for the consultation and who will undertake the review?  Will the BAI consult extensively with stakeholders, including, for example, the Department of Health, which has primary responsibility for promoting World Health Organization, WHO, protocols?  There may also be other health organisations which might be part of that consultation.

They made very interesting presentations.  I have both questions to ask and comments to make.  I congratulate the BAI on the 1916 commemorations, which were successful.  The radio and television inputs there were highly successful also.  I am happy that, as a natural spin-off from that, the BAI is involved in the Creative Ireland project, which has enormous potential to bring the arts to every child and adult irrespective of social background or location.  It is enormously liberating for people and has huge implications for quality of life and tourism.  I am delighted the BAI is involved.  Having regard to the great success of the 1916 commemoration and without seeking in any way to politicise the committee, I must congratulate my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, for her political leadership in respect of this matter.  There is a consensus on that.<\/p> <p>  The references to Creative Ireland and 1916 lead me to the work on archiving RTE programmes.  It comes within the brief of the BAI to see that this happens.  Those programmes represent a huge social history of our country and are a major artistic resource in themselves.  What work is being done to archive and rebroadcast them?<\/p> <p>  No one in the room will say TG4 is not an enormous success.  It is very popular.  What is exciting is the number of non-Gaelic speakers who watch, enjoy, relate to and are very pleased with it.  The position is similar in the context of Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta.  I am not sure that I sense there is an adequate presence of the Irish language and Irish culture on RTE 1 and RTE 2.  The witnesses might correct me if I am wrong in that regard.  I would be very happy to be proven wrong.<\/p> <p>  Plurality was mentioned.  Local radio is a hugely important medium, in particular for a certain demographic which might not access other media, including modern multimedia.<\/p><p>Are the witnesses confident that local radio is playing on a level pitch or could more be done to support it?  Is it adequately supported?  I am approaching this as a lay person based on anecdotal evidence but one gets the impression it is underfunded or under-resourced, perhaps also in terms of commercial input. <\/p><p> The witnesses talked about structures, funding and plurality in multimedia and I want to raise a question while they are here because it is relevant.  It would be remiss of me not to bring it into the debate and seek a reaction although in many respects it is probably more germane to Friday's meeting.  I would like all three witnesses to respond because it is a serious matter.  There are people in the country with a certain belief and if what they believe is true it is very serious.  If what they believe is not true it is still serious.  The traditional religious population of the country - people who hold what we consider conservative, traditional values - feel very alienated at the moment.  They have a perception that the broadcast media is against them, their culture and set of beliefs, that it is not reflective of their views, beliefs and practices and does not give adequate expression to them.  I have not met any who are suggesting they should have exclusivity but they are feeling alienated.  They may be completely wrong and the witnesses may be able to readily establish that for me.  If they are wrong, how could their firm belief on this be addressed?  I will finish but it is a very important point.  I am only doing my job.  Very educated people with numerous degrees, including postgraduate qualifications, come to me with this view.  It is not the view of only one sector of the population.  It is the view of quite a range of people, some of whom have very high educational levels.  It does not matter what level of education they have but it would be too simplistic to assume their view is based on some form of ignorance because it is not.  I am interested in the witnesses' response to it.  They will probably tell me it is more germane to Friday's discussion.  I can live with that because I can raise it again then.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#F00300","speaker":"1397","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499184000,"counter":45,"content":"<p>I will bring in Deputy Ryan.

It is hard to get a big turnout in these meetings when something is happening.  I thank the witnesses for the presentation and the survey.  The Reuters Institute digital news report is very informative.  I do not know if it has had much coverage in the media.  I do not think it has.  I will concentrate on local radio.  Local radio is providing the service in our area.  Local radio, Shannonside radio, Northern Sound, Radio 103 Offaly-Westmeath and Midwest Radio are the only stations bringing real, local information to local people, whether it is the events of a county council meeting or current affairs.  The views of Oireachtas Members are broadcast regularly on those stations.  No one has every complained they were deprived access or not allowed to have their views expressed.  Yet the BAI is not giving them the support they deserve.  They will not be able to continue broadcasting current affairs without support from the licence fee or some form of support.  The cost involved in providing current affairs is very expensive.  Most of the local sports programmes are sponsored by some company because it is an attractive package.  Current affairs is different because it cannot be sponsored.  There is no point in having a politician or Oireachtas Member sponsoring a programme because it is not allowed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#G00400","speaker":"1393"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499184000,"counter":48,"content":"<p>We allow it on radio.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#G00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael O'Keeffe"},{"type":"speech","time":1499184000,"counter":49,"content":"<p>I am not fond of that idea.  I do not agree with any political party or politician controlling current affairs.  They are the people with the deep pockets.  If they are allowed to that, I oppose it.  I do not agree at all with that.  It gives them regular appearances.  Community radio was mentioned.  In most places, it is dying on its feet.  There is no revenue coming in.  Local schemes have been withdrawn.  Employment schemes have been withdrawn.  Community employment schemes were available to community radio.  They never got the traction that was hoped for simply because very few people flick stations.  Some people listen to Shannonside radio all day and then they might watch the 6 O'clock news on television.  I do not know what the BAI can do to support community radio but I wish it well.<\/p> <p>  As far as the national service is concerned, home produced drama is very attractive and very expensive but it attracts the biggest audiences.  Current affairs is wall-to-wall at the moment.  One can start out with \"Morning Ireland\" and end up going through it again on the Sean O'Rourke show, then move on to \"News At One\", then another programme, then \"Drivetime\" and it goes on and on.  The story is reproduced, which is fine.  Some people would like current affairs 24 hours a day.  Some mornings I turn it on to Lyric FM to hear Marty Whelan.  It is a relief sometimes when they go on and on.  Access to shows such as the Marian Finucane show seem to be restricted to a panel.  It seems to be the same panel.  Deputy Eamon Ryan might be more regularly on it than people from outside the Pale.  I do not hear many people from outside the Pale on the Marian Finucane show on Sunday mornings.

The Reuters report confirmed what we knew, that is, that we listen to a lot of radio in Ireland and tend to do radio well here.  Obviously, there are significant financial challenges for local radio, to which we will come in a moment, but there are financial challenges right across the board regarding the business model for all the national broadcasters as well.  Some steps have been taken to try to ease the situation for local radio, but we recognise and accept - this is what we are addressing in the strategic theme relating to sustainability - that there is a fundamental challenge regarding the funding model right across the board.<\/p> <p>  This brings me to the elephant in the room which Deputy Ryan mentioned, that is, that we have a broadcasting context and landscape which has been fixed and is shaped by a particular set of legislation and that, in the meantime, the world is changing rapidly.  It is to be hoped some of this will be addressed by the AVMS when it is finalised, but we certainly accept the anomalies that exist.  These anomalies are growing in terms of what is and is not regulated.  At the heart of this is a financial issue which means that the funding - the revenue - which might go to supporting local radio, community radio or Irish national broadcasters is being hoovered up and is going elsewhere.  This is not an issue that can be easily resolved.  The full resolution of it does not lie within the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland or even within the Oireachtas.

In the past, we had what used to be called service level agreements.  We do not have them anymore.  My understanding is that this is linked to the fact that we are an independent regulatory authority with a board.  We are answerable to the Oireachtas joint committee and also to the Committee of Public Accounts.  Given that we are an independent regulatory body, having KPIs that would make us answerable to the Department raises some questions.  The independence of regulators, in particular in the broadcasting area, is a huge issue at a European level because governments in certain countries - not this one - seek to interfere with their broadcasting sectors.  Given the power of broadcasting, it is still a very powerful medium, despite certain developments.  We have an agreement in place to have quarterly meetings at which we agree and send the Department all our strategic objectives and deliverables.  We give the Department copies of our accounts and all the statutory requirements we have, but we do not formally answer to the Department.

It is very difficult to measure the impact of regulation in this area, and this is a problem with which most of Europe is grappling.

I know that RTE has been working on its archives, particularly its news archive.  I was talking to someone just this morning about this and I understand RTE will launch a major development regarding its archives.  As I mentioned in my presentation, we have an archiving scheme which has funded some very significant projects.  The scheme is being reviewed and we will come forward with proposals in that regard.<\/p> <p>  Regarding TG4's and RTE's programming, we meet both organisations and we have met the new ceannaire of TG4.  They have presented their new strategic plan, which is very well focused.  We also meet and have discussions with RTE regarding its performance in a number of areas.  This includes performance in the area of Irish, so we are certainly conscious of the issue and we ask RTE leading questions and searching questions about this and other areas.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the point Senator O'Reilly made about the perception or feeling that people of a particular religious disposition are not properly represented, I do not think it is a matter of whether it is right or wrong; if that is the perception, that is a great pity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/CC22017070400002#H01200","nonspeaker":"Professor Pauric Travers"},{"type":"speech","time":1499184000,"counter":64,"content":"<p>Yes.

That may not bring any great financial benefit because many of them are likely to base the majority of their workforce in the UK and their European licence would be based in this jurisdiction or somewhere else.  It could bring a bureaucratic headache for us to process a range of licences which may not bring an economic benefit to Ireland.  We are weighing up some of those issues.  In general terms, our policy is that we should be permissive and welcome companies that want to locate in this jurisdiction.  In the long term that may have benefits for production and other aspects and develop a greater production sector here.

I am joined by Mr. David Malone, financial controller at the Irish League of Credit Unions.  The league is the largest credit union representative body on the island of Ireland, with a total of 289 credit unions out of 302 in the Republic of Ireland affiliated to it.  We exist to provide leadership, co-operation, support and development for credit unions in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland where we have another 90 affiliated credit unions.<br\/><br\/>On social housing, there is clearly a social crisis.  There was also a context and timeline relating to the committee's consideration today of how credit union funds can be used to deliver housing in this crisis.  In November 2014, the Government published Social Housing Strategy 2020 predicated on &quot;private sector finance which will be raised from a variety of sources which could include the EIB, ISIF, Pension Funds, Credit Unions and other financial institutions, both domestic and international&quot;.  In response to that specific request, the league made its detailed proposal, Social Housing Funding, in October 2015.  In June 2016 the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness as a priority recommendation stated, &quot;The Government should seek to mobilise as quickly as possible, all possible sources of funding, including funding from the Housing Finance Agency, Strategic Investment Fund, the Irish League of Credit Unions and Irish Pension Funds, to increase the supply of social and affordable housing.&quot;  The Department of Housing, Community and Local Government policy document, Rebuilding Ireland, published in July 2016 states:<\/p><blockquote>The Government is also committed to a range of other structural, funding and policy supports to increase delivery by AHBs.  Among these measures will be the establishment of an Innovation Fund to support the development by AHBs of innovative financial models ...<br \/><br \/>Support will be provided from this Fund to an Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH)\/sector-led new special purpose vehicle, involving investors, including the Credit Union movement. <\/blockquote> <p>To date no fund has been established, despite our willingness to invest and insistent lobbying to be allowed to do so.  The crying need for social housing has not been supported by credit union funds, which are available.  There are two roadblocks.  One is regulatory and requires the Central Bank to change the criteria for permitted credit union investments.  The second is the establishment of a financial vehicle, as committed to by Government in Rebuilding Ireland.<br\/><br\/>The Central Bank issued its consultation paper, The Consultation on Potential Changes to the Investment Framework for Credit Unions, also called CP109, in May.  The league's response has been sent to the committee.  This consultation paper has some positive aspects which we welcome, but others we are very concerned about.<br\/><br\/>On social housing, the Central Bank is considering if it would be appropriate to facilitate the provision of credit union funding to approved housing bodies by way of investment.  The initial potential levels of investment proposed by the Central Bank would be up to up to &euro;900 million which, on the basis of 70% finance provided by credit unions at an average notional social house cost of &euro;200,000, would fund close to 6,500 homes.  If followed through, this would be a significant step forward.  More broadly, but closely connected, the same set of proposals will contribute negatively to the downward pressure on investment income being earned by credit unions.  Our affiliated credit unions currently have just under &euro;2 billion invested in bank bonds which are an important source of investment yield.  The restriction set out in the consultation paper will severely curtail the universe of bank bonds that credit unions can invest in.<\/p><p>The investment yield for our Republic of Ireland credit unions declined from 3.6% in 2012 to only 1.4% in the six-month period to March 2017.  We estimate that the current 1.4% annualised yield from credit unions' investments would decline to as low as 0.3% per annum in the coming financial years.  How can credit unions have a sustainable future business model in the context of these future projected investment yields?  Given that CP109 would effectively eliminate investment returns, it is essential that investment rules are amended to allow for centralised lending of mortgages and loans to small and medium-sized enterprises in order that some of the &euro;10 billion of surplus funds in credit unions can be lent out.<\/p><p> As the Rebuilding Ireland policy document is being reviewed, our request to the committee is to advocate strongly for the implementation of what has been committed to by Government and recommended previously by the special Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  The Central Bank may, further to its consultation paper, at last allow credit union investment in social housing.  The net issue then is for Government to deliver on its commitment to establish an appropriate vehicle to do so.<\/p><p> Then there is a wider housing agenda beyond social housing and how that links holistically to the overall viability of credit unions at the very moment our economy has returned to astonishing levels of concentration in mortgage lending especially, but other types of lending also .  We need action immediately from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to enable investment in social housing.  This should be accompanied and underpinned by real engagement, led by the Department of Finance, to develop a credit union model that can do the \"much more\" it is so ambitious to do across the board for communities and the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Malone wish to say a few words or shall I go straight into questions?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#D00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499162400,"counter":179,"content":"<p>We welcome the feedback on CP109 in respect of the proposals relating to the approved housing bodies' investments.

I am a member of a credit union and wish to acknowledge the work of the Irish League of Credit Unions.  It is a mutual society, its work is highly reliant on voluntarism and other factors and it is community-based.  It is to be welcomed that representatives of the Irish League of Credit Unions are here and have made their pitch.  The Irish League of Credit Unions makes some very valid points in what is a very concise and to-the-point presentation, for which I thank Mr. Farrell because it is important to get to the kernel of the issue.<\/p><p>Mr. Farrell made the point that Rebuilding Ireland will be reviewed, as the Minister has said.  It is timely that the Irish League of Credit Unions' proposal be looked at again in the context of the Government's commitment.  As Mr. Farrell pointed out, the Government acknowledged that, among other financial institutions and as part of the Rebuilding Ireland strategy and programme, it would look at the idea of the credit unions.  Mr. Farrell said in his opening statement that &quot;there are two roadblocks&quot; and he set them out very clearly:<\/p><blockquote>One is regulatory and requires the Central Bank to change the criteria for permitted credit union investments.  The second is the establishment of financial vehicle, as committed to by Government in Rebuilding Ireland.<\/blockquote> <p>These are valid points.<\/p><p>I wish to ask Mr. Farrell two questions.  First, would individual credit unions outsource all investments and decisions to the proposed special purpose vehicle?  He might elaborate on that.  Second, is there sufficient expertise within the credit union sector to become involved in offering loans for social housing?  Where all this is coming from is important in terms of centrality, decision-making, oversight, policy and governance.  There is a huge number of issues here, and proven expertise must be demonstrated by the credit union movement.  I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#D00400","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I thank both bodies for their presentations.  It was appropriate that the committee acknowledge the process commenced by the Central Bank and also acknowledge and support the submission made by the Irish League of Credit Unions.<\/p><p>We have been saying, until we were blue in the face, that there is a crisis in the provision of housing and an emergency in the provision of social housing.  This is a no-brainer.  We have the potential for &euro;2 billion in investment which could yield a return to the credit union movement and provide up to 6,500 social housing units, but there are two roadblocks.  The Government needs to open the two roadblocks.  The Rebuilding Ireland document made a vague commitment to look at the potential which exists in this financial vehicle to support the industry by allowing new finance into the market to create more competitive finance in the marketplace than the restricted finance available from the pillar banks.<\/p><p> This is an emergency but this is available to assist in addressing the crisis.  However, the Government and the Central Bank are procrastinating and it is just not good enough.  As Senator Boyhan said, this is a simple document and it is clear about what it sets out to achieve.  It has benefits for all concerned and I have no question to ask of the witnesses today.  I just want to voice my full and vehement support for the recommendations.  I have made a submission on behalf of our party supporting that stance.  I implore Government and the Central Bank for movement in this area.  We are told that NAMA is in the process of winding down and that it has the potential for &euro;2 billion.  NAMA also has the NARPS model which promotes a similar type of vehicle to what is being proposed here, one which does not impinge on European regulation.  It is not on balance sheet but an off-balance sheet methodology that can work and yield results.  There is a role for NAMA as an authority in respect of the management of these and other funds, to ensure we find a way out of this crisis with real and meaningful ways of doing things, different from how we did things in the past.  Relying on conventional methods, which the Government is pouring money into, is just not working.  It did not work under Deputy Kelly's plan, it did not work under Deputy Coveney's plan and it will not work under the current Minister's plan.  This is the way social and affordable housing has to be delivered.  Let us get on and do it.  Let us ensure this committee plays its part in demanding that Government moves in this direction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#D00500","speaker":"1217","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":183,"content":"<p>Many of us are enormously frustrated, as is the Irish League of Credit Unions, with the fact that for two years the league has made a series of presentations to the relevant authorities but we are still here discussing it.  Many of us in this committee, and across the House, share this frustration.  Our party has advocated, in the Committee on Housing and Homelessness and previously, that we need a portion of these funds to be released for precisely the purposes outlined by the witnesses today.  As Deputy Cowen has done, I have made a submission to the Central Bank as part of its consultation, which fully supports the proposition.<\/p> <p>  There is a double win if the State does this, because this is additional money.  No funds can be used to provide housing within the Government's housing action plan but it can be used to provide additional units over and above those targets and this is the real value of what is being proposed.  We should stress this very clearly.  The submission refers to three funding frameworks outlined on page 3.<\/p><p>My own preference - that is what I stated in the submission on the Central Bank - is for option 2, primarily in terms of the capacity of the tier 3 approved housing bodies to deliver units, certainly in the first three to four years.  The second option in terms of the annual funds that would be released is probably the most credible not from the point of view of the credit unions, but from theirs.  Obviously, if their capacity increased then, the total quantum of the fund could be increased as well, but even on that basis one would be looking at an additional 17,500 units delivered over six years.  That is an additional 2,900 units, which would be hugely welcome.<\/p><p> We have been asking repeatedly what has been the real obstacle to a decision on the release of the funds for social housing.  I invite the witnesses to be as frank as they can to let us know where is the blockage.  We all know off the record or we have our own assumptions but it is important, as part of our attempts to put pressure on the relevant authorities to make the funds available, that the witnesses would share with us whatever information they can about where the obstacles have been.<\/p><p> I would like the ILCU witnesses to talk a little bit about their preferred model for the shape of the fund.  The Government's housing action plan was outlined but is that the preferred model of the credit unions and that, as outlined in their schedules, they would put a sum of money into a fund where there would be other private sector funding - the Irish Council for Social Housing would be part of that - and tier 3 approved housing bodies could access that on an ongoing basis in terms of individual projects?  Would that be a rolling fund and as opportunities came up for the approved housing bodies, either sites to buy or to build, they could come and seek loan finance?<\/p><p> If I understood it correctly, the Irish League of Credit Unions talked about the possibility of 100% loans versus the 70% loans, with matching funding from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the local authorities.  From within the ILCU's risk assessment, is it conceivable for such a fund to provide 100% loans, obviously with the guarantee of the availability agreement coming through?  If that is the case then there would be less reliance on the public funding and that could be used elsewhere in the public housing system.  Has there been discussion with the approved housing bodies in terms of their capacity to deliver units?  With the best will in the world, even if one has unlimited funding but the sector can only deliver so much.  To what extent are the funding schedules on page 3, as a result of any of those engagements?<\/p><p> Has the ILCU had any discussions with the Department on the possible redesignation of approved housing bodies as State entities and therefore on-balance sheet?.  I am sure the witnesses are aware of the ongoing review between the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, the CSO and EUROSTAT.  If EUROSTAT and the CSO take the decision here that has been taken across the water in Britain that would obviously change some of the rationale for what is being proposed here, although not substantially in my view.  Has the Department included the ILCU in that conversation or are the witnesses aware of those issues?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#E00200","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":185,"content":"<p>I welcome the work done by credit unions over the years.  When I was younger and buying my house, we got our bridging finance from the credit union.  Credit unions are hugely helpful to people, in particular when they are buying homes or making any significant purchase.  My question is slightly different from some of the questions that have been asked.  One of the difficulties I find is that many of the people who are in trouble with their mortgages are with companies whom I would call vulture lenders, in other words, they charge way above market norms.  People are with such companies because the traditional lenders would not lend to them because they are considered high risk and they are paying a higher premium as a result.  Many people are still trying to hold on to their homes and as their economic position improves they could sustain a lower rate mortgage, but they cannot sustain the rate they are being charged.  Does the ILCU think there is a role for credit unions in the context of the social service they provide to people who would be a higher risk for lending but are in real trouble?  They want to hold on to their homes but they cannot find any sustainable way to do so.  Has the ILCU thought about that as an option, in other words, that people who are with those companies, whom we all know, could approach a credit union with a view to getting a standard rate mortgage at a sustainable rate, which they did not get previously?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#F00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":186,"content":"<p>I thank the gentlemen for their presentations and record my frustration that the issue has not been resolved.

I focus today on approved housing bodies and the relationship with them.  Is there enough governance in place in the approved housing bodies, in particular given their growth to almost 120 bodies in the last three years?  It is a significant increase.

Certainly, it is preferable to borrowing from banks.  While I support the league's right to put its proposal, it is not a total no-brainer.  There are issues around it.  The problem in housing overall is not really finding funding because the Government has access to funds should it choose to use them.  Last week, the Government chose to pay down debt from the sale of AIB rather than to use the money for housing.  The rate the league is talking about is 2.5% and I have seen 3% or 4% on previous occasions.  That is still higher than using those funds or the funds in the Irish Strategic Investment Fund.  NAMA, of course, has cash reserves of &euro;3 billion.  The key issue I have is not so much with credit unions but with all of these concepts.  It is the desperate search to find a special purpose vehicle which does not breach EU rules.  We have to stop trying to avoid impinging on EU rules, otherwise we will not resolve this emergency.  The scale of what the credit unions can provide bears no comparison to what local authorities could provide, given their lands and expertise, if they were funded.  That is the essential problem.  I see the credit union proposal as a possible supplement but it is no replacement for the tried and tested method of providing housing on a faster, cheaper and larger scale, which is what we need.<\/p> <p>  The other issue I have has been discussed at the committee before, namely, the proliferation of approved housing bodies.  There are problems with them from the point of view of tenant representation, as they tend to provide much less support than one has from a local authority where councillors can step in to assist people who are having rent or other issues.  We have all had stories about trying to make contact with them.  Even in respect of pyrite, there is an approved housing body we cannot get to communicate with us in the way we can with a local authority.<\/p> <p>  Is there an international or other model under which the league can foresee credit union funds being lent?  Is there a risk to credit union members if credit unions get involved in the housing market?  How can the league mitigate that risk?  The last thing we need is credit unions gambling the money of those who rely on them and their ethos of co-operation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#G00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499162400,"counter":188,"content":"<p>I go back to Senator Boyhan's question on individual credit unions and their credit decisions.  He asked if they had the required expertise.<\/p><p>Yes and no.  There are examples of individual credit unions lending for social housing on a small scale, but the Government's ambition here for the approved housing bodies in on a much larger scale than for individual credit unions or individual smaller approved housing bodies.  That is the whole idea behind the special purpose vehicle mentioned in the Rebuilding Ireland report and policy.  Collective credit union money on one side would initially go into the fund as per the Central Bank's proposals.  We agree with that when it comes to the tier three, the biggest ten or 12 approved housing bodies.  The idea is that that fund would then have, either as employees or as a retained firm, people with credit expertise who would help the fund and its shareholders: the credit unions, pension funds and possibly the Strategic Investment Fund.  It would not just be the credit union's money that would be in that fund.  <\/p><p> There would certainly be expertise then to help make the credit assessment and credit decisions to ensure that the money is put to a safe purpose for whichever individual approved housing body and project.  This would be the case whether the project involved one house or ten houses and whether it involved building or buying.  Whatever that individual project might be, it has to be a safe and good improvement project.  Individual credit unions do not have and would not claim to have the expertise to do the credit assessment on a &euro;500,000, &euro;1 million or multi-million euro loan for a project of that size.  That is why the Government's policy is to have a fund or a collective, as it were.  The risk is mitigated by being part of a collective.  <\/p><p> Deputy Cowen reiterated his support and the fact that he previously sent a submission to the Central Bank's consultation paper.  <\/p><p> Deputy &Oacute; Broin referred to tier three and to the preferred model.  Our paper and our proposal is ultimately a response to the Government's initial policy document in 2014, the Social Housing Strategy 2020.  It was then refined to reflect the updated Rebuilding Ireland plan launched last July.  It is fair to say that the 2020 strategy was the Government's policy to enhance the role of approved housing bodies as distinct from local authorities.  That is not our area of business, however.  Our forte lies in taking in money from and providing loans to our 3 million members.  Our surplus funds, as I mentioned in my opening address, amount to almost &euro;10 billion.  We are looking to put this surplus into social projects.  The money has to be safe, of course, which is why there is a need for credit assessment and credit expertise at a collective level.  The model set by the Government's policy is to grant more and more involvement to approved housing bodies and to look for outside funding, not just from credit unions but also from the Strategic Investment Fund and from pension schemes, both national and international.  <\/p><p> When it comes to development and acquisition, individual approved housing bodies would approach the fund with proposals for individual projects.  The quicker ones to reach the market are those to acquire completed or 90% completed houses.  These might be in unfinished estates and the like, although that market has probably largely dried up at this stage.  Buying a green or brown field site and then developing it obviously takes longer.  Initially there would probably be a bridging loan for the first 12 or 24 months.  When the house is built, certified and handed over to the tenants there would be a 30% capital advance from the Department.  When the rental agreement and the payment and availability agreement with the tenant kick in we would then set the loan up for 25 to 30 years.  We see the fund as having a role in both development and acquisition, though probably more in acquisition to begin with.  As we get up and running and gather practical experience, however, there is no reason that we would not have a bit of both.<\/p><p>We have met with PricewaterhouseCoopers, the advisory firm, as part of the Irish Council for Social Housing's remit for this fund, and it was talking about a mix of acquisition and development.  I know it is appearing before the committee after us and it will be able to provide more detail.  We are more interested in the funding than the actual housing side.  <\/p><p> The 100% or 70% is related to the model.  The model, as we understand it, is that there is a capital advance payment known as the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, which is worth up to 30%.  Large approved housing bodies will get 30% of the project cost on a loan that only has to be repaid after 20 or 25 years if the house does not remain part of the social housing stock.  It attracts a low rate of interest but does not get repaid as long as the house is in social housing supply.  The other 70% is borrowed.  In theory that 70% will be borrowed from the fund.  Credit union money would make up some of that fund.  That is the model.  We did not design the model.  It is a safe model for the lender, whether the lender is the housing finance agency, HFA, which is the current main lender, a private bank or this fund made up of credit union money and other moneys.  It is as if a private person has a 30% deposit for their house.  It is not 80%, 85% or 90% mortgage territory.  It is 70%.  We would draw the analogy of a borrower having a State job and the State stepping in, if the borrower did not repay the loan, to repay out of his State job earnings.  There is a step-in arrangement if the approved housing body disappeared or got into difficulty.  The borrower is almost guaranteed its money because it is only a 70% loan initially, and the loan repayment ultimately comes from the payment and availability agreement, which is the rental subsidy from the local authority for the tenant, and the tenant then pays a smaller top up.  <\/p><p> The approved housing bodies are in communication.  We have had many meetings since the end of 2014, since that initial social housing strategy that the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, brought out.  We have had many meetings with the Irish Council for Social Housing, which is the apex body for approved housing bodies, and with individual housing bodies.  We have met with CEOs and finance directors.  PricewaterhouseCoopers is assisting them on this special purpose vehicle.  We have also met with other financial advisers that the housing bodies were engaging with during 2015, 2016 and this year.  We are in constant communication with them and feel that we have a good understanding now of their business model.  We have reviewed their annual accounts and their governance structures.  <\/p><p> Deputy Casey mentioned governance and regulation or the lack thereof, but housing bodies are now becoming a regulated industry.  Tier 3 incorporates ten or 12 of the biggest approved housing bodies, tier 2 incorporates some of the smaller bodies and tier 1 incorporates the very smallest.  The 80:20 rule applies to any of our organisations.  There are ten or 12 of the really big bodies and then hundreds of the smaller ones.  The tier 3 housing bodies are now learning what it is to survive in a regulated environment.  I would not speak to their experiences within that regulated environment.  They are appearing before this committee later.  Certainly credit unions operate in a highly regulated environment.  They are regulated by a division of the Central Bank of Ireland, which is the registry of credit unions, to a very high standard, so we would have comfort that the approved housing bodies, some years after the credit union movement, are now regulated.  Certainly from now on they are going to be operating in a highly regulated environment, which will provide more comfort on top of the financial contracts that I spoke about earlier, encompassing the 30% and the guaranteed rent.  We have had excellent working relationships with the approved housing industry since 2014.  <\/p><p> The on-balance sheet versus off-balance sheet debate is going on all the time.<\/p><p>They are trying to keep the approved housing body model off the balance sheet.  The Government's desire or requirement is for the social housing model to stay off the balance sheet.  That is not something that would involve the Irish League of Credit Unions.  We have responded to the current structure for the delivery of social housing.  If the discussion about what is and what is not on the balance sheet goes in a different direction, or if the payment and availability of models like the 30% CALF model changes, we will have to consider the changed scenario, structure and environment.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Dowd spoke about individual members having toxic loans or loans with very high interest rates from non-main street lenders.  We are talking about private mortgages for private houses.  Credit unions are allowed to offer mortgages as a small percentage of their lending.  Up to 10% of their loans by value may be offered for periods in excess of ten years.  Such loans are generally housing loans.  Under their laws and regulatory rules, individual credit unions are allowed to allocate small amounts - up to 10% - of their loans for housing and for mortgages.  Now that the global financial crisis has ended and people have more confidence in the Irish economy - perhaps the economic recovery is more evident in the cities than it is as one travels out - more and more people are approaching credit unions to see whether they can switch their mortgages from their current providers, which may include high street banks, non-high street banks and the remains of loan portfolios that were bought from foreign banks that exited the Irish market.  To be fair, as Deputy Coppinger mentioned, the credit unions have to make sure such loans are as safe as possible and have as good a chance as any other loans of getting repaid.  Ultimately, it is some other local person's money.  We always advise members to give the facts to the people in the credit union and they will do their damnedest to facilitate them.  When one goes into a credit union, one deals with somebody who understands one's situation and the decision on one's application is made by that person or somebody else in that building.  The decision will not have to be relayed back from regional or national headquarters.  At least there will be a sympathetic ear.  At the same time, it has to make some financial sense.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":192,"content":"<p>It has to be sustainable in the context of the applicant's existing income.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#K00200","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499162400,"counter":193,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#K00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":194,"content":"<p>There is no doubt about that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#K00400","speaker":"1329"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499162400,"counter":195,"content":"<p>The interest rate could be much lower in the credit union.

An overwhelming majority of them - more than 90% - said they were very supportive of the CP109 proposals in respect of social housing.  We got feedback from them about the importance of the investment diversification provided by investment in social housing.  At the moment, over 90% of the credit union movement's investments are with banks in the form of bank bonds or bank deposits.  In many ways, credit unions are somewhat over-exposed to the banking and financial sector as a counterparty.  Social housing can provide a significant element of diversification for them.<\/p> <p>  The credit unions have a regulatory reserve ratio of 16% at the moment.  This means they are exceeding the 10% minimum requirement by six percentage points.  Across the movement, this equates to &euro;900 million, or approximately the level of funding suggested in CP109 as the maximum level that could be invested to yield 6,500 homes.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin spoke about the level of housing provided.  It is interesting to note that our survey suggested that the credit unions would be willing to engage in further funding of that sector.  If 20% of the credit union movement's investment base were dedicated to housing, almost 14,000 homes could be provided.  There is certainly a commitment in the sector to provide substantial social funding for social housing projects.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#K00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Malone"},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":197,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Farrell have anything to add?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#L00100","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499162400,"counter":198,"content":"<p>I think I have more or less said what I have to say.  Deputy Coppinger suggested, in the context of the AIB sale, that funds are not the problem.  It is not really for us to comment on that.  The Government's position, or Europe's position, is that the Government is under an EU mandate to use the AIB proceeds for something other than capital spending.  We will assist in the social housing area if we are asked to do so.  We started this process in 2014.  I suppose the 2020 document was the written request.  We had been engaging for a few years before any documents were produced in this space.  Interest rates were at a totally different level back then.  In 2014, the rate was approximately 3.5%, which would have been the average in this area.  It was at 2.5% in some of the material that was drafted by financial advisers more recently, including late last year.  Obviously, interest rates have been decreasing even further.  We are into negative interest rates at the European level for the foreseeable future.  The latest proposal involved a 2.5% rate.  We have not had detailed conversations because, as we understand it, the fund has not been opened and is not nearly up and running.  We do not have details of the interest rate.  If it is 2% or 2.5%, it will represent good value for the approved housing body.  I know the current rates are going to be much lower if they are on the balance sheet than if they are off the balance sheet.  If a rate of 2% or 2.5% is secured, that is much better than what is being achieved in Government bonds or in bank deposit accounts at the moment.  It would then be a question of issues like prudence and credit assessment, about which we had a conversation earlier.  Assuming that stacks up, a rate of 2% or 2.5% would be economically viable for us.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Coppinger's final point related to the risk to members' funds.  We cannot speculate.  No credit union will decide to put its members' funds at risk.  Every credit decision, from a &euro;500 loan for Christmas or a communion to a &euro;5,000 loan for a car or a loan of &euro;50,000, &euro;75,000 or &euro;100,000 for a house, is put through the wringer internally in every single credit union.  Some credit unions even seek outside assessment from experts as well.  It is certainly the case that the credit unions exist because their 3 million members trust them.  If they tried to do anything that was too risky or not worthy of being approved, the Central Bank would not allow it.  The boards of the credit unions would not want to do anything that was not within risk parameters or not appropriate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#L00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Farrell"},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I will take a few more questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#L00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":200,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their answers.  I have two follow-up questions, the first of which relates to the possibility of 70% loans, as opposed to 100% loans.  The approved housing bodies have an availability agreement that is guaranteed by the State.  They also have the step-in clause that has been mentioned, which means that the local authority can step in if something happens to an approved housing body.  I presume the existence of these two arrangements means there would not be a huge amount of additional risk if a 100% loan as opposed to a 70% loan, were provided.  The only reason I am asking is that the 30% CALF complicates the lending procedures.  Given that the two safety nets to which I have referred - the availability agreement and the step-in clause - are in place, what is the view of the credit union movement from a financial risk management point of view about the possibility of having the 100% loan option?<\/p> <p>  I want to go back to the first question.  I think it is really important for us to press Mr. Farrell on it.  Two years ago, capital investment in social housing by the State was at rock bottom.  It was approximately &euro;400 million per annum.  Many of us challenged the Government to increase capital investment.  It said it did not have the money.  We challenged that and identified other sources.  At the same time that the Government was saying it did not have the money, the Irish League of Credit Unions and others were putting on the table amounts of money that were equivalent to what the State was spending at that point.  I am working on the basis of the figures provided by the league.<\/p><p>The credit unions are proposing an annual fund from their own resources, let alone from other funds that may be available, equivalent to what the State was funding at that point, somewhere between &euro;347 million and &euro;520 million.  Everybody wanted to know about funds and we asked the Departments of Finance and Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government about this.  The Government said it had no funds but the credit unions said, \"Yes, we have funds, here they are and here is the sustainable model for funding\".  From the sector's direct experience with the Central Bank and the Departments of Finance and Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, can the witnesses tell the committee who was blocking the access to those funds?  I believe the public has the right to know.<\/p><p> The credit union sector was saying that it could double the amount of investment in social housing in a way that is good for the credit union members and for the people who need the housing.  Somebody was stopping the sector from doing that.  Was it the Central Bank's Registrar of Credit Unions, the Department of Finance, the Minister or was it the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government?  Without putting the representatives too much on the spot, could they give their experience of those engagements over the past two years?  We are talking about 10,000 to 15,000 homes.  This is the kind of quantum of units that could have been commenced two years ago and built over a six year period, if this had been taken up when the sector first proposed it.  These are not trivial amounts of homes and families that would have benefited if the Government had taken up the offer two years ago when it was first made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#L00400","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":202,"content":"<p>There are no further follow up questions before I go back to the witnesses.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#M00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499162400,"counter":203,"content":"<p>With regard to the 70% and the 100% figures, it would certainly not be the same if the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, disappeared and we were at 100%.  It would not be as risky or the same as a bank or a credit union giving a 100% mortgage to an individual person, because there is the payment availability that guarantees 92% to 95% of the market rent by the local authorities or by an arm of the State.  The rent is guaranteed and there is the step in, as the Deputy and I have mentioned.  It would certainly not be as risky or as out there as lending 100% mortgages would be.<\/p> <p>  At the same time, I believe that while a 100% mortgage would be a bit far, it is possible there could be somewhere in between because if the value of property went down again, everybody would find themselves in negative equity again.  This would not be so good because the accounting has to be reflected on balance sheets.  If the stock of housing at the approved housing body level dropped substantially again, there would be minus figures in the accounts.  This would not look right even if the houses remained rented and the rent was still coming in.  It is possible that somewhere between 70% and 100% would still leave it safe but with some extra capital and investment for social housing by means other than approved housing bodies.  I presume this is where the Deputy is coming from.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the roadmap or the path we have been on for the past two years, to be fair to the Irish League of Credit Unions and the approved housing bodies, early on we identified issues with three significant arms of the State.  The Central Bank is the credit unions regulator and we operate in an environment that is highly regulated by the Central Bank.  It is very prescriptive and rules driven, and had been long before any global financial crisis.  We were never run on the principles-based system, rather it was always on the rules-based system.  We have a very prescriptive rule book in legislation and in Central Bank regulation on what credit unions can and cannot do, on how much they can lend and for how long.<\/p> <p>  Very early on in the debate, or in the journey, we outlined that the first issue was that credit unions could not invest in a collective to do with approved housing bodies.  They could only invest in bank bonds, Government bonds and bank deposit accounts.  That was one issue on which we have worked and lobbied the Central Bank.  We had Members in both Houses to help us do that.  The consultation paper that issued in May looks like it is going to open the door to a first phase that could allow up to &euro;900 million to go into tier 3.  As a first phase, I believe it to be a good start.  There is a commitment from the Central Bank to review that in two years to see if we are looking good and if the approved housing bodies are proving a good investment class for credit unions.  The consultation paper issued in May and we started the conversation back in 2014, so it is there but it took a while and a lot of work by us and others to get that consultation paper.<\/p><p>It looks like in the next three months, by the fourth quarter, it will hopefully be up and running and we will be open for business.<\/p><p> The other arms we had identified were the Department of Finance and its role in looking after credit unions on behalf of the Government, and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in the context of housing and social housing.  The capital advance leasing facility, CALF, and the payment and availability, P&amp;A, agreements came out.<\/p><p> We have worked with the Departments on the special purpose vehicle also since the Rebuilding Ireland report was issued one year ago, as Deputy Cowen said.  During the past year we have lobbied and pushed hard in this regard.  We met the then Minister, Deputy Coveney.  Before that, we met the then Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, and recently we met the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, to push them on the commitment in the report for the special purpose vehicle.  As we understand it, they are to provide some support.  The Rebuilding Ireland report states that \"Support will be provided from this [innovation] Fund to an Irish Council for Social Housing (ICSH) [approved housing bodies] sector-led new special purpose vehicle, involving investors, including the Credit Union movement\".<\/p><p> We have been meeting with the two Departments, as the second and third arms of the State in this context, and pushing hard since the end of 2014 and especially since the Rebuilding Ireland report was issued one year ago.  The report contains a clear commitment and a clear sense of direction from the Government that it is going to make this special purpose vehicle, or sponsor it, for the approved housing body industry in order to create this fund.  We have met PricewaterhouseCoopers, who they have engaged.  The NTMA and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund were also mentioned in the Rebuilding Ireland report as the other State agencies that could or would be asked to come in and help to administer the fund.  Professional advisers, custodians and trustees, etc., must be employed by these funds to be compliant with their own regulations.  All of those funds, and this one in particular, would be regulated by a funds division of the Central Bank, which is a different division from the credit union registry.  It would be a regulated entity in its own right and would have to have professional advisers in the background.<\/p><p> Now that we seem to have the Central Bank door slightly ajar, or looking like it might be ajar later in the year, we will now have to increase our focus and push on to make sure the Departments come through for the approved housing bodies to have the fund so they can take in credit union and non-credit union money.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ed Farrell","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":205,"content":"<p>With the payment and availability agreement being linked to a percentage of market rent, does this create an uncertainty?

We would assess whatever model is there.  When credit union money starts coming into the pipeline, we will have to get expertise to adjudicate if the model is as tight as can be, if it could be tighter, and, if modifications were to be made, the pros and cons as a bundle.  As a model, it appears to be a good, secure model with the CALF, the P&amp;A and the step in.  We can consider tweaks and changes.  We are always on one side or the other of a problem.  Property is going up too fast now but three years' ago it was the opposite domain and one would be sorry to be in a market rent.

We are four housing bodies - Cl&uacute;id, Co-Operative Housing Ireland, Oaklee Housing and Respond! - that co-operate on matters of housing supply.  We are four of the larger approved housing bodies, AHBs, and collectively provide more than 12,500 homes for families across Ireland.  Some 3,000 of these have been delivered in the years since 2010 or, in other words, since the end of 100% capital funding.  We have a delivery pipeline of 6,000 new homes to be delivered over the remaining years of the Rebuilding Ireland plan and are potentially some of the largest customers for credit union investment.  All of us are tier 3 AHBs, have experience in accessing private finance and have been certified for lending by the Housing Finance Agency.<\/p> <p>  The national housing action plan, Rebuilding Ireland, identifies AHBs as key delivery partners for social housing, recognising \"their track record in terms of both housing provision and management\".  This builds upon support for the sector in the Housing Policy Statement 2011 and Social Housing Strategy 2020, published in 2014.  There is a clear and ongoing Government policy of support for AHBs playing a central role in social housing delivery.<\/p> <p>  Rebuilding Ireland sets out the key recommendation that the Government \"should seek to mobilise as quickly as possible, all possible sources of funding, including funding from the Housing Finance Agency, Strategic Investment Fund, the Irish League of Credit Unions and Irish Pension Funds, to increase the supply of social and affordable housing\".  Regarding credit unions, the proposed addition of investments in tier 3 AHBs as a permitted investment class is welcome to us as a potential additional source of finance as we seek to play our part in responding to pressing local housing need.  It would assist in promoting credit unions to our members and tenants and would offer an opportunity to showcase the potential for local social investment by the movement.<\/p> <p>  For our organisations, credit unions play a key role in local communities in promoting sound money management, providing access to travel, education and home improvements, and tackling the challenges associated with moneylenders.  The ongoing sustainability of the credit union movement is vital to us and the members and tenants whom we represent.  We also see key additional benefits for credit unions themselves from the higher yields that may be possible compared with the current range of permitted classes of investment.  It would also allow credit unions to invest in a highly visible way in the delivery of services of value to the local community and to strengthen their bonds with their members.<\/p> <p>  Liquidity and stability are obviously key issues for all financial services providers.  As the Central Bank's consultation paper notes, at the end of 2016, credit unions had assets of &euro;16.1 billion, loans of &euro;4.1 billion and investments of &euro;11.4 billion.  Given the range of permitted investments under the 2006 guidance note, it is clear that the movement as a whole has more than adequate levels of liquidity and is suffering from falling rates of investment income.  We believe that diversification of the investment portfolio can be undertaken to provide for improved investment returns while sustaining adequate liquidity levels.<\/p><p> As a proposal that would support AHBs and credit unions, we welcome the consultation from the Central Bank on credit union finance for social housing.  We have provided a collective response to that consultation and have circulated a copy of it to the committee.  In it, we set out some of the key features of the funding arrangements for new AHB delivery through the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, and the payment and availability agreements.  These and associated schemes can provide confidence to the Central Bank and credit unions about the robustness of social housing as an investment class.  We are happy to provide more detail to committee members during our conversation.<\/p><p> The current consultation represents the culmination of many years of work by credit unions and housing providers in seeking to make the case for locally backed social housing delivery.  The Housing Alliance would value the support of this committee in the context of the current consultation, both for the benefit of housing delivery and for the good of the credit union movement.<\/p><p> We thank the committee again for the opportunity to present to it and we are happy to answer whatever questions members might have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#S00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brennan.

At the risk of us boring other committee members, some of us will probably repeat some of our comments from the start of the previous session so that the witnesses can know where each of us stands.<\/p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the work being done by the witnesses' organisations and their efforts to access credit union and other sources of funding.  As they will know, we argued for it at the Committee on Housing and Homelessness last year and have again argued for it in our submission to the Central Bank's consultation.  We share the witnesses' frustration over the length of time it has taken this proposal to reach the point of the Central Bank considering it as a possibility.  Some of the signals seem to be positive.  We are conscious, particularly as constituency representatives who work with families that are homeless or at risk of homelessness, that if the decision by the powers that be had been taken two years ago when the credit unions first made their approach, thousands of families that are not housed currently would have been.  That is an important point for everyone to acknowledge.<\/p> <p>  I will ask a couple of technical questions and I am interested in the witnesses' opinions on them.  The payment and availability agreement has always been a complex issue to be negotiated by AHBs and the Department and local authorities.  The current system uses a percentage of market rent as opposed to, for example, a calculation based on the cost of paying down the loan plus the AHBs' maintenance of the properties.  Would the latter be a preferable model and provide more certainty or would the situation balance out between the swings and roundabouts and peaks and troughs of the rental market over 25 or 30 years?<\/p> <p>  In the witnesses' experience, do the payment and availability agreements cover their organisations' housing management maintenance and staffing costs?<\/p> <p>  Going by our discussion with the credit unions, the current arrangement is 30:70 between CALF payments and private financing.  Is there an argument at this juncture for us to consider 100% loans so that there is no additional 30% requirement?  Would that be advantageous or disadvantageous to AHBs?  Does the 30% CALF payment benefit AHBs' overall financing and the structure of that or would 100% loans give them more flexibility?  I would be interested in the witnesses' views.<\/p> <p>  A significant issue for the AHB sector is the capacity to deliver units.  In its submission to the Central Bank, the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, set out three funding schedules that in some sense depend on what the witnesses believe is their organisations' ability to deliver.  If there was the type of funding that the ILCU and others are proposing, what do the witnesses believe their organisations could deliver above and beyond what is currently in their pipelines?<\/p> <p>  I am interested in the witnesses' thoughts on affordable housing.  Traditionally, AHBs provided differential rent social housing.  There is considerable demand for affordable renting and purchasing from middle-income families.  Is that an area into which the sector could expand?<\/p><p>What kind of funding could be provided and what are the witnesses's thoughts on that?  My final question is for Mr. Coyle.  The Irish League of Credit Union's submission to the Central Bank listed the tier 3 approved housing bodies on the basis of their stock in this jurisdiction.  Oaklee obviously has a very significant amount of housing stock in the North of Ireland and people may not know that it is a much bigger housing association on this island than suggested by  its 400 units here in the South and the information before the committee.  The members of this committee might benefit from having a clearer sense of the organisation's profile, North and South.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#T00300","speaker":"1215","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":218,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Speaking for myself and for a number of other representatives across the Oireachtas, some of us have an issue with this proliferation of approved housing bodies.  What is their purpose?  They started out as as the provision of specialised knowledge or connection between groups of people, be they the elderly or the disabled or similar.  Alone, for example, was known to provide specialised knowledge in the area of older people.   That now seems to be gone, however, and housing bodies are popping up all over the place without any areas of specialisation.  I do not really see why approved housing bodies have the degree of involvement in housing that they do.  They are now being encouraged, both by the Government and by local authority managers.  This is probably for ideological reasons because the Government does not want the local councils to provide housing on the scale that they once did.  There are many different reasons for this.<\/p> <p>  Sometimes there are certainly problems with council housing.  People are sometimes put into large-scale areas with no transport facilities, for example.  We have all seen that happen over the years.  I was a councillor myself for 11 years.  Fingal County Council, for example, does not seem to run any housing anymore and this is largely ceded instead to housing bodies.  I know that Cl&uacute;id is involved in an upcoming project, as is Respond!  Why is this case?  <\/p> <p>  There is a difficulty here for the tenant.  Many people on the housing list do not realise that when they get a house from a housing body they are not in fact council tenants.  The problem with this is that tenants do not have the same level of representation from councillors and public representatives to help them address problems.  It was previously the case that when, for example, windows needed to be replaced, councillors would lobby council management to get the funds from the Government to do this.  We do not have that facility with the approved housing bodies.  There is probably a good reason for this, as the bodies are not sufficiently funded or resourced.  <\/p> <p>  There is also the issue of rent.  If people get into massive arrears for some reason, the councils have always been willing to sit down and work out a programme to deal with this.  <\/p> <p>  Then there are issues like pyrite.  I have found it very difficult to set up a meeting on the pyrite problem in the Parnell Estate in Mulhuddart.  Respond! is in charge of that estate.  If the council were running that estate, not only would the problem be fixed by now, but they would also have sat down to have a meeting with public representatives like myself and with tenants.  This has not happened.  The approved housing bodies have to answer for that.  People are contacting us as public representatives thinking that we can assist them but we cannot.  The point I am raising is that we do not have the same ability to intervene with approved housing bodies when problems arise.<\/p> <p>  Another issue I have is a financial one.  One of the reasons why approved housing bodies are being used more is the desperate search by the Government and like-minded parties to find off-balance sheet models and special purpose vehicles.  So it is then, that local authorities are no longer to be provided with money.  We have loads of money in this country and we could solve this housing problem.  The funds are there.<\/p><p>The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund has money to offer, interest free.  In my view, this is a political decision.  I am sure some people began their involvement with approved housing bodies because they wanted to get specialised housing.  However, I do not see how it can be argued now that the latter remains the case.  I do not think that approved housing bodies can solve the housing problem.  They are being looked to far too much in that regard.  They are being given local authority lands.  I do not know the nature of the transactions with the councils or whether the approved housing bodies pay for the land involved.  From what I see in my constituency, the approved housing bodies are being given all the council lands.  They are also being given responsibility for running housing estates.  From the point of view of public representatives, this is a major problem.  I would like the witnesses to address these issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#U00200","speaker":"1434","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":220,"content":"<p>I agree with Deputy Coppinger in the context of her concerns.  Like previous speakers, I was a councillor for years.  As councillors, Cl&uacute;id and Respond! were the main approved housing bodies with which we would have dealt, if on a smaller scale.  All of a sudden, Co-operative Housing Ireland has entered the picture and on a bigger scale.  I welcome the fact that we need to work with the credit union movement to provide houses because local authorities are not doing that.  I think this is a Government call.  We are getting to the stage that this is the way forward.<\/p> <p>  When one applies to Cl&uacute;id or Respond!, one must apply to the local authority and the names are then submitted to the different agencies.  On some of the application forms it states that one cannot go to any political parties or one cannot have representations from political figures.  As a person who has worked in the area of local authority housing and who has made constant representations on behalf of people on the housing list, that is an issue.  The major issue is that a tenant cannot purchase his or her house.  I do not like that.  The impact of approved housing bodies appears to be growing.  In my constituency, Fruithill Manor was developed by Co-operative Housing Ireland in Graiguecullen, County Carlow.  I was at the launch of this development of 67 houses, and we are waiting to get word in respect of four of these.  I hope we will receive word this week.  This body is different to what it was previously.  Even though the names of those applying for houses go to the local authorities, it is different because everything goes through the approved housing body.  I know that Co-operative Housing Ireland has managers who run some estates.  I have no problem with that because I think it is good that everybody can participate.<\/p> <p>  The main issue I have relates to the fact that the approved housing bodies need to look at giving people the option to buy.  This is a major concern.  It is putting people off applying for some of these houses because they feel, given that they are younger, that they may not be able to buy their houses.  Hopefully, however, things are going change and they want the option to buy at a later stage.  They will never have that opportunity unless they hand back their keys and seek either a local authority mortgage or to go on the local authority housing list.  From my experience as a former councillor and as a Senator, I am of the view that there should be more co-operation with councillors because they work through the local authorities.  I have had individuals to whom I could not give references because it is stated that people cannot obtain references from public representatives.  I have been making representations for people for 18 years and I am concerned in that regard, particularly because we, as public representatives, ensure that we represent our communities and we recommend people who we believe would make good tenants.<\/p> <p>  I know that the approved housing bodies have been buying houses.  Can I have an update on that?  Numerous houses in my local authority area have been purchased.  More houses have been bought by approved housing bodies than by the local authority.  They are buying once-off houses.  Originally, the approved housing bodes were supposed to cater for the needs of people with disabilities or those with special needs but that all seems to be changing.<\/p> <p>  I know we have a housing crisis.  I acknowledge that it would be good if the credit unions worked with the approved housing bodies going forward.  I think it would be good for the people who are looking for houses.  However, in terms of the bigger picture, there needs to be an option for people to buy their houses and there must be increased co-operation with councillors, Senators, Deputies and local authorities.  Perhaps the witnesses revert to me on those points?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#V00200","speaker":"1395"},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":221,"content":"<p>This is a very important discussion.  I agree with many of the points that have been made.<\/p><p>I wish to raise a number of points as I have questions I need answered.  I agree with Deputy Coppinger that one needs protocols in place between the housing agencies and elected representatives.  I had a case where a constituent was being put out of his home as a result of significant difficulties by a housing agency.  Notwithstanding the fact that he was in my office, that we rang the housing body and spoke to the person in charge and that he confirmed to the person in charge his consent to me speaking on his behalf, the person on the other end of the telephone refused to communicate with him or with me on the grounds that she did not have a written letter of consent from the individual who informed her that he was illiterate and could not write.  That was the bull that person had to face.  It was an absolute disgrace.  However, it was dealt with and we got a different outcome when I protested to the chief executive of the body.  It goes back to the point made by Deputy Coppinger that one needs proper protocols in place.  Obviously there must be data protection but when a public representative rings a State body, as we do, with the named individual in the room with him or her and with the person's PPS number, cut the bullshit and get on with the job.  We have to be able to represent people.  <\/p><p> NAMA has 6,564 houses that it offered to local authorities around the country.  Only 2,520 of the houses were taken up by the local authorities.  In Dublin, 2,030 homes were offered to local authorities, of which 757 only were taken up, which left 1,273 homes in Dublin.  Were any of the approved housing bodies present offered any of those homes and if so, did they take them up or if not, what was the reason for refusing them?<\/p><p> It seems to me there is a significant lacunae of activity in housing.  The local authorities have turned a blind eye to the housing crisis.  They were offered houses they did not take.  I acknowledge the good work that Ministers are doing, there is no criticism implied or intended on this matter, but we need dynamic leadership reporting to the Minister who will cut across all this red tape and get action.<\/p><p> In County Louth, they conducted a survey of empty houses, including boarded-up houses and they have done it very successfully.  Is there anybody who lives on any street in any town that does not see or know of a house that is boarded up or shops or houses that have been boarded up for years?  We need a more dynamic approach from the housing bodies, from the State or from an agency that will deal with this.  If Louth County Council can go after empty homes that are boarded up and put them back on the market with social housing clients for an average of approximately &euro;100,000 per house, without the need for additional infrastructure, as water, sewage works and other services are laid on, why do we not pursue this?  What are the approved housing bodies doing about it?  It is a no-brainer.  One does not need millions to do this job right.  It can be done for approximately &euro;100,000 per home.  The local authority puts the compulsory purchase notice on the boarded-up house and within a couple of months, if that is not responded to, it goes in and does the job.  I think the approved housing bodies should do that as well.<\/p><p> I brought a housing agency round my town.  I showed them 30 to 40 empty dwellings, blocked up, locked up and nobody in them.  I hope something will happen out of that.  There is a lack of urgency in our Administration in respect of dealing with this issue.  I do not mean to be lecturing.  I accept and acknowledge the excellent work the bodies represented by the witnesses are doing but that sense of urgency is not there today.  We need to inject that sense of urgency into those dealing with housing.  We as public representatives need to be more active as well.<\/p><p> Were the approved housing bodies offered houses that they refused?  Is it not a disgrace that nationwide, there are 4,000 homes that could but do not house families as social tenants?<\/p><p>Such people may be paying exorbitant rents to vulture landlords.  We missed a huge opportunity to deal with this matter.  An opportunity exists now.  If there are 165,000 empty homes in this country - there are at least 31,000 empty homes in Dublin - in the name of God, the housing bodies should get in there and deal with the matter.  I urge the organisations to meet the Minister and the local authorities at county manager level.  When that is done they should come back to us with a plan and we will push the initiative with our agencies and Ministers.  The shame, disgrace and appalling situations that too many families face every day of the week cannot continue.  They are living in extreme situations.  Yesterday I read an article in a newspaper that highlighted the plight of a family who had to live in a tent located outside of a local authority building for three weeks.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#V00300","speaker":"1329","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":224,"content":"<p>That is not the fault of housing bodies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#X00200","speaker":"1434"},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":225,"content":"<p>No.  I am addressing the issue of housing.

I welcome all of our guests here today.  I am sorry to have missed their presentations but I have read them.<\/p> <p>  I am a chairperson of a small housing body that has never been invited here or anywhere else.  Deputy Casey mentioned the creation of housing bodies.  I can assure him that many of the new housing bodies may be small but they have done a tremendous amount of work.  My housing body has only 17 units but they are full and the tenants are happy.  We built houses that were good value for money and we maintain them.<\/p> <p>  I wish to thank the person who originally set up Respond!  The organisation has done wonderful work over the years.<\/p><p>I am very interested in learning more about the funding model used by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  How does the Central Bank view the practice?  The Central Bank and the Minister for Finance viewed this matter in a different light, including that other forms of funding were taboo for credit unions.<\/p><p> I was a member of the Irish Council for Social Housing for a decade or more.  One of the reasons I left the organisation was because of the incremental way the bigger groups took it over and knocked out the smaller volunteer groups.  I mean no disrespect but the ICSH was influenced by the boom generated by the Celtic tiger.  It went mad buying up property and could not buy enough land in places.  Expectations were raised and this country was left with a savage housing crisis.  The organisation got too big for its boots in many ways.  I do not mean anything personal by that, but I saw this situation occur before my eyes.  The ICSH was taken over.  The smaller groups could never progress or become a member of boards because the larger ones held power.  It became a symptom of the problem rather than a solution.  The movement did great work over the years, especially Respond!, and before we ever heard of Cl&uacute;id, Oaklee Housing and many of the other housing organisations.  The organisation had managing directors, boards of directors and whatever.  Different people dealt with communities and the organisation had elected members throughout the country on sites.  Unfortunately, the organisation is part of the problem now that is bureaucracy.  One cannot build the blooming houses.<\/p><p> I want to ask the same question that Deputy O'Dowd asked about the NAMA offer.  My own local authority refused NAMA.  The NAMA complement of property was not taken up for a plethora of reasons and the vacant properties as well.  <\/p><p> The ideals of the organisation were perfect but it got caught up in big business rather than look after the needs of customers or clients.  Some clients of housing associations must endure awful issues.  In some cases, public representatives cannot act on their behalf, which is anathema to what I stand for.  I have a foot in both camps because I chair a very successful voluntary housing group.  It has a small number of houses but we stuck to what we wanted to do.  All the other smaller groups, and Deputy Casey might have mentioned some of them, have done great work but remained small.  The organisation has gone into big housing like the big developers and is left with huge platters of land and maybe lots of houses that are not properly maintained or finished.  It acted like NAMA.  <\/p><p> The county councils have completely lost their way.  I do not know whether they will hand over their housing provision to the AHBs or anyone else.  I do not know who is expected to deliver all of the houses that the county councils have aspired to provide.   No houses have been built in Tipperary and the same applies up and down the country.  There is just talk.  What about the unfortunate people who must sleep rough or live in unsuitable houses?  The number of houses that are locked up is a disgrace.  Any time one turns on the radio one can hear Fr. Peter McVerry and others talk about houses that are boarded up.  I do not know why the organisation present cannot tackle the problem.  Leaving houses boarded up attracts anti-social behaviour.  I suggest that the organisation thinks about where it came from and originally set out to do.  I suggest that it remain small and good at what it does because being all powerful has not proved successful in the building industry or in the voluntary association.  I urge the organisation to show more respect for the voluntary associations.  One or two of the voluntary associations may have grown too large, but volunteers took hold of them, which was necessary.  Voluntary associations need a code of conduct but not because they are high and mighty.  We can see why they have not been the answer because the houses have not been delivered.  We need more volunteer groups but they need to be shown respect and given fair play.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#X02400","speaker":"1347","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":248,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy McGrath.

That sounds like a big number but it is only one tenth the size of the local authority stock.<\/p> <p>  Let us be honest.  AHBs will not solve the housing crisis on their own.  They do not have the scale to do so but are willing to play their part.  One of the reasons we are sitting here is that we are determined to do so.  <\/p> <p>  We must admit that our capacity is an issue.

The development of AHB capacity is a commitment that has not yet been acted upon.  We have an issue with this.<\/p><p> Affordable housing is very much an issue for us and for society at large.  While we at AHB and local authority level are providing social housing for those within the limits of the income threshold, there are a lot of people above that threshold who cannot provide for themselves in the private market and have no recourse.  At least social housing tenants will end up on a scheme and may hopefully be catered for at some point.  There is no scheme for those who are above the income threshold.  There is a commitment in the various programmes issued over the past year that there will be an affordable scheme brought about.  It has to happen in order to create a balanced and fair housing market.  AHBs and particularly the four bodies before the committee today are very much open to playing their part.  It requires a degree of subvention, however.  By definition, we are talking about people who cannot wholly look after their own housing need.  As a group, we have also made a submission to the Government as to how we would like to see the affordable option being brought forward.  If we have time later we might discuss it.  <\/p><p>In respect of NAMA, my own housing body, Co-operative Housing Ireland, has never refused an offer from it.  We have accepted every offer it has made.  We found NAMA good to work with and have done our best to deliver quickly on what it offers.  If NAMA was to offer more,  we would gladly consider it.  This would generally be the experience of the AHBs before the committee today.<\/p><p> In terms of vacant units, unfortunately we cannot resort to compulsory purchase orders.

The Senator was in attendance at the announcement, it was a great day.  It is an interesting project in that it is mixed tenure - the holy grail of housing development.<\/p><p>It contains a mixture of social and private housing.  We put some youth services on the site as well.  We have two local authorities, Laois and Carlow, nominating into that site.  It is a great example of how we should be dealing with the housing crisis.  That was a NAMA site and we were able to do it because we were dealing with a lease arrangement.  In the absence of an affordable scheme, how could we go out and purchase stock to try to replicate it?  We would need a scheme allowing us to purchase and put stuff on at market rate.  It is difficult for AHBs or any players, including local authorities, to come up with those options.  It might be facilitated through local authority or State lands being used for that purpose.  The affordability piece could be offset against the value of the site, for example.<\/p><p> Senator Murnane O'Connor also mentioned tenant purchase.  AHBs do not do that for a number of reasons.  In our own case, it is a matter of belief and the reasons for which we were established.  We want to provide social rental on an ongoing basis.  One of the reasons we are in our current difficulties is that local authorities sold off a lot of their stock and are now short.  We have less social housing available in this crisis than would have been the case had this not happened.  That is just my view and the view of my organisation.<\/p><p> As a co-operative body, we support people into home ownership on a co-operative basis.  For example, in D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown the local authority has provided a site and people have come together to form a co-operative.  They are going about building units for their own benefit and, at the end of the process, the units will be in private ownership.  The owners will have achieved this through a co-operative and affordable model.  That is something that could be replicated on a wider basis.<\/p><p> I will pass some of the other issues raised to my colleagues.  Mr. Cathal Callan might wish to address Deputy &Oacute; Broin's questions about the payment and availability agreements and possible alternatives.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#Z00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499162400,"counter":258,"content":"<p>The first question was a comparison between cost rental and the current payment and availability structure.  The second question was whether the payment and availability structure allows us to cover our costs.  The current payment and availability structure is sort of structured on a cost rental basis anyway.  It is set as a percentage of the market rent and is then measured against the asset we are buying and how much loan is required on it.  What has moved is the amount of CALF that is available.  There may be a situation in which no CALF is required and in that instance one would borrow 100% if one had a funder who was prepared to lend.  Cl&uacute;id has borrowed solely from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA, which will fund to 100% in that situation.<\/p> <p>  What is allowed by the Housing Agency when we put our assessment through is 3.5% above cost of funds.  If we bring in a cost rental model, it will match the cost of funds to the amount of payment and availability required.  We would also have to create a margin because the differential rent does not cover the day to day reactive maintenance, management of the property plus the planned programme.  At the moment, the margin is around 3.5%, in return for which the housing associations are picking up the risk.  A cost rental model would have to attach to a fixed loan over 25 years as there would have to be cost certainty whereby the cost of funds required would be set at the start and would stay the same for the full period.  At the moment, if housing associations are not going to the market to fix the rate, they are bearing the risk of a variable rate over the full life of that loan.  Comparing the two, what is in place at the moment is effectively a variant on the cost rental model.  It has a slightly higher margin than one would expect of a pure cost rental model but that is because the housing associations bear the risk of the variability of the loan over the period.<\/p><p> Regarding risk mitigation in 100% loans, the key driver behind CALF when it was introduced up to a maximum of 30% was the fact that AHBs did not have adequate funding to put equity into the purchase of properties.  If they did, they utilised their cash reserves very quickly.  CALF was meant to create a situation whereby the risk that the funder - in our case, the HFA, external funders or credit unions - brought to the table was mitigated via the funder not taking the full risk on the loan.  Those are probably the main drivers regarding the payment and availability agreements and the fixed loans.<\/p><p> To give some context to the question on funding pipelines, Cl&uacute;id's pipeline is in the region of &euro;350 million over the next three years, which will supply just short of 2,500 units.  That is a considerable amount of debt to be taking on.  It is being done within a framework of a regulator, which is now coming on line, and under which we are being more closely monitored and managed.  Reference was made to an earlier statement.  The professionalism within the sector is required because of the level of debt that we are taking on.  Were we taking on that level of debt without the attendant professionalism in the sector, we would be running the risk of a larger AHB getting into problems or having difficulty accessing the funding because it is not adequately set up to do that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Callan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499162400,"counter":260,"content":"<p>I might answer a few of the questions, starting with the general points about the housing and homelessness crises.  It is acknowledged everywhere that we are in a bad situation.  There is no other way of looking at it.  I often wonder how we can have a thriving economy if we do not have a functioning housing market.  It is hitting many people in different ways.  Constantly on my mind is the question of whether young people who are at the point of family formation will stay in this country if they cannot access housing in some form or other.  What is their future in Ireland?  This issue affects people who are trying to access mortgages or social housing, but there is also a group in the middle who are seeking an intermediate solution because they qualify neither for social housing nor mortgages.  There is a significant question to be addressed in that.  For this reason there is a need for the State to consider some intermediate provision, be it called \"affordable\", \"cash rental\" or whatever model is considered to be the right one.<\/p> <p>  As for the role of AHBs in all of this, I have been in my role since last August when I joined Respond!  I come with an outsider's view of AHBs and a strong feeling that there is room for improvement.  In a voluntary role, I chair the network of all of the homeless organisations in the four counties of Dublin.  Previously, I worked as the CEO of a specialist AHB, Sophia Housing, which deals with people with complex needs.  I cannot get the situation that those people are in out of my bloodstream.  I cannot forget the degree of need that people have.  That is why we in Respond! try to deliver our part.  Our AHB role is a small part, though, and we are not the solution for housing.  Local authorities, the wider State and private provision have a role.  If all of the organisations present improved our delivery three times over, it would be a small contribution.  We should increase our delivery and make our contribution, but it is not going to sort out the problem.<\/p> <p>  With people's needs in mind, the first thing that I did upon joining Respond! was to say that we needed to accept some responsibility for homelessness.  We could not just sit pretty as a landlord taking in rent, able to do what we do and have 100 employees, a finance department and this and that department without accepting our responsibility for doing something about homelessness.  For that reason, we have engaged in the provision of emergency accommodation.  No one wants to do that and we should not have to provide emergency accommodation.  It is crazy that we have to go down that route, but we absolutely have to because the delivery pipeline of all sorts of housing - private, social and any kind of affordable housing - is so slow that it will take us years to address it.<\/p><p>We have to do it while also doing other things.<\/p><p> I would be with anyone who wants to challenge us, our arrogance, our efficiency, our effectiveness or whatever.  It is appropriate that happens and I would welcome it.  My colleagues feel the same way.  We are at this meeting trying to determine how we can be held to account and demonstrate how we are regulated, how we operate and how we can be challenged to improve what we are doing, and whether it is possible for us to do more, be that through credit union money or whatever.  That is our motivation.<\/p><p> In terms of representation from local authority members or Deputies, I would personally be comfortable with that.  We are in a democracy and that is what we are supposed, and need, to do.  I have a personal commitment to doing that.  It happens.

That is the future, but doing that work is faster than applying for planning permission and going through the construction phases when houses are sitting empty and boarded up and everything is in place except the families.  Obviously, the organisations before us must do significant work on such units, but the average cost in County Louth is approximately &euro;100,000 per home, which is far less than it takes to build a house.  I acknowledge and welcome the work that the organisations are doing.<\/p> <p>  We all have good ideas and are doing excellent work.

I have a couple of follow-up questions.  How do the housing bodies envisage that the special purpose vehicle fund will emerge if the Central Bank and the Registry of Credit Unions consent to change the rules to allow credit unions to provide such funding?  Do they envisage that funding from the HFA will form part of that fund, or will funding from the HFA be available separately as it currently is?  Given that HFA funding is currently available, what is the additional advantage of having another source of funds?  Somebody might rightly or wrongly point out that the housing bodies can seek to borrow from the HFA anyway.  What is the added value of the credit union fund?  That is my first question.<\/p> <p>  I would like to repeat a question that I put to the representatives of the credit union movement this morning.  The housing bodies are in discussions with the Department, which is involved in discussions with the CSO and EUROSTAT about the possible redesignation of approved housing bodies as on-balance sheet State actors rather than non-State actors.  How concerned are the housing bodies about that?  What is their sense of where that is at the minute?  If this redesignation happens, as it has already happened in the UK, it will create a particular difficulty for their operations and for the Government's plans.<\/p> <p>  Obviously, the housing bodies are involved in ongoing negotiations with the Department about the legislation, which we have yet to see.  I am sure the bodies have more of an idea than we do of how it is shaping up.  Are those discussions going well?  Are there concerns about this process?  Is there anything that the witnesses feel it would be appropriate to share with the committee about all of that at this stage?<\/p> <p>  I would like to say that my experience of approved housing bodies in my constituency has been quite different from that outlined by other members today.  I want to acknowledge that difference.  Co-operative Housing Ireland, which was formerly known as NABCO, has a significant number of units in Dublin Mid-West.  Respond! has acquired units there more recently.  Cl&uacute;id also has a significant number of units.  My experience has been very good.  That does not mean there are no problems.  We sometimes have difficulties with housing managers.  My experience with housing bodies has been no better or no worse than my experience with local authorities.  I have found that these relationships have been very productive.  The units the housing bodies provide and manage are of a very good standard.  I had quite a lot of experience with Oaklee when I was a councillor on Belfast City Council and my experience was the same.  I do not suggest other members are wrong but it is important to acknowledge good engagement with housing bodies, good housing managers and well-managed approved housing bodies.  My experience is that these bodies provide good-quality social housing in addition to the local authority housing that is there.  The witnesses have clearly articulated today that this should continue to be the model.  As long as it is, I will be very happy to support it and to see more of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#DD00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":270,"content":"<p>The houses that the housing agencies provide to people, often after buying them in groups, are of an extremely high standard.  That is not the question.  I totally disagree with what has been said in one respect.  This is the way forward from the Government's point of view.  I hope the credit unions work on the tier 3 we are looking at because that is important.  I still think people should have the option of buying after ten or 15 years in a house.  I think it should be given to them.  I would stand firm on that.  The other issue I would like to raise is not a major one.  I am concerned about the timescale of the delivery of the houses.  I think that is crucial in one sense.  When a housing estate is built, how quick is the delivery?  I think that is crucial.  As the witnesses are aware, we have had separate dealings with the different bodies.  I asked a question about this but I did not get a reply.  I welcome the once-off purchases that all the housing bodies are doing now.  They are providing houses that people need and that has to be welcomed.  That is not even an issue here.  I have never had an issue with the standard of any of the houses that have been provided by the housing bodies.  They have an excellent standard in that sense.<\/p><p>I hope the plans for the credit unions work as we go forward.  It is crucial because we have a housing crisis.  What is the timing?  I find that the timing can sometimes be slow.  Do the housing bodies have a regulation or rule that requires them to complete their work within a certain timeframe after they purchase a house or get a housing estate through NAMA?  I know they have worked very well with NAMA.  I compliment them on that.  They have always taken on the houses.  I know they have been working on this issue.<\/p><p> Overall, we have to be positive here today.  There are some little things that people come to me about.  It is a question of political representation.  I will make sure to say this if anyone comes to me again.  I had felt that this issue needed to be addressed.  These are just concerns that I have.

I am sure some of my colleagues will do likewise.  I will begin by answering Deputy &Oacute; Broin's question about additionality in the context of the availability of HFA assistance.  The HFA provides a pretty good product at a good rate.  We have to allow for that.  We would not be sure that it will necessarily be available into the future.  In the interests of having a workable market, it is better to have more than one good supplier of a product - finance, in this case - in the market.  I would welcome the possibility of credit union funding for all sorts of reasons.  It is not just about the funds themselves.  It would be a great example of social finance doing what it should do in a particular local area.  It would be a huge win for local authorities, the State and ourselves.  We can all combine to provide housing for people who badly need it.<\/p> <p>  It is clear that credit union finance would be off the balance sheet.  We are off the balance sheet at the moment.  It is possible that this will change because we are under assessment by the CSO and EUROSTAT in this context.  We have been communicating with the various authorities involved.  We have been making our case fairly strongly.  The Irish Council for Social Housing is working hard on that.  We hope we will remain off the balance sheet.  When the AHBs in the UK ended up on the balance sheet, one of the issues was that the regulation was deemed to be so intrusive that it amounted to State control.  I think that has been factored into the regulation Bill that has been mentioned and will be introduced this month.<\/p> <p>  The wider question of regulation arises in this context.  The word \"proliferation\" was used by someone when speaking about the number of AHBs.  There are approximately 500 AHBs.  As Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned earlier, the vast majority of them are small, locally based entities that were established through local initiative to deal with a particular problem in a village or community.  Those who put AHBs in place, drew down funding and have continued to manage those bodies must be applauded.  They will continue to operate in this way.  Most of them do not have the ambition to expand to deal with the particular issue of the general housing crisis.  Since those days, more recently it has become extremely difficult to establish a new AHB.  I understand that no new AHB has been established since the rules were changed a number of years ago.  Regulation has increased significantly, as the members of the committee will be aware.  Like all developing AHBs, we must sign up to the code of conduct with the regulator.  We are heavily regulated.  When the new legislation comes in, it will put additional requirements on us.<\/p> <p>  As Deputy Casey mentioned earlier, tier 3 might be called the ultimate level of regulation.  All of the housing bodies represented at this meeting are tier 3 AHBs, which are bodies that have more than 300 units.  All of us have significantly more than that.  We are deemed to be suitable for increased regulatory attention because we are developing, borrowing and taking on judicial responsibilities.<\/p><p>Cathal Callan has spoken of Cl&uacute;id's level of borrowing - &euro;350 million - going forward.  If a lender is to lend into that situation, such as the credit unions may be, they would want to ensure that those entities are properly regulated and that the systems to which Cathal referred are in place.  We welcome the additional regulation that will result, on a statutory basis, hopefully after the enactment of the Bill to be introduced this year.  All of this is good.<\/p><p> With regard to representation, in general, approved housing bodies do their best to respond to representatives, be they Deputies, councillors at local level or council officials when they raise issues with us.  Yesterday I was invited to a local authority strategic policy committee.  I sat down and answered all the questions and addressed all the issues that the committee members had to deal with.  We would do this on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p> As Co-operative Housing Ireland, CHI, is a co-operative, our members own and control our organisation.

Some of the units may not be accepted by the people involved.  We depend, to a degree, on local authorities in that respect but this process would always happen in co-operation with the local authority.  By and large, much as we do not or cannot tolerate much in the way of voids or empty units among our stock, neither can we tolerate unfilled homes.  For financial reasons we must fill them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#FF00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kieron Brennan"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499162400,"counter":276,"content":"<p>Going back to the added value issue, and Mr. Brennan has touched on it, all of those present here are actively looking for alternative finance from the Housing Finance Agency.  The motivation behind this is to widen the portfolio of debt and where we get it from, but it is also because we realise there is a limit to how much we can borrow from the Housing Finance Agency in the long term.  As I have said, our programme will require significant additional funding.  This is why we welcome the potential to borrow from credit unions.  When we looked at additional funding coming in to the sector we recognised the limitations within the commercial banks for long-term matched funding.  We then looked at long-term investor funding, which is long-term commercial bank funding from outside Ireland.  We would welcome the opportunity to have another source of funding that could match the time periods we need to borrow for, which are around 20 years, 25 years or 30 years.<\/p> <p>  The second question relates to the CSO.  I have very serious concerns about the implications of any decision.  I believe the implications within the United Kingdom were not as significant and were managed quite well.  However, they pertained to the level of governance and not to the financial or economic aspects.  I do not believe we would have a problem with governance as because the regulator is not on a statutory footing, there is not the same level of control in place.  We will potentially have a problem around the funding streams that are coming through to us.  I have been with Cl&uacute;id for eight years.  I came in when the capital loan subsidy scheme and capital assistance scheme funding stopped and it came as a juddering halt to the sector as to how we were going to move forward.  It has taken a number of years for us to get to the point where we could borrow properly and where we knew what we were doing in relation to it.  The regulator was put in place.  My concern is that if there is a decision regarding the price and availability structure or the capital advance leasing facility, CALF, structure that has implications in respect of the CSO decision, it could have the same juddering effect on the sector as had that cessation in funding.  This could present major problems for this proposal in the context of credit unions accessing funds.<\/p><p>There are also major problems about our long-term plan and delivery programme because it is all premised on accessing funding from the HFA or elsewhere.  I am concerned about the decision, and it will not be reversed quickly.  There may have to be changes and the changes that are put in place may cause problems for the funding stream.  One is stepping somewhat into the unknown but I would estimate a two-year or three-year window to rectify it, if it is possible to do so.<\/p><p> The issue of tenant purchase was raised.  There have been lots of discussions and Cl&uacute;id has looked at running some form of tenant purchase.  Our executive board has actively held discussions on whether we want to do it.  Mr. Brennan spoke about retaining properties for social housing but there is another problem, which is that all our assets are encumbered and have a loan against them.  Any tenant purchase system has to work on a significant discount basis and the discount for AHBs, for example, would have to be compensated somewhere.  It is not that we will start crying because we are out of cash - we have a debt and have to repay that debt.  Whether it is with the CLS or the debt finance units there is the same implication.  Cl&uacute;id would welcome a tenant purchase system if we understood the mechanisms behind it and how it would work.  However, we also understand the risk and there are issues that need to be worked through.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HP22017070400002#FF00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Cathal Callan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499162400,"counter":278,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Callan, Mr. Coyle, Mr. Dunne and Mr. Brennan for coming before us and for their ongoing engagement.

Our statement focuses on the roll-out of the scheme, the problems we have encountered with the scheme and data from a survey we carried out in recent months which involved in-depth interviews with a number of fishermen.  Ms Ryan will discuss that.<br\/><br\/>The MRCI is a non-governmental organisation.  We work predominantly with migrant workers in low-wage sectors of the economy.  We come to this issue through the intersection of immigration and employment, and it is something on which have worked for many years in terms of how people become undocumented in the State.  We have worked with fishermen for approximately three years, but our drop-in centre deals with up to 2,000 people a year in the context of issues relating to immigration, exploitation and employment rights.<br\/><br\/>This issue came to light through an expose in the <i>The Guardian<\/i>in 2015.  As a result, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, set up a task force to examine it.  Senator Gerald Nash worked on the enforcement element.  Following that, the Department of Justice and Equality set up an atypical scheme for fishermen which created a number of problems in terms of access to and retaining immigration status once granted.<br\/><br\/>I will hand over to Ms Ryan, who will take the committee through some of our research and preliminary findings.  I will then discuss our recommendations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017070400002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel McGinley"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499180400,"counter":289,"content":"<p>There are a number of fishermen in the Gallery and another will follow.  Committee members may be able to meet them after the meeting.  We hoped a fisherman could speak directly to the committee.  However, as the session is being broadcast, workers are reluctant to speak because there may be repercussions for their jobs.<\/p> <p>  I will discuss the context of the atypical permit scheme for the information of the committee.  MRCI has monitored the scheme since its roll-out in February 2016.  The permit was introduced to deal with a very particular segment of the fishing fleet in Ireland, namely, polyvalent, beamer and specific vessels over 15 m.  There are approximately 179 boats in this category.  The scheme gave undocumented fishermen from outside the EU a window of six months, from February to July 2016, to come forward and apply for work permits.  The scheme relied on the employer and an employment contract to make a person eligible for the scheme.  The scheme imposes a very limited 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 39-hour working week on this segment of the fishing industry.  However, as I am sure the committee will understand, the industry does not operate within that framework.  Many boats go out on trips for 12 days at time and might be back in harbour for a day or two before going back out for another 12 days.  The hours specified in the permit do not fit the hours worked and the industry and fishermen are not being remunerated at the correct rates as a result.<\/p> <p>  This segment of the industry is marked by long hours, poor remuneration, breaches of employment legislation and disorganised enforcement.  In fishing, no single body is tasked with enforcing employment legislation.  Instead, the issue cuts across a number of bodies dealing with health and safety, the organisation of working time - including rest breaks - the payment of wages and the minimum wage.  This means that much of the information is not combined by the different bodies responsible in order to establish a comprehensive picture of non-compliance and exploitation.<\/p> <p>  The committee may ask why workers do not take cases to the Workplace Relations Commission.  The profile of workers can explain this.  Many workers are from outside the EU, as we said, and do not have a sufficient level of English to complete the application process.  Many do not know their rights and entitlements or how to exercise them.  In addition, workers know employers are well networked and organised and fear that if they take a case against one employer, they will be marked as troublemakers and will be unable to get further work.  This has happened to a number of fishermen with whom we have worked.<\/p> <p>  Fishing can be very isolated, as the committee can see from the hours involved and the areas where fishing is an industry.  It is exhausting work.  Fishermen have very little time off to seek support and meet organisations such as the MRCI and the ITF.<\/p><p>I will now discuss some preliminary research findings.  We are in the process of doing research.  We have already carried out 30 in-depth interviews with fishers, mostly from the Philippines and Egypt.  As the research is still in progress, this is just preliminary evidence, but the full findings will be provided to the committee as soon as possible.<br\/><br\/>Regarding the profile of the respondents, 93.3% were employed at the time we surveyed them, that is, over the course of last year.  At this time, 80% had a work permit, that is, an atypical work permit, and 41.2% had experienced discriminatory behaviour against them.  This would be, for instance, migrant workers not receiving the same wage as Irish or white fishers, having to attend to the more difficult jobs than others on the boat and sometimes even having to stay back on the boat on shore to clean up after all the other crew members had left.  Of the workers surveyed, 33% had experienced verbal or physical abuse or both.  One worker stated that his employer shouts and swears at him and the crew daily, and on one occasion the employer began physically pulling and tugging at him.  Of those surveyed, 44% had experienced personal injuries while at work.  Such injuries included serious cuts and crushed limbs.  One man received serious cuts but did not get medical attention until he went back onto land four days later.  One worker became so ill that an air ambulance had to be called.  When the ambulance arrived, the worker's employer denied that the sick man had worked for him.  Regarding safety, 48% claim they do not feel safe at work.  Their safety concerns are due often to the lack of rest breaks and days off.  Consequently, the exhaustion makes them prone to work accidents.  Another hazard is the lack of safety equipment on board some of the boats.<br\/><br\/>Our preliminary results reveal that exploitation and non-compliance are widespread within the sector.  The rights conferred under Irish employment law are routinely breached.  Most breaches occur under the National Minimum Wage Act, the Organisation of Working Time Act, the Terms of Employment (Information) Acts and the Payment of Wages Act.  Of those we surveyed, 17.2% earned less than &euro;300 per week, 65.4% were required to carry out extra duties without extra pay and 50% did not receive any holiday pay of any kind.<br\/><br\/>I will quote from one of our interviews.<\/p><blockquote>We work constantly, around the clock, there are no official breaks.  We bring food with us onto the boat that we can eat while we work.  Crackers and crisps and other dry food we can have on the deck and eat while we sort fish.  Sometimes we have to beg for a break or we sometimes sneak breaks while we go the toilet, quickly grab some food or a short lie down.  There is a lot of tension on the boat, the skipper shouts and abuses us for not working hard enough.  It's up to him who gets a break and when and it depends on his mood.  The longest rest you will get is an hour or two.  A lot of the time your sleep will only be 30 minutes long.<\/blockquote><p>For context, in the fishing industry, 14 hours is the longest working day one is supposed to have in 24 hours, and one is supposed to work a maximum of 72 hours in one week.<br\/><br\/>Through our monitoring of the scheme, casework and preliminary research, it has become clear that the atypical scheme has not achieved what the Government set out to do, that is, to tackle exploitation in the industry and provide an avenue to document workers.  In fact, some people are in a worse situation.  Many did not find a willing employer during the six-month window to apply for a work permit, leaving them undocumented.  As the first round of permits are up for renewal, we see many fishers let go as employers do not want to deal with the bureaucracy.  This is leading to a casualisation of work whereby undocumented and documented fishers are taken on for trips at a time here and there without contracts or agreements.<br\/><br\/>One fisher wanted very much to speak today but he was very concerned about getting employment.  He asked me to read a statement out, on which I will conclude.<\/p><blockquote>First of all I would like to thank you for the opportunity to speak for myself and my colleagues.  We are all professional and skilled fishermen.  Many of us come from coastal towns where generations of our families have been working in fishing.  It is a very hard and difficult job.  I have worked in many different boats in Ireland with bad conditions.  In this work we only get a few hours' sleep per night on the boats.  We fish for very long periods, sometimes over 20 days at a time.  Many Skippers treat us migrant workers with disrespect and discrimination.  We are not treated equally.  There also are many health and safety issues on the boats.  One man I know he was fishing and a wire cut off three of his fingers.  The skipper called an ambulance for him and left him on the shore.  The fisher lost his job and was given no support by his employer.  When the employer reported on the accident he stated that it was the fisher's fault when really it was the Skipper who was not taking care of health and safety properly on the boat.  Fishing will always be a very difficult job but we must have fair conditions and pay.  When we are badly treated we must be able to stand up to employers and get justice.  Everyone deserves to have a safe working environment and be fairly paid for their work.<\/blockquote><p>Ms McGinley will now outline some of our recommendations very briefly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017070400002#D00400","nonspeaker":"Ms Dearbhla Ryan","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499180400,"counter":291,"content":"<p>I will be very quick.

We request that the committee write to the Minister for Social Protection - soon to be Minister for employment and social protection - and recommend the setting up of a time-bound working group between this Department and the Department of Justice and Equality on which the MRCI, the ITF and other interested individuals would sit.  This would be a short-term measure to review what has worked and what has not.  As there is a complete lack of linkage between skills gaps in the industry and what is needed in terms of permits, there needs to be a review of this in terms of labour migration policy and the skills that are needed in the industry right now.  There is a need right now that is not being recognised by the atypical scheme.  What we are seeing are these gross forms of exploitation along with a lack of monitoring and enforcement in this area.

Like the MRCI and Ms Ryan, I have reams and reams of case examples.  Thankfully, I now do not have to go into them but I will speak about one case that took place on 28 April later in my presentation.  Unlike the MRCI, I have been involved in this since 2008.  What shocks me is that I have been a film star in the fishing industry and the maritime industry for the past ten years and I used to say to my wife I would break the story the next time I appeared on television, but the reality is that we have campaigned for the past ten years in every single Department, through Minister after Minister, and have achieved nothing.  We have had reams and reams published in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>and all the national newspapers, two occasions on &quot;Prime Time&quot; and many pieces on the &quot;Six One&quot; and &quot;Nine News&quot;, resulting in just a one-day sensation.<br\/><br\/>It took publication in <i>The Guardian<\/i>, an international publication, to force the Minister at the time, Deputy Coveney, who must be complimented for doing something and introducing the permit scheme, to take action.  However, if one takes the time to go back through the RTE archives, one will see Ken Fleming standing outside his door in January 2016 saying I do not believe that the boat owners, with whom I had engaged through 2008, 2009 and 2010, believe or understand that with the permit scheme comes a whole raft of legislation.  The most important at this time is legislation on the national minimum wage, which then stood at &euro;9.15.  I was asked by the interviewer that day whether I thought the boat owners would pay it and I said it absolutely would not happen, and I have been proved right.  I went on to say I feared - and my colleagues on my left have heard me say this a number of times - that we would legalise slavery, which is exactly what we have done.  Neither Deputy Coveney nor anyone else involved in the Departments at that time had any idea that their efforts on the day would reduce what has been described as a work permit - although we all know what it means - to nothing more than a dog licence.  I have seen dogs treated better than what I have witnessed in the past two years in particular in Ireland.  It shames me to say I am Irish.<br\/><br\/>I also remind the committee that Senator Gerald Nash, who was the junior Minister at the time, was good enough to attend a meeting in his constituency on 6 December 2016 which 42 fishers attended.  I will repeat what Senator Nash himself said.  He said it is clear the permit scheme is not working and he expressed some shame that he was part of a permit scheme that led to the working conditions that currently exist in this country.<br\/><br\/>I have been described as a fantasist.  I am currently subject to threatening letters from the industry for defamation.  <i>The Guardian<\/i>has been sued.  The <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>has received a letter of intent to sue for defamation.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has been reported to GSOC.  It seems we are all wrong.  Then let us consider the efforts of the State.  The Marine Survey Office will not talk to the Garda.  The Marine Survey Office is the principal policing and enforcement agency in this field.<\/p><p>The Marine Survey Office had to be dragged into the office to sign the memorandum of understanding, MOU, because it did not fit well with the individual responsible for running that particular office on behalf of the State.<\/p><p> The National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, not the WRC, were charged with responsibility of enforcing the legislation in the industry.  The individuals who were charged with the responsibility of enforcing the legislation in the industry were the same individuals with whom I was communicating in 2008 to 2010, inclusive.  This is borne out in my files and yet this State for some weird reason decided that those same people who have presided over the industry for such a long time, working in NERA, somehow were going to turn some magical trick and change the way they have been operating for the past ten years.  Sadly, I have been proven right, because they have discovered that out of 68 boats that do not comply with the legislation, 30% of those boats had no paperwork and yet, like speaking to a child, they tried to tell me that they had a list of breaches and of non-compliance - no payslips, low wages, non-payment of wages, long hours and bad treatment, which statistically represented X amount.  We asked them, in respect of the 30% of boats that do not have paperwork, how it was possible to determine what breaches had actually taken place.  How could they say, in their presentation to the Santa Marta Group last Monday week, that they have issued 200 permits when, on drilling into the figure for 2017, they have given a figure straddling two years?  The one thing members will understand is that on the night of an election, one always look for the valid poll because that determines who gets elected and who does not.  The valid poll in Ireland stands at 42 permits at present.  There are only 42 permits today in existence today for an industry that has more than 1,500 migrant workers.  Yet the only thing I see on the legal front is invitations to migrant workers to call to the local police station to discuss how best they can be escorted to the airports and run out of the country, while no action has been taken against the owners of the boats from which they have been taken.<\/p><p> We have approached every single political party in the D&aacute;il.  We have been to the European Parliament and have met the MEPs.  The attitude quite simply is that everyone on this side of the table is wrong and the poor boat owners are getting bashed by the State.  The reality of what is happening to these individuals is that for them, a work permit is akin to a dog licence.  I am told by boat owners that they look after their crew, that they shop in Lidl and buy tons of food.  They invite me to look in the back of their jeep or in the fridge.  A boat owner will tell me that a crew member had dinner with his family last Christmas but so did the dog.  We have allowed the industry to drop to a bottomless pit so far away from what we would class as reality that they will tell a trade unionist that this is justification and that they are good men.<\/p><p> Let me describe an incident.  A man from Ghana aged 51 years of age was working on an Irish-owned vessel, 142 miles off the coast of Ireland.  He hurt himself on the Sunday night, having joined the vessel on Friday, 28 April.  He insisted that he had to go to bed because he fell through a false floor in the hull of the boat.  He went to bed on Monday night and he was assaulted on Tuesday by the boat owner, who insisted he should somehow resurrect himself from the bed and go back to work.  That was not possible for this Ghanaian guy - who incidentally has a stamp 4 document and is entitled to be here and to be treated correctly - and he remained in bed until the following Sunday.  He made his way to the wheelhouse and pleaded with the owner to get him off the boat because he was in excruciating pain.  The boat owner hit him again and sent him flying down the stairs and exacerbated his injuries.  He took to the bed for the second time.  On the Monday, an officer of the Irish Naval Service boarded the vessel on a routine inspection.  The next part of my story is borne out by the statement from that officer, who met the Ghanaian crew member, who pleaded with him to take him off the vessel.  He told the man that the Naval Service vessel was not fit for that purpose.  The captain of the Naval Service vessel spoke to the owner and captain of the vessel in question.  The Irish owner-captain of the vessel agreed that he would take the man to port immediately.  The Naval Service officer was satisfied that he would be taken to port.  At 3.30 a.m. on the morning of 8 May, in seas that were not conducive to what was about to happen, this man was taken from his bed and was brought to the front of the boat.  The remaining crew members, all of whom were non-nationals were standing there and he was put into a survival suit and dumped over the side of the boat.  The boat owner called to his other boat that was in the vicinity and told it to come and pick up the black B.  The crew of the second boat reached him, picked up a rope that was tied to his waist, got him ashore, brought him to Castletownbere and sent him on his way.  He went to the Garda station and the garda&iacute; told him he was a fine fellow and was lucky to be alive.  There was an altercation between him and the garda&iacute;.  As he was entitled to be in Ireland, unlike others he did not fear denunciation and the other stuff used against migrants on a daily basis.  He stood his ground.  He was told to go to Bandon because Bandon was the closer station to where the incident took place.  He telephoned Bandon and Bandon Garda station told him to go back to Anglesea Street, make the statement and have it faxed to Bandon.  Luckily somebody in the area, an employee of the State, told him he should get in touch with Ken Fleming.  When the Ghanaian rang me, I was able to go straight down and check it out.  The incident was entered into PULSE and the garda went off to do what he does best - whatever that was - but it was not in the interest of this poor man.<\/p><p> I engaged a very high-profile law firm because I did not think I was capable of handling this and we bullied the garda&iacute; by letter and every other way we could for them to carry out an investigation.  That investigation has now concluded.  It is clear the man was put into the water.  It is clear that he was injured and it is clear that it was unsafe to do what was done.  It is clear that a rope was tied out of his back and it is clear the other boat took him up.  It is clear that the Naval Service officer heard him say, \"please get me off the boat.\".  All of that is clear but the garda&iacute; are now claiming the boat was too far out, 140 miles off our coast, which is outside the jurisdiction.  My response was that if there was ten tonnes of drugs on it, we would all line up for the cameras, because of this fantastic job of work An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had done, but given that it was a black Ghanaian 142 miles off the coast, they would let the Brits handle it, because the ship was British-flagged but Irish-owned.  I am still working between Interpol and Europol.  I have been in touch with very sympathetic police in England, who are smiling at the manner and attitude that is being demonstrated by the Marine Survey Office, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, all of which have washed their hands of this. <\/p><p> I am glad this happened because the lad has survived and he has met me.  It is like when the families of those who have lost their lives in the past have come to me, in that they got redress for their loss.  We do not take any nonsense and there is no wriggle room.  Such an incident can take place.  Nine men can live in one room in Finglas with no sanitary facilities and urinate out through a window because only one of them is paying the bills.  I suspect the aforementioned man with no fingers is living in that room.  Photographs can be provided to members of a situation akin to a game dog hunting sheep to the ground by way of a whistle.  As Ms Dearbhla Ryan said, when the captain makes a decision that the crew can sleep, they do not go to the bunks.  The men fall to the ground in their full oils and sleep on the spot because every minute counts.  The maximum time they enjoy from one length of Ireland to the other at any one time is a two-hour rest period.  Yet we are paying serious money to the NERA and to the Marine Survey Office to do a job.  There are some great people working there, if they were allowed to do their job.<\/p><p>We have a situation where this State is responsible for presiding over modern day slavery.  That brings me to my final point.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017070400002#E00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Fleming","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499180400,"counter":296,"content":"<p>Mr. Fleming is 15 minutes into his contribution and we have to allow members to ask questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017070400002#G00200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499180400,"counter":297,"content":"<p>Deputies should be warned that as a result of the inaction of this State, we have already made formal complaints to the European Human Rights Association and the European Parliament.<\/p> <p>  On 12 July 2017 we are lodging our own trafficking cases against this State and we will accuse the Irish State of failing to do what it should do in order to protect the individuals who found themselves in our State.

That does not mean the scheme is defunct, but it needs to be reviewed and facilitated much better.  It is very difficult to apply for permits as the system is very bureaucratic.  The power is in the hands of the employer and against the employee because the employer must make the application and bring in a model work permit.  That is a real problem.  There is mobility in the scheme but it is not being used.  As we are aware, there is a lot of exploitation.  If one wants to leave one boat and move to another boat one should be able to do that easily and quickly but there are not enough resources in the Department of Justice and Equality to enable that to work quickly.  We have a problem and there is a solution but it is just not working properly.  The Department of Justice and Equality wants to introduce a range of schemes to deal with the undocumented.  It is not interested in a blanket regularisation, it is interested in schemes for different sectors.  That is one of those types of scheme but we have to get it right.

There is no willingness on behalf of any Department to go down that road.  It is a difficult issue.  I am a trade union official for 30 years.  I am not working with my own tools, which I did for years, as I am doing this job now for about 13 years.  We have a set of circumstances where the Government agencies, NERA and all of those guys, are being asked to go in and police something that is quite complex.  The man on my right is one of my inspectors who has been over here helping me.  It took me two years to train him.  My team is a team of seven.  It is a hands-on job because of the trickery in the maritime area generally in terms of a flags of convenience and plates on walls.  We can get around all that because we have inspection rights.  We offered to be part of the construct of the scheme and we were ignored.  We were brought in and shown a piece of paper and we were told to leave.  When they told us to leave every bit of expertise in the country had just walked out of the room.<\/p> <p>  I offered to provide finance to train members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the highest level.  I spoke with Derek Byrne, the assistant commissioner.  I suggested he pick seven or eight garda&iacute; and take them out of their locations because if one has a garda in Castletownbere or even Finglas, he is dependent on me to give him the nod when something is going on around the corner that is a bit untoward so that we can start detecting the crime.  If I happen to be a boat owner who has a black fellow on the boat and I am not paying him.  The Garda has not got involved and is not going to get involved in that.  If we are going to have a raid somewhere we need to train up people from different jurisdictions and bring them in, but the one thing we have to do is find a way to stop the boat owners from knowing we are coming.  I say that on record.  A raid took place in October and I rang the Garda on the Friday and said they need not bother going because the boat owner knew they were coming.  I told them the boats that would be there waiting for them.  This was a senior garda.  He asked me how I knew.  I said one of the boat owners had just told me.  He asked me who told him.  I said it was one of \"your lads\".<\/p> <p>  It is community based.  It is a community disease.  It is inherent in everything.  I always preface my remarks by saying I am a practising Catholic.  It is right from the Catholic Church all the way down to the Spar shop with the Western Union machine in it.  A Deputy owns one of the shops and I asked him one day in RTE whether there were any foreign workers in his port and he said \"No\".  I asked what he was doing with the Western Union machine in the front of his shop.  What Irish person sends people money through Western Union?  The whole system is in denial.  Unless we can get the Garda and the MSO to commit resources, no matter what we do to the permit scheme, what colour it is or how well designed it is, if there is not independent inspection and consequences this will go on and on.<\/p> <p>  If members saw those people when they are homeless or when they come to Liberty Hall and accept clothes for nothing, or if they saw me in RTE going next door to buy toilet rolls - in the name of Jesus - and the boat owners say I am a fantasist.  They cannot get me today because of House privilege but when they get me, if they ever get me, it will be off to the High Court with me because they are suing everyone else.

Since Theresa May funded the awareness on trafficking there has been a reconstruction of the attitude of the police in England.  I have given a few talks in every major county in England because there are 42 different police forces there.  I have met most of the important ones.  There is no sense in meeting a midland police force so we have stayed on the coast.  They have employed a guy by the name of David Enright who is a senior detective.  He is heading the thing up.  They mean to do the business, whereas over here we get together in these groups, these Santa Marta groups, and it is really grandeur and everybody is tapping everybody on the back.  The Archbishop of Dublin is there.  Everybody is there.  The PSNI is there.  The fisheries authorities are there.  Revenue is there.  Everybody is there.

We are treated as a pain in the arse and nothing is going to be done about it.  There is a view that no trade union movement or anyone like it will tell them how do to the work.  That is not what we are trying to do.  I was asked one day what were my aspirations before I retired.  I said that these people are in hell and at the end of the day they will remain in hell, but at least if we get them paid for it, we will have achieved something.

Only two fishermen out of 42 had permits just one year after the introduction of the permits scheme.  I would like to see the whites of the eyes of some of the employers involved.  In late 2015 and early 2016, I personally had to drag people to sign a memorandum of understanding that would enforce the employment rights of this scheme.  There was a problem, there is a problem and there continues to be a problem with certain agencies.  They have adopted a dog in a manger attitude in terms of the operation of this scheme.  In some respects they have exploited and abused people who have chosen to work in this country in difficult circumstances and in good faith.  I have no difficulty referencing the particular agency that took a repugnant attitude to the scheme from the start . The Marine Survey Office took a very territorial and proprietorial attitude to its responsibilities.  I found it difficult to get the office to sign the memorandum of understanding in the first place.  If it wants to discuss the matter, then I want to see it happen and we can discuss ways to improve the scheme.<\/p><p>As Mr. Fleming and others have acknowledged, the scheme was developed in good faith.  In response to an expos&eacute; published in <i>The Guardian <\/i>the Government at the time moved quickly to introduce a scheme that would bestow and apply employment rights to those who worked in this country.  I remind committee members that those who worked in the State until then were undocumented, by and large, and worked illegally as share fishermen.  The motivation was to grant employment rights to these individuals in order that they could benefit from legislation such as the National Minimum Wage Act, and the Workplace Relations Commission must ensure those rights are vindicated.  It was very clear to me that the scheme was not being enforced when only two fishermen had permits out of the 42 fishermen who met me in a hotel room in Drogheda.<\/p><p>Politically the scheme was designed to solve an egregious problem in the fishing industry and in our society in general.  Clearly, the lack of enforcement is an issue.  I have raised in the Seanad, and through various media platforms with Mr. Fleming in recent times, the need to review the scheme and for someone to take political responsibility for the scheme.  It is a political hot potato.  We are talking about migrant workers who are often abused and exploited.  The problem is there are no votes in it but resolving the matter is the right thing to do.  People are working here in good faith, but in many cases they are being abused and exploited and endure difficult circumstances.  The scheme needs to be reviewed.  I stand over the fact the scheme was designed with the best will in the world to introduce employment rights for people who are availing of a new permit scheme.  Sadly, the scheme is only good if agencies are prepared to enforce it, which has not been the case to date.  It would be useful to invite the agencies to attend here as it would allow us to get an holistic view of the problem and develop a route map that would resolve the issues with the scheme.<\/p><p>The Irish fishing industry depends on skilled non-EEA labour.  The industry must acknowledge that systems of pay and protection must be respected and introduced.  Mr. Fleming and I have discussed these matters.  We share the view that the industry needs a collective bargaining agreement or a sectoral employment order to govern pay, terms and conditions.  If the present situation continues, I envisage that the reputation of the Irish fishing fleet will be permanently damaged, which would have an impact on the supply chain and the market.  The Irish fishing industry markets itself as sustainable.  What about sustainable employment?  We need to reflect deeply on the matter.  There are some very good employers in the industry.  I know them and members know them because we have dealt with them.  People who circumvent the law queer the pitch for compliant and decent employers.  These employers work hard, run their businesses properly and look after their staff in compliance with the law.  Unfortunately, a number of individuals do not.  We must deal with them and this State must take responsibility for doing so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017070400002#H00400","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1499180400,"counter":308,"content":"<p>I wish to declare an interest.  As a former SIPTU official I know at first hand that everything Mr. Fleming has said is right and accurate.  One of my first experiences of being a trade union official took place in Rossaveal in Galway in 2007.  I was a fairly innocent and green trade union official who tried to help some Egyptian fishermen but I lost on a technicality.  I have spent more than ten years as a trade union official and in all that time I have never met people who were more exploited than the fishermen.  I have every confidence that this committee will tackle the issue because we have worked very well on other issues.  If we do not deal with this matter as a body politic, then there will be an inquiry in 20 or 30 years like the inquiry into mother and baby homes.  At that time we will be asked why, as a political class, we failed to deal with this scandal.  Let members be under no illusion that this is bonded labour or slavery and I saw it at first hand.  Regardless of our political differences, I do not believe anyone on this committee would stand over such a situation.  It raises a question that I will put to Mr. Fleming or Ms McGinley and I urge them not to answer my question in a party political way.  Why has there been a lack of political will to deal with the problem?  My theory is that the State authorities do not want to know because they know it would open a Pandora's box.<\/p><p>They know they will be opening a roll of shame that would show them up for their complete failure to intervene.  Therefore they would rather just keep playing along.  We have State actors, Departments and civil servants playing along saying there is nothing to see here when we know there is something to see here that is shocking and shames the country.  We are a country that sent our people overseas for years and here we are turning our backs on the weakest and most vulnerable workers.  We cannot even allow room to legislate for them to give them a modicum of safety and respect.<\/p><p> I would like to see representatives of NERA appear before the committee.  I have been a frustrated trade union official for years, but there is something scandalous here.  I want accountability.  The people in NERA have turned their backs on these workers for years.  They cannot say they did not know because Mr. Fleming and his colleagues in the ITF along with my colleagues in SIPTU and the people in the MRCI have flagged this.  Let us consider the statistics.  One in two workers has a real fear over safety at work.  Where is the State?  It is nowhere to be seen.<\/p><p> Earlier we discussed our priorities for the rest of the year.  I request that we not only write immediately for this time-banded review but that we call these people in as an issue of the utmost urgency.  This goes beyond anything else the committee has been dealing with.  We are dealing with slavery happening throughout the State.  My next question may be a loaded question, but I must ask it.  Is our fishing industry modelled on this slavery model?  Is that how it operates?  If it is, I for one do not want anything to do with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017070400002#H00500","speaker":"1389","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1499180400,"counter":310,"content":"<p>It is surviving on it.

This is going on everywhere.<\/p> <p>  However, there is another element to this that ties into a wider debate we need to have here and across Europe.  The EU has a huge responsibility for it.  It has led to a racist Europe.  It has blocked migrants from getting away from very dangerous situations and has not let them into Europe with a level of decency.  They are usually black and from places such as Egypt or Somalia.  They are drowning by the tens of thousands in the Mediterranean and being treated disgracefully by a fortress Europe.  If that does not indicate that the fish rots from the head - pardon the pun - then what does?  The EU is supposed to give a lead in how we deal with human beings.<\/p> <p>  I agree with Mr. Fleming's description of it as modern-day slavery.  Those sorts of conditions are modern-day slavery.  Slavery is only acceptable when one set of human beings is seen as a lesser form than another.  When they are treated as lesser people by allowing them to drown in the Mediterranean, when they are not allowed into EU countries and are put in camps when they get here, when we confine them to the torture of direct provision and do not allow them the right to work and keep them on a pittance in a place like Mosney, then we are sending out a signal that these are lesser human beings and the employers pick up on that signal.  The employers then exploit the fact that at sea beyond the 12-mile zone, no particular country has responsibility apart from the country whose flag the vessel bears and that flag can be changed.<\/p> <p>  The whole nine yards is at play here.  However, we immediately need investment in inspectors that will take this on and will check out boats as Mr. Fleming said.  While they may not be able to raid boats and be invisible - they are not the Marines after all - there are many ways to skin a cat and there are many ways they could find out.  While I stand to be corrected on this, I believe we have more dog wardens in the country than labour inspectors.  That goes to the heart of how we treat workers, particularly migrant workers, and more so if they are black and come from Africa or the Middle East.<\/p> <p>  There are a number of issues at play.  If this Department has any concern, it should look immediately at the level of employment inspectors.  It needs a strategy to find out what is going on, document it and go after those who are breaching employment law.  Given the previous role of the new Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the Department of Justice and Equality, I wold have thought she would have considerable experience in this.  I am not sure if she has the correct kind of experience.  It is a pity she is not here.  When she next appears before the committee, she might have something more to add to the discourse because a huge amount is at stake here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017070400002#J01100","speaker":"1367"},{"type":"speech","time":1499180400,"counter":320,"content":"<p>I wish to state that the Minister was not invited to attend today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017070400002#J01200","speaker":"1220"},{"type":"speech","time":1499180400,"counter":321,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fleming for his presentation.

It crosses five Departments and, without being pejorative, there is the old saying that when everyone is responsible, no one is responsible.  Clearly, due process is not taking place here.

Everything we can do should be done on this.  As mentioned earlier, ten or 15 years hence there could be an inquiry into this.

I was aware of the issue on our ships from speaking to my colleague.  I agree with many of the comments made.  We must invite representatives from the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, to appear before the committee as soon as possible.  We must ensure enforcement is part of the project in the future, and if we carry out a review of it, it should be a short-term review in order that we can get this to work.  Technically, five Departments could be in charge of this, but I do not wish to be here 20 years hence - I hope I will be alive 20 years hence - listening to how we did not solve this problem.  The least we should be able to say is that this committee did its best to come up with a solution.  We will work together on it.  Many of us have been shocked by the powerful presentation Mr. Fleming made.  I appreciate it.  I do not wish to be political about it but if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, has not responded, that message must be conveyed as well.

I agree with Deputy Neville and others that we should not break down on party lines in discerning a solution to this.  It is an issue of our common humanity and we must unite around that in our quest for solutions.  However, political responsibility must be taken at senior ministerial level.  No ministerial responsibility has been taken for the drift in the system over time.<\/p> <p>  As Mr. Fleming correctly pointed out, a group chaired by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, devised the non-EEA permit scheme, with the support of the Department of Justice and Equality and others.  There was a small element of the scheme where employment rights became an issue and where a memorandum of understanding was required to try to have some type of risk-based enforcement and inspection process in place.  I recall attending the last meeting of that group in December 2015.  Everyone congratulated themselves on a job well done, but I and officials in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation put our hands up and told them the job was not done as we had no idea how it was going to be enforced or what the inspection regime would be from the perspective of vindicating employment rights.  As Mr. Fleming knows, I spent two to three months trying to bang heads together, for want of a better phrase.  They were from eight agencies - the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Workplace Relations Commission labour inspectorate, the Health and Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners, the Marine Survey Office, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Naval Service - and five Departments.  This was to try to sign a memorandum of understanding as to who would take responsibility for inspecting ships and, critically, the sharing of information, because when there are limited inspection resources, best practice insists that one must share information and try to identify the actors in an industry who might be liable to be non-compliant.  That was difficult.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to make an explicit political point on the drift we have now and I hope people will not misinterpret this, but there must be direct ministerial responsibility for reforming this, and there has been silence from the political system over the last period.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017070400002#K00700","speaker":"1398"},{"type":"speech","time":1499180400,"counter":329,"content":"<p>I would also like to thank Ms McGinley, Ms Ryan, Mr. Fleming and the chaps who are present for giving their presentation today.

We have quite a lot of part-time and seasonal workers in farming and related industries.  My general experience is that most of them are treated as well as the farmers' own families.

In any 24-hour operation, the shifts are broken up into three shifts of eight hours or two shifts of 12 hours or some other division.  As there is no rule or legislation, however, which demands a minimum number of crew to operate the vessel, it can be sailed with as small as crew as one thinks one can get away with.  If a vessel is operating for 24 hours, those on board cannot rest.  Everybody, including the skipper, is at work for that particular period of time.  When the skipper finally reaches the barrier and has to give in, he will go to bed because he has that choice, and one of the other unfortunates on board will continue to steer the boat and haul until the skipper resurfaces.  The guys with whom I have learned to work are getting approximately two to three hours sleep in every 24 hours.  Those vessels are out there and it is just a matter of luck that they are not drifting in front of other boats and ferries and causing major accidents.<\/p> <p>  If we review a permit scheme, as I said at the outset, it would be meaningless because Deputy Coveney's task force was dismantled behind our backs.  No one told us.  The actual task force, which was put in place to bring all the State agencies together in order that we would not have this multiplicity of secretaries and offices and Deputies, is gone.  They thought we would not find out.  That did not happen by mistake.  That was deliberate.  They believed we would run out of steam.  My organisation has been dragged so far into this that we have put millions aside.  We will stay for as long as possible.  <\/p> <p>  In respect of Senator Reilly's comment, we have attacked the agencies by way of the retail outlets.  We are working on a memorandum of understanding with all of the European supermarkets.  If we are forced to pull the trigger, it will bring the fishing industry in Ireland to an end and it will disgrace us.  We have sent submissions to Europe.  We are preparing a formal complaint against the State.  This is not something which an Irishman does against his own country.  It is all because we cannot energise any Department in Ireland or any Government agency, from the Garda National Immigration Bureau to anybody else.  They are confiscating passports.  I have been on Burgh Quay getting passports belonging to unfortunate poor individuals handed back because the garda&iacute; took their passports, which they had no right to do.  The garda&iacute; themselves are exercising control over these people in some circumstances.<\/p><p>These people are wandering around without documentation in fear that the next garda they meet will tip them on the shoulder, arrest and deport them.  I do not have any training but when I went into the office with P&aacute;draig Yeates and asked why a person's passport was taken, I was told to wait for a moment.  A garda then brought the man out, asked him to sign a form and gave him an extra six months to stay in the country.  He handed back his passport, tapped him on the head and said he hoped he would find a job on a fishing boat.  This was done in my presence and I would testify to that anywhere.  This happened in the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, office.  What in the name of God is going on and what was going on before the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland and I got involved in this issue?  This is an indictment on the GNIB.  I once saw Mr. Yeates offer his hand to an Egyptian fisher, who shied away from shaking hands because he had lost a hand.  I had to tell Mr. Yeates that he did not want to show that a hand was missing.  When we asked what was being done about the loss of his hand, the fisherman said he could not do anything as the boat owner had told him he was illegal and if he opened his mouth, he would be deported.  He said he could not go back to Egypt. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017070400002#L01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Ken Fleming","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1499180400,"counter":348,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Fleming and our other guests for their powerful presentations.

If members want to change the system, they must highlight the issue.  We have been banging on for years about the practice of tying workers to employers.<\/p> <p>  We appeared recently before the joint committee to discuss the issue of banded contracts.  There is a serious problem in that there are no criminal sanctions applied when employers take money out of employees' pockets.  The National Minimum Wage Act provides a criminal sanction but it is very difficult to trigger.  If an employer puts his hand in the pocket of a worker and robs him or her, as is happening here, the employer does not face criminal sanction.  The legislation presents an opportunity to introduce criminal sanctions for those who rob workers' wages. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JEJ2017070400002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Ms Edel McGinley"},{"type":"speech","time":1499180400,"counter":354,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their engagement with the joint committee.
