Our thoughts and the thoughts of the members of the Fianna F\u00e1il group in the House, which the Leader mentioned, are firmly with Detective Garda Donohoe's family and his colleagues, who I visited in the detective branch in Swords yesterday where his brother serves.

While much has been said about it, anyone who has read any of the circumstances of Friday night's murder will understand just how particularly vicious and brutal it was.  All of us would want to send sympathies to his wife, his two very young children, his family and the community in the area.  I agree with the Leader's rescheduling of business for tomorrow, which is appropriate.  Fortunately it is a rare occurrence when a garda is shot dead in the course of duty and in the course of protecting the community.  However, perhaps because it is so rare, it is very important to mark it with appropriate respect and sympathy.  That is the right thing to do for tomorrow.  I also agree that it is not the day for calling for the usual sorts of adversarial debates in light of what has happened.

He was a gentle giant and a pillar of the community.  I express sympathy to his grieving wife and family.  I pay tribute to An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and in particularly to his colleague, detective garda Ryan, who with extraordinary courage after this terribly traumatic event turned up in the Garda station to help in the efforts to find his colleague's killers.  It is a sad day for us, particularly because of this situation.  In addition there are a number of other people bereaved - our colleagues Senator Henry and Senator Clune, whom I just saw in the dining room.  I presume we will have an opportunity to pay a more extended tribute to Senator Eamon De Buitl\u00e9ar who was such a vital and wonderful part of this House.  I will also remember the late Kevin Heffernan, who was a vital part of the Dublin football team.  I was lucky enough to see those three titanic matches in the 1970s between Dublin and Kerry, two of which, I am very glad to say, we won.<\/p><p>  Even at this sad time we have to represent the citizens because there is sadness not just in bereavement, but there is sadness for many people in the experience of living.  I received an e-mail from a public service employee who has been really struggling to survive as follows:<ul><ul>I type this letter as a very worried public sector employee ... I was just about able to pay my mortgage of &#8364;822 last year and now the mortgage is gone up to &#8364;987 and in the your words [because I replied to him] this is now unsustainable.

I fear I am going to put out of my house&quot;.  As I have said before we now have evictions, soup kitchens and children being told to jump up and down in schools.  The property tax is again going back to the 19th century because people who dare to improve their houses are actually penalised, as it is not based on the value of the house at the time they bought it.<\/p><p>  I received another e-mail from a woman stating:<ul><ul>I have to bring to your attention the fact that a number of secondary school students were not allowed onto the school bus this week as they did not have a ticket.  They were literally left standing on the side of the road, humiliated in front of their peers [their fellow schoolchildren] ...

I would ask that, while I appreciate that my colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, has said that, given the seriousness of the crime perpetrated last week and the callous murder of Detective Garda Donohoe, this is not a day for normal business, as Senator Norris stated, we must also press on and raise the issues that are necessary.<\/p><p>As Senator Darragh O'Brien stated, a debate would be useful.  There was a debate last week in the context of dealing with issues to do with the Garda.  Resourcing, this crime aside, is a major issue within the Garda.  While people understand that the Government must make cuts, when it comes to front-line health service and law enforcement all of us would gladly contribute more to have the knowledge of our relative security, and that is incumbent on all of us.  When that debate takes place, perhaps we can begin to peel back the blindfold on some of the issues within the Garda that are being under resourced.  For example, Sligo, in the north-west, has a detective unit of eight detectives and there is one car between them.  Cavan has a unit with six detectives and there is no car for those six detectives.  While I can appreciate when the Minister states that the crime of last week is in no way connected to resources, when there are eight detectives in Sligo and six in Cavan with but one car for those 14 Garda to do their duties, I am bound to conclude we are not providing them with the necessary resources.<\/p><p>Finally, I ask for an early clarification from the Minister for Finance, if he is available to come to the House - he has so often made himself available to us - to clarify what is going on in the context of the promissory note.  This was announced to us as the panacea that would help deal with matters.  We on this side of the House support the Government's efforts in this regard.  The Taoiseach stated that Ireland is the only country that did not have the same tools available to it in dealing with the crisis as other countries have.<\/p> <p>The people of Ireland and the Government have shown solidarity to European communion in helping to save the euro.  Now it is time for them to reciprocate.  There is complete confusion in this regard between Bloomberg, CNN and the various other news agencies.

However, the people of Roscommon were in the same position.  We were 37 or 38 miles away from the nearest accident and emergency department but it was decided to strip us of that department based on information from HIQA which had never visited the hospital.  This calls into question the role of HIQA.  I have always stated that HIQA was created by the HSE to cover for it and for the political system so they were not to blame.  I call for a debate - with the Minister for Health and nobody else - on the way forward in our health service, smaller hospitals and accident and emergency departments.

In Amsterdam, the mayor and city council have established what the Dutch newspapers are calling &quot;scum villages&quot;.  This arises with regard to what is happening in Ennis.  Anti-social behaviour is being replicated in every town and village in Ireland.  Amsterdam and other areas in the Netherlands are moving repeat offenders out of their houses into Portakabins or ship containers.  They are then moved to an area outside the town where they are supervised 24\/7 by social workers and the police.  They are not allowed to leave these areas until they learn to behave properly.  <\/p><p>I am asking the Leader for a debate on sentencing.  Last week, we saw a high-profile case on sentencing.  Anti-social behaviour is a blight on every community and is terrifying decent people.  We may not establish what the Dutch newspapers refer to as &quot;scum villages&quot;, but the only way to control these people is through their pockets.

Yesterday, it came to my attention that staff in Derrynea courthouse in County Galway were told that their administrative office is to be closed down by the end of April.  I understand this is part of a rationalisation process.  The courthouses concerned are at Inis M\u00f3r and An Spid\u00e9al in County Galway, as well as Derrynea in Connemara, which is one of only a few Irish-speaking courts in the country.  This is a national review, so it would be good if the Minister could attend the House to explain its current status and his plans.  I am afraid that there will be a scaling down of court services, particularly in rural areas, which would be a retrograde step.  I am calling for that not to happen.

Consequently, I wish to add my voice to that of Senator Kelly in calling for a debate in the House in which the Minister for Health should participate.  Moreover, this should not be an Adjournment debate but I ask that the Minister participate in an open debate in which Members can ask questions of him on the matter.  In addition, the ban on staff recruitment should be lifted to enable the opening of these units because more than 200 patients are waiting to access the services, some of whose lives are at risk.

It is a family that has contributed a lot to the protection of the State and it is horrific that a serving member of An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na should be killed in such a brutal manner while protecting the people's money.

They are heartfelt and they reflect the feelings of a stunned nation at this time.  People cannot begin to understand how anyone could do what was done to Detective Garda Donohoe but it is a reminder of the vicious elements that still exist in society.  At all times we must be cautious and supportive of our police force in every way possible.  I listened to a television commentator last night and he stated how our police force enjoys the affection and appreciation of all the people, more than any police force in the world.  One of the reasons for that, as I have said in the House on many occasions, is that we have one of the finest police forces in the world.  Detective Garda Donohoe is a hero, a patriot in every sense of the word.  He was putting his life on the line, as all garda\u00ed must do, to protect our way of life, give us a sense of security and uphold the State.<\/p><p>Two Senators today referred to Detective Garda Donohoe as a gentle giant.  He was that in every sense.  I did not know him personally but realised this when I read about him subsequently and heard the expressions of admiration for him.  I also realised that this was a moment in the life of the nation when we had to be determined that there would be zero tolerance in regard to any activity of a violent or barbaric nature, that we should help our police force through the Legislature in any way we can.  In this House there is a completely non-partisan approach to good policing; we are all working for the same aim.  That is the greatest message we can give from this terrible tragedy: we are united on this issue.

While we have 13,500 brave garda\u00ed out there on a daily basis protecting us and serving their country in highly dangerous situations, we must remember those paramedics, prison officers, fire fighters and those working in accident and emergency departments and the Civil Defence who might not have been subjected to such a barbaric act as Detective Garda Donohoe but who too often have been victims of abuse.  These people are understated national heroes who go about their jobs every day all too familiar with the specific occupational hazards.  They deserve our support and I will do all I can to protect those who are in harm's way because of their jobs.  We must adopt a policy of zero tolerance for those thugs who threaten the very essence of what these people do.

The murderers' only interest was financial gain.  I know Detective Garda Joe Ryan and knew Detective Garda Donohoe perhaps a little better.  He lived about six miles from my home and I had several conversations with him over the years.  This morning, I visited his football club on my way to sign a book of condolences to his family.  The local community is devastated at having lost a great young man.  Detective Garda Donohoe was a true garda and everyone recognises the part he played in the community.  He won a county championship medal with Naomh P\u00e1draig in 2003 and after his football days were over, he gave of his time after work to benefit young people at Scoil N\u00e1isi\u00fanta Bellurgan, where my colleague, Senator Jim D'Arcy, taught for some time.<\/p><p>The murderers of Detective Garda Donohoe must be caught and brought to justice.  They must spend the rest of their days in prison.  A sentence of 40 years should not be reduced to 30 or 25 years.  The Garda and PSNI will work together.  A member of my family suffered at the hands of the same thugs from south Armagh when his Jeep, including equipment he needs for work, was stolen.  On Friday night, as soon as I mentioned the murder of the detective garda, he told me the thugs who had carried it out were living in south Armagh.  I know gentlemen from the same part of the country but the individuals in question live in south Armagh and their only interest is in robbery and thuggery.  As I stated, they robbed from my family.

I know the role the Garda has played in protecting this State since 1922.  I had the personal experience as a young teenager of having garda\u00ed protect our home against people who called themselves republicans and who were stoning our property.

Sadly, this area used to be referred to as &quot;bandit country&quot;, but I am afraid some of the banditry is lingering on.  I know the Garda and the PSNI co-operate wonderfully together, but in south Armagh and north Louth, consideration should be given to a corridor where both forces can operate together, and we should do whatever we need to do in legislation to enable it.  We know, for instance, that if our forensic team had been able to gain access to the burned out car in Keady, it would have speeded things up and we would not have had the delay.

That sort of occurrence is extremely unusual and that fact must be brought to bear when these men are brought to justice.  It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever that they would knowingly enter into a situation in which they would have been dealing with members of the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na.  Like others speakers, in particular Senator Brennan, I would welcome co-operation between the Garda and the PSNI and would appeal to the public, especially in the area where this occurred, to provide any information, no matter how insignificant it may appear, to the Garda to bolster its efforts to bring these men to justice as soon as possible.  I agree with previous speakers that today is not the day for the debate but it raises the point that these people, who are at the front line on a daily basis protecting the citizens of this country and all aspects of our lives, including the financial aspect, which unfortunately was the case here, should be given the resources they require.<\/p> <p> I would also like to commend the work of the Dublin joint policing committee, which I attend.  It is not until one actually has regular interaction with the garda\u00ed that one sees how responsive they are and how they take on board the suggestions made by various interested parties - politicians and others - to contribute to the overall security of the country.  <\/p><p>I would also like to support the comments of Senator Hayden regarding the Constitutional Convention.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the interactions and debate that occurred at the convention.  It is a work in progress and this has never been done before.  It is very novel and I was quite hesitant before attending and thought that it may not have the teeth we might like it to have.  Certainly all areas of society are represented in the convention and I believe very good proposals will come from it.  I hope the Government will listen to those proposals when the time comes.

We were called to speak to the Seanad in 2005 so I am not quite a novice but perhaps the L plates are still there.  In my presentation I propose to deal with those areas in which I specialise.  A very positive aspect of the European Parliament is that it gives members an opportunity to work on committees in areas in which they have specialist knowledge.  The areas on which I work and which I examine are agriculture, rural development, environment, food safety and public health.<\/p><p>The title of my paper is Food for Thought - Ireland and the EU 40 years on.  In recent weeks and months we have had much food for thought and perhaps we will debate this later.  I certainly want to allude to it in my presentation.  If I have time I will mention the medical devices directive because I have been appointed the shadow rapporteur for the EPP group on this important legislation which has huge implications for improving patient safety and the industry.  As Ireland has a large medical devices industry, the Seanad will be interested.<\/p><p>The EU has gone through many difficult phases, perhaps none more so than the current one, and the House has debated many of the issues.  Despite all of the negativity about the EU and whether it had the ability to pull itself back from the brink, we have managed to calm the situation.  I ask people to reflect back to a year ago when there was a huge sense of unease, uncertainty and fear in the population and in politics generally about the ongoing crisis.  In as far as we have stabilised the situation, we have calmed the mindset in the European Union, notwithstanding people are still unemployed, including far too many young people.  There are also debt burdens and a dimming of the sense of hope we are trying to restore.  Things can and will get better, not because we want them to or because we are willing them to improve but because we are taking action to make things better.<\/p><p>Europe works slowly and in a complex way and markets and media have quite the opposite demands.  There is therefore a mismatch between the expectations of what Europe should be doing and the pace at which the European Union can work because of its institutional organisation and the need to engage.  Those in politics need to understand there is a tendency to give a knee-jerk response and get a reaction in the public space, but sometimes we need to be more reflective and hold back on responses to situations because our initial reaction is not always the best or the most long-lasting.  I compliment Herman Van Rompuy, who as President of the Council is always worth listening to for the very reason that he does not give a headline.  He gives depth and commentary which will stand the test of time.  This is a good mark of the man given the job he does.<\/p><p>I am glad to say that those who predicted the demise of the European Union, and certainly the demise of the single currency, are less vocal today.  We went through a time in the Parliament when it was extremely tense and difficult with unusual fighting matches across the Chamber.<\/p> <p>That has certainly eased somewhat, although the difficulties have not gone away and more needs to be done.<\/p><p>I will deal with the farming and food industries now.  I am conscious of time, so I may abbreviate my remarks but will leave my script for Members to consult.  When one looks at Irish agriculture one must take into account how it has evolved in the last 40 years of EU membership.  In 1973, agriculture accounted for 18% of GDP while today it is around 2%.  The agri-food sector accounted for 40% of our exports while today it is around 7%.  It is, however, much more important than that figure suggests because there is a low import content and there is also less repatriation of profits.  It is an important sector and I think this House recognises that.<\/p><p>In 1973, the farm workforce was approximately 263,000 or 25% of the total workforce.  Today it is significantly less at around 85,000 people or 5% of the workforce.  It is enlightening to look back at the evolution of the policy.  We joined the EEC and farmers welcomed it because it gave them guaranteed higher prices for their produce than they has been getting before membership.<\/p><p>In 1957, the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy spoke about things that we are still trying to achieve, such as increasing agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress, ensuring the rational development of agricultural production, optimum use of resources, ensuring a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, stabilising markets, assuring availability of supplies, and ensuring that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices.  Those objectives were set out in 1957 and they are still as relevant today as they were when first drafted.  <\/p><p>Farmers responded to those guaranteed higher prices in the 1970s: milk production increased and so did beef and grain.  Those with memories, however, will recall that things went too far and in 1984 we had milk quotas.  We also had other restrictions because the European agricultural budget situation was going out of control. <\/p><p>In 1992, we had the MacSharry reforms which were a significant departure - moving away from price and market supports to a lower price regime and the introduction of direct payments by way of area aid and livestock payments.  We also had Agenda 2000 and the mid-term review of 2003.  I mention the latter, in particular, because it was hugely significant.  It heralded the introduction of the current single farm payment system.  It introduced a concept of cross-compliance which links the payments farmers receive to meeting environmental, food safety, animal and plant health, animal welfare standards, and a requirement to keep land in good agricultural and environmental condition.<\/p><p>It also saw the introduction of the rural development policy being strengthened to give farmers assistance with environmental and quality assurance schemes, and animal welfare standards.  Ireland opted for full decoupling of payments.  On 1 January 2005, therefore, there was no longer a requirement to have an animal to get a payment.  There was resistance to it initially but the system came in.  Farmers did have to meet these statutory management requirements and, indeed, there were many inspections around this issue.  However, full decoupling came and farmers have learned to live with it.<\/p><p>In 2008, we had the health check which confirmed that milk quotas would be abolished in 2015.  Given that they have been in place since the early 1980s, it is a significant policy departure and it also deepened the decoupling process for other member states that have not gone the way we had.<\/p><p>We are now in a current round of reforms and last week the European Parliament's agriculture committee exercised its first major vote under co-decision on agriculture policy.  We managed to distill some 8,000 amendments to around 25 or 30, so it was a major piece of work.  More importantly, we managed to get support for the compromise amendments.  <\/p><p>For the first time, the European Parliament has the same power as the Council on agriculture policy and has therefore brought more openness and democracy to the process.  However, it has also brought a layer of complexity which requires MEPs to table amendments and then try to reach compromises within and between groups.  While the experience so far has not been easy - I was one of the lead negotiators - it can work.  <\/p> <p>We delivered a vote last week, which will go before the full plenary of Parliament in March.<\/p><p>Allied with the vote we will take in March on our position on Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform - I will refer to some of the details shortly -  we hopefully also will vote on the European Union's budget for the period from 2014 to 2020.  This is hugely significant because without figures, we will not be able to sign off on the actual detail of the reforms.  As Members are aware, there was an attempt to agree the figures late last year between the Heads of State and Government.  Unfortunately, that failed and will meet again in early February.  The fact the meeting has been called is a positive sign.  My optimistic side would consider the possibility that the Heads of State and Government can agree figures that are reasonable.  While Members are aware there is an attempt to cut \u20ac75 billion from the Commission's proposal, it might be possible to reach some sort of compromise on that.  Thereafter, it would be a question of whether the Parliament could be persuaded that this was an adequate budget, because Members should remember the Parliament can reject or accept a budget but cannot amend it.  However, it is an interesting political dynamic, in that I believe the Parliament will look twice the figures and it cannot be taken for granted that it would simply assent to whatever was on the table.  In the event that the Parliament does agree and the vote on the budget goes through and if we can vote through our agriculture compromises in plenary session - I think some difficult areas will arise in the plenary vote - thereafter we will be free to open discussions with the Council.  As with all deals, it will be that the Commission, the Council and the members of our negotiating team, of which I will be one, will sit down and will try to thrash out an agreement at an overarching level for the European Union that maintains a Common Agricultural Policy and that fits and gives flexibility to member states which have different issues.<\/p><p>I regret there has been very little debate about the new aspects of the policy but perhaps this House could take up some of these points.  The idea is framed that we want a greener and fairer Common Agricultural Policy and one concept that is talked about is to use public money for public goods.  To put it at its simplest, the view is that in agriculture, farmers sell their produce but do not receive sufficient reward from the marketplace to value in the public goods dimension, that is, their welfare standards, environmental contributions and management of the landscape.  Consequently, the thrust of policy is to suggest that increasingly, money will be available to support farmers dedicated towards the delivery of public goods.  In my contributions, I always have stated that food also is a public good and one cannot divorce one from the other and therefore, a link must be kept.  However, the proposal is that 30% of direct payments to farmers would be directly linked to delivering more environmental measures such as crop diversification, permanent pasture and provision of ecological focus areas.  Those Members who are familiar with farming would regard those as being the bit in the field one did not farm because it was left for nature.  However, under these proposals we would be obliged to plan some of these back into the system.  I acknowledge there is a great deal of controversy around this proposal.  Some of these issues, particularly the 30% issue, will be decided by the Heads of State and Government because it is part of the multiannual financial framework, MFF, discussion.  As Members are aware, there are member states within the Council, that seek to cut the payments and there are others which seek to have agriculture contribute more in respect of both greening and climate actions.  Consequently, there is quite a big push in that direction.  I spoke at the Oxford farming conference earlier this month and made the point that I understood the focus on the payments because in 2011, which was a relatively good year, more than 73% of farm incomes came from the single farm payment.  Consequently, Members can discern the reason this is so important to farmers who are out in the fields - indeed, one could not be out in the fields today because it is so wet, which will have an impact on farm incomes - and who rely so much on this payment.  However, a deeper debate is needed on the direction of the policy.  While we have tried to do this in the European Parliament, national parliaments and Members of this House could help us in that regard.<\/p><p>I mentioned the reliance on the single farm payment.  This is something about which I have a concern because we regard agriculture as being the backbone of our recovery and it can and will be that.  Moreover, we have a good reputation for food.  However, that industry is being built on a sector that is heavily reliant on a Common Agricultural Policy.<\/p> <p>That is why we are fighting hard on the budget side and on the orientation of the policy.  We must not do anything to suddenly pull the rug from under farmers.  We must ensure those who are producing continue to receive support to do that, particularly where we have increased market volatility.  If we look at dairy produce or any of the other commodity areas, we see greater market volatility, which is very difficult for farmers to deal with on a daily basis.<\/p><p>Some of the income points revealed by Teagasc for last year are worth looking at.  Average farm income was down 12%.  Year on year, farmers can suffer swings in their incomes.  In the good year of 2011, an average family farm income was \u20ac24,462.  I know dairy farmers' incomes are higher but many of our farmers are in dry stock and suckling so average incomes in agriculture are low.  The same story exists across the rest of the European Union.  In general, farm incomes are about 50% of the average of the rest of the population.  The line we should push is that we eat on the back of low income farming.<\/p><p>That brings me to another part of the debate at European Union level and within member states.  If there is less support for farming through the public purse and a drive for budgetary austerity in the European Union, what is happening to the food market?  I have been involved in an initiative on this in the European Parliament, and since 2010, the Commission has been investigating the food supply chain.  The fact the Commission set up a round table of all the stakeholders and major players, such as distributors, manufacturers and retailers, meant that something was wrong.  The Commission now accepts there is a problem in the food supply chain, that it does not function as it should and needs greater scrutiny.  That is the case in my opinion.  To some extent we had a crisis in the banking sector because people thought the banks were regulated and everything was fine.  It was only after the crisis that we realised the sector was poorly regulated and needed further scrutiny.  The food chain is much more vulnerable.  Food is essential for us all and good food is particularly important for our children.<\/p><p>We have a situation, however, where there are a large number of producers, smaller numbers along the supply chain and then a major concentration of power at the retail end.  Shoppers have very little idea when they buy a product of where it comes from, although that is a separate issue, and what the price was along the line.  There is a greater need for transparency along the food supply chain.<\/p><p>There is also some difficult and sharp practice in the chain.  It is interesting that the Commission, with the stakeholders, drew up a list of areas that were wrong and needed to be corrected. As a result of that process, an agreement for a voluntary code of practice has been drawn up.  It is a gentleman's agreement, although that makes me smile because there must be gentlemen at the table for such an agreement.  Let us be clear, however, about what it means.  I was at the last meeting of the stakeholder forum and it was interesting that all those involved in the process want a voluntary agreement because there is a threat of legislation at EU level on the relationships along the supply chain.  It is recognised that such legislation would be extraordinarily difficult but the threat exists.  Later this week, the Commission will adopt a Green Paper on unfair trading practices in the entire retail supply chain.  I would prefer it to deal with food separately but it has decided to look at all of the supply chain.<\/p><p>It is interesting that the only groups that would not sign up to the voluntary code were the farming organisations, which wanted a legislative process.  I bring this to the attention of the House because there has been discussion in all member states about the imbalance of power.  In the United Kingdom, an adjudicator has been appointed and she has the power to investigate practices in the supply chain and it will be possible to complain anonymously.  Britain is not the only member state where this is happening.  I have dealt with other member states where this is being done because of the concentration of power.<\/p> <p>Producers constantly argue that they receive very little of the price we pay for food, which is not to say that food prices should rise.  We need to recognise, however, the way in which food prices are determined if we are to decide whether the process is fair and equitable.  Senators should be interested in this issue and I believe they are. <\/p><p>A question arises in this regard for those who are interested in competition law.  When we have moments to spare, I and some other Members of the European Parliament discuss whether competition law, as it currently applies, works to the betterment of food consumers or whether it should be examined more forensically.  If the objective of competition law is simply to deliver cheap food, what are the consequences of this approach further back in the food chain?  We saw the consequences of this approach in a recent case which indicated that it may not be such a good idea. <\/p><p>I want to move to the issue that has dominated the conversation of those who are involved in the food and agriculture sector, namely, the finding of horse DNA in burgers.  I am aware that the matter was widely discussed and debated in the House.  I compliment the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, on obtaining and, with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, forensically revealing the details of the case.  Ireland has led the way on this issue.  For example, the FSAI is the only food safety authority in Europe that uses DNA testing for authenticity.  We have shown great leadership on this issue and have been very open with the relevant information.  The issue of authenticity of food is much higher up on the agenda as a result of the work done in this country.<\/p><p>Many Senators will understand the traceability systems we have in place.  For example, farmers here participate in a process involving birth certificates, ear tags and registrations.  There is a sense, therefore, that people felt let down by the circumstances of the most recent case involving horse DNA in burgers.  We have also grown more aware of the complexity of the food supply chain.  I am tempted to try to quote Professor Patrick Wall, who is a rock of sense on these issues.  He observed that food manufacturers must trust carefully all of their suppliers and if they are unable to fully trust their suppliers, they should not use their products.<\/p><p>I wrote to the Commission on this issue and I have no doubt from the response I received this morning that the recent case involved a breach of EU labelling laws.  If a non-beef product is in a beef burger, this should be stated on the label.  This is extremely important, especially as regards other animal species.  Animal species and the preparations used must be stated on all minced beef products.  If horsemeat or another ingredient is in minced beef, this should be identified on the label.<\/p><p>The relevant legislation is being strengthened.  From December 2014, a regulation on the provision of food information to consumers will require, in the case of meat products or meat preparations containing added protein, including hydrolysed proteins of different animal origin, that the name of the food will bear an indication of the presence of such proteins and their origin.  Accordingly, a beef burger containing horse protein would have to be designated under the name &quot;beef burger with horse protein&quot;.  <\/p><p>While the idea of labelling is crucial, a label will stick on anything and anything can be put on a label. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900015#R00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359471900,"counter":56,"content":"<p>Ms McGuinness, you are going over time.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900019#V00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359471900,"counter":57,"content":"<p>I will conclude.

I also applaud her for her continuing contribution and for wearing the green jersey in the European Parliament, particularly in her area of expertise.  I will raise a couple of issues she may wish to address.<\/p> <p>In the last day or two her colleague, Pat the Cope Gallagher, MEP, has criticised what he believes will be a massive reduction in EU Structural Funds.  He reports that 43.5% or almost \u20ac200 million will be taken out of the Structural Funds between 2014 and 2020.  He has asked that a special provisional allocation of up to \u20ac345 million go towards the Border, midland and western, BMW, region.  He makes the point that the criteria used are flawed and outdated due to the figures being used by the Commission with regard to wealth.  The reference years used predate the devastating economic crisis and rising unemployment levels across Ireland and particularly in the BMW region.  The unemployment rate now stands at 16.5% across the region, which is 20% below the EU target set under the Europe 2020 strategy for growth.  Perhaps Ms McGuinness will comment on that.<\/p><p>There is also the question of payments.  The IFA takes the view that any redistribution of payments must not undermine the viability of family farms and must be on the basis of objective criteria.  As Ms McGuinness is aware, there in an ongoing debate in this country about what are termed &quot;active farmers&quot;.  Can she outline what she believes to be the definition of active farmers?  Like my friend and colleague, Senator Comiskey, I come from a severely disadvantaged area where there are primarily stock farmers and hardly any form of tillage.  About 99% of the land in County Leitrim is marginal and does not grow anything much other than trees, which I understand are supposed to be a key area of growth but that has brought its own legacy.  I am curious to establish this.  On the one hand, there is a view that the proposals on the direct payments will benefit approximately 75% of farmers across the country, in areas where there are both tillage and dairy farmers, yet there appears to be some resistance to this on the basis that there will be a continuation of direct payments to corporate bodies and the very rich and that this could somehow undermine the continuing viability of the family farm.  Where I come from farming is part-time to a large extent.  People try to get extra off-farm income.  However, the money they receive directly from Europe goes into the local towns and villages and the local economy.  Any disruption or significant reduction of that will have a knock-on effect on the local economy.  I am curious to hear Ms McGuinness's views on the issue of payments.<\/p><p>There is also the rural development programme and greening.  There appears to be controversy about the greening proposals.  Members of the agriculture committee visited Germany a few weeks ago and I was interested to find that the Germans are very concerned about the greening measures as well.  It was salutary to discover that they are also concerned for what they term their disadvantaged areas.  I understood that all of Germany had lush, fertile land but that is not strictly the case.  We might be able to engage in common cause with them in that regard.  We secured funding of \u20ac350 million under the rural development programme.  Again, there is concern that this could be reduced.  Will Ms McGuinness comment on that?  There is also discussion about capping the payments due to the large sums of money some individuals have been getting.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900019#V00400","speaker":"1128","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359472200,"counter":60,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, to the House.  We are delighted to have her here for this discussion on \"Food for Thought - Ireland and the EU 40 years on\".  As she is aware, prior to its accession to the EU Ireland had a predominantly agriculture based economy, and society was heavily dependent on agriculture.  We were mainly dependent on the UK market and struggling to shake off the effects of years of protectionist policies.  While Irish products were readily accepted on the UK market, the advantage was limited.  British policy at the time was to allow the entry of overseas agricultural products, but at low prices.  That left little profit for the Irish producer and it constrained wages and development within the sector.  The 1960s saw a move away from this policy and with British accession to the EEC likely at that time, participation by Ireland was very attractive.<\/p> <p>Irish EEC membership provided access to the Common Market, and the Common Agricultural Policy offered security and provided pricing levels for goods fixed at the higher rates than previously available to the Irish producer.  Membership of the Common Market and, subsequently, the Single Market transformed the Irish agricultural sector and food production across the Continent.  The Single Market created access to a market of 500 million people for Irish goods by removing administrative burdens for Irish food exporters.<\/p><p>The Common Agricultural Policy introduced a means of securing food production in Europe while alleviating the pressures on the farming community and farm incomes.  The direct payment schemes allowed many to remain on the land at a time when emigration and urbanisation were becoming the norm.  CAP coupled a system of direct payment with rules governing rural development policy aimed at improving the environment and the countryside and improving the quality of life in rural areas while encouraging diversification of the rural economy.  Rural development measures have been instrumental in creating employment, promoting tourism and maintaining national identity in rural areas.<\/p><p>Ireland has been the recipient of \u20ac10 billion in funding under the Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund since 1973.  The original aim of CAP was to make Europe self-sufficient in food but soon this aim was surpassed, creating the challenges of over-production and necessitating changes in the structure of CAP.  Reform was necessary and payments were unhooked from production.  Emphasis was placed on protection of the environment, the quality and safety of our food and the welfare of our animals.  Laws regulating the production of food and food safety date back to ancient times, but a body of legislation now exists regulating food labelling, additive use, organic food and genetically modified production.<\/p><p>The BSE crisis in the 1990s pushed food safety to the top of the European agenda.  The EU had to become more willing to safeguard human health and assist the industry in making a recovery.  As a consequence, notification procedures were introduced and prescribed hygiene practices became standardised across Europe.  Today there are continued advances in the methods of production within the agrisector with the emergence of new technologies.  The evaluation and the testing of these new technologies to assess food safety can be onerous and expensive, in particular on farming people, which was mentioned by Ms McGuinness.  From the time the animal is born on the farm, farmers are very careful about tagging and traceability, and rightly so, but it creates a lot of costs.  However, by using the combined resources of the EU, member states will be better able to respond to these new technologies.  By acting as a whole, the EU can protect public health, prevent unfair practices and ease consumer concerns.<\/p><p>Greater EU food safety standards have contributed to the improvement of the health and well-being of European citizens.  Almost 75% of active pesticides have been removed from the EU market.  An EU integrated approach to food safety is also the most effective means of making animal health a prerequisite for safe food.  The EU has introduced laws on the trading of live animals and animal products which, over 20 years, have eradicated many serious diseases.<\/p><p>Globalisation will contribute to assisting the spread of many diseases, but through co-operation and uniform action among member states, Europe will be better able to respond.  The EU is already the biggest global exporter of food and feed, amounting to \u20ac65 billion in 2010, but with global concerns regarding food security and food prices rising, an opportunity exists for agricultural producers and processors.<\/p><p>Growing levels of obesity may require a shift in focus from food safety to the nutritional value of food.  However, what is clear is that these new challenges, as with previous challenges, are best dealt with through the development of a uniform and co-operative legislative programme.<\/p> <p>In doing so, the EU will be best placed to create a sustainable, export-driven agrifood sector in the next 40 years and beyond.  I thank Ms McGuinness for being with us today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900020#W00200","speaker":"1124","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359472800,"counter":63,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, to the Chamber for this, our second address from a Member of the European Parliament.  We are really glad to have this opportunity to engage with her and we found last week's engagement with Mr. Gay Mitchell, MEP, very useful.  Some of what Ms McGuinness said struck a chord in terms of the procedure of passing legislation at European Parliament level, which is not understood or debated enough in the domestic sphere.  She mentioned, for example, 8,000 amendments before the agriculture committee, which puts into perspective some of the differences between the European Parliament and national parliaments.<\/p><p>I pay tribute to the great work Ms McGuinness has been doing on agriculture and I must point out that this is my first or maiden agriculture speech.  I did grow up in a farming community in rural Cork but I am not my party's agriculture spokesperson.  Senator Susan O'Keeffe is our agriculture spokesperson but unfortunately she cannot be here today.  She sends her apologies but has, it must be said, briefed me very thoroughly on some of the issues involved, many of which were raised by Ms McGuinness.  The first and obvious one was referred to by Ms McGuinness in her speech, namely, where is the beef?, as we might say, or the burger and horse meat DNA issue.  Ms McGuinness mentioned that she wrote to the European Commissioner for Health and Consumer Policy, which was a very important initiative on her part.  Among the requests she made was that he would investigate whether the findings might indicate an EU-wide problem and not just one that is confined to Ireland.  I agree that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, has handled the situation very well and that the potential damage to or fallout for our agrifood sector has been minimised by the Government's response.  I would like to know how confident Ms McGuinness is that an investigation can be instigated at EU level and that measures can be taken by the EU to address this difficulty. <\/p><p>On a related point, Ms McGuinness spoke very eloquently on the authenticity of food and the issue of food labelling.  I was struck by something Professor Alan Reilly, the head of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, said last year in this context.  While he welcomed the EU extension of mandatory country-of-origin labelling, he pointed out that it does not address the issue of processed foods, where ingredients are sourced from many countries.  Neither does it address a real bugbear of mine - as a shopper and a mother who is trying to find decent, healthy food that my children will eat - which is labels like &quot;natural&quot;, &quot;local&quot;, &quot;artisan&quot;, &quot;freshly-squeezed&quot;, &quot;hand-made&quot; which do not have any legal definition or authority.  This also frustrates me as a lawyer.  Can Ms McGuinness indicate whether there is a timeframe for the introduction of better labelling?  Is it possible to regulate to that extent or would that represent too much of a nanny EU state?  Consumers need more information and the current labelling regime is very frustrating.<\/p><p>Ms McGuinness also referred to the Common Agricultural Policy, a huge issue about which she spoke very comprehensively.  How confident is Ms McGuinness that fairness will prevail in the renegotiation of the CAP, especially in the context of the negotiations being steered towards the more productive or bigger farmers?  Ms McGuinness spoke about the low average income of farmers but clearly, within that, there are a number of bigger farmers who are able to invest more, rent more land and so forth.  Will such farmers be favoured under the renegotiated CAP?  How confident can we be in Ireland that our farming will not be sacrificed to the emphasis on productivity?<\/p><p>A point which is very close to my own heart and which Ms McGuinness is also very passionate about is the idea of the greening of the CAP.  Is the EU at risk of getting the greening aspect wrong?  Is the balance right at present and are Irish farmers embracing the notion of greening sufficiently?  Ms McGuinness also touched on the issue of animal welfare, about which I feel very strongly.  I wonder if farmers are placing enough emphasis on animal welfare because it is something about which consumers are also becoming increasingly concerned.  It is in the interests of the sector as a whole that it is much more cognisant of animal welfare issues and green issues generally.<\/p><p>Ms McGuinness spoke about rural development and made specific reference to the Oxford farming conference.  At that conference Ms McGuinness said that across the EU, particularly in remote parts, there are genuine fears about land abandonment, village decline and a decline in the numbers of young people.  That is something we hoped we had left behind in Ireland but we are seeing it reappear in debates about rural communities here.  Is there a divide between urban and rural communities on this issue?  Is that visible at EU level and are there steps we can take to address it?  <\/p><p>The final point I wish to make is about public health, which relates to the issues of beef, burgers and food labelling.  Ms McGuinness may be aware that last year we held public consultation hearings in the Seanad.  <\/p> <p>Senator Susan O'Keeffe was prominent in organising the hearing on cancer and, in particular, the influence of lifestyle on cancer prevention, in respect of which there is now growing awareness among the medical profession and people generally.  There are so many common cancers which evidence shows can be prevented by substantial lifestyle change.  Is this a matter that can be dealt with at EU level?  Consideration is being given by the Seanad to how best we can reform our domestic policy on this and what health promotion measures can be adopted to address the issue.  Should this be left to individual Governments or is it better also seen as an issue for address at EU level?  I am interested in hearing what is being done in this regard.  A particular finding of the World Health Organization links diesel engine fumes with cancer, which again is an issue that might better be tackled at EU level.<\/p><p>As Ms McGuinness mentioned the gentlemen's agreement, I cannot resist asking about gender balance in the European Parliament.  The sense is that gender balance at EU level is better than it is in the Oireachtas, where only 15% of Members of the D\u00e1il and 30% of Members of the Seanad are women.  The gender balance in the Seanad is better.  Also, there is a good gender balance among our MEPs.  I know that 100% of our Labour MEPs are women, which is particularly strong.  I am aware of a recent initiative in the European Parliament to increase the number of women on boards of public companies.  I apologise for the number of questions with which I have bombarded Ms McGuinness.  However, I am particularly interested in hearing about the next step in this regard and what further steps are proposed.<\/p><p>I again thank Ms McGuinness for her fascinating address.  I am delighted finally to have an opportunity to speak on agriculture.  I might take over from Senator O'Keeffe after this.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900022#Y00200","speaker":"1148","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359473400,"counter":65,"content":"<p>I welcome Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, to the House.  I am delighted we are represented so brilliantly in Europe by a female Fine Gael member.  My question may be an innocent one to which Ms McGuinness may have a general answer.  Ms McGuinness stated that in 1973, 263,000 people were working on farms or in the farming industry and that this reduced to 85,000 in 2012 and in the same breath used the word &quot;progress&quot;.  In what way is it good that fewer people are working on the land?  Should we not be encouraging more people to work on the land?  Without nature, we are going nowhere.  We certainly cannot be depending on the banks or insurance companies.  I would recommend that Senators read the recently published book, entitled <i>What Has Nature Ever Done For Us<\/i>, by Mr. Tony Juniper, which is interesting.  The chain of how we live is dependent on nature.

I welcome also that she is responsible for the food and agriculture area.  We greatly appreciate her work.  Ms McGuinness will be aware that I was in charge of euro commerce for a number of years.  She is highly regarded by all in business as someone who can wear both hats in terms of representing the consumer and the agricultural producer.  I was delighted to hear her comment on the DNA testing issue.  Ireland is way ahead of the rest of the world in DNA testing, which was first developed in Trinity College Dublin and has been further developed since.<\/p><p>I would like to speak on some wider topics.  For instance, can Ms McGuinness comment on Chancellor Angela Merkel's recent statement to MEPs: &quot;The EU commission will eventually become a government, the council of member states an &quot;upper chamber&quot; and the European Parliament more powerful, but fixing the eurozone problems is more urgent for now.&quot;  It appears to me she is suggesting we are automatically heading towards a federal Europe.  I would welcome Ms McGuinness's view on whether this is a good thing, if this is the way we should be going or if we should be debating more than that.<\/p><p>My second point is about leaving the European Union.  Following Mr. David Cameron's speech last week, there is now real discussion in the United Kingdom about its leaving the European Union.  If the UK was to withdraw from the EU in four years time, would Ireland have to follow?  The UK is our biggest trading partner.<\/p> <p>Some politicians would argue otherwise, but our historic and current links with Britain are considerable.  Would it be so bad to follow if we retained our trading links with Europe, as Norway has done, while reinforcing our links with the UK and retaining most of the powers from the EU?  To date, I have been an enthusiastic European, almost to the extent of, like a teenager, loving everything to do with Europe.  However, I would start to question it if Britain left in four years time.  We have time to consider the issue and I would welcome Ms McGuinness' opinions.<\/p><p>Europe's recognition of the independence of Kosovo is mixed.  Ireland has recognised its independence while Spain, Slovakia, Cyprus, Romania and Greece have not.  What does this issue hold in store for the EU?  After Kosovo, where will the calls for independence finish?  What of Catalonia, the Basque country and Scotland?  Surely the future of integration is receding due to the crisis.  How can Ireland and the EU avoid further calls for independence from around Europe?<\/p><p>Having been in business, I would welcome further research, through a detailed audit, on the cost of European legislation to Ireland.  It is easy for MEPs in Brussels to pass regulations and legislation and for same to be transposed into Irish legislation, but such laws can have a significant effect on Irish business, particularly small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  Highlighting this negative side of the EU might change it for the better.  Could do this done?<\/p><p>Has the euro been an utter failure and could we adopt another policy?  We were such enthusiasts for the euro while we were doing well.  Two weeks ago, one of the main architects of the single European currency, Jacques Delors, stated that the eurozone had been flawed from the beginning and that political leaders had turned a blind eye to the fundamental weaknesses and imbalances of member states' economies.  Commenting on those who, like the British, objected to euro membership on the grounds that the currency could not work without a state, he stated that they had a point.  This was from Jacques Delors, the hero of the euro.<\/p><p>According to the Icelandic Prime Minister, Iceland would either adopt the euro after joining the EU - I had not realised the implications of this - or drop the krona and unilaterally adopt another currency.  She stated: &quot;The choice is between surrendering the sovereignty of Iceland in monetary policy by unilaterally adopting the currency of another country or become a member of the EU&quot;.  EU membership would allow Iceland to do exactly this.  It looks like it will join Europe.  Is it possible that it will do so at a time when Britain is leaving Europe?  If such events come to pass, all of Europe will be dramatically changed.  I would welcome Ms McGuinness' opinion as someone who has been close to this debate for many years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900023#Z00300","speaker":"1145","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359474000,"counter":68,"content":"<p>I have not lost my journalistic past.  I have taken copious notes, regardless of whether I get to answer all of the interesting points.  I will try.  I may group them where appropriate.<\/p><p>Senator Mooney raised a number of questions about the key point of the active farmer.  I will discuss greening and the idea of active farming.  We are concerned that some payments go to farmers who are not producing, that is, they are not active farmers, yet the system is so designed that avoiding such a situation is difficult.  There are some cases of large landowners in Scotland who, despite not actively farming, receive significant payments for their large tracts of land.  A key issue - we voted last week - is to try to agree a definition of an active farmer so that money goes to those who actually work the land.<\/p><p>I will make a strong point to farmers and those Senators who know the agricultural community.  I am concerned about what is happening to the Irish land market, in that there is virtually none.  Little land is selling, given the uncertainties about CAP reform.<\/p> <p>A massive amount of land is leased, sometimes on short 11-month systems, and some farmers are not farming now but are thinking of doing so because of the changes in the system.  I am receiving calls from farmers who are asking what they should do.  I have told them and will say again in this public forum that they should not gamble with money they do not have and they should resist the temptation to take the income support payments from the Common Agricultural Policy and hand them to the land owner.  That is a real problem with the system, which is to move to a flat rate payment per hectare.  It will capitalise the value of those payments into land prices and rent, and in many cases it will almost solidify the land market, and the direction of the policy is a real worry.<\/p><p>We want active farmers to get the money but member states had the capacity to target money at active farmers.  For example, one member state did not allow airports to claim money as they could have done.  We are arguing that there should be a negative list of various types of companies that do not use land for farming and which should not get the payments.  If a budget is under pressure, we must ensure that the funding goes to rural communities and farmers.<\/p><p>We have the same agenda as the Seanad with regard to active farmers.  There was particular mention of livestock farming and there is a real concern - evident in Ireland with decoupled payments - that we are losing livestock numbers.  France is concerned about holding on to its livestock sector as there are territorial balance issues and we want farming across the regions.  It kept coupled payments and there are proposals in the current reforms to allow member states to recouple some payments where there are vulnerable sectors in vulnerable regions.  As Senators have indicated, perhaps in some regions we may be able to recouple payments so that livestock farmers can get some support.<\/p><p>There is a bigger question of the change in direction and who will benefit from the Common Agricultural Policy.  There has been much public debate in this regard.  When we move from decoupled payments to a flat rate payment, there will be difficulties across the ditch between neighbours.  We should be frank about the issue.  If we lived in a time when we could distribute additional money to farming, there would not be a problem but we are talking about two issues.  New member states want more support from CAP but the budget is limited.  Money will move to the east.  Within member states there is also a need and policy direction to redistribute.  My message has always been that we must work a new system in a way that does not disrupt production.<\/p><p>With regard to the German reaction to the greening proposals, it seems Dr. Merkel, the German leader, does not like the idea of a 7% ecological focus area.  What has gone wrong with the farm research and advisory systems over the years, as we have not engaged with both the environment and production frameworks in dealing with farmers?  One cannot farm if the environment is not good and one issue goes with the other.  We are almost trying to stitch in environmental awareness by linking it to direct payments but most farmers know that one needs good soil and water to produce food in a sustainable manner.  The German reaction, which is replicated in the Parliament, is interesting and it is against the proposals.<\/p><p>There has been some very interesting research in the UK, where there have been programmes for biodiversity strips, and I am a fan.  There is one on our farm.  If nature is given a place it will flourish, and there will also be benefit to the crops and a return for looking after nature.  The issues are not incompatible and we will come up with something to give a greening to the Common Agricultural Policy that is supportive of farming rather than going against it.<\/p><p>With regard to the general budget, including Structural Funds and rural development, there is a concern that cuts could come in rural development funding.  There have been some slightly more positive soundings recently and we will know more when the next meeting of the Heads of State and Government convenes.  Rural development funding is targeted and important for this region and others, particularly in the support of farming families and the economy.  Small cuts will have an impact and we must be careful on a global level of how we manage the issue.<\/p><p>I thank all Senators for their kind remarks.  Senator Comiskey spoke of the general history of the policy.<\/p> <p>We are examining obesity issues as the Union has come full circle from producing for need to considering public health issues and the nutritional value of foods.  There is a notion that everything should be labelled in order that people can instantly read about the nutritional value but my view is people should instinctively know food and that knowledge should not be taken away by saying the label will tell them everything.  People need to reconnect with food.  This is happening, with more people growing their own food and asking questions about food.  This will come.  With regard to the frozen beef burger saga, the worry is that, morally and ethically, people are buying cheaper products for children who need better sustenance.  A beef burger should contain beef and people should make their own but perhaps they do not have that intrinsic knowledge.  I am a great believer in giving people the capacity to know and understand.  The Senator's contribution was important in that regard.<\/p><p>I applaud Senator Bacik on her maiden speech on agriculture issues, as she was well briefed.  Her point is well made about the legislative process in Europe.  It is extremely complex and it is a fundamental problem that people feel a disconnect about this.  On the other hand, before I entered politics, I did not understand or care about how the Seanad or the D\u00e1il worked.  Sometimes we need to tell people how something works in order that they can understand it without getting into the nitty gritty.  We amend, we sign off and we vote.  We then walk away and the legislation is left with officials.  There is little scrutiny of, or follow through on, implementation until there is a problem, which is a serious failure of the legislative process.  Every document that is drafted requires several others to be drafted to interpret it and so on.  Those who initially had a good idea and drafted the legislation find it gets skewed somewhere between signing off and implementation.  The European Parliament and all other legislatures fail in that regard.  We do not connect enough with the consequences of what we do.  I have discussed this with colleagues and it is something we need to examine to see whether we can do this a little better.<\/p><p>On the &quot;Where is the beef?&quot; issue, Ireland has shown leadership and I have brought this message to the Parliament.  Other food safety authorities will do forensic work and there will be an outcome to that.  At least, we took action first and we were open and transparent with the information.  I am confident there will be EU action.  Commissioner Borg's swiftness in coming back to me gives me that encouragement.  The authenticity of food is key.  Mention was made of all the various labels.  One of my children is fond of chocolates and sweets.  One would imagine low fat was the Holy Grail of all foods.  Cabbage could be labelled low fat but it is not in that category.  The issue is consumer understanding of food.  I would hate to think that Ireland could become the nanny state of labelling.  A combination of consumer awareness and good labelling is needed.  A great deal of work is going on in the area of health claims to remove spurious claims where manufacturers have to prove whatever it says on the tin.  The new rules on the provision of food information to consumers will be in place on 31 December this year.  That is detailed legislation, on which I can send Members information if they are interested. <\/p><p>I was taken by Senator Bacik's comments on fairness and production under the CAP.  Many small farmers are productive and a large farmer is not necessarily more productive.  Sometimes the language relating to agriculture is confusing because of that.  There is a debate about the distribution of payments but we must acknowledge that the current payments system is reflective of past production levels and that many farms have retained that level of production.  If there is a sudden shift in the amount they received overnight, there would be consequences not just for farmers but for the processing sector.<\/p> <p>The member states that have moved to a flat rate regionalised payment, such as England and Germany, will have completed the process next year.  They did it over a ten-year period, having started the discussion in 2003 and commenced implementing it a few years later.  There was war within each of those countries but it has happened and it has been a lengthy process.  Germany used national supports for bio-energy to somehow mitigate the consequences.  What I think will emerge at the end of all the processes is that those on very high payments per hectare will take a reduction and those on low payments will see a payment increase.  I remind Senators that this is a Common Agricultural Policy which has many objectives, including sustainable food production, territorial balance and environment.  It is not simply about scattering the money as far as it will go and we need to be conscious of that when we debate it because there are many other issues, including the animal welfare question which is a huge issue for farmers. <\/p><p>Sometimes animal welfare problems emerge on farms where there are human welfare problems and mental health issues.  I spoke to Department inspectors about this issue and to their credit they work in a sensitive way but often there are other problems.  All farmers who are well want their animals to do well and they look after them.  Given the recent weather patterns, there is a need to be conscious of that issue on vulnerable farmers.<\/p><p>The concern across the European Union in regard to land abandonment is very real.  In regard to young farmers, there is a real problem.  I mentioned that there is very little movement on land at present.  We have a low number of young farmers but there are many farmers in agricultural colleges which is very encouraging.  I commend a report published last week, commissioned by Macra na Feirme, which refers to the need to get land into the hands of young people who are interested in farming.  That can be done by encouraging older farmers to think of semi-retirement.  We need to ask about the payments system as it currently operates as it probably works against land mobility given that people need land to get the payment.  That is a disincentive to young farmers and it may also be a slight draw on our intentions to expand production.  Given that farm productivity across the European Union is declining, we need to re-engage on the issue of sustainable intensification and get back to good research being communicated to farmers to ensure greater efficiency.  Part of the EU 2020 strategy is to encourage better resource use.  There are opportunities and rather than think of more, we ought to think about doing it better because of the cost of production arising on farms.  <\/p><p>Farmers are wise enough not to want 200 cows if there is less return but rather to get more out of 100 cows by working more efficiently.  There are many interesting challenges in this area.  If we can get new people into the system with new ideas there is an exciting period ahead.  However, the trouble is that there are uncertain times ahead for the next year or so.  In a sense that cripples decision making.  I regret that is happening as farmers are keen to chart a way forward.  We see the end of milk quotas as an opportunity to get new farmers into the dairy system. <\/p><p>General questions were raised on public health which is real issue.  There is no doubt that nutrition and health are key issues.  Every time I open a newspaper there is a different piece of health advice.  As people do not know where to turn perhaps that is an issue for another day.<\/p><p>On the issue of women representation in the European Parliament we are fairly well represented.  There was a radical idea in regard to gender balance on boards of public companies which was watered down a little but the conclusion is that where there is a better gender balance it helps the boards to function and companies profit from it.  Many public companies are moving in that direction.<\/p><p>I remember my childhood on farms and perhaps some Members also gathered potatoes by hand.  Many bodies were needed as there were not many machines.  Agriculture has been mechanised a great deal and the drudgery has been taken out of some aspects of it.<\/p> <p>Some people believe it was a very romantic way of living - it was not on a very frosty morning - but we have a nostalgic view of it.  The Senator said we should have more people on the land and I mentioned that young people coming back into farming is crucial.  However, we need to consider how farming families can realistically make a decent income from farming or from another enterprise on the farm.  I believe that is where it will go.  The Senator said that without nature we are going nowhere, which is part of what we are talking about with agriculture policy now.  We need to work with nature to get the most from it.  Mechanisation and also other opportunities would have taken many people from the workforce.<\/p><p>Senator Quinn had many issues and I am not sure if I have time, a Chathaoirligh.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900024#AA00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359475500,"counter":73,"content":"<p>We have a number of questions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900028#EE00200","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359475500,"counter":74,"content":"<p>Let me try to address some of them.  On the DNA, we are doing that.  I did not get to write down the full quote from Chancellor Merkel.  Even in our 40 years in the European Union, I regard it as a work in progress as opposed to an end game.  It depends on how one looks at it and how one engages with it.  On deeper integration or whatever term the Senator used - a federal Europe - it is a very simple fact of whether people can work together.  Can countries work together effectively?  In that same breath, this question of the UK's decision has had its desired effect.  I gather the British Conservative Party has increased its poll rating somewhat.  Very often in politics, things happen for other reasons.  Because I have listened to so much to this debate in the UK, I believe we have to allow the UK to make up its own mind.  However, it would be a strange European Union that every so often had a member state that had committed to doing certain things in free association with other colleagues and then afterwards decided it did not really mean that and wanted out.  It is a very hard way to do business.<\/p><p>The most difficult words in Europe are compromise and solidarity.  Nobody likes to compromise but the only way to make progress anywhere, especially in the European Union, is through compromise.  I found that difficult in the beginning because everybody thinks his or her ideas are the best.  However, if one goes in with that attitude, one comes out with absolutely no progress.  I believe Chancellor Merkel's comments are in that frame and I do not see them as a threat.  I believe that Mr. Gay Mitchell, MEP, mentioned last week that Ireland is much freer and independent now as part of the European Union than we were before we joined.  I am not convinced that the UK will leave.  I believe wiser counsel will prevail if and when there is a referendum and it will be an interesting one to follow.<\/p><p>In terms of crisis, there is a tendency for people and countries to go inwards and have this idea of being independent without ever thinking what difference it would make.  Would it make any difference and would life be any better?  That is always the question to ask.  Very often it would not be better.  There is a sense of insecurity that politics needs to address because that is why these things are happening.  The same applies to the question on Iceland the Senator raised.<\/p><p>I mentioned my concern about EU legislation because people complain about it, but it is in its implementation.  I have never understood why it is not possible for us to say that certain legislation does not work effectively or that we are implementing it with gold labelling on it and that we need to look at that and change it.  We should be able to do it because we have the skills and knowledge to do it.  I support the Senator's idea of having an audit, but it must be remembered that when we pass directives, the national parliaments legislate after that.  A directive gives the general pointers and member states then introduce the legislation.  Many countries have a light touch approach, which I do not favour, and others gold plate.  Let us consider how forensic we had to be on the hamburgers.  Let us consider the issues surrounding BSE.  The amount of traceability and rules that needed to be introduced caused horror across the industry but the result was excellent.  We all need effective regulation - not more or less, but effective regulation.  We should try to rule out the ineffective and burdensome.  However, in the food industry there is no room for anything but perfection, which is the bottom line.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900028#EE00300","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP"},{"type":"speech","time":1359476100,"counter":75,"content":"<p>There are quite a number of questions.

Interestingly, while coming up today I heard on the radio a lady interviewed on &quot;Today with Pat Kenny&quot; about chicken production in this country.  There used be 11 processors; there are now three.  It costs &#8364;7.60 to produce a chicken in Ireland and it costs &#8364;4.50 in the rest of Europe, especially eastern Europe where energy costs, feed costs and labour costs are much cheaper than ours.  How can we compete?  I was startled to hear that in Hungary and Ukraine, from which we import 80% of our chicken, they export chicken fillets, which is what we use, through Holland.  That comes in as fresh chicken but it could be eight days before it gets to our shelves.  We get a chicken from Thailand or Hungary, bacon from Denmark, cheese from Holland and breadcrumbs from the United States, and could call it &quot;Chicken <i>Cordon Blue<\/i>&quot; when it is made up and labelled as the produce of Ireland.

Until I see the figures I remain determined to push for an adequate budget for both headings of the CAP.  If any cuts were made to the Leader programme naturally everything in rural development would be affected.  This would be a real shame because the Leader programme is very much a bottom up ground level initiative and has helped to establish businesses.<\/p><p>The point on food labelling ties in with something I said earlier.  Our way of making legislation takes time because it involves committees, plenary sessions, negotiations with Council, Commission proposals and then implementation in all member states.  It can only be implemented on that date because of the legislative process.  With regard to CAP reform we hope the Minister, Deputy Coveney, as president in Council will get an agreement by the end of June.  We will not see implementation until 1 January 2015 because we will need time to make the changes.<\/p><p>Senator O'Neill raised a very interesting point about the number of people who used to be on farms.<\/p> <p>We need to look back at how that was done and how it was that we could have a number of people living off a farm.  In today's world, however, it is extremely difficult.  I dare say that the trend in food prices over time has been the problem.   Farmers will point out what they used to get for a sheep 20 or 30 years ago compared with now.  <\/p><p>I heard the programme that Senator O'Neill mentioned and am aware of the fact that so many chicken products are imported.  This concerns the issue of authenticity and what is happening in the food supply chain.  In my view, food processors need to understand that for us to trust their products they must have a trusting relationship with all their suppliers.  The idea of having blocks of frozen chicken or other meat, and pressing a button to get the cheapest option, is not appropriate in the food supply chain because we know of the practices that happen.  We will have to ask the food industry to examine the matter to see if it is appropriate that this should occur.<\/p><p>It must be remembered, however, that we are also a major food exporter.  Therefore, we do not want to say that it is all about our food because we want others to enjoy the quality of food we produce.  We want it to be exported to the US, Europe or elsewhere, so we need a food supply chain that does not have any weaknesses in it.  With a commodity like chicken - and Senators heard the report this morning - it certainly looks like that, as it operates now.  <\/p><p>As regards young people in farming, in the Celtic tiger era everybody looked down on farming.  There was no interest in it and people left the land.  We had a great number of part-time farmers because the building trade helped and supported it.  Money was invested in farms because there was a little more cash in hand.  We now have a situation where younger people who like farming - and I think people have to like it, rather than being forced into it - want to farm.  There is an opportunity with the abolition of milk quotas but it has to be about efficiency in farming as well, not just about having more cows.  There are opportunities for young trained farmers to re-engage with the idea of productivity gain, which is referred to in the Treaty of Rome.  We had perhaps forgotten about that idea in the switchover towards environmental concerns.<\/p><p>Senator Barrett asked whether subsidies are capitalised. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900030#GG00900","nonspeaker":"Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359476700,"counter":94,"content":"<p>There are two minutes remaining.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900031#HH00200","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1359476700,"counter":95,"content":"<p>We are in a transition and need to watch this because I do not think that is sustainable or appropriate in terms of public money or policy.

People are tempted by a label that gives them a cheap price, but it is also about being aware of the intrinsic qualities of food.<\/p><p>The role of large multiples is hugely significant.  They decide what we buy because if it is not on their shelves we do not see it.  They have a huge impact on SMEs and access to shelf space.  That area, to which I referred earlier in my speech, needs a great deal more attention.  Competition policy needs a little more forensic analysis on how it applies to the food supply chain. <\/p><p>As regards what the EU is doing on direct access to food, there are loads of initiatives but we need to be realistic as well.  Many people will not have time to go to farmers' markets.  We use them but we will not get everything we want there.  It is wonderful when they work and people can engage with them because they help food production.

I find it horrific that if they are touched in Ireland in any way, they can be designated as Irish produce.  As Ms McGuinness noted - this is the kernel of the issue - people must become more educated.  One cannot, as a government or as a leader, tell people what they are going to eat.  Moreover, while labelling might be present, people may not read it.  However, one should be confident that if something claims to be Irish, it is Irish.

There are some very useful initiatives in place for long-term leasing and tax concessions are available.  Perhaps there is not enough information or awareness about that.  I believe the uncertainty concerning the single farm payment is preventing any progress in this area.

There will be a demand for dairy produce and any research and development that finds new product lines will help Irish farmers.  Dairy expansion is possible and farmers themselves, as a result of the banking crisis, will be more cautious.  It is hard to find money for expansion.  They will be more cautious about how they expand, looking at efficiency factors and attracting new people into the dairy sector.  Other member states, however, want to hold on to quota.  It is a heated debate in the European Parliament still, even though the quotas are set to go in 2015 and Ireland supports that position.<\/p><p>Senator Mullins asked about long-term damage.  Truthfully, there was very little reaction to the issue in the European Parliament because horse meat is consumed in Europe.

The reason given is that they are in conflict with the principle of the Bill but it is still our right to table amendments.  If we do not agree with the principle of the Bill, I contend it is our right to seek to change the legislation to bring it into line with what we see as the correct principles which should underpin the provision of water services in this State.  However, I have to accept the ruling of the Chair.<\/p><p>  In dealing with amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 6, the Minister of State might remember that we had a very similar debate when he brought forward the household charge.  We had a very interesting debate on poverty proofing policy decisions in this State.  During that debate, we made the point that the household charge would have an impact on many low income families, that there would be a level of resistance to the household charge and that people were sick and tired of a whole raft of new taxes, stealth charges and regressive charges coming at working families at a time when the State was in a very difficult financial situation.  We made the point again that much of what the Government was doing was having a damaging effect on the domestic economy but, more crucially in the context of the amendment we tabled then and which we table now, we were concerned about the issue of poverty.<\/p><p>  The Minister of State will have heard the term &quot;fuel poverty&quot; on many occasions and will know that many people in this State suffer from fuel poverty.  As a consequence of what the Minister is going to do here, namely, setting up a Uisce \u00c9ireann and introducing water charges, we may well see water poverty as we do not know what waivers will be in place and how it will impact on low-income families or people on welfare.  That would be an appalling situation in which to find ourselves.<\/p><p>  The amendment specifically would delay the coming into operation of the section and would empower the Commission for Energy Regulation to make functions to bring about water charges.  That is essentially what the Government wants to do.  We seek to delay that until a poverty impact analysis has been carried out.<\/p><p>  Far too many people in this State are on low pay and are on social welfare, because jobs are simply not there.  Far too many people in this State live in poverty and live just above the poverty line.  When one looks at all the new taxes and charges coming into being, all of that will have very negative impact on families in this State.  Let us just remind ourselves of what those families are looking at.  Last year they were faced with a flat rate household charge of &#8364;100.  They will now be faced with this family home tax, because it most certainly is not a property tax, of on average between &#8364;300 and &#8364;500, depending of the value of their home.  We will see an increase in the carbon level of &#8364;5 per tonne.  We saw a reduction in the fuel allowance from 32 weeks to 26 weeks and a 2% VAT increase, which disproportionately impacts on low-income families and households.  There is a projected increase of approximately 1.9% in inflation.  There was an increase in fares for public transport, an increase in the drug payment scheme threshold and an increase in school transport costs.  In addition to all of that, we will now ask those same families to pay water charges.  <\/p><p>  It is getting to a stage where people are asking themselves what they paying all these charges for.  If they are paying income tax, PRSI, the universal social charge and more taxes than ever, why is it that they are now being asked to pay water charges and property tax in addition to all of that?  <\/p><p>  There is also an issue of how much all of this will cost the State and the fact that money could be better spent elsewhere.  The Government claims that installing the water meters will cost &#8364;500 million and that money will be borrowed on the strength of that.  What will happen if it costs more than &#8364;500 million?  Who will bear that cost?  Will the cost in any way be borne by the householder?  The local authorities' professional officers have said the true cost of installing water meters will be &#8364;1.2 billion.  Would it not be better to spend the money on improving the water infrastructure in this State rather than use taxpayers' money to put meters outside people's doors which the Government can use as some sort of tap to get more taxes from them?  <\/p><p>  At the same time, the Government will not introduce any new taxes for higher earners or will not look at the concept of a wealth tax.  It has no difficulty putting a tap outside people's houses which will measure the water going into the house, for which the Government will charge them as a new form of taxation, but it has still not spelled out exactly how that will be done and whether it will be a flat rate or based on usage.  All of those issues need to be dealt with.<\/p><p>  There are other amendments to which I will get but, obviously, I do not agree with water charges.  There are some services which should be provided on the basis of need and on the basis we pay taxes.  I do not have a difficulty with water conservation.  There are many things the Government could do to improve water conservation - for example, education, water harvesting, dual flush toilets and so on which could be tackled at the planning stage.  There are many measures people could take.  I would not have a difficulty with enforcement where householders waste water and ensuring people have to pay for what is essentially wastage but what I cannot support is the principle of people having to pay for water.  It is a precious commodity and costs money to get into people's houses but people pay for that through their taxes.  <\/p><p>  Will the Minister ensure that when he brings forward policies like this, sits at the Cabinet table and looks at introducing new taxes and charges, he does so in the context of equality and poverty proofing many of these measures?  I have no doubt whatsoever that when these charges are brought in, more people in this State will be living in poverty which would be regressive.<\/p><p>  It is interesting that Fianna F\u00e1il has not tabled a single amendment to this Bill but it is not surprising given that the genesis of the water charges comes from that party.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900034#VV00700","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1359478200,"counter":122,"content":"<p>On a point of order, are we speaking to the amendments or are we having a party political broadcast?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900034#VV00800","speaker":"1143"},{"type":"speech","time":1359478200,"counter":123,"content":"<p>We are on the amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900034#VV00900","speaker":"1120"},{"type":"speech","time":1359478200,"counter":124,"content":"<p>What is the relevance of school transport to the Water Services Bill 2013?

They are paying more taxes than ever before, which is the point we are making and that is why we want this to be poverty-proofed.  Almost everyone now pays the universal social charge and only those on very small incomes are exempt from that charge.  There are many people who should not be paying the USC.  The essential point we are making is that at a time when people are paying more taxes than ever before, it is unfair to ask them to also pay all of these indirect taxes as well.<\/p><p>The final point I wish to make before the Minister responds is that all of this is damaging to the very principle of taxation.  I have no difficulty in paying taxes and I believe the principle of taxation is good.   We should pay taxes and should encourage others to pay them, as long as they are fair and progressive.  There are many people now wondering why they are paying taxes because they are seeing a drift away from progressive taxes towards indirect taxes, where wealthy people pay the same as those earning only \u20ac200 or \u20ac300 per week.  They do not see this as fair.  It is doing enormous damage to the whole principle of taxation and it is wrong.  The Government must go back to the drawing board and make sure that when it introduces measures such as water charges that it properly equality-proofs and poverty-proofs them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900035#WW00800","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1359478800,"counter":133,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd to the House.

I thank Senators from both sides for agreeing to that because it was important for me, as a Member of the Oireachtas for County Louth, to be there.<\/p><p>At the heart of all of this - notwithstanding Senator Cullinane's point about poverty proofing, which I agree must happen - is the fact that if the amendment were to succeed, it would affect another section of the Bill, whereby the regulator would not be able to do anything at all.  The effect of what Senator Cullinane is suggesting would be that nothing at all would happen until the poverty-proofing and affordability issues were addressed.  The Bill could only commence then, which means Irish Water or Uisce \u00c9ireann would have no legal authority to do any other work in the interim.  <\/p><p>What goes to the heart of what we are doing here is that the water charges will have to be fair and will have to be seen to be fair.  As I said last week, during the consultations we have had so far, we have met people who are champions of those on lower incomes, including Father Se\u00e1n Healy of Social Justice Ireland, the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul and other similar organisations.  There is a process in place that involves consultation not just with those who advocate on behalf of the poor but also with other Departments, most particularly the Department of Social Protection.  All of these issues will be dealt with and will be properly considered.  In that context, I ask Senator Cullinane to consider withdrawing his amendment because nothing could be done if it were passed.  It would effectively mean that the regulator could not deal with any of the other issues involved here.  I ask him to withdraw it although I accept that he has the right to put it to a vote.  I also accept that at the heart of the amendment is the point made by Senator Cullinane about affordability and fairness.  It is my job and that of the Government to be accountable to the Oireachtas in that regard.  I am happy to discuss this further in an Oireachtas committee and to go through all of the issues when the time comes and the charges are decided by the regulator and the Government.  <\/p><p>Notwithstanding everything said by Senator Cullinane, a householder who happens to live north of the Border, in County Armagh or in Belfast, for example, pays, on average, the equivalent of \u20ac1,000 per annum for all of the services he or she receives.  Those service charges are decided by the Executive in Northern Ireland and by the local councils.  All parties who sit on the Executive and on the local councils contribute to that decision-making process.  This year, a proposal was agreed by Belfast City Council that those charges would increase.  I believe the vote on that was unanimous and all parties, including Sinn F\u00e9in, supported an increase of 2%.  I wish to insert reality into the debate and make that point to Senator Cullinane.<\/p><p>Senator Cullinane also made a point about water conservation and he is correct that a significant amount of money will have to be spent on the rehabilitation of our water mains network.  As we all know, over 40% of water, on average, is lost or unaccounted for, which is a scandal that we must not allow to continue.  A significant portion of the moneys raised from water charges will be spent on fixing the leaks.  The regulator must insist that Uisce \u00c9ireann draws up a year-by-year plan for reducing the amount of unaccounted-for water.  There are different rates of water loss in different counties.  In Dublin, the rate is approximately 23% or 24% but other counties are losing more than 50% of their treated water.  There are significant issues to be addressed in this regard.  <\/p><p>I ask Senator Cullinane to reconsider his amendment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900035#WW01000","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1359478800,"counter":135,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his response and I concur with his views on water conservation.

If the average leakage, on a county by county basis, is 36% then that is where the real problem lies and that is one of the fundamental points being made by my party.<\/p> <p>We want to ensure there is enough investment in water infrastructure to deal with that.

In the context of reform of our overall tax system, we must ensure that, where possible, higher earners pay more, including through the introduction of a wealth tax.  We must also ensure that the rate is based on ability to pay.  In other words, there is a progressive element to it.  While the principle of collecting taxes is a good one because we must ensure people receive services, what is wrong is that we are moving away from progressive and direct taxation to indirect taxation, which is having a disproportionate affect on many low-income families and putting them into poverty.  <\/p><p>People in the North of Ireland receive many services, including free school books, free school transport, bin collection and desludging services, for what they pay.

We tabled a number of amendments that have been ruled out of order, but I will speak to the section on our proposed alternative to Irish Water, namely, a national water sector framework team.  The essence of our proposal was to ensure that we had local democratic responsibility for the provision of water, which is important, that water was delivered in the best way and that there was a collaborative approach between local government and the Department.<\/p><p>  We are opposed to the centralisation of this function and would prefer to see it preserved within local government.  I am a former councillor and many of us need to win support from within the local government system to enter this House.<\/p> <p>Many of us who came through that system would have spoken on many occasions about the lack of powers in local government.  There was a good and healthy debate only last week on the issue of local government reform so I will not rehash all of it.  Many Senators from all sides spoke about the need to empower local government and councils, reversing a loss of power in local authorities.  They argued that we must ensure local authorities have very real powers and functions and that is why we want to find the mechanisms that will keep provision within the local governance system and under the supervision of democratically elected local councillors.  Local control and accountability is important.<\/p><p>I also share the concerns of SIPTU about the proposal to move 3,000 workers from their current positions in local authorities into a new utility.  There will be negotiations and discussions between the trade unions and the Government on the matter but the issue is related to the weakening of local government by taking staff out of local councils.  The staff, which could be doing other work, will be put into a new body, further weakening the ability of authorities to provide services that people need.  We also share SIPTU's view that such a move would have serious implications for the future of local government, as I mentioned, and its ability to respond to emergencies at a local level.<\/p><p>Local authorities are accountable to communities and if we agree with the principle of subsidiarity, we should agree that we should, as much as possible, ensure that local authorities have as much power as they can handle and they can meet the basic needs of people.  It is a bit peculiar that at a time when the Government is introducing a property tax or family home charge, with people being told this comes from a need to provide services, one of the core services provided by local government is being taken from the equation.  Not only are people being asked to pay the charge, but there will also be water charges, despite the fact that water will no longer come under the remit of local government or councillors.  It is a genuine and progressive view.<\/p><p>I understand that managing water is complicated, as there are health considerations, environmental concerns, consumer views, engineering issues and EU requirements.  We must ensure there is long-term investment in water, and the best way to achieve this is through local government, with an assurance that local government has the tools to carry out the task.  I have more to say but I know other Senators from Fianna F\u00e1il wish to speak to the section.  I also want to hear the Minister's thoughts.  I may return to make some of the points I cannot make now but I imagine the Minister of State has the gist of what I am saying.  This is about democracy, democratic accountability and ensuring that local government keeps as many powers and functions as possible.

It should not be like the HSE, which only has an e-mail or phone number as a point of contact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900038#ZZ00300","speaker":"1128"},{"type":"speech","time":1359480300,"counter":164,"content":"<p>I have much respect for colleagues on the other side but I disagree with them on this issue.  For every litre of water that is purified in this country, another litre is lost.  That means that anything between 40% and 50% of water, which costs a fortune to cleanse, goes to waste.  We must operate in a different and better manner, and we should act bravely.  This project will define us as a nation because water is a scarce resource throughout the world.  There are many countries, particularly on the African Continent, that would love to have our levels of water but much of this is wasted.  It is a sinful waste in that context.<\/p><p>This new system may not be perfect but it will be a damn sight better than what is being done currently.  That is not the fault of the thousands of employees in the various local authorities, and the problem is there is no joined up thinking.  When an emergency arises, people must deal with scores of local authorities rather than one centralised body that can strategically think, plan and react.  In that regard, the concept is good.  Bord G\u00e1is has been awarded the contract and the company can speak for itself; it has been remarkably successful in its work to date and the projects in which it has engaged.<\/p> <p>I would prefer that the contract be given to a tried and tested organisation that has proven credibility than to put it out to tender and have to put it up on the EU tenders database from which process the contract may be given to a company from abroad, about which we know a little, purely on the basis of price.

To cut to the heart of this matter, this job is too difficult for individual local authorities to deal with it.  The rate of unaccounted for water in different counties, taking the examples of Fingal and the greater Dublin area, is approximately 23% to 24%.  In counties Roscommon, Kerry, Cork and other such counties the rate is in the high 50% bracket.  Some counties do not have the capacity in their local base to do the work that needs to be done.  New synergies among all the counties are needed to have one water authority which can deal universally, right across the board, with the issues of unaccounted for water.<\/p><p>In terms of charging for water and commercial water rates, the rate in County Kildare is \u20ac1.52 per 1,000 litres of water.  One pays \u20ac1.52 for 1,000 litres of water.  However, one pays double that rate, more than \u20ac3 for 1,000 litres of water, in the adjoining county of Wicklow.  Therefore, there are significant differences between counties.  We believe, as I believe does everybody to whom I have spoken on this, that what is needed is one universal commercial charge for the whole country with the same charge applying to all domestic consumers, irrespective of whether they live in Cork, Dublin or elsewhere, similar to the charge applied by any other energy entity such as the ESB.  The ESB charge is the same, regardless of where in the country one lives.  When one puts on a switch, one pays the same rate as other customers for doing that.  In terms of areas which have poor electricity infrastructure, the rest of the country pays for that.  Similarly, in terms of areas which need investment in water infrastructure, the rest of us will pay to upgrade the water supply in those areas.  That is constructive resolution of that problem.<\/p><p>I wish to deal with the issue of job losses.  I wish to categorically state that there will be no job losses.  Everybody currently employed in local authorities in the water services area will remain in their jobs.  If people wish to move or to be seconded to Irish Water of Uisce \u00c9ireann, they can do that if they have the required skills and the knowledge and if there is a vacancy.  People can transfer to this body if they want to and if they have the necessary skills.  If people do not want to transfer to it, they will remain working in the local authority .  There will be no involuntary redundancies.  Nobody will lose his or her job.  There is a new synergy between local government and Irish Water.  A body which deals with all these issues, which is chaired by an independent chairperson, Kevin Foley, and Uisce \u00c9ireann and the four unions involved are represented on it.  Therefore, there is accountability at that body and issues are being dealt with.  There is a commitment that this is the way it will be, with service level agreements which will run to 2017, and there is no issue about that.  <\/p><p>On the question of the importance of local authorities and those working in this area to Irish Water, let us consider who got the job as the chief executive of Irish Water.  The former county manager in Dublin, Mr. John Tierney, is the new chief executive and he has worked in county councils throughout the country in a career in the public service spanning 35 years.  He has done a fantastic job in Dublin.  He has worked day and night with his staff and with councillors.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900039#AAA00200","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1359480900,"counter":167,"content":"<p>A good Tipperary man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900039#AAA00300","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1359480900,"counter":168,"content":"<p>He is a good Tipperary man-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900039#AAA00400","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1359480900,"counter":169,"content":"<p>He is a north Tipperary man.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900039#AAA00500","speaker":"1162"},{"type":"speech","time":1359480900,"counter":170,"content":"<p>-----from north Tipperary.  The Members have a Tipperary-born Minister before them for his sins.  I had no control over that and I cannot get any votes down there.  There is a real tangible connection with what is happening in Irish Water directly back down through local government.  If the chief executive of Irish Water has worked body and soul in local government, his appointment is a perfect choice and will provide for an excellent transition.<\/p><p>The issue of the local councillor's access of Irish Water was raised.  The local councillor currently has access to the local engineer and he or she will continue to have such access.  There is no reason local authority members should be worried about this.  I was a member of a local authority for 27 years and any time a serious water issue arose in a community area I was able to telephone the engineer to have the issue addressed.  Local councillors are agents of their community and they will not be excluded from contact, accessibility or securing information.  Irish Water needs local government elected members to work with it and advise them of issues, and that will happen.  The next Bill on this area that will be introduced before the summer recess will outline the connectivity and accountability of Irish Water to local councillors.  The water infrastructure will be based on the water basin districts.  There is no reason regional assemblies should not deal with many of these issues. <\/p><p>Another important issue for local councillors is the drawing up of development plans and decisions on what will happen in an electoral area, of which water supply and planning will form a critical part.  We have to set up provision for tangible practical relationships between the planning authority and Irish Water, which will be the case, and that will come under a second Bill on this area that will come before the House.  Nobody is being disenfranchised.  There will be better water infrastructure and a one-stop-shop nationally for all of that but locally councillors will have the ability to communicate, get the facts and obtain results, as will Maggie Murphy, James Maguire or whoever lives next door to them.  <\/p><p>One of the good aspects of Bord G\u00e1is is that its customers service is second to none.  In this body we will create between 350 and 400 jobs in a national customer service location.  If a person has a problem, he or she can telephone the customer service section of the body and in that way there will be accountability.  I have seen how an equivalent service operates in the United Kingdom and perhaps the Oireachtas committee or Members of the Seanad might go and examine such a service which involves a call centre.  One can see when the calls are made the way they are logged in real time, the way they are followed up, the action to be taken on them, whether it is coded red, yellow or green, they are followed through and at the end of every day they are examined and account is taken of what happened, what is being done and the reason an issue has not been resolved.  There will be a hands-on approach to issues and accountability back to the consumer.<\/p><p>I dealt with the issue raised by Senator Wilson last week but I wish to respond to what he said.  If one sets up a new entity, it will not materialise out of the air - there is no magic wand.  The best thing to do is to ensure that it is a publicly-owned entity.  It must be a public utility.  It cannot be a private one and on that we all agree.  What better than to offer all the public utilities the job of taking on the running of Uisce \u00c9ireann.  There were three major players who could have done it - the ESB, Bord G\u00e1is and Bord na M\u00f3na.  There was no tender as such, no money or benefit in kind given to Bord G\u00e1is for doing this.  Obviously, its costs will have to be covered but there is no extra money sitting on its table for doing this.  It was not about competition but about the ability of an organisation such as Bord na M\u00f3na, Bord G\u00e1is or whichever entity to submit an application on how it would run the organisation, the issues it could deal with, its track record, how efficient it is and how it could do this.  I want to stress that was the process and I hope I have got across those points to Members.<\/p><p>We are very concerned to ensure that the next Bill will clarify all those issues.  I will be come to the House before the summer recess and hopefully I will answer all the Members' questions to their satisfaction as best I can to make sure that the structures are in place.  This will not be a HSE on wheels.  This will be Uisce \u00c9ireann which will be accountable and transparent and provide for a wonderful natural resource which we have to protect and enhance.  I think that we are doing it the right way.  I understand the Members' concerns and I hope to be able to address them in the next Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900039#AAA00600","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1359480900,"counter":171,"content":"<p>The Minister of State will forgive us for not wanting to take a leap of faith with him.  I would much rather see what he spoke about now when we are making decision on the establishment of this body.<\/p> <p>The qualifications of the new CEO are not the issue.  We all fully support what the Minister of State said regarding the new appointee.  Many staff members of Waterford city and county council have good qualifications and are excellent public servants.  I have only heard of one director of services on Waterford City Council, who is a friend of mine, taking up a position in Uisce \u00c9ireann.  However, the issue is the breaking of the link between local authorities and the provision of water.  The Minister of State cannot, on the one hand, have, as he put it, \"those tangible connections\" while, on the other, breaking them by taking the provision of water out of local government.  I do not see how that stacks up.<\/p><p>There is an opportunity through the new local government structures - I disagree with the regional structures - to examine this.  For example, Sinn F\u00e9in does not prefer the option of domestic water metering.  International best practice demonstrates that district metering is a much better option to measure the quality of water, water usage and so on.  The Government did not examine these options because this is about collecting taxes and taking in more money, not water conservation.  One of the Minister of State's party colleagues in the House referred to the waste of water.  I could not agree more that lots of water is wasted.  In some instances, this is the responsibility of householders but the vast majority of waste is caused by the system itself.  The Senator mentioned the word &quot;sinful&quot;.  Surely we have to then agree that if it is sinful that so much water is wasted and if 38% of every litre produced of the quality necessary to go into people's homes is lost in the system and only a small percentage is lost through waste by the householder, why is the Government penalising the householder and asking him or her to pay the cost?  We are not fixing the problem but the Minister of State will not concede that.  The legislation represents an opportunity to charge citizens more money and raise taxes in a regressive way and in the most indirect way.<\/p><p>He mentioned public services.  Once the concept of a charge is introduced, as sure as night follows day, it will be much easier to privatise Uisce \u00c9ireann in time.

If the Minister of State is saying it is cast in stone that the service can never be privatised, I do not believe him.  Many services have been privatised over the years.  Once the concept of charging is introduced for a service, it will inevitably be privatised.  The same happened with waste collection charges.  When they were introduced, we were told it was about making sure people would pay as they use and reducing waste and not about privatising waste collection services.  Only a small number of local authorities now provide such services.  The principle of a charge was adopted and all the services were privatised.  The same happened with water services in the UK and it will happen here because the Government is following that model.<\/p><p>I do not care what the Bill states.  The logic of this process is that in time, because of what is happening, water services will inevitably be privatised.  I believe that is wrong.  The fundamental issue is whether it is good or bad to establish a single utility.  It is not the best or most cost-effective way to manage the service, staff and the assets, unless the Government intends to privatise it.  A new national water governance framework, such as that proposed by my party, should be developed in partnership with government and local authorities to ensure the delivery of water and the commitment of all involved to ensure water conservation and to comply with EU regulations.  That would be the best model.  I understand where the Government is coming from on this even though I do not agree with it.

Revenue generated by Irish Water will be reinvested in infrastructure, as there is a significant requirement for investment and providing new infrastructure over the coming decade.<\/p><p>I have examined the issue of district metering to which Senator Cullinane referred.  Every local authority uses district metering to monitor water usage.  If the water being consumed is greater than they expect, they close parts of the system to find where is the leak.  Everybody can see a major leak when the main pipe bursts and water floods out, but the biggest problem is we never see the small or medium sized leaks which could be going on forever.<\/p> <p>The problem is that on the public side there is leakage and unaccounted for water that is wasted but also on the private side, in the Senator's house or in my house, between the tap and the connection there can be significant leakage.  Subject to correction that leakage can be as high as 20% or 30% in some cases.  Private side leakage, that is, from the kerb into one's home, is another important reason for metering.  It enables one to check whether there is leakage and wastage.  District metering plays an important role but it is not the answer.  Therefore, I suggest the Senator withdraw his opposition to the section as it does not stand up to scrutiny.  The only thing that makes sense is to cut back on water wastage.

An article in today's <i>Irish Independent<\/i> did not refer to Uisce \u00c9ireann, which may be because the Act has yet to be passed and it is becoming commonly known as Irish Water.  It is under the auspices of Bord G\u00e1is \u00c9ireann, which is an Irish language name.  Given that the Bill states: &quot;The subsidiary shall be known, in the Irish language, as Uisce \u00c9ireann and, in the English language, as Irish Water&quot; and presuming that stays as it is, it will only be when writing in Irish that one would use &quot;Uisce \u00c9ireann&quot; and when writing in English one would use &quot;Irish Water&quot;.<\/p><p>  I ask the Minister of State to change this section to ensure that the name of the company will be Uisce \u00c9ireann - it has nothing to do with the Irish language.

I am inviting the Minister of State to not take my word for it - I would not ask him to do that - but have it evaluated to see how effective that company is operating from an efficiency and cost-effectiveness point of view.

It will supply water to houses.  People will have no alternative, if they want water, but to deal with this company.  It is for the chairman or the Minister of State not to be taken in absolutely.  This is the time to act, not when the genie is out of the bottle down the line and consumers are getting bills for \u20ac500, \u20ac600, \u20ac700 or \u20ac800 - whatever it will be in time - when, perhaps, half of that figure, if the company was operated effectively, would be appropriate.  I am looking to see the disciplines that are within the Bill that can achieve that.  What I see is that the State is taking a share-holding, then opting out and leaving it to a company, the performance of which from the point of view of best practice is highly questionable.  That is dangerous.<\/p><p>I am looking to the Minister of State to respond to me on what other factors he can introduce to ensure that the customers are not ripped off and get the best value for money.  That is not easy when there is a State, or even a private, monopoly.  Once there is a monopoly in this area, it is difficult.  I cannot see how there can be other than a private monopoly, but I would prefer a system whereby Bord G\u00e1is, or whoever, could apply to operate the infrastructure and charge the customers for a licensed period.  At the end of the licensed period an evaluation could be undertaken to see if value for money was being achieved and it would be open to the Government to decide whether to put it out to tender.  No doubt there are many private companies which could take on this job and, perhaps, do it much better.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900043#EEE02500","speaker":"1126"},{"type":"speech","time":1359483000,"counter":220,"content":"<p>The Minister of State clarified that already.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900043#EEE02600","speaker":"1125"},{"type":"speech","time":1359483000,"counter":221,"content":"<p>I ask the Minister of State to look at those options.

He is right as this is the case.  While such metering does not extend across all local authorities, we do have such a system in place.  As I stated previously, it is the most effective way to measure wastage and usage in the system and I would much prefer to see that than to see the introduction of domestic meters.  One authority that has this system in place is Laois County Council.  That model has proven itself to be a much better way to do this.  Spikes in usage can be observed and can then be better rectified.  This allows for the pinpointing of leaks across the system, which is important if one is trying to reduce waste in the system.<\/p><p>Essentially, whatever view one might have about water charges or even the setting up of Uisce \u00c9ireann, all Members desire the most efficient management of the water system.  Whatever about Members' views on the charges, they all desire to have the best use made of our water, as well as water conservation.  However, in respect of management, the pinpointing of leaks and ensuring the huge amount of leakage within the system is dealt with in the best way possible, I believe district metering to be better than domestic metering.  Sometimes, debates like this are false because while the Minister might assert that domestic is better and I might respond by suggesting district metering was better, we often lack the requisite reports and analysis to enable us to share equally, discuss and debate the matter in the context of bringing forward this legislation.  Perhaps it is a weakness within the legislative system that so doing is not part of it and that such assessments are not carried out when sought by legislators to inform them when making the decisions.  Best practice should be considered, where possible, and based on the research my party and I have done and on foot of information we have received from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service, my understanding is that district metering is a very good system.  I already have cited the example of Laois County Council.  I will not labour the point because Members wish to deal with all the Bill's sections and amendments.  In fairness, the Minister of State has been very good in responding to them.  I expect the Minister of State has taken on board my comments, even if he does not agree.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900046#HHH02700","speaker":"1133","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1359484800,"counter":272,"content":"<p>If it is helpful to the Senator, I have seen a local authority training manual in which reference is made to training staff for metering, including district metering.

I have visited Galway and have observed what happens there.  Were every seat in this Chamber to represent a house that was on a district meter, the local authority would know there was water leakage somewhere in here but would not know precisely where.  Consequently, while the district meter enables it to ascertain the total area as to where the loss might be, to find the individual leak, it would be obliged to test down each row.  One often sees the workers concerned at different intersections where they are turning water on and off.  Consequently, I do not believe there is any contradiction or issue about district metering being effective and important.  While district metering will tell one where the totality of the loss is, it will not identify the actual location either by street or by house.  I believe that is the point.

I acknowledge that in the discussion on poverty proofing, the Minister of State agreed with the principle of doing it.  However, he might recall the last discussion by Members on the issue during a debate on the household charge.  I believe Senator Norris also participated in that debate.  At the time, Members considered the criteria that were set down in respect of the indicators of poverty, whereby people are deemed to be deprived if they lack two or more items that were set out.  Although some of the items included incited some amusement, at the time it was a genuine attempt by the Combat Poverty Agency to try to establish the real indicators of poverty.  I wish to restate the position.  I believe that when Members make such decisions, they must make sure they are conscious of the impact of that decision on families who are struggling and in particular on families which are either in poverty already or above the poverty line.  I understand the Minister of State has indicated the Government may consider how low-income families will be supported and so on in the context of this measure but Members again are being asked to take a leap of faith.<\/p><p>  I do not know what, if any, supports will be put in place to help those who may be unable to pay.  I do not know what, if any, supports will be put in place for low-income families or for those who are in receipt of social welfare payments.  However, I do know there will be a charge, which will be in addition to the property tax and that many families simply will be unable to pay it.  Whatever about the position in which ordinary families on middle incomes will find themselves, it is fair to state that many lower-middle income and low-income families will find this to be disproportionately tougher.  I wish to restate that point as it is one of Sinn F\u00e9in's core arguments against the Bill.  I again remind the Minister of State that if such poverty-proofing analysis has been carried out, such information might be provided to Members.  When Members table such amendments in advance and if such analysis has been carried out, the Government could provide them with the methodology used to so do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900047#JJJ01300","speaker":"1133"},{"type":"speech","time":1359484800,"counter":284,"content":"<p>If it is helpful to the Senator, the next legislative item to be introduced will deal with a lot more information than is available in this regard.

All Members will accept that regardless of what positions they might have taken on them.<\/p> <p> This amendment takes into consideration those who are on jobseeker's allowance, jobseeker's benefit, supplementary welfare allowance, family income support, farm assist, the old age non-contributory pension, disability allowance, disablement benefit or the blind pension.  They should be exempt from the charge.  I appreciate the Minister of State indicating that he will come back to us with more detail and perhaps we might discuss that in the House.  As public representatives we hold clinics and know the pressure people are under and while we in the Opposition are aware of the difficult choices Governments must make, we must deal with those families who come to our clinics in real distress because of their financial circumstances and any charges that make it more difficult for them.

Works on such roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<\/p><p>The main focus of each county council's roads programme are the restoration, maintenance and improvement programmes, which deal with the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads.  In the normal course of a county council's road works programme, repairs to minor county roads would only be considered towards the end of the programme after more heavily trafficked routes had been dealt with.  The purpose of the community involvement scheme is to permit local participation in the repair of roads.<\/p><p>All local authorities were issued a circular in 1994 requesting them to investigate the potential to promote and harness community support for road works in their respective areas.  Typically, community support has involved activities such as minor road works and drainage or a financial contribution towards road works.  In this way, if there are particular problems affecting a given stretch of road and the local community is willing to assist the local authority in money or kind with the necessary works, such roads can be improved sooner than would otherwise be the case.  As such, the scheme recognises local community involvement in this area without in any way diminishing the statutory responsibilities of county councils.<\/p><p>The statutory underpinning for local community involvement in road works is provided in the Roads Act 1993, section 13(6) of which provides that a person or group of persons may, with the consent of the road authority, carry out maintenance and improvement works on a local road.  The subsection also provides that a road authority may provide materials, plant, equipment and the services of its staff to a person or group carrying out such works and that the person or group is indemnified by the authority against all actions and claims arising in respect of the works, provided they are carried out in a bona fide manner and in accordance with any conditions, restrictions or requirements specified by the authority.<\/p><p>In previous years, local authorities were permitted to allocate up to 7.5% of their restoration programme grants for community involvement scheme works on regional and local roads.  Under that scheme, the community contribution, in money or kind, could not be less than 25% of the cost of the works.  In practice, however, such works were usually only carried out on cul-de-sac local tertiary roads.<\/p><p>This year, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is launching a new pilot community involvement scheme, which will be based on contributions within the range of 20% to 50%.  This is a significant increase in the local contribution.  Where the local contribution is monetary only, it will be 20% and where the majority of works are to be undertaken by the council, the local contribution will be 30%.  Should the majority of works be undertaken by the local community, the local contribution will be 40% and where all the works are to be undertaken by the local community with the local authority contributing by way of materials or machinery, the local contribution will be 50%.  In the latter case, no cash contribution would be required from the community.<\/p><p>The local authority will take into account the length, width and condition of the road and number of dwellings along the road and will then estimate the overall cost of each scheme, taking account of material, labour, machinery and traffic management costs.  It will then determine the local contribution, make a priority list of projects and apply to the Department for funding.  This method of calculating the local contribution is deemed to be the most fair and equitable way to proceed.  The funding available for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads will be reduced significantly in the next few years and it will not be possible to provide the full funding required for these less trafficked routes.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that the community involvement in road works scheme is purely voluntary in nature and local communities will not be forced into participating in it.  The scheme is available to give local communities the opportunity to have these works completed where they would not normally be considered for funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900048#MMM00400","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1359485400,"counter":325,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.

I look forward to the Minister of State's reply. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900050#MMM00300","speaker":"1158"},{"type":"speech","time":1359486300,"counter":333,"content":"<p>I thank Senator Conway for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar.<\/p><p>The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on such roads are funded from local authorities' own resources supplemented by State road grants.  The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the local authority.<\/p><p>The main focus of each county council's roads programme are the restoration, maintenance and improvement programmes, which deal with the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads.  In the normal course of a county council's road works programme, repairs to minor county roads would only be considered towards the end of the programme after more heavily trafficked routes had been dealt with.  The purpose of the community involvement scheme is to permit local participation in the repair of roads.<\/p><p>All local authorities were issued a circular in 1994 requesting them to investigate the potential to promote and harness community support for road works in their respective areas.  Typically, community support has involved activities such as minor road works and drainage or a financial contribution towards road works.  In this way, if there are particular problems affecting a given stretch of road and the local community is willing to assist the local authority in money or kind with the necessary works, such roads can be improved sooner than would otherwise be the case.  As such, the scheme recognises local community involvement in this area without in any way diminishing the statutory responsibilities of county councils.<\/p><p>The statutory underpinning for local community involvement in road works is provided in the Roads Act 1993, section 13(6) of which provides that a person or group of persons may, with the consent of the road authority, carry out maintenance and improvement works on a local road.  The subsection also provides that a road authority may provide materials, plant, equipment and the services of its staff to a person or group carrying out such works and that the person or group is indemnified by the authority against all actions and claims arising in respect of the works, provided they are carried out in a bona fide manner and in accordance with any conditions, restrictions or requirements specified by the authority.<\/p><p>In previous years, local authorities were permitted to allocate up to 7.5% of their restoration programme grants for community involvement scheme works on regional and local roads.  Under that scheme, the community contribution, in money or kind, could not be less than 25% of the cost of the works.  In practice, however, such works were usually only carried out on cul-de-sac local tertiary roads.<\/p><p>This year, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is launching a new pilot community involvement scheme, which will be based on contributions within the range of 20% to 50%.  This is a significant increase in the local contribution.  Where the local contribution is monetary only, it will be 20% and where the majority of works are to be undertaken by the council, the local contribution will be 30%.  Should the majority of works be undertaken by the local community, the local contribution will be 40% and where all the works are to be undertaken by the local community with the local authority contributing by way of materials or machinery, the local contribution will be 50%.  In the latter case, no cash contribution would be required from the community.<\/p><p>The local authority will take into account the length, width and condition of the road and number of dwellings along the road and will then estimate the overall cost of each scheme, taking account of material, labour, machinery and traffic management costs.  It will then determine the local contribution, make a priority list of projects and apply to the Department for funding.  This method of calculating the local contribution is deemed to be the most fair and equitable way to proceed.  The funding available for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads will be reduced significantly in the next few years and it will not be possible to provide the full funding required for these less trafficked routes.<\/p><p>It should also be noted that the community involvement in road works scheme is purely voluntary in nature and local communities will not be forced into participating in it.  The scheme is available to give local communities the opportunity to have these works completed where they would not normally be considered for funding.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/seanad2013012900050#MMM00400","speaker":"1069"},{"type":"speech","time":1359486900,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State for his comprehensive reply.
