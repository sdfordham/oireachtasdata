If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br\/>Last October the clerk to the committee and I visited London.  Among other activities, we attended an interesting climate change conference at Westminster and took the opportunity to visit the London Irish Centre.  There is not a family in the country that has not been affected by emigration.  That is the case with many of my family and social circle.  It was an enlightening and insightful experience to witness at first hand the work being done by the centre in Camden.  The committee's remit generally covers a great deal of environmental work, given the Departments we mirror.  We cover the arts, but we need to maintain our focus on the cultural aspect.  We should take advantage of any way we can to support the work of the London Irish Centre.  We forget that during the years the centre became the fulcrum of activity for many Irish people who travelled to London not just socially but also in the context of people's identity.  The sense of belonging we have as Irish people is well provided for in a variety of ways by the centre and that is important.  The reality of the economic downturn is that 20,000 Irish people emigrated to the United Kingdom last year, the majority of whom went to London.  The support the centre gives is as relevant today as it was when it was set up almost 60 years ago.  I hope the committee will become more aware of that work during our deliberations.  Most of our visitors come here by train or car, but the delegates had to fly from Heathrow Airport.  I acknowledge their effort and the extra mile they had to go to attend.  I ask Mr. Barlow to address the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014031200003#D00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394633700,"counter":8,"content":"<p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting us.  It was a pleasure to go the extra mile to be with them.  I will run through a brief history of the organisation and then concentrate on outlining the services we offer, both welfare and cultural services, how we link with people today, how this is relevant to their needs and what we are doing to promote Ireland in London.<\/p><p>  The London Irish Centre is the oldest and largest Irish charity in Britain.  It was founded by the church in 1954 and we are currently celebrating our 60th anniversary.  It was founded primarily to provide accommodation, social care, employment and, importantly, ensure Irish emigrants arriving in Britain maintained their faith.  That was important to the Catholic Church which had founded the centre.  My mother at the tender age of 16 years left what was a poor County Clare in 1951 and arrived in Euston Station on her own three years before the centre was established.  It means a lot to me as the chief executive to support the people with whom she travelled and in the years that followed.  We still ensure we provide a safe place and a safe start for those making what is probably a much easier journey now.<\/p><p>  Since the early days, we have been at the heart of the Irish community in the heart of London.  Only yesterday, I looked at an RTE archives film from 1968.  RTE came and filmed during the mid-years of the centre and showed people celebrating a c&eacute;il&iacute; and attending mass there.  It hammers home the importance of the work we currently do with the older generation who were in that archive film.  That is important to us today.  The centre has been in place for the past 60 years through the good times for the Irish community but also through some bad times.  Originally people came over in a recession; another cohort came in the 1980s and, more recently, many younger people have come to London looking for work.  They do not necessarily want to travel to London or leave their homeland.  We were also there for people through the Troubles.  There was a time - it is documented in all of our records - when the centre was raided almost on a nightly basis by the police service in England to check that everything was above board.<\/p><p>  Nowadays we are no longer a ghetto of Irishness.  The last thing we want to be is such a ghetto in one of the most diverse cities in the world; therefore, we are outward looking and have integrated.  Only 24 hours ago, Mr. Dunne and I attended an event in the parliament at Westminster with the Taoiseach, the UK Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Ed Miliband, and a range of political representatives from the North and across the United Kingdom hosted by a charity founded to look at positive relations between the two states and cross-Border co-operation.  Our work no longer necessarily is done in a ghetto.  We are now in a different environment.  We proudly wave the tricolour from our building and are very much part of the scene in London.  Ours remains one of the largest independent welfare organisations in the city.  Last year we supported 14,000 people, more than 78% of whom were Irish, most of whom were first generation.  We provided varying degrees of support and classed more than 5,000 of them as vulnerable.  They are homeless or have severe addictions and mental health problems.  We work with families in poverty and those who perhaps are about to lose their homes because of changes to the UK welfare benefit system.  Our work is increasing.  We have seen more people come in in the past two or three years.<\/p>  <p>We are doing this alongside having tighter and tighter financial funding restraints.<\/p><p> We value and celebrate our history, but we are certainly not complacent about our services.  In 2012 we launched the biggest piece of research ever carried out of the Irish community in London.  A total of 855 people - first and second generation - were interviewed about their needs as Irish people and their expectations of Irish services in London.  That publication was launched at the UK Parliament's buildings at Westminster and has been referenced in the D&aacute;il and the Westminster Parliament.  The reason we produced it was to make sure our services were meeting the needs of people today, not just perceived needs.  There are over 130 Irish organisations in Britain, many of which have been using it also to make sure they are tailoring their services to meet the needs of the Irish population in Britain.<\/p><p> There are many perceptions about whom Irish charitable organisations are helping in Britain and much of our innovation is about making sure our services are meeting needs.  Only 32% of our clients are over 50 years of age and it is very important to provide services for them.  They are the very people I mentioned who came over in the 1950s and 1960s, many of whom are now becoming frail and elderly.  We provide befriending and support services for them, including luncheon clubs, bingo clubs, line dancing and so on.  However, the biggest group we work with are aged between 26 and 49 years and represent 63% of our clients.  There is a growing number of people in their twenties and early thirties coming to London in the past few years.<\/p><p> The other perception which is false is that all younger Irish people coming to Britain are prepared, have decent jobs, are well educated and can settle in easily.  That may be the case for many of them, but we are finding that many younger people are coming over without planning their journey and that they are running into difficulties.  Jobs or housing that might have been promised to them do not materialise and they quickly find themselves unemployed, homeless and in poverty.  We are there to support them also.<\/p><p> I am second generation Irish, as I was born and brought up in the south east of England, and when I moved to live in south-east London as a young person in my early 20s, I had a very large Irish family connection in west London, but I might as well as have been living in Sydney because the enormity of London and the distances involved made it a very lonely place until I could get to see people at weekends.  One of the things we are now doing is making sure we are providing services for the many younger people who are coming over who want to celebrate their Irishness, be involved in the organisation and do something with which they can identify as being part of their roots back in Ireland.<\/p><p> I would like to provide one example of a client who I personally helped recently.  When we were short of staff a couple of months ago - the staff were very stretched at the time - a young guy came to us.  We offer shower facilities and clothing for people who are homeless.  The young guy was in his mid-20s and had been in London for just over six months, having left the west of Ireland owing to family issues and relationship problems.  He had a job and planned his journey to London, but one evening a couple of weeks after he had arrived he was mugged and it caused him to lose his job, as he was no longer able to work in labouring.  He had nasty injuries and was hospitalised for a time.  As a result, he could not pay his rent and within a few months was knocking on our door to get clothes from our clothing store and food vouchers.  He was sleeping rough down the road in north London.  After he had had a shower, I discovered that what he really wanted to do was talk about his situation.  We chatted for about half an hour and he was desperate to go home, but he felt he could not return to his previous environment owing to relationship problems.  He had one distant relative, but he did not have the means to travel back to Ireland because he was that poor and destitute.  We were able to contact his relative and make sure she was happy to put him up and we repatriated him the next morning.  We checked it out in order that we knew he was safe, secure, warm and had a roof over his head.  This is one of many examples of the work we do on our welfare side.<\/p><p> Obviously, we do not just provide welfare services.  Our cultural programme is integrated with our welfare programme and is headed up by Mr. Gary Dunne who will answer questions about it.  It is the largest such programme in Britain.  In 2013 over 23,000 individuals took part in our arts and cultural events.  Our events are extremely diverse, ranging from large-scale festivals such as the Return to Camden Town Festival, the biggest traditional Irish music festival in Britain, to the more contemporary comedy festival which showcases top Irish comedians from Britain and the island of Ireland.  It is now in its second year.  We have more niche events such as the London Irish Book Club which consists of a small group who meet to look at books.  This is very relevant to our trip as later today we will be talking about our library.  We are absolutely delighted and very thankful for the support of the committee in helping us to boost it and I am even more delighted to see the books in the flesh, so to speak.<\/p><p> To mark our 60th anniversary, we have a major concert series which is being part-funded by Culture Ireland.  We have nine top-of-the-range acts, alongside our normal culture programme, and are very grateful to Culture Ireland for supporting it.  In addition to our mainstream cultural programme, we do an awful lot of partnership work which is very much about bringing Irish art to Britain.  I have spoken a lot about welfare issues and what we do in-house, but we are not a ghetto; we are very much about showcasing Irish art in Britain.  Mr. Dunne and others in the London Irish Centre have been instrumental in working with the British Museum, the South Bank Arts Centre and the University of London, Goldsmith's College.  We were commissioned last year and again this year by the Irish Embassy to deliver the Irish Showcase, the leading Irish art showcase in Britain.  One of the biggest things in which we are involved is working with the programmers for the concert at the Royal Albert Hall for the President next month.  We are very honoured that the London Irish Centre is working on it also.<\/p><p> We want to be a voice for Ireland and the Irish in London.  If one types the words \"London Irish\" on Google, ours is the first organisation one will probably find.<\/p>  <p>We want to continue doing this for the next 60 years.  We could not do the work we do without the support we get from the Irish Government, particularly the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade through the immigrant support programme.  We value that support.  In the current financial year which ends this month 48% of our &pound;1.2 million operating costs comes from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The remaining 52% is made up through general fund-raising, property rental and other endeavours.  The funding provided by the Irish Government is crucial to the work to which I referred in the area of the arts and welfare.  We thank the Irish people, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Government, for this support.  We assure the Irish people that we will endeavour to continue to provide services to meet the needs of their elderly relatives in London for the next 60 years.  I also assure them that we are also looking after their sons, daughters and siblings who find themselves in London, be it by way of assisting them in finding somewhere they can celebrate being Irish or, if they need it, giving them a helping hand along the way.  <\/p><p> I thank the committee for inviting us.  It is a great privilege to be here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014031200003#D00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Barlow","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394634900,"counter":11,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barlow for his insightful comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014031200005#F00200","speaker":"996"},{"type":"speech","time":1394634900,"counter":12,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Barlow for his interesting presentation.  Like others, I have family members scattered all over the world, including in London.  Mr. Barlow has mentioned that the centre works with people in London who present as homeless in securing housing.  I presume it does not work directly with them in that regard but does so through the authorities in London or other parts of the United Kingdom.  I am interested in hearing how this manifests in the context of the changes in UK welfare policy referred to by Mr. Barlow.<\/p><p>  Mr. Barlow also referred to the false perception that young Irish people going abroad were prepared, well educated and so on.  Perhaps he might elaborate further on that issue in terms of the extent of the problem relative to the number of people who emigrate.  For example, is the percentage very high or is this something of which the centre would be aware?  Mr. Barlow might also outline what he believes could be done here in preparing people for emigration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014031200005#F00300","speaker":"1052"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394634900,"counter":13,"content":"<p>In terms of housing, we ceased providing accommodation directly many years ago.  As I said, the centre started out as a hostel.  We do, however, signpost people to emergency accommodation.  We have links with emergency hostels supported, for example, by the Shelter organisation.  We also work with local authorities to get people into emergency accommodation.  That task is getting harder because, as I am sure members of the committee are aware through the media, the accommodation problem in London is worsening because rents are escalating enormously.  The majority of people, including those in well paid jobs, who are trying to get a foot on the ladder and provide their own accommodation are finding it very difficult to do so.  This links in with the false hopes people have in coming to the United Kingdom which, in turn, links in with what we are trying to do.  The committee might be able to help by ensuring people who are thinking of moving to London or other cities in Britain are educated about the realities of doing so.<br\/>In 2011 we launched an information booklet, which is also available online.  I understand it is also available online in most Irish libraries and other places where people might go to research coming to Britain.  The booklet is entitled <i>Moving to London,<\/i>and provides people with realistic information on what they can expect in terms of the geography of London and how vast it is compared to most cities on the island of Ireland and the position on rents.  Given the many changes that have occurred in the past three years, the booklet could probably do with being updated.  A number of people coming to London expect to be able to rent a two bedroom house in north London.  The London Irish Centre owns three garages which it is proposed to demolish and replace with a two bedroom house which we can rent to boost our income. Its rentable value will be &pound;3,500 per month.  That is the cost of renting a house in the area, which, while a good one, is not one of the wealthiest.  These are the types of issue about which people need to be made aware.  They need to know that if they do secure accommodation, it is likely to be a flat-share in a not so nice area.  Anything the Irish Government or organisations and agencies could do to support our work in educating people on the realities of moving to London would be welcome.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014031200005#F00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Barlow"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394634900,"counter":14,"content":"<p>On the second question, we do not have detailed information on the percentage split between young Irish graduate emigrants who are well set up and in secure jobs in professional industries and those for whom the move is more difficult.

We deal with people for whom the move is much more difficult and who find themselves in crisis.  We are investing heavily in providing resources in order that people can prepare before they make the move.  In the social media area we have 20,000 people.  Our website is visited by approximately 500 people per day, many of whom download the booklet mentioned by Mr. Barlow in preparation for their move.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014031200005#F00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gary Dunne"},{"type":"speech","time":1394634900,"counter":15,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegates.

My daughter moved to London two years ago where she set up her own business.  I must tell her to ensure she calls in to the centre.  Perhaps on the next occasion I visit London I might visit it with her.<\/p><p>  Mr. Barlow has mentioned that there are 130 Irish organisations in London, including a branch of the GAA and so on.  I have not checked, but I am sure they are all listed on the centre's website.  Deputy Catherine Murphy discussed the issue of housing with the delegates.  I am interested in discussing the issue of enterprise with them.  Mr. Barlow has said the centre hosts cultural evenings and so on.  Does it ever host enterprise evenings, through which it could network with agencies such as Enterprise Ireland?  <\/p><p>  The comedy festival was mentioned.  Irish people are noted for their comedy.  Irish comedians who have gone to London have done very well; some of them have taken over the BBC, but I will not mention any names.  During one of my visits to London I attended a comedy festival.  It was probably hosted by the London Irish Centre, but I did not realise it at the time.<\/p><p>  I congratulate the centre on its work.  In working together we can be stronger.

It all depends on how one defines an Irish organisation.  The statistic Mr. Barlow cited is for Irish community organisations, of which ours is the biggest.<\/p><p>  The London Irish Centre&rsquo;s mission statement is to support the Irish community and promote Irish culture.  As an entity or a charity, there are two ways by which we can support Irish business, one of which is by providing space.  We have invested a great deal to make our big old centre in Camden Town suitable for hosting quality events.  The second way is marketing.  We work closely with groups such as the London Irish Business Society, LIBS; the London Irish Graduate Network, LIGN; and the Irish International Business Network, IIBN.  We have good working relationships with these groups and do not have the staff or capacity to be particularly proactive in supporting business.

The delegates are very welcome.  Their presentation was very helpful and inspiring.  I acknowledge the work of the Chairman and the clerk in making this visit possible.  They have shown prowess in collecting, if my figures are right, over 6,000 books and 1,000 CDs and DVDs.  This says something about the work they have done, but it also says a lot about the Irish in Britain and the affection for, and strong links with, them.<\/p><p>  I had the privilege and pleasure last year of hosting two groups of Irish senior citizens from Britain.  The event was organised by Sally Mulready, a remarkable lady who is a Labour Party councillor in Britain but also sits on the Council of State with the President.  Over the course of several hours with the people concerned I saw their great emotion when thinking about the homeland and their great pride.  I did not hear one negative word from them.<\/p><p>  The work of the London Irish Centre in Camden Town is unique and historic.  It was the first port of call for many Irish people who found themselves in difficulties for different reasons.  I saw how they were received with respect and given help exactly when it was required.  The new wave of emigration and the thousands of people going to the United Kingdom again must cast the London Irish Centre back into a role which, to some extent, had been changing.<\/p><p>  I presume the London Irish Centre receives funding from the Irish abroad or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or some source in Ireland.  How successful has it been in accessing funding from British sources such as the welfare system and so on?  I recall Fr. Sheridan years ago banging down many doors until he ensured what was available to UK citizens and other ethnic groups was made available to the Irish.  What is that relationship like now? <\/p><p>  Other ethnic groups have the same issues as the Irish.  Does the London Irish Centre interact with them?  Do they come along and display their wares and so on?  There is a seanfhocal, n&iacute; neart go cur le ch&eacute;ile - there is strength in unity.  Are there opportunities to work with the other groups?  It is more difficult for Irish people leaving now because there are no jobs.  What is the position when they arrive in Britain?  The delegates mentioned insufficient planning.  I can understand this because many young people never saw themselves having to leave Ireland.  The recession has happened quickly.  Do they have great difficulty in accessing work when they arrive?  What type of work is available?  The construction industry absorbed many members of the Irish community in the past.<\/p><p>  The question of votes for Irish emigrants may be outside the delegates&rsquo; remit.  Are they as exercised about it abroad as we are here?  It is often discussed at the Convention on the Constitution and debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am sure it is a discussion point.  The delegates might have a more focused idea because they are at the coalface.  The Convention on the Constitution suggested that where there would be votes, perhaps for the President, they be confined to those who had emigrated in recent years.  I have received a lot of correspondence from people abroad in a different age group who would feel left out if that were to be the case.  I am not ignoring the logistical problems but focusing on the emotion.  What is the thinking on the voting issue?  How important is it and for what should they vote?<\/p><p>  I compliment the London Irish Centre on its outstanding work.  It played a very important role during the Troubles in Northern Ireland.  They also visited Britain when the Irish community came under terrible pressure.  Places such as the London Irish Centre became a focal point where people went to have a sense of security or support.  I presume this has changed, particularly since the Queen&rsquo;s visit here and given the President&rsquo;s forthcoming official visit to Britain.  I presume, too, that the Irish community in Britain looks forward to a new future now that our relationship with its adoptive country has changed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014031200006#G00300","speaker":"1115"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394635500,"counter":20,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his kind words about our work.  I touched on his final point in my few words at the beginning of the meeting.  Our place in London has changed.  From talking to people who have been involved in the organisation throughout the decades and reading our archives, I get a real sense of how people on both sides of the divide found refuge in the London Irish Centre, particularly in the 1970s.  We now proudly fly the tricolour outside our building.  It was not until President Robinson visited in the mid-1990s that there was a tricolour near the building because it was not the thing to do in those challenging times.  I read that one was hastily stuck to the wall minutes before her car arrived.<\/p>  <p>We have moved on a long way.  There were people from all the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland parties in particular with the Taoiseach and leading politicians in Westminster yesterday with a bright green London Eye opposite on the banks of the Thames.  That proves how our work has moved from being a place of refuge and ghetto to a place that is far more dynamic and active as part of the wider community.  That links to the work as a black, minority, ethnic - BME - organisation.  We work locally and across London with other ethnic minority organisations and we have shared work regarding the storing of information on ethnicity with other ethnic organisations.  We host the main group of London Somalis at the London Irish Centre, and they have conferences and regular meetings there.  We are diverse, although we are very proudly first and foremost Irish.  Our doors are open as part of the community sharing everything that is good about being Irish with the rest of the London community.  We also welcome the rest of the community interested in us.  It is a different place which is very dynamic, innovative and refreshing in which to work.  Much of that is thanks to the cross-Border co-operation and developing issues over the past decade and a half.<\/p><p> Some 48% of our income is from an emigrant support programme and that is very valuable to us.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has told us it must be spread further as more Irish organisations set up to support waves of emigration to places like Australia, Canada and New Zealand.  The vast majority of the money comes to organisations in Britain, and although the pot is not diminishing, it must do more work for more people across more parts of the world.  Much of our income used to emanate from UK local authorities, particularly around north London, where we are based.  As a result of very tough funding cuts in the past three or four years in the UK, much of that money has dried up and it is much harder to get funding for services.<\/p><p> As an example, we used to get a grant from our local authority, the London borough of Camden, to provide a day service for vulnerable and elderly Irish people, but that no longer comes to us for two reasons.  The funding system has changed, so people who need support from the local authority must have personal payments.  Individuals, through their social workers, must buy services, so we no longer get a grant to provide a service, as individuals must buy the service at a rate per day.  That makes it very difficult to plan services.  As a result of the manner in which funding is legislated for in the UK, asking for specific funding for the Irish community is impossible when dealing with local authorities.  Bodies must provide services to the entire community, which makes the provision of culturally specific services much more difficult.  That is where our co-operation with other ethnic minorities in London works, and we can put in joint bids for issues affecting the community.<\/p><p> The funding issue is difficult.  Like most charitable organisations in Britain, we must consider every penny or cent we are spending, and we have cut costs by approximately 12% in the current financial year.  It is very tough to keep up with reductions in income generation none the less.  For our 60th anniversary this year we are trying to pull out all the stops to promote what we are doing across London and in Ireland to let people know the importance of the services we are trying to offer.  We want to let people know the reality of the work we are doing.  Although certain people know what we are doing, there is a majority with the wrong perception of what we do.  They may think we are a big social club or stuck in decades gone by in providing a specific type of service that does not appeal to people coming to London now.  We cannot be complacent and much of our work must be innovative.  We need to show people what we are doing and how efficient and effective are our services, as well as the value for the people using them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ENJ2014031200006#G00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. David Barlow","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394636100,"counter":22,"content":"<p>The only point I wanted to address was the question of how young emigrants find it to arrive in London.  As Mr. Barlow mentioned, we carried out the largest research process ever carried out on the Irish in London two years ago, entitled Fresh Perspectives, which was a community needs analysis.  From that, we can see that 60% of the recent migrant cohort aged between 18 to 35 were going to managerial and professional industries, only 10% were going to manual and traditional roles and the rest were students.  Another interesting point from the needs analysis was how difficult young migrants found the transition to the London workplace.  It is a very competitive work market and work plays a central role in the lives of Londoners.  I am sure it does here as well.

We appreciate the witnesses coming here to give us some more information.  I am interested in the number of volunteers as well as expert staff.  How many are there and how many are required?  Is the centre able to maintain the numbers of volunteers?  No matter what the type, when an organisation is trying to reach out into communities, it will always require volunteers.  They play a vital role and there is more to it than just volunteerism.  How is the issue managed?<\/p><p>  The Government is having research done by UCD on the diaspora but has the centre played any role in it or does it see a role in that respect?  I know the centre has extensive programmes promoting Irish arts and culture, providing many Irish music and language classes.  Is it mostly Irish people participating in that or are people from other cultures interested?  Is that encouraged?

I was reading again the history of the centre on the way over in preparation for today, and we published <i>The Scattering<\/i>in 2004, which was our 50th anniversary.  It reminded me that we have this beautiful premises because of the voluntary work of Irish predecessors and ancestors in London.<\/p>  <p>The centre was set up by the church and volunteers.  They bought one little bit first and voluntary Irish labour built the place.  Volunteering has always been a key part of the centre.  We have 150 volunteers today.  I started in the centre as a volunteer six years ago.  Our volunteers do everything from befriending, which as the name suggests includes going out to visit older Irish people in London, to running Facebook pages to pouring tea at tea dances, to doing box office at the London Irish comedy festival.  There has always been, and it is very much the case these days, a strong culture of the community supporting the community.<\/p><p> Only last week I inducted seven new young Irish arts volunteers.  They are young Irish people in their mid to late 20s who have signed up specifically to be arts volunteers.  There is an interesting motivation there when one asks people why they are volunteering.  Interestingly, for them it is about belonging.  They are in London and they are fully integrated into London life but they get a sense of belonging, connection and groundedness from having an organic link with their roots.<\/p><p> We have done quite well in retaining volunteers.  Our two volunteer staff seem to manage them really well.  We have a big summer event and a big winter event and there is a lovely energy around the whole project.

Four hundred people attended as part of the Culture Ireland 60th anniversary concert series which David mentioned.  One of our new volunteers carried out a survey at the desk.  He asked where people had heard about the gig and whether they were Irish or non-Irish for market research purposes.  Up to 40% of the crowd for that gig were non-Irish.<br\/>We had the famous Bothy Band piper, Paddy Keenan, in the week after and 77% of the audience were Irish.  That is a mix of Irish-born people and people who identify as Irish.  Even within the Irish language it depends on the level.  In the beginners class 70% of those who attend are Irish.  It is a different split at intermediate level and nearly 100% of those in the advanced class are Irish.<br\/>In terms of the people who come to our events, it depends on the events.  I could talk about them all day.  In terms of our motivation, we are trying to do at least two things at the same time.  First, we offer a taste of home and an opportunity to celebrate their roots and identity to Irish people in London.  Second, we are funded by bodies such as Culture Ireland, whose primary aim is to promote Irish arts on the international market and we are building relationships with <i>TimeOut<\/i>, <i>The Guardian<\/i>and the <i>Evening Standard<\/i>to bring the very best of Irish programming to London audiences.

We were in Coote Street and Woodlawn.  I was in Britain in the early 1980s.  I was involved in a number of Irish organisations in the north of England that focused on some of the issues we are talking about.  The witnesses will be pleased to hear that Laois library sent books to the book project.  I hope they will be of some benefit.<\/p><p>  I wish to refer to the status and welfare of the Irish community.  I did not live in London but I was there on a number of occasions.  In the north of England and in cities such as Coventry and Leeds &ndash; Manchester is not too bad because there is critical mass, as is the case in London &ndash; I found that it was very difficult for Irish emigrants.  In some places there was not even an Irish centre.  The Federation of Irish Societies, as it was, tried to reach out to as many people as possible.  How intact is the network now?<\/p><p>  I was part of a group at the time that focused on trying to get ethnic minority status on the agenda because we felt very strongly that, to put it crudely, the Irish community was not getting a slice of the action compared to other ethnic minorities.  We felt that we did not have the lobbying power, coherence or status of other ethnic minorities.  From what was said it seems the witnesses believe that minority status has been achieved.<\/p>  <p>The other issue I wish to ask about is voting rights.  Sinn F&eacute;in introduced a Bill in the House yesterday to extend voting rights in presidential elections to Irish people living abroad.  We know there are logistical challenges in that but we feel they should be overcome in the interests of the diaspora.  I agree with what Mr. Barlow said about Mary Robinson earlier.  To her credit, she went to a lot of places that no President ever went before, including in this country.  She was the first President to push the boundaries in that regard and President Higgins is continuing in her footsteps, thankfully.  Indeed, Mary McAleese played her part too.  Apart from being symbolic, the role of President has a global reach and status and we feel that extending voting rights for presidential elections would be a very positive step in terms of embracing and reaching out to the Irish community abroad, particularly in England, Scotland and Wales.  <\/p><p> There has been a lot of talk recently about reform of the Seanad, following the turbulent referendum campaign.

It has a challenging job because it represents welfare and arts organisations like the London Irish Centre as well as various Irish social clubs.  It represents a very wide range of Irish organisations and is still very much to the fore in providing support across Britain.<\/p><p>  In terms of the black and ethnic minority, BME, community, my personal opinion is that the Irish community is still not as recognised as other ethnic minority communities in London.  While it is not one of our charitable objectives to be a campaigning organisation, we certainly need to get the message across to our funders about the importance of culturally-specific services, both in terms of welfare and well-being.

Unfortunately, there has not been much understanding of the situation there from the perspective of my country.  As we see it, the events in Ukraine are a result of the very deep internal political crisis which did not come about only yesterday.  The crisis was not created by Russia and came about, despite multiple warnings from my country.  It was created artificially for geopolitical reasons.  The current leadership in Ukraine, the United States of America and the European Union are trying to demonise my country by depicting us as the cause of the conflict.  This is not new for us.  Every time Russia attempts to protect its lawful interests, the image of an ugly, vicious Russian bear appears immediately.  <\/p><p>  The events in Ukraine are causing pain for all Russians.  Unlike for political technocrats in the United States and Europe, Ukraine has never been just another foreign country for Russians.  Russian history begins in Kiev and Belarus.  Kiev is the mother of all Russian cities and the starting point for the Russian fleet.  Ukraine is an inseparable part of Russian history.  The people of Ukraine are our brothers, not just in a figurative sense.  That is why all Russians are grieving for all those who lost their lives during the recent violence in Ukraine.  The fates of Russians and Ukrainians are bound together historically, culturally and at family level.  Together we defeated fascism.  All of these facts should be taken into consideration when one is trying to understand the relationship between Russians and Ukrainians.  Our two peoples are now being forced to clash with one another.  <\/p><p>  My country does not recognise the new leadership of Ukraine because of its illegitimacy.  The current leadership took power as a result of a <i>coup d'&eacute;tat<\/i> and has consciously obstructed the agreement signed on 21 February this year with the connivance of France, Germany and Poland, the Foreign Affairs Ministers of which signed the agreement and guaranteed its implementation.  Consequently, the current Ukrainian authorities have de-legitimised all of their subsequent activities.  <\/p><p>  I would like to draw attention to how the new authorities began.<\/p> <p>They have attempted to restrict the Russian language spoken by more than 50% of the population, eliminate the Communist Party supported by 15% of the population, cause vandalism to Soviet-era monuments and encourage extremist actions by far-right, fascist and neo-Nazi forces.  There are several Svoboda Party representatives in the current Ukrainian Government.  In a resolution dated 13 December 2012, the European Parliament stated:<blockquote><br \/>It is concerned about the rising nationalistic sentiment in Ukraine, expressed in support for the Svoboda Party - recalls that racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic views go against the EU's fundamental values and principles and therefore appeals to pro-democratic parties in the Verkhovna Rada not to associate with, endorse or form coalitions with this party.<\/blockquote>The following year, this was forgotten by Europe.  We do not understand why this has happened.<\/p><p> Most of all, Russia is concerned about the strengthening of neo-Nazi, nationalist and anti-Semitic forces in Ukraine.  These forces are not a new phenomenon in Ukraine but over the past several years, with the connivance of the Ukrainian authorities and the direct participation of the West, they have been growing in real strength.  This was demonstrated with the so-called Right Sector movement members exploiting the revolutionary feelings of people which pushed them to struggle with police forces while also provoking the police through illegal activities.  I must remind the committee that the police and security forces did not use their weaponry against these people.  The Right Sector movement members are in the Ukrainian Government and its leader declared he will participate in presidential elections.  He has also requested access to arsenals to pacify the east of Ukraine and fight with Russia.  This nationalist organisation has taken serious actions against Russians in east Ukraine which Kiev ignores.<\/p><p> It is also one of the reasons there was such righteous indignation among the Crimean population and those in southern and eastern regions of the Ukraine.  Kiev&rsquo;s authorities are not able to control these radicals.  Instead, they use them to stay in power and to suppress protests from those who want live better together with Russians and other residents of Ukraine and build a new democratic country.  In this context, we are surprised by the EU and US position.  We did not hear any condemnation of the Right Sector&rsquo;s actions.  Moreover, the Russian Federation is demanding the West sets in motion an inquiry into the famous story about snipers in Maidan.  Otherwise, it would have been rolled under the carpet.<\/p><p> We want to be heard, especially in Ukraine and the capitals of EU member states.  Beware.  We all know what fascism is.  If such forces like the Right Sector are allowed to continue, no one will notice when they wake up in another country.  The anti-constitutional actions used by the present Ukrainian Government, made up of nationalists and neo-Nazis, are considered by the EU to be legitimate.<\/p><p> The referendum on the independence of an autonomous republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol will be held on 16 March in full compliance with international law.  The citizens of Crimea have the full right to determine their fate by themselves and not to have to ask for permission from Kiev.  This fact does not contradict international law.  The decision of the International Court on Kosovo, dated 22 June 2010, is based on Article 1.2 of the UN Charter which has created a precedent that it does not require a mandate from the central authorities to conduct a referendum.  This has been repeated in documents and statements of officials from the USA, Great Britain, France, Germany, Austria, Denmark and other western European countries.  The precedent in international law is considered to be a law itself.  Thereby, the authorities of Crimea are acting fully in compliance with international law and with the decision of a UN international court.  Crimea, if it passes the referendum, as an independent and sovereign country, can then appeal to join the Russian Federation.<\/p><p> The Russian Embassy in Ireland has received numerous SMS messages, e-mails, letters and telephone calls from Irish citizens supporting Russia&rsquo;s position.  That does not mean we do not get telephone threats and so forth but they are fewer than those voices which are on our side.  This fact testifies not only about the interests of the Irish people to the events in Ukraine but about their objective approach in assessing the activities of the current leadership of Ukraine, as well as the Crimean authorities&rsquo; position with Russia, the EU and USA.<\/p><p> I thank the committee for its attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014031200002#A00400","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We are not here to demonise the Russian Federation.  It was a term he used himself and he said that the Russian people are grieving for those who lost their lives in this conflict.  The loss of life is a concern to all of us.  Why was Russia not represented at the Budapest Memorandum talks last week?  The US, EU and Ukraine were the only participants in these talks.  It goes without saying that proper respect should be shown to the Ukraine's substantial Russian-speaking population.  The ambassador claimed the crisis has been created artificially.<\/p> <p>If it is an artificial crisis, the reaction has been extremely severe, to say the very least.  It appears to us that Russian-backed forces are in full control of Crimea.  A one-sided and clearly illegitimate referendum is about to be held over the next number of days.  Has this crisis been created and exacerbated by a mindset that Russia has the right to control the destiny of a state that used to be part of the Soviet Union?<\/p><p> It has been clear for some time that it is the wish of the strong majority of the Ukrainian people to be part of the European democratic mainstream.  There was an extreme reaction when the association agreement had been progressed between the EU and the Ukrainian Government.  One of the narratives we have heard over the past weeks is that Russia was acting to defend Russian civilians being suppressed by Kiev.  In the coverage we read and see in our media, the only people we have seen being beaten off the streets in the last number of weeks were Russians protesting against their Government in Moscow and some Ukrainians supporting their Government in Sevastopol.  That type of activity is unacceptable.  Another clear message put out by the Russian Government was that the Russian troops were classed as self-defence volunteers.  It is strange that the uniforms and vehicles with military numberplates had all the trappings of belonging to Russian troops.<\/p><p> If right is so much on Russia's side, why the efforts to stop the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, from entering Crimea?  As we all know, the OSCE is directly charged with monitoring situations quickly.  Its attempts to enter Crimea were stopped.  The OSCE monitoring team included a colonel of the Irish Army.  Warning shots were fired at that convoy.  Why are there 30,000 Russian soldiers in Crimea compared to the 11,000 usually stationed there with Russia's Black Sea Fleet in the port of Sevastopol?  Can the ambassador comment on reports that the Russian Parliament is preparing legislation to make it easier to annex parts of other countries?  I repeat my thanks for the ambassador's attendance and I am sure he will be glad to deal with the questions that are posed by the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014031200003#B00300","speaker":"970","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394635200,"counter":61,"content":"<p>I welcome the ambassador-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014031200004#C00200","speaker":"1030"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394635200,"counter":62,"content":"<p>There are too many questions.

I am recalling for him the fact that it was the most insensitive correspondence this committee has ever received from an ambassador.  I am not a diplomat; I am a street fighter and a politician.  I do not want to be offensive, but I want to express anger in an inoffensive way.<\/p><p>  I am the first to agree that ultra-right-wing forces were at the barricades in Kiev and that either eight, ten or 12 riot police were shot dead by demonstrators, but I also agree that the riot police used live ammunition to massacre 80 civilians.  There are two sides to every story.  It is very sad that the ambassador should suggest we are trying to demonise Russia.  I hold Russia in the height of respect.  The role Russia has played historically and the Red Army's role in the liberation of the world and Europe must be recorded.  One would wonder at the sacrifice of so many sons of Russian mothers so that Russia can behave as it does towards Ukraine today.  We do not demonise Russia.  It is not an artificially created conflict.  This is probably one of the most serious conflicts in world politics in this century.<\/p><p>  While I agree that conservative, right-wing and ultra-right-wing forces were at play, they constituted a minority.  What happened in Ukraine was a popular demand for economic and political change.  People were so frustrated they took to the streets.  Sadly, some ultra-right-wing activists jumped on that democratic demonstration and exacerbated the conflict with the police.  While the right wing was active there - Russia keeps claiming that its reason for moving in was the threat of the ultra-right - I am sickened at the sight of Russia's own neo-Nazis and skinheads.  Every other week we see videos of Russia's own ultra-right, fascist skinheads terrorising the lesbian and gay community.  Rather than demonise the right wing of Ukraine, Russia might look very closely at its own right wing.  The extreme right is already elected in Russia.  The Liberal Democratic Party of Russia has 56 seats.  How does Russia square that?<\/p><p>  What worries me most is that, notwithstanding the fact that Russia is one of the 56 members of the OSCE, it has deliberately frustrated the OSCE observers in their attempts to enter Crimea.  Does the ambassador not agree - clearly he does not, but I will ask him anyway - that Russia has already broken the Charter of the United Nations, the OSCE Helsinki Final Act and the specific commitments in the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances?<\/p> <p>What sort of friendship agreement would it be?  The bilateral treaty of friendship, co-operation and partnership was signed in 1997.  It is time we sat down and tried to understand each other's positions.  Nobody is demonising Mr. Peshkov or his country.  We recognise that the international tensions are dangerous for humanity, Russians and western and eastern Ukrainians that we must talk and find a solution which I argue is the one proposed by the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014031200004#C02200","speaker":"1030","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394635800,"counter":83,"content":"<p>I thank the ambassador for coming.  It is positive that he has come to meet the joint committee, as it is very important that we hear the views of all sides.  We can all agree that there are too many conflicts and far too much loss of life.  We have also seen the way conflicts are hijacked by ultra fundamentalist groups to further their own ends.  This has absolutely nothing to do with the people and their legitimate rights.<\/p><p>  Russia is a member of the UN Security Council and the OSCE and a party to the Budapest memorandum and bilateral treaties and so on.  Why were the issues of concern in respect of Ukraine not discussed by these agencies?  Instead it seems matters were pre-empted because of Ukraine's interest in greater European integration.  The deployment of Russian troops in Ukraine has brought about an extremely severe crisis.  <\/p><p>  Russia has used its veto at the Security Council on a number of occasions in relation to the situation in Syria, stating it wants to protect Syria's sovereignty.  It agrees with the principle of non-intervention in domestic affairs, yet there is this interference in Ukraine's domestic affairs.  I know Crimea has a chequered history, that Catherine the Great took it over in the 18th century.  President Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine, to which President Yeltsin agreed.  We are, therefore, looking at a violation of national sovereignty.  <\/p><p>  When the Ukrainian ambassador was here last week, he said language was not a problem.  He told us he was a Russian speaking man from Sebastopol in Crimea.  He was not able to learn Ukrainian in school because there was no Ukrainian language school.  That was his very black and white statement.  If there are issues about human rights and language, why can they not be addressed through the international organisations that deal with human rights issues?<\/p><p>  Amnesty Internatinal has been calling for the establishment of an OSCE monitoring mission to calm tensions.  What is the current position in this regard?<\/p><p>  I take the opportunity to ask the Russian ambassador about Russian influence in Syria.  The crisis in Syria is of mammoth proportions and the population are being starved.  In time we will see images of people in Yarmouk and other cities similar to the pictures taken in Belsen and Auschwitz.  Russia and Iran have a certain influence in one direction; the West has an influence in the other direction.  How is Russia using its influence in dealing with the situation in Syria?<\/p><p>  Let me deal with the issue of Russian troops.  Will the ambassador commit to putting pressure on his government or bring back to it that the presence of Russian troops is not helping, that there is a need for negotiation, calmness and compromise?  President Yanukovych opted to leave Ukraine, which was a significant factor in what was happening.

Mr. Sergii Reva, had attended a committee meeting at which he outlined his views on the crisis.  It is welcome that the Russian ambassador, H.E. Mr Maxim Peshkov, has come before us today and I hope he will clarify some issues for us.  There are people in Russia who will see us as well meaning westerners who have no clue about what is happening on the ground.  However, we have a viewpoint.  Everybody is concerned about the rise in the number of of anti-Semitic attacks on the Jewish population.<\/p><p>  We are concerned about the composition of the interim government and people who are being given senior posts in the Ukrainian Government.  I expressed my concerns to the Ukrainian ambassador in this regard and have made the same point to the Russian ambassador.  Throughout the crisis in Ukraine I have been critical of both sides.  I have just come from a meeting with the Taoiseach to discuss the European Council.  My view is that mistakes were made by the European Union, the United States and the Russian Federation.  The ideal would be for both sides to work together and for Ukraine, because of its strategic location, to trade with both Russia and the European Union.  It was a mistake for the negotiations to move towards the zero option.  There could have been an historic compromise and others in Europe share this view of the crisis.   Only the people of Ukraine can decide their future.  It is an important principle that they should be able to do this without foreign interference.  We need to address this principle.<\/p><p>  I share Russian concerns about the emerging right-wing groups in Kiev and the positions they been able to establish in the power vacuum within the government.  I stand in total opposition to their ideology.  Deputy Brendan Smith mentioned self-defence units, which are a key part of the crisis.  These masked men do not talk openly when questioned.  They have no marks on their uniforms to establish who they are, but they have heavy weapons.  I have heard suggestions the uniforms may have been bought in stores, but from where did they get the military equipment?  Has the Russian Government supported their creation in any way?  Is it supporting them militarily or economically or controlling them?  What is the ambassaor's view of these armed groups that have emerged in Crimea?<\/p><p>  President Putin has the agreement of the Russian Parliament that he can send Russian troops into Ukraine, in particular the eastern part of the country, if the crisis worsens.  Russian troops also stage military manoeuvres.  It is welcome that there seems to have been a de-escalation.  In what circumstances would the Russian Government sent troops across the border?  Will the ambassador suggest a possible scenario because there is a threat and we, naive westerners, are concerned about where it will lead?  It is leading to further tensions in the region.<\/p><p>  A decision was made on 6 March to call a referendum in Crimea, which is due to take place on 16 March.  This is happening during the crisis in Ukraine.  The people have a right to self-determination and to decide democratically on their country's future in an open, fair and transparent way.  All sides, including civic society, should have an opportunity to put their views to the people, but that will not happen in a period of ten days.  Such a period is too short and does not follow democratic best practice in any country.  Will the ambassador agree that it lacks good democratic practice to hold a referendum in such a short timeframe? <\/p> <p>Has the Russian Government decided what it will do if the people vote in favour of joining the Russian Federation?  If that happens it will be viewed by many as a further escalation, but that depends on Russia's response.<\/p><p> Yesterday the US Secretary of State, Mr. John Kerry, rejected an offer to talk to the Russian President until, as he said, Russia engages with US proposals on the Ukraine crisis.  I think that view is counterproductive.  I urge all sides to sit down and talk and reference the Irish experience where negotiations were moved on in a peaceful manner.  Does the ambassador believe that the meeting should have gone ahead?  What specific issues did the Russian Government want to raise with the US Government?  I presume it was the make-up of a new government.<\/p><p> The EU has stated that if the Crimea referendum goes ahead and Russia wins, it will place sanctions on Russia.  Today the EU has agreed the wording of sanctions that include travel restrictions and asset freezes against those supposedly responsible for military actions in the Crimea.  European officials have also indicated that President Vladimir Putin and his foreign Minister, Mr. Sergei Lavrov, will not be on the list.  Therefore, those channels of communication can be kept open, but further escalation is possible at any time.  Instead, the list is expected to focus on people close to President Putin and will probably focus on security services and the military establishment.  How will Russia respond?  I accept that Mr. Peshkov is an ambassador and may not wish to comment.  If sanctions are introduced, can we expect similar counter-sanctions from the Russian Federation?  <\/p><p> Ireland is a small country located on the edge of Europe.  We have seen conflict in our own land for too long and can empathise with the Ukrainian people about what they are experiencing.  It behoves us all to do whatever we can and to raise our voices against what is going on, but we seem to be slipping further towards the brink of war.  The referendum is a mistake because people need time to settle down and talk.  It is positive that the interim government wants people to talk, and that is what they called it when they met Irish officials.  Does the ambassador agree that talking is the way forward rather than military exercises or responses?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014031200005#D00500","speaker":"1037","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394636400,"counter":86,"content":"<p>I join with colleagues in welcoming the ambassador and his colleagues here.  One can see from the contributions made by various members that they are only interested in peace and seeing that there is no loss of life.  The only thing I found surprising about the ambassador's contribution was his surprise at the EU and US positions.  Obviously the EU is deeply concerned about the violation of Ukraine's sovereignty by the Russian armed forces and breaches of the various internationally recognised agreements that are in place, such as the Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances of 1994 and the bilateral Treaty on Friendship, Cooperation and Partnership.  Does the Russian Federation or his government plan to have meaningful engagement to prevent loss of life and restore peace and stability in the region?  As the ambassador will know, the Irish Government called for Russian forces to withdraw to their barracks.  Will the Russian government respond positively to the request?<\/p><p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned Russia's influence on Syria.  Will the ambassador comment on the apparent serious breaches of UN Security Council Resolution 2139, signed on 22 February?

Members did not say anything with animosity but made helpful interventions that were in no way aggressive towards Ukraine, Russia or Crimea.  The members have a long history and knowledge of the geographical region.  I wish to state that it would be a huge tragedy of worldwide proportions if negotiations broke down and ended in hostilities.  That would lead to greater bloodshed, so it behoves everybody involved - Ukraine, Crimea and Russia - to have regard for world peace and the need to ensure that whatever is done from here on in does not in any way aggravate an already sensitive situation.  Past experiences have shown that when situations such as this occur, it is far better to resolve them through diplomatic intervention and negotiations rather than in a different way.  People may not readily recognise that there are consequences for the region, including Ukraine, Crimea and Russia, in the event that this issue is not satisfactorily resolved.  Russia is a more open economy now than it has ever been in the past 150 years.  It has established important trade links worldwide, and links have been established between Russia and the rest of Europe, and globally, that are mutually beneficial.  It would be very sad if lasting damage was done to the economies of Russia, Europe, Ukraine and Crimea in the course of finding a solution.<\/p><p>  Nobody here agrees with aggressive re-nationalisation, or whatever the case may be.  It is okay if people wish to go in a particular direction and embrace a different tradition as long as it is done through diplomatic channels, and we must revere, respect and protect that right.  If all these things are lost and the crisis escalates, there will be more serious consequences for everybody involved that will not so easily be resolved.  It is with that in mind that we should all - members have expressed this wish - ensure that what happens is within our immediate influence and is our preferred option.  We must always remember that with strength and power there is a need for magnanimity, a lesson that we have learned from past generations.

Unfortunately, the committee operates with one side of the information, so I will outline the real situation in the region.  Let me introduce or remind the committee of what happened in Ukraine step by step.  It began following the EU's invitation to the Ukraine to become an associate member, which does not mean that it would immediately have become a member.<\/p> <p>Ukraine is a sovereign country and has a right to go with Russia or Europe, but it was a fatal mistake on the part of Europeans to make this proposal an ultimatum - \"You will go with Europe or you will go with Russia.\"  Is it a mistake or is it a well-prepared step?  I do not know, but it was the action from Brussels.  What was our reaction?  It was put to Ukrainians and it was put to Brussels as to why they put forward this alternative.  We have our own relations with Ukraine and we have our own relations and co-operation with Europe.  We asked why they made this kind of ultimatum and they said they had no other choice.  \"You will go with Europe or you will go with Russia.\"  We did not present this kind of choice to Ukrainians.  We asked them to read the agreement of association and then to take their calculators and begin to count down the economic result of this, with the special relationship with Europe and Russia.  They began to think and then they said they would postpone their decision to sign the agreement.  That was their choice.  <\/p><p> The next step was the beginning of demonstrations and meetings in Maidan.  First, who were the people who came to Maidan, or Independence Square?  Decent people, people who sincerely believed in their European future, people who were tired of corruption, local hostilities and so on.  They showed their emotions but it was only the first step.  Immediately, radicals and right-wingers spread into their meetings and the real killings and massacres began.  I remind the committee that in spite of all the difficulties, there is no difference in the way we look upon Viktor Yanukovych.  Whether we like him or not, it does not matter.  He did not give a command to police and to Berkut to shoot.  Who was shooting?  We now know it was snipers; the Estonian Minister for Foreign Affairs said it was one of the members of the coalition.  That is all.<\/p><p> The next step, after analysis of the situation following talks or negotiations - by the way, we took part in this with Yanukovych - was that our European and American colleagues and partners decided on and signed an agreement dated 21 February.  What was written in this agreement?  The agreement provided that new presidential elections would take place at the end of this year, that the constitution of 2004 would be restored, that the Berkut police would go back to their barracks, that no emergency situation would be claimed in Kiev or in the country, and there would be constitutional reform.  These were the proposals of Yanukovych, all of which were fulfilled.  While the opposition was obliged to disarm its military groups and to free up all of the administrative buildings it had taken over, it did not fulfil any of these obligations.  Immediately there was a question about the three countries that guaranteed the agreement, and their reaction was zero.<\/p><p> The next step was that Viktor Yanukovych had to leave the country, and illegal steps by the Rada began the procedure of impeachment of the president.  In the constitution there is a paragraph stating how this procedure must be done.  They did not do it.  Therefore, the procedure of impeachment was not fulfilled at all.  <\/p><p> At that time Ukraine had no economic or ethnic problems.  The first two decisions of the Parliament were the banning or cancelling of two laws - the law on regional languages and the law banning the propaganda of fascism and Nazism.  What was the reason for this?  Whether or not it had no other business to do, it was a very clear marker for all Ukrainians.  It was a threat to Russian speakers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2014031200006#E00400","nonspeaker":"H.E.

It worries me - this is an observation - that if, for example, the European Union decided to take unilateral action in some fashion and move into Ukraine on one side in order to protect what it would see as its supporters or the people of a similar background and then the Russian Federation did the same for the other side, then we would have a serious crisis on our hands.  The point we are trying to get away from here is this - why should it be necessary for the Russian Federation to become involved in the internal affairs of Ukraine?  We know a little about parades in this country as well and the fact that one does not like the parade does not necessarily mean that we can use that as a means of conflict or potential conflict.  That is merely an observation.  Incidentally, I was in Vilnius at the meeting of the Eastern Partnership on the day that the European Union and Ukraine decided to go in opposite directions.<\/p><p>  The last point on that relates to the impeachment of the president.  We in this country could not become involved in the impeachment of a president or prime minister in an adjoining country, in Europe or outside it.  The question that then arises is \"why would it be necessary?\".  The European Union should not become involved in that either.  It would be seen by us as an internal issue within Ukraine.  We fully respect the right of people of Russian ethnic origin to have their civil and human rights protected in every sense, including the language, as well.

No additional troops were sent to Ukraine.  I can only quote my president.  He said that we do not intend to send additional troops Crimea if nothing extraordinary would happen.  I hope that no extraordinary situations will occur in this region.<\/p><p>  As for persons in uniforms, masks, etc., if one looks, for instance, to these films or videos from Maidan during all of the demonstrations, one can see persons in the same uniforms on both sides.

This goes back to the point I raised repeatedly.  I acknowledge the ambassador has been genuine in the manner in which he has attempted to respond to the questions but he is looking at it from the opposite perspective.  However, in issues of this nature it also is necessary to be able to examine the subject matter from the other side of the argument.  For instance, if there are Russian troops in Ukraine, albeit not in official uniform, or from wherever those troops came - we do not know where they came from, but we have seen them on television - who authorised them and what is their business there?  Are they supporting the previous administration or do they support something else?  Are they awaiting something else?  For example, in the case in which an administration must retire or resign, in most other situations one would assume that elections would take place as quickly as possible, that such elections would be free, and, as various speakers have noted, would be monitored and that an attempt would be made to ensure no one abused the system in order to achieve the desired result.  I do not suggest for a moment that this is what the ambassador is doing.  I fully sympathise with the job the ambassador is doing to answer the questions.

This is because there are no sides in the conflict, or rather, on one side there is Bashar al-Assad and his people, and on the other side there is a quite fragmented and amorphous group of people of various views and groupings, military people and so on.  They begin at a rather liberal part of the opposition and end with al-Qaeda, the Taliban and so on.  It is quite difficult to find some compromise as to what to do.  For instance, the Assad side agreed to some negotiations with the liberal section of the opposition.  They began the contacts, but they were all in vain because the military part of the opposition - that is, those who are with al-Qaeda, the Taliban and other groupings - are against all such contacts, which is quite a problem.<\/p><p>  As for the humanitarian position, the Deputy is correct that the situation is rather gloomy in that country.  It may not be catastrophic, but it is nearing catastrophe.  We are trying to help.

I believe this issue which relates to political prisoners who come under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement was discussed on Second Stage.  The Bill allows for DNA samples to be taken from former offenders within the past ten years, which should mean that any political prisoner under the Good Friday Agreement will be excluded.  However, the Bill states sentences must be expired.  As there are a number of political prisoners under the Good Friday Agreement who are out on licence, technically their sentences have not expired, even though they have been released under the Agreement.  This is an issue which needs to be addressed in the Bill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014031200003#B00500","speaker":"984"},{"type":"speech","time":1394616600,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Before I respond specifically to the amendment, I thank Deputies for their support for the Bill and their fortitude in dealing with what is already a very large Bill, to which I propose to add some additional sections.  I also inform the select committee that I will bring forward some further amendments on Report Stage to deal with historical samples and DNA profiles, easing the burden on the Forensic Science Laboratory and improving continuity in the chain of evidence for forensic exhibits in criminal trials.<\/p><p>  Turning to amendment No. 1, the former offenders regime in sections 33 and 34 is not a blanket provision covering all persons who fall within the ambit of the definition of former offenders in section 33; rather, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will have to identify individuals who are covered by section 33, in respect of whom a garda not below the rank of superintendent is satisfied that it is in the interest of the protection of society and desirable for the purpose of assisting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigation of offences to have under section 34 a sample taken from the person for the purpose of generating and uploading that person's DNA profile to the DNA database.  That is the first hurdle to be jumped before a request is made to a person to provide a sample.  It is not automatically an issue of obtaining samples. <\/p><p>  There are a number of further safeguards.  In the event that the person fails to comply with the request, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may apply to the District Court for authorisation to send a notice to the person requiring him or her to attend for the taking of a sample.  Even then if the person fails to co-operate, he or she cannot be forced to provide a sample, although the Bill provides that he or she may be prosecuted.<\/p><p>  The former offender provisions are also subject to the ten year rule contained in section 33(3).  Broadly, under that rule, a former offender may only be requested to provide a sample up to ten years after the sentence for the offence concerned has expired.  The likelihood is that most former offenders covered by the Good Friday Agreement will be covered by this ten year rule given the passage of time since their release.  That is the position from a practical standpoint.  From a strictly legal standpoint, it would not be possible to make the amendment the Deputy proposes.  In the first instance, it would result in the unequal treatment of two similarly situated individuals and as a result might be unconstitutional.  Even if the proposal did not suffer from a possible constitutional impediment, it would be extremely difficult to ground such a provision as there is no statutory provision covering the release of prisoners under the Good Friday Agreement in this jurisdiction.  <\/p><p>  I understand where the Deputy is coming from, but his concerns are misplaced.  I am satisfied that few, if any, of the cohort of former offenders about whom he is concerned are covered by the provisions of sections 33 and 34.  Even if they are, they cannot be compelled to provide a DNA sample.  I will not, therefore, accept the amendment the Deputy has proposed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014031200003#B00600","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"speech","time":1394617200,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I understand what the Minister has said.  Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn would like to focus on the ten year rule.  The Minister has said the amendment will create an unequal situation between prisoners, but is it also the case that by not excluding prisoners who are out on licence as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, he is saying it is likely most of these individuals will be covered by the ten year rule but not all of them?  Even in admitting this, some prisoners are being treated differently from others released under the Agreement.

If ten years have elapsed since someone was imprisoned, this ceases to be relevant to him or her.  All those who have served terms of imprisonment will be treated equally in that context.  There is no legislation under the Good Friday Agreement relating to the circumstances I have described.  Measures have been implemented and complied with as agreed, but I cannot take this any further beyond the response I have given which sets out clearly the different steps that can arise under this legislation and the circumstances in which protection is provided.  I do not see this being an issue of particular concern in the context of the Bill's provisions, but I cannot distinguish in it between individuals who have served prison sentences and been released for less than ten years and others.  There has to be a reason for someone seeking to obtain the DNA information.  It cannot simply be a case of \"Whoops!  There is some and I want it.\"  Specific provisions will apply to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in seeking to ensure the appropriate steps are taken.  A series of in-built protections apply in this regard.  If someone falls into the category about which the Deputy is concerned, there are substantial reasons for concern that he or she is engaged incriminality and there is a reason to seek a DNA profile, in these circumstances someone should not be excluded from seeking it.  The provision deals with issues that are in the public interest, treats people equally and tries to ensure safeguards are in place in order that the possibility of obtaining a DNA profile is not abused in any circumstance.  There have to be solid reasons for seeking it and, ultimately, if the individual who is requested to co-operate declines to do so, there can be a prosecution.  However, in the context of the prosecution, clearly the court would have to be satisfied that it was reasonable for the Garda to seek the profile in the circumstances prescribed by the Bill.<\/p><p>  I understand the Deputy's concerns, but the amendment is not necessary.

To correct this, the section is being deleted and recast.  It is proposed to confirm in writing for specific categories of persons that their DNA samples or profiles have been destroyed or removed from the DNA database.  It is proposed under the new subsections (1) and (2) that those persons in respect of whom the retention period for samples or profiles is extended will be informed in writing of the ultimate destruction or removal of their samples or profiles, should that take place.  This requirement will apply in all cases of extended retention, whether the person concerned appealed against such retention, and will act as an additional check or safeguard for this category of person.<br\/><br\/>It is also proposed under the new subsection (3) that certain other categories of persons be informed in writing by the Garda Commissioner of the destruction of their samples or profiles.  The samples concerned must have been taken under sections 27, 29, 44 or 48 to 50, inclusive, and the specific categories of persons concerned are volunteers, persons whose samples were taken for elimination purposes, missing persons or their blood relatives or unknown deceased persons.<\/p>  <p>The provision has already been specifically made in the Bill for application to be made by or on behalf of such categories of persons to have their sample destroyed or DNA profile destroyed or removed from the database.  It makes sense, therefore, for it to be subsequently confirmed to such persons that their requests have been complied with.<\/p><p> Subsections (4) and (5) provide for written confirmation of destruction or removal to be given in respect of samples taken under sections 41 to 46, inclusive, or profiles generated from them.  The samples and profiles in these cases specifically relate to those taken from Garda personnel, staff of the forensic science laboratory or other personnel, solely for illumination purposes.  These provisions already exist in the current section 98 and subsections (2) and (3) are effectively just being renumbered.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014031200004#C01700","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1394617800,"counter":177,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1394617800,"counter":178,"content":"<p>Section 98 deleted.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1394617800,"counter":179,"content":"<p>Section 99 agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1394617800,"counter":180,"content":"<p>NEW SECTIONS<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1394617800,"counter":181,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 4 to 12, inclusive, are related and will be discussed together.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014031200005#D00700","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1394617800,"counter":182,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 4:<blockquote><br \/>In page 112, after line 33, to insert the following:&ldquo;<b>100.<\/b>(1) Where a person is arrested for the purpose of being charged with a relevant offence, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may take, or cause to be taken, the fingerprints and palm prints of the person in a Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na station before he or she is charged with the relevant offence concerned.<br \/>(2) The power conferred by <i>subsection (1) <\/i>shall not be exercised unless a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not below the rank of sergeant authorises it.<br \/>(3) The provisions of subsection (1A) of section 6 and section 6A of the Act of 1984 shall apply to fingerprints and palm prints taken pursuant to this section as they apply to<br \/>fingerprints and palm prints taken pursuant to the said section 6.<br \/>(4) A person who obstructs or attempts to obstruct a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na acting under the power conferred by <i>subsection (1) <\/i>shall be guilty of an offence and<br \/>shall be liable on summary conviction to a class A fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.<br \/>(5) The power conferred by this section is without prejudice to any other power exercisable by a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take, or cause to be taken, the<br \/>fingerprints and palm prints of a person.<br \/>(6) Sections 8 to 8I of the Act of 1984 shall, with the following and any other necessary modifications, apply to fingerprints and palm prints taken from a person pursuant to<br \/>this section as they apply to fingerprints and palm prints taken from a person pursuant to section 6 or 6A of that Act:<blockquote>(a) references to an offence to which section 4 of the Act of 1984 applies shall be construed as references to a relevant offence;<br \/>(b) references to section 6 or 6A of the Act of 1984 shall be construed as references to this section; and<br \/>(c) references to the detention of the person under section 4 of the Act of 1984 shall be construed as references to the person being arrested for the purposes of being<br \/>charged with a relevant offence under this section.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>A new Part 11 is being inserted into the Bill with a number of provisions relating to fingerprints, palm prints and photographs.  The majority of Part 11 involves the insertion of new provisions amending section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984, which currently deals with the retention and destruction of such identification evidence.  The destruction arrangements for fingerprints, palm prints and photographs contained in section 8 are being aligned with those for DNA profiles contained in the Bill as published.  In effect, the current process, which requires a person to apply to have his or her fingerprints destroyed, is being replaced with one that presumes on the destruction of the fingerprints within 12 months, unless the person is convicted of an offence.The remaining sections in this new Part arise from the need to apply to Part 11 the proposed new destruction arrangements to other relevant statutory provisions or from the relocation of those provisions relating to fingerprints, palm prints and photographs that are already in the Bill, so that all those provisions are together in the Bill.  That will help make the provisions more readily understandable.<br\/><br\/>I propose to deal first with the most substantial amendment in this group - amendment No. 7 - on which many of the other amendments in this Part hang.  The purpose of this amendment is to provide for the alignment of the retention and destruction arrangements for fingerprints, palm prints and photographs with those for samples and profiles already in the Bill.  Deputies will recall that the retention arrangements provided for in the Bill in relation to samples and profiles were framed in light of a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of S &amp;amp; Marper <i>v<\/i>. the UK.  That case concerned a challenge to the indefinite retention regime in England and Wales that applied to the samples, profiles and fingerprints of persons who were not subsequently proceeded against or convicted.  The court held that the &ldquo;blanket and indiscriminate&rdquo; nature of the arrangements failed to strike a fair balance between public and private interests, were a disproportionate interference with the right to privacy and could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society.  It is also likely that the same considerations apply to photographs, though these were not specifically dealt with in the Marper case.<br\/>Currently fingerprints, palm prints and photographs may be retained indefinitely, subject to persons who are not proceeded against within 12 months, are acquitted or against whom proceedings are dismissed or discontinued, having the right to apply to the Garda Commissioner for destruction.  Such persons also have the right to appeal to the District Court and Circuit Court in the event of a refusal to destroy the identification evidence concerned.<br\/>I have decided that in all the circumstances, and taking particular account of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, our default position on the retention of forensic evidence should be in favour of destruction, with the Garda Commissioner enabled to authorise retention, on a year-by-year basis, where a statutory test is met.This approach is consistent with my overarching aim in this Bill, outlined on Second Stage, to strike an appropriate balance between the use of identification evidence for the investigation of crime and protecting individuals&rsquo; personal rights.<br\/>Section 103 relates to the destruction of fingerprints, palm prints and photographs and substitutes a number of new sections for section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984.  The original section 8 is being replaced and new sections 8A to 8I are being added to that Act.  The new section 8 provides for the automatic destruction of fingerprints, palm prints and photographs in certain circumstances, such as where the persons concerned are not proceeded against within 12 months, or are acquitted.  These destruction arrangements are aligned with those already provided for in respect of biological samples and DNA profiles under sections 76 and 80, respectively, which the committee has already accepted.<br\/>Section 8A provides for the extension of the retention period under section 8 for fingerprints, palm prints and photographs in certain circumstances.  This section broadly follows similar provisions already contained in the Bill in relation to the extension of the retention period for biological samples and DNA profiles.  In cases where the Garda Commissioner determines that certain circumstances apply, having regard to specified matters, he may authorise the extension of the retention period for fingerprints, palm prints and photographs by a period of 12 months, or subsequent such periods where the statutory test continues to be met.  In such cases, the Commissioner is required to inform the person concerned in writing that the authorisation has been given and of the person's right to appeal that decision to the District Court.  The Commissioner is required to give effect to the decision of that court.  These are substantially better arrangements that exist within our current law in this area.<br\/>Section 8B provides for the destruction of fingerprints, palm prints and photographs in exceptional circumstances.  These exceptional circumstances are the following: it is established after a detention during which the identification evidence was taken that no offence was in fact committed; that the identification evidence was taken on the basis of mistaken identity; or a court determines that the detention of the person from whom the fingerprint, palm print or photograph was taken was unlawful.  Section 8C specifies the meaning of certain terms in this new part.  These relate to the dismissal of charges, quashing of convictions and determination of proceedings.  It is a factual, interpretative provision intended to ensure clarity in this context.<br\/>Section 8D deals with the circumstances in which persons are to be informed of the destruction of their fingerprint, palm print or photograph.  The section provides that written confirmation of destruction must be provided to persons in respect of whom the retention period for their fingerprints, palm prints or photographs was extended.  This requirement follows the same approach taken for biological samples and DNA profiles under the revised section 98 that was discussed earlier, and will apply in all cases of extended retention, whether the person concerned appealed against such retention or not.<br\/>Section 8E provides that sections 8A, 8B, 8D, and 8H shall apply to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission as well as the Garda Commissioner.  This mirrors the approach already taken in respect of biological samples and DNA profiles in the Bill, and ensures that the same retention and destruction arrangements apply to all identification evidence taken by the Ombudsman commission in the course of its investigations.  Section 98 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 already provides that designated officers of the commission have the same powers as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in respect of the taking of fingerprints, palm prints and photographs when investigating complaints that appear to involve offences.  Section 8F allows the Garda Commissioner to delegate any of his or her functions under sections 8A, 8B, 8D and 8H.  This section replicates and inserts into the Criminal Justice Act 1984 the powers of delegation currently provided in section 138 of the Bill, thus ensuring that they also apply to the Commissioner&rsquo;s powers in relation to fingerprints, palm prints and photographs.<br\/>Section 8G sets out the manner in which notices to be given to persons under sections 8A or 8D are required to be served.  Section 8H provides that where a person is required under sections 8 to 8B to destroy a fingerprint, palm print or photograph, they shall ensure that every copy thereof and every record relating to these forms of identification evidence, insofar as they identify the person from whom they were taken, be destroyed.  Section 8I provides that the retention, destruction and related arrangements contained in sections 8 to 8H shall apply to fingerprints, palm prints and photographs taken before or after the commencement of this section.  This means that such identification evidence taken under existing statutory provisions prior to commencement of this section will be covered by the new retention and destruction arrangements.  This ensures equality of treatment of persons who had their fingerprints, palm prints or photographs taken under statute before or after the commencement of this legislation.<\/p>  <p> I turn to the other amendments relating to fingerprints, palm prints and photographs.  Now that I have dealt with the key amendment in the group, I will return to amendment No. 4 which essentially moves section 154 of the Bill into Part 11 as section 100.  This section deals with the power of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take fingerprints and palm prints of persons arrested for the purpose of charge.  At present such identification evidence can only be taken where persons are detained following arrest or conviction.  A new subsection (6) has been added in order to apply the destruction arrangements set out in new sections being inserted into section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 which I outlined earlier.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 5 inserts section 101 which amends section 3(1) of the 1984 Act, inserting definitions of &ldquo;Commissioner&rdquo; and &ldquo;photograph&rdquo; into this interpretation section.  These words are required to be defined as they are referred to in amendments now being made to the 1984 Act in relation to the destruction of fingerprints, palm prints and photographs.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 6 moves section 155 of the Bill into Part 11 as section 102.<\/p><p> Turning to amendments Nos. 8 to 12, inclusive, there is currently a range of legislative provisions that permit An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take fingerprints, palm prints and photographs in certain situations and in respect of certain offences.  It is necessary to amend these provisions, with necessary modifications, so as ensure the new retention and destruction arrangements apply across these provisions in a consistent and coherent manner.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 8 inserts section 104 which amends section 9 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 in order to apply the new retention and destruction arrangements to fingerprints, palm prints and photographs taken from, or of, persons in custody under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act 1939.  It also incorporates section 156 of the Bill which is being moved to Part 11.  This applies certain other provisions of the 1984 Act to persons detained under the 1939 Offences against the State Act. <\/p><p> Amendment No. 9 inserts section 105 which amends section 28 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 in order to apply the new retention and destruction arrangements in respect of fingerprints, palm prints or photographs taken from, or of, persons dealt with under the Probation of Offenders Act 1907, or convicted.  Amendment No. 10 inserts section 106 which amends section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 so as to apply the new procedures for the retention and destruction of fingerprints, palm prints and photographs taken from, or of, persons detained under section 2 of the 1996 Act.  <\/p><p> Amendment No. 11 inserts section 107 which amends section 12 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 which relates to the power of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to take photographs from arrested persons.  Section 107 applies the new retention and destruction arrangements to such photographs.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 12 inserts section 108 which amends section 52 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 so as to apply the new retention and destruction arrangements to fingerprints, palm prints and photographs taken from, or of, persons detained for offences relating to firearms and explosives.   <\/p><p> In brief, it can be said this brings into a new part of the Bill very important measures relating to fingerprints, palm prints and photographs, making them accessible in one coherent Act rather than across several Acts and where there is a consistent approach to the retention of records, whether it relates to DNA or other identification material.  It also provides for a greater balance of protection in the area of personal rights and, importantly, reflects the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.  It is of substantial importance that we ensure our legislation is balanced in this context and reflects decisions made by the court.<\/p><p> I hope members will welcome the extensive amendments contained in Part 11 which are of particular importance to this area of law and provide the correct balance between assisting garda&iacute; in undertaking investigations and accessing important identification information and, on the other side, providing greater safeguards for personal rights and provisions that will ensure information it is not necessary to retain can be destroyed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014031200005#D00800","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394618400,"counter":184,"content":"<p>I welcome what the Minister has said because it is important to have balance and safeguards.

If, in relation to a fingerprint, palm print or photograph taken from or of a person under section 6 or 6A, the retention period under section 8 is extended on one or more occasions under section 8A, the Commissioner shall, upon the expiration of that period (as so extended), cause the person from or of whom the fingerprint, palm print or photograph was taken to be informed by notice in writing as soon as may be after the fingerprint, palm print or photograph has been destroyed of its destruction.<br \/><b>Application of certain sections to Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission<\/b><br \/>8E. The references in sections 8A, 8B, 8D and 8H to the Commissioner shall, for the purposes of the application of those sections to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, be construed as references to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.<br \/><b>Delegation of functions of Commissioner under certain sections<\/b><br \/>8F.

Where a member state is requested to provide a DNA profile, and that profile is not available, Article 7 requires the requested state to obtain the profile.<br\/>Giving effect to the data protection provisions of the Prum decision requires both the modification of the existing data protection law as contained in the Data Protection Act 1988 and some additional new provisions.  The modifications are contained in amendment No. 22 and the new provisions are contained in amendments Nos. 23 to 26.  There is also a new data protection provision to be inserted into Chapter 5 in relation to mutual assistance but I will come to that later.<br\/>I will briefly outline the content of amendments Nos. 21 to 26.  Amendment No. 21 replaces section 113 of the Bill, as published, with a new section 113.  The section provides definitions of the key terms used in the chapter, many of which are assigned the meanings they are given in the Data Protection Act 1998, as amended.  Amendment No. 22 provides for a new section 114 which sets out a number of modifications which are needed to ensure that the data protection measures in the Prum Council decision are fully applied to the processing of data supplied or received under Chapters 2 and 3 or pursuant to an Article 7 request.  I will describe each of the seven modifications in turn.<br\/>The first modification provided by subsection (2)(<i>a<\/i>) inserts in the interpretation section of the Data Protection Act a small number of additional definitions.  The second modification provided by subsection (2)(<i>b<\/i>) is to section 2 of the Data Protection Act and inserts additional subsections after subsection (1), the main effect of which is to ensure compliance by the data controller with the rules in respect of the correction and destruction of inaccurate or incorrectly supplied data as set out in section 116 of the Bill.<br\/>The third modification provided by subsection (2)(<i>c<\/i>) is to section 2C of the Data Protection Act.  This is a substitution of subsection (1) necessitated to incorporate the security measures mandated by Article 29 of the Council decision.  Fourth, subsection (2)(<i>d<\/i>) modifies section 4 of the Data Protection Act to ensure that a data subject whose data are processed under Chapter 2 or 3 of this Act, or under an Article 7 request, may access information on data held about him or her, as provided in section 4, regardless of any exemption from this right of access contained in section 5 of the Act.<br\/>The fifth modification provided by subsection (2)(<i>e<\/i>) to section 7 of the Data Protection Act addresses the duty of care owed by a data controller and a data subject&rsquo;s right to damages as set out in Article 31 of the Council decision.  The sixth modification provided by subsection (2)(<i>f<\/i>) to section 8 of the Data Protection Act is to ensure that the exemption in that section that applies to data processed for the investigation of crime cannot override the data protection requirements of the Prum Council decision as provided for in this Part.<br\/>The final modification provided by subsection (2)(<i>g<\/i>) is to section 9 of the Data Protection Act and appoints the Data Protection Commissioner to be the competent data protection authority in the State for the purposes of a European Union or international instrument and sets out some specific monitoring functions accordingly.<br\/>Amendment 23 inserts section 115 which sets out the limited purposes for which DNA and dactyloscopic data, and related reference data, supplied to or received from a designated state can be processed.  The purposes are: comparing the data in order to find out whether there is a match of the data on the relevant database system in the State; providing automated responses to the designated state that supplied the data; entering a note of a match on the DNA database system; and creating the required records of the supply and receipt of data.<br\/>Data supplied by a designated state must be destroyed once a response is issued to the designated state unless there is a need to retain the data for mutual legal assistance purposes under the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 or for the creation of required records.  The limitations on processing are to ensure the data protection rights of an individual, whose DNA or fingerprints etc. are the subject of a search or comparison, are protected and that the data may not be processed for any other purpose other than those permitted by the European Union or international instrument under which the search or comparison occurred.<br\/>Amendment No. 24 inserts section 116 which sets down in subsections (1) to (5) obligations on a national contact point or a data controller in the case of an Article 7 request, to take certain actions where it comes to his or her attention that the data supplied for processing or received as a result of processing, are incorrect or are data that should not have been supplied to the national contact point or data controller concerned.  The section provides for communication of the existence of the error between the national contact points or data controllers in the states concerned, so that the data involved can be corrected, in the case of incorrect data, or destroyed in the case of data that should not have been provided in the first place.<br\/>Subsections (6) and (7) provide that data must be destroyed in any event once the time mandated by the state in which the data originated expires.  Subsection (8) provides for an exception to the requirement to destroy the data in cases where to destroy the data would be detrimental to the interests of the data subject.  Subsection (9) provides for action to be taken where a data subject contests the accuracy of data and it is not possible to establish its accuracy.<br\/>Amendment No. 25 inserts section 117 which provides for the appointment of authorised officers by the national contact points.  Authorised officers are those members of staff of the forensic science laboratory or the Garda technical bureau who will operate the systems for searching and comparing DNA and dactyloscopic data.  Authorised officers are appointed in writing and their authorisation ceases by default once they are no longer working for the national contact point to which they were appointed.  The authorisation can also be revoked by the national contact point.  The section also provides for details of the authorised officers to be provided to the Data Protection Commissioner or the data protection authority in a designated state on request.<br\/>Amendment No. 26 inserts section 118 which prescribes the requirements for the creation of records that are necessary in relation to the automated processing under Chapters 2 and 3.  The Prum decision sets down the information that needs to be recorded and the format of the records.  The purpose of these records is to facilitate the Data Protection Commissioner in monitoring and checking the security or legality of the processing of personal data.  The recorded information should include a description of the data concerned, the date and time it was supplied and a means of identifying the national contact points or authorised officers involved in the supply or receipt.<br\/>The use of these records is restricted to monitoring data protection and ensuring the data is secure.  A two year mandatory time limit applies for the retention of the records created.  The Data Protection Commissioner, for the purpose of his or her functions under the Act, shall be provided with the records on request.  There is an obligation on the national contact points to conduct random checks of the records for the purpose of ensuring the lawfulness of the supply and receipt by them of data.  I will shortly propose a similar amendment in Chapter 5 in relation to recording of Article 7 requests.<br\/>Amendments Nos. 13 and 14 are minor, technical amendments arising from the re-numbering of section 118 as section 117 and are consequential to amendment No. 25.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014031200006#E02700","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1394619000,"counter":211,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1394619000,"counter":212,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 14:<blockquote><br \/>In page 113, line 20, to delete &ldquo;<i>section 118(1)<\/i>&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;<i>section 117(1)<\/i>&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014031200007#F00300","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1394619000,"counter":213,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1394619000,"counter":214,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos. 15 to 19, inclusive, 35, 36, 39 and 40 are related and will be discussed together by agreement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014031200007#F00500","speaker":"978"},{"type":"speech","time":1394619000,"counter":215,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 15:<blockquote><br \/>In page 113, between lines 29 and 30, to insert the following:&ldquo; &ldquo;Council Framework Decision&rdquo; means Council Framework Decision 2009\/905\/JHA of 30 November 2009 on Accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote>As you indicated, Chairman, I propose to deal with amendments Nos. 15 to 19, 35, 36, 39 and 40 together.  This group of amendments arises from the need to give effect to the elements of a Council framework decision on the accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities which require legislation.  The purpose of the Council framework decision is to ensure mutual recognition by member states&rsquo; authorities of laboratory activities carried out by a forensic service provider of another member state where that provider is accredited to the required standard.  Put simply, it ensures that this State will deal only with accredited laboratories in other EU member states and equally provides assurance to other member states that Forensic Science Ireland, as it is to be known once the Bill is enacted, is accredited and meets the same exacting standards.<br\/>It is to be noted that the Prum Council decision requires member states to take the necessary measures to guarantee the integrity of DNA profiles made available or sent for comparison to other member states and to ensure that those measures comply with international standards.<\/p>  <p>Under it, as it is currently numbered in the Bill, is the overall interpretation section for this part of the Bill dealing with international co-operation.  A number of small amendments are being made to this section, arising from the inclusion of the Council framework decision on accreditation within the framework of this part of the Bill.<\/p><p> Amendments Nos. 15, 17 and 18 insert a definition of the Council framework decision and other references to it as required.  Amendment No. 16 slightly amends the definition of dactyloscopic data in order to take account of the fact that it is defined slightly differently under new provisions being introduced to give effect to the Council framework decision.  Amendment No. 19 refers to the text of the framework decision, which for convenience of reference is being appended to the Bill.  A new chapter 8, dealing with the recognition of accredited forensic science providers, is being inserted into this part.  This comprises two new sections.   Amendment No. 35 inserts section 135, relating to the interpretation of this chapter and clarifies the meaning of certain words and phrases used in the following section.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 36 inserts section 136.  It provides that the results of an accredited forensic provider carrying out laboratory activities in a member state shall be recognised by the authorities in the state which are responsible for the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences as being as reliable as the results of an accredited forensic service provider carrying out laboratory activities in the state.  The section also clarifies that the laboratory activities referred to are those that result in the generation of DNA profiles or fingerprint or palm print data.<\/p><p> I should mention that our forensic science laboratory has already the level of accreditation required under the Council framework decision.  The Garda technical bureau, which is the repository for fingerprints and palm prints, is working towards achieving this level of accreditation and aims to achieve it by the end of this year, or early next year at the latest.<\/p><p> Amendment No. 39 inserts the Council framework decision on accreditation of forensic service providers into the Bill in the form of a new Schedule 4.  The final amendment in this group, amendment No. 40, amends the Long Title of the Bill to provide for giving effect to the Council framework decision on accreditation of forensic service providers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014031200007#F00600","speaker":"1025","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394619600,"counter":217,"content":"<p>Are

Data Protection Act 1988;&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote>In addition to the data protection provisions introduced in Chapter 4, these amendments to the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 provide for the data protection requirements as set out in article 30 of the Prum Council decision insofar as that article applies to article 7 data.  Article 30 of the Prum decision requires member states to record the supply and receipt of non-automated data, namely, data which is supplied or received pursuant to a request under article 7 of Prum.  Article 7 requires member states to obtain a DNA profile where that profile is not otherwise available.  In Ireland, the obligation to record the data in accordance with article 30 will be a function of the central authority under the Mutual Assistance Act.  <br\/>Amendment No. 31 introduces a new section 79C to the Mutual Assistance Act.  In addition to specifying what information should be recorded by the central authority, the new section also sets out the purpose for which the recorded information is kept as well as the length of time for which such records must be retained.  In regard to the former, the keeping of the records is for the purpose of monitoring data protection and ensuring data security and the central authority shall, when requested, make the records available to the Data Protection Commissioner.In addition, the central authority will be required to use the records created to carry out random checks for the purpose of reviewing the lawfulness of the supply and receipt of data &ndash; comparable to an internal audit. <br\/>As for the destruction of the records, the provision requires that the records must be destroyed after two years, whereas the results of the random checks must be destroyed after 18 months.  Finally, subsection (7) of the new section ensures that any information supplied or received by a data controller, which could be the Garda Commissioner, Forensic Science Laboratory or the DPP, relating to a request pursuant to article 7 must be notified to the central authority for the purpose of maintaining the records under this section.  It is not envisaged that this would arise regularly but there are provisions in the Mutual Assistance Act which permit, in urgent cases, direct communication between, for instance, the DPP and another state.<br\/>Amendment No. 27 defines &quot;data controller&quot; by reference to the Data Protection Acts and is consequent to amendment No. 31.  Amendment No. 32 amends section 107 of the Mutual Assistance Act.  That section confirms the application of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 to mutual assistance.  That section will now be amended to confirm that the modifications to the Data Protection Acts introduced in Chapter 4 of this Bill, and which I have already spoken to, apply to requests pursuant to article 7 of the Prum Council decision.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/JUS2014031200008#G03800","speaker":"1025"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1394619600,"counter":253,"content":"<p>Amendment agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1394619600,"counter":254,"content":"<p>Section 120, as amended, agreed to.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1394620200,"counter":255,"content":"<p>NEW SECTION<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1394620200,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I move amendment No. 28:<blockquote><br \/>In page 126, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:<b>&ldquo;Amendment of section 77(5) of Act of 2008<\/b><br \/><b>121. <\/b>Section 77(5) of the Act of 2008 is amended by&mdash;<blockquote>(a) the deletion of &ldquo;and&rdquo; at the end of paragraph (b),<br \/>(b) the insertion of the following paragraph after paragraph (b):<blockquote>&ldquo;(ba) in the case of a request pursuant to Article 7 of the 2008 Council Decision, or that Article insofar as it is applied by Article 1 of the 2009 Agreement with Iceland and Norway, for the DNA profile of a person who is suspected of having committed the offence concerned whose DNA profile is not in the possession of the appropriate authority, a statement issued by the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or the Director of Public Prosecutions, as may be appropriate, confirming that the requirements for the taking of a DNA sample from the person under the law of the State would be complied with if the person were in the State, and&rdquo;.&rdquo;.<\/blockquote><\/blockquote><\/blockquote>This amendment amends section 77 of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008.

Section 122 is being amended in two places to take account of the new destruction arrangements for fingerprints, palm prints and photographs in the context of mutual assistance requests.  The amendment of section 79(1) of the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act reflects the replacement of section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 with the new destruction arrangements for fingerprints, palm prints and photographs provided for in the Bill.

Common action in the field of police cooperation under Article 30(1) (a) of the Treaty entails the need to process relevant information which should be subject to appropriate provisions on the protection of personal data.\r\n(4) The intensified exchange of information regarding forensic evidence and the increased use of evidence from one Member State in the judicial processes of another highlights the need to establish common standards for forensic service providers.\r\n(5) Information originating from forensic processes in one Member State may currently be associated with a level of uncertainty in another Member State regarding the way in which an item has been handled, what methods have been used and how the results have been interpreted.\r\n(6) In point 3.4(h) of the Council and Commission Action Plan implementing The Hague Programme on strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union Member States stressed the need for a definition of the quality standards of forensic laboratories by 2008.\r\n(7) It is particularly important to introduce common standards for forensic service providers relating to such sensitive personal data as DNA profiles and dactyloscopic data.\r\n(8) Pursuant to Article 7(4) of Council Decision 2008\/616\/JHA of 23 June 2008 on the implementation of Decision 2008\/615\/JHA on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime, Member States shall take the necessary measures to guarantee the integrity of DNA profiles made available or sent for comparison to other Member States and to ensure that these measures comply with international standards, such as EN ISO\/IEC 17025 &lsquo;General requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories&rsquo; (hereinafter &lsquo;EN ISO\/IEC 17025&rsquo;).\r\n(9) DNA profiles and dactyloscopic data are not only used in criminal proceedings but are also crucial for the identification of victims, particularly after disasters.\r\n(10) The accreditation of forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities is an important step towards a safer and more effective exchange of forensic information within the Union.\r\n(11) Accreditation is granted by the national accreditation body which has exclusive competence to assess if a laboratory meets the requirements set by harmonised standards. An accreditation body derives its authority from the State. Regulation (EC) No 765\/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting out the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products contains detailed provisions on the competence of such national accreditation bodies. Inter alia, Article 7 of that Regulation regulates cross-border accreditation in cases where accreditation may be requested from another national accreditation body.\r\n(12) The absence of an agreement to apply a common accreditation standard for the analysis of scientific evidence is a deficiency that should be remedied; it is, therefore, necessary to adopt a legally binding instrument on the accreditation of all forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities. Accreditation offers the necessary guarantees that laboratory activities are performed in accordance with relevant international standards, in particular EN ISO\/IEC 17025, as well as relevant applicable guidelines.\r\n(13) An accreditation standard allows any Member State to require, if it wishes, complementary standards in laboratory activities within its national jurisdiction.\r\n(14) Accreditation will help establish mutual trust in the validity of the basic analytic methods used. However, accreditation does not state which method to use, only that the method used has to be suitable for its purpose.\r\n(15) Any measure taken outside a laboratory is beyond the scope of this Framework Decision. For example, the taking of dactyloscopic data or measures taken at the scene of incident, the scene of crime or forensic analyses carried out outside laboratories are not included in its scope.\r\n(16) This Framework Decision does not aim to harmonise national rules regarding the judicial assessment of forensic evidence.\r\n(17) This Decision does not affect the validity, established in accordance with national applicable rules, of the results of laboratory activities carried out prior to its implementation, even if the forensic service provider was not accredited to comply with EN ISO\/IEC 17025,HAS ADOPTED THIS FRAMEWORK DECISION:Article 1\r\nObjective1. The purpose of this Framework Decision is to ensure that the results of laboratory activities carried out by accredited forensic service providers in one Member State are recognised by the authorities responsible for the prevention, detection and investigation of criminal offences as being equally reliable as the results of laboratory activities carried out by forensic service providers accredited to EN ISO\/IEC 17025 within any other Member State.\r\n2. This purpose is achieved by ensuring that forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities are accredited by a national accreditation body as complying with EN ISO\/IEC 17025.Article 2\r\nScopeThis Framework Decision shall apply to laboratory activities resulting in:(a) DNA-profile; and\r\n(b) dactyloscopic data.Article 3\r\nDefinitionsFor the purposes of this Framework Decision:(a) &lsquo;laboratory activity&rsquo; means any measure taken in a laboratory when locating and recovering traces on items, as well as developing, analysing and interpreting forensic evidence, with a view to providing expert opinions or exchanging forensic evidence;\r\n(b) &lsquo;results of laboratory activities&rsquo; means any analytical outputs and directly associated interpretation;\r\n(c) &lsquo;forensic service provider&rsquo; means any organisation, public or private, that carries out forensic laboratory activities at the request of competent law enforcement or judicial authorities;\r\n(d) &lsquo;national accreditation body&rsquo; means the sole body in a Member State that performs accreditation with authority derived from the State as referred to in Regulation (EC) No 765\/2008;\r\n(e) &lsquo;DNA-profile&rsquo; means a letter or number code which represents a set of identification characteristics of the non-coding part of an analysed human DNA sample, i.e. the particular molecular structure at the various DNA locations (loci);\r\n(f) &lsquo;dactyloscopic data&rsquo; means fingerprint images, images of fingerprint latents, palm prints, palm print latents and templates of such images (coded minutiae).Article 4\r\nAccreditationMember States shall ensure that their forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities are accredited by a national accreditation body as complying with EN ISO\/IEC 17025.Article 5\r\nRecognition of results1. Each Member State shall ensure that the results of accredited forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities in other Member States are recognised by its authorities responsible for the prevention, detection, and investigation of criminal offences as being equally reliable as the results of domestic forensic service providers carrying out laboratory activities accredited to EN ISO\/IEC 17025.\r\n2. This Framework Decision does not affect national rules on the judicial assessment of evidence.Article 6\r\nCosts1. Each Member State shall bear any public costs resulting from this Framework Decision in accordance with national arrangements.\r\n2. The Commission shall examine the means to provide financial support from the general budget of the European Union for national and transnational projects intended to contribute to the implementation of this Framework Decision, inter alia for the exchange of experience, dissemination of know-how and proficiency testing.Article 7\r\nImplementation1. Member States shall take the necessary steps to comply with the provisions of this Framework Decision in relation to DNA-profiles by 30 November 2013.\r\n2.

This is the most important legislation that will be enacted during this D&aacute;il&rsquo;s lifetime.  It will provide assistance for members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the investigation of crime and bringing individuals before the courts who have committed crimes.  It will ensure maximum use is made of identification evidence.  It will also ensure that where an allegation is made, an individual cannot be wrongly convicted.  The existence of DNA databases in other countries has proved during the years to be of great assistance in identifying instances of miscarriage of justice.  This will be an important tool in helping An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in fighting crime.  In putting in place the required resources it is important that we can fully co-operate with other European Union colleagues in the fight against international crime.  It will ensure those involved in cross-border crime will know there is the maximum co-operation between police forces across Europe and that we can access information held in other member states.<\/p><p>  I pay tribute to my officials and those from the Office of the Attorney General who have done enormous work in the preparation of the Bill and the drafting of crucial amendments.  It is complex legislation, but it is also human rights legislation as it seeks to ensure victims of crime know we have the necessary 21st century and state-of-the-art facilities in Forensic Science Ireland to facilitate investigations.  It also reflects the human rights judgments and jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in this area in that information will be properly used and retained and destroyed when no longer required.<\/p><p>  I pay tribute to those who work in Forensic Science Ireland who do tremendous work.  It is given very limited public recognition, but the work it does is crucial and central to the investigation of crime.  Its work in seeking to ensure the necessary infrastructure and expertise are in place to provide for the DNA database is of great importance.  DNA evidence is used extensively in the investigation of crime and has proved to be extremely useful in identifying the perpetrators of crime.  A DNA database will be a significantly important additional tool for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is, therefore, in the public interest that this legislation e enacted.  I hope it will be through both Houses before the summer break.<\/p><p>  I appreciate that much of what have we dealt with today is complex and technical.  It is important in enacting legislation that we update related criminal law legislation to ensure consistency of approach to DNA profiling and samples, fingerprints, photographs, etc.  We have gone through this complex legislation with great speed.

We have received correspondence from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but I do not think it addresses all the points raised by Dr. Horgan.  He referred in particular to a High Court judgment in 2003 which found Ireland to be in breach of international laws on neutrality.  The State took no action on foot of that judgment.  He also makes charges that garda&iacute; at Shannon Airport were instructed, on the advice of the Attorney General, not to search these aircraft and that complaints made by activists at Shannon were not acted on.  That is a serious charge.  We should invite Dr. Horgan and the other petitioners to appear before us to expand on their petition and, perhaps, ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to address the issues raised and clarify whether previous Ministers for Foreign Affairs ever gave permission for extraordinary rendition flights, transfers of prisoners or commercial aircraft to be used in ways that are contrary to our neutrality laws, and whether exemptions were granted for flights carrying arms, ammunition or explosives.

I represent the Vintage Veteran Trucks Association in Ireland which has a wide membership across the country.  We are involved in the important restoration of vintage veteran trucks and trailers.  We restore them to their original condition and participate in a number of social events throughout the year for the purpose of showing our restored vehicles and raising money for various charities.  Our vehicles are restored to the highest standards with due care and attention to safety standards.  They are only used for social and domestic purposes; they are not commercial vehicles.  We enjoy reduced vintage insurance premia and our vehicles are classed as vintage veteran vehicles for the purposes of road tax at the reduced rate.<\/p><p>  In 2012 we became aware that there was new legislation, the Road Safety Authority (Commercial Vehicle Roadworthiness) Act 2012, under which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport could make regulations for the testing of vehicles and provide for exemptions from testing for certain vehicles.  We wrote to the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, in September 2012 requesting that when he made regulations, he exempt our vintage veteran vehicles from roadworthiness testing.  We further became aware that he had made regulations, SI 347 of 2013, providing for an exemption for pre-1980 motor caravans, but he did not provide for the exemption of our vehicles, as requested.  In January 2014 we again wrote to him requesting that he include our vehicles in the regulations.  We received a reply from the Road Safety Authority stating that as these vehicles could be used for commercial purposes, they had to be tested.  We again wrote to the Minister in February to point out that our vehicles were not commercial vehicles and that they were only used for social and domestic purposes.  We provided him with a suggested text to amend the regulations to exclude pre-1980 vintage vehicles.<\/p>  <p>We received an acknowledgement stating a further reply would issue.  We have not received a further update.<\/p><p> I also attach for the committee's information a submission made to the Minister which sets out the reasons we consider our vehicles should be exempt from roadworthiness testing.

Irish Veteran and Vintage Car Club Limited, IVVCC, was formed in 1963 to cater for owners of veteran and vintage vehicles and enthusiasts who did not possess vehicles.  We are happy to come before the committee to support the Vintage Veteran Trucks Association in Ireland, one of our affiliated clubs.  The IVVCC's mission statement is to be the voice, custodian and facilitator of the historic vehicle movement in Ireland; to promote and facilitate the preservation, ownership, appreciation and use of historic vehicles; to promote public awareness of the historic vehicle movement; and to protect the regulatory environment affecting the use of historic vehicles.<br\/>In 2013 the Irish Veteran and Vintage Car Club celebrated 50 years, which is an achievement for any voluntary or community-based organisation.  We now boast a membership of approximately 650, with more than 47 affiliated clubs nationwide.  Most importantly, the IVVCC is the national representative of the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale des V&eacute;hicules Anciens, FIVA, which is a worldwide organisation.  FIVA has more than 85 member organisations in 62 countries and represents more than 1.5 million historic vehicle enthusiasts.  Its motto is &quot;Yesterday's vehicles on tomorrow's roads&quot;.  In January 2013 it enacted the Turin Charter, a policy paper designated to &quot;preserve and safeguard the history of vehicles including their engineering, form, functions, and documented histories and their many and diverse relationships with society and social environments&quot;.<br\/>It is important to point to the history of self-propelled goods vehicles which dates back to Cugnot's steam dray of 1769 and which long pre-dates that of the passenger car.  While the preservation of historic cars can be challenging and often expensive, the preservation of goods vehicles is far more challenging and expensive.  Most goods vehicles clocked up considerably more mileage than private motor cars; consequently, few of them remain today.  Many were on the road for ten or more hours a day during their business usage.<br\/>Apart from the greater use made of these vehicles in their day, the storage problem associated with their preservation is a major inhibiting factor in their preservation.  It is imperative that an historic vehicle be kept under cover and protected from the elements, as otherwise they will deteriorate very quickly.  This is particularly challenging in the case of larger vehicles such as those preserved by members of the Vintage Veteran Trucks Association in Ireland.  It is important that these vehicles be preserved for posterity as they are a very important part of our social history.  Many preserved goods vehicles are painted and display sign writing in the livery of the owner's business by way of advertisement which emphasises long-established businesses.  Examples of such livery can be seen in the IVVCC centenary publication, <i>Historic Motoring in Ireland, <\/i>which was published last year.<br\/>The value of preserving goods vehicles can be seen in the social or industrial history these vehicles recall.  Some have been restored in the livery of certain utilities, recalling projects such as rural electrification, the postal service of bygone decades, some of our defunct industries and agricultural infrastructure such as the old creamery network.  Many are displayed at static shows where there is a charity fundraising dimension, while the heritage they recall has an educational value for adults and children.<br\/>I would like to address the definition of historic vehicles.  The IVVCC and FIVA consider all mechanically propelled vehicles manufactured more than 30 years ago to be historic vehicles, the only exception being vehicles designed to run on tracks such as trains.  This clearly includes cars, motorcycles, goods vehicles and passenger busses.  FIVA's administration office is based in Brussels and iactively engaged in monitoring new regulations which might have an effect on the use of historic vehicles.  In this context, it is relevant to bring to the attention of the committee the outcome of several months of discussions between FIVA and the relevant European institutions.  At the end of December 2013 the European Council and the European Parliament reached agreement on the proposal to revise the roadworthiness testing directive.  The committee should note the agreement text has yet to be formally adopted by the two institutions.  This is scheduled to take place in the first quarter of 2014.  FIVA understand the agreement will define vehicles of historic interest as any vehicle considered to be historic by the member state of registration or one of its appointed authorising bodies and which fulfils all of the following conditions: it was manufactured or registered for the first time at least 30 years ago; its specific type, as defined in national or EU law, is no longer in production; and it is historically preserved and maintained in its original state and has not sustained substantial changes in the technical characteristics of its main components.  This definition clearly includes goods vehicles over 30 years old.  It is the view of FIVA and the IVVCC that historic goods vehicles should be treated no differently from other historic vehicles in respect of roadworthiness testing.<br\/>I would like to provide the committee with some basic statistics for the use of historic vehicles.  Historic vehicle-related activity is worth &euro;16 billion to the European Union annually.  More than 70% of historic vehicles travel less than 1,500 km per year and anecdotal evidence indicates historic goods vehicles are likely to travel less than half of this figure.  A total of 29% of historic vehicle owners have a household income of less than &euro;30,000 per year and 78% of historic vehicles are valued at less than &euro;15,000.  These statistics are derived from a 2006 survey conducted by FIVA in 11 EU countries, including Ireland.  FIVA is undertaking a similar research project this year which will be launched on 26 March in 15 EU countries.<\/p>  <p>I have copies of that to make available to the committee.<\/p><p> In conclusion the IVVCC asks the committee to recommend that the legislation be amended to ensure that all historic vehicles be treated in the same manner in all respects including the exemption from roadworthiness testing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200004#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peadar Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394617800,"counter":351,"content":"<p>Mr. Ward has clearly outlined the case for support of his fellow colleagues.

I was not aware that the matter raised in the communications was an issue for vintage vehicles.  I am familiar with the charitable work they do.  I proposed that both groups would come before the committee to set out their stall, giving them an opportunity to present it in public.  The Joint Committee on Transport and Communications is televised and it gives us an opportunity to highlight what has happened.  If I were benign, I might say it was an oversight, but if it was not an oversight, I am concerned as to the reason this has been allowed to happen.  The groups play a central role in public events in maintaining and preserving heritage.  Their work feeds into education in terms of teaching the current generation about the practices and engineering of the past.  They provide wonderful entertainment to so many people and they play an integral role in festivals which generate local economic activity.  It is clear that they play a part in the domestic tourism sector.  I hope that the exemption they are looking for will be extended.  Quite clearly, the vehicles are used for social and domestic outings, largely for pleasure.  Many of the vehicles that I am familiar with are taken on low loaders to events around the country,  The vehicles are not driven for long distances, such is the interest in preserving them.  They are not driven at high speeds or put through any work routine.  I fail to see why the exemption cannot be extended.  I will make a proposal that the committee encourages the Minister to put in place the appropriate exemption by way of statutory instrument to meet the needs of the Irish Veteran and Vintage Car Club and the Vintage Veteran Trucks Association.  I know the Department has indicated that it will review of the statutory instrument.  In my view that is too far down the road.  It would be more appropriate to deal with it and have the vehicle class included in the overall exemption.  When one considers that it includes motor caravans and tractors, I would have thought a logical extension would be the trucks that the VVTA so carefully maintain and protect for posterity.

I do not know the reason that the proposal that was put by both groups to the Minister, which seems reasonable, was not accepted.  I do not fully understand that.

However, I cannot figure it out.<\/p><p>  I will support Deputy Dooley's amendment.  Far from relying on a review in 2013, if I were a vintage car, truck or commercial vehicle owner, I would be a little bit weary of what will come down the tracks in 2015.  I do not understand the logic of treating trucks and commercial vehicles differently from vintage cars and I believe their request is reasonable.

As members will be aware many EU directives differ from country to country so one cannot say the same approach is taken in every country.  For the most part there is no differentiation between goods vehicles and other historic vehicles in EU countries.  They are not treated differently.  For the most part, vehicles over 30 years old are not subjected to roadworthiness testing in most European countries.  The current directive being discussed at EU level will propose that vehicles over 30 years old will not be subject to roadworthiness testing.<\/p>  <p>Having said that, this will be a directive rather than a regulation that each member state will decide how to implement.  <\/p><p> Deputy Harrington asked about the vehicle safety and so on and I shall point out two particular things in that regard.  First, the people who own an historic goods vehicle, motorbike or passenger car are enthusiasts who are interested in preserving the vehicle and its history for posterity.  It is rare to ask an enthusiast what type of car or truck he or she owns because inevitably he or she will own more than one as.  It is like a disease.  People will want to collect more and become very enthusiastic about them.<\/p><p> My next point is particularly relevant to insurance.  Mr. Kinneen referred to the fact that owners of these trucks can avail of special rates of insurance and the same applies to historic cars.  The insurance rate is very competitive because the vehicles are a good risk for a couple of reasons.  First, they are maintained to a very high standard.  Second, the number of kilometres or hours that they spend on the road is limited.  I have drawn attention to the fact that the last FIVA survey showed that 15,000 km was the average mileage for cars and all historical vehicles.  In fact, it is considerably less for goods vehicles because they are not driven on the roads. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200005#G00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peadar Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394618400,"counter":359,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Ward saying that there are no claims on them or a minimum number?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200006#H00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394618400,"counter":360,"content":"<p>It is almost unknown.

I must declare an interest in this matter.  One of the speakers spoke about the delivery of vehicles and the way in which they turned out.  My brother is actively involved in restoring the vehicles with one of the representatives present.<\/p><p>  Under the regulations, the suggested changes intend to superimpose a modern standard on an old vehicle and, therefore, detract from the character of a vehicle.  Let us contrast that with the manner in which the Department of Defence beautifully restored the armoured car called the Sliabh na mBan a couple of years ago.  It is sent around the country and does a great deal of charity and community work on behalf of the Department.  Let us consider the type of wing mirrors that the authorities want installed on some of the vehicles with what the gentleman and lady before us advocated as being suitable.  It would detract from the character of the vehicle if, for argument's sake, the Department of Defence sought to have the standards associated with modern military vehicles imposed on the Sliabh na mBan.  People would not be enthusiastic for something like that to happen.  <\/p><p>  Even though I have the details I would like the delegations to tell me what changes would be made to the vehicles if the regulations were left unchallenged. <\/p><p>  I wish to point out another important matter.  The associations have sought a meeting with the Minister and his officer is considering their offer.  Deputy Dooley has recommended the best course of action.  I urge that common sense should prevail.  We are being asked to superimpose modern regulations on vehicles that were not designed for such a purpose.  Pre-1980 cars are not required to have seatbelts on the back seat for the very good reason that such cars were not built with them and the same should apply to these vehicles.  They are used primarily for social and leisure purposes.  I am not aware of anybody hauling barrels of Guinness up and down the quays in Dublin in a 1940s truck and that is what this matter boils down to.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200006#H00500","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1394618400,"counter":363,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegations here today and thank them for their excellent presentations.

A great debt is owed to them and to the companies who have invested in the preservation and exhibition of commercial goods vehicles that were used in the past.  The vehicles will be very evident and visible in the coming week and on St. Patrick's weekend in the parades.  They will be a highlight for many people.<\/p><p>  The delegations made a logical request which the Government should co-operate and comply with.  The amendment suggested by Deputy Dooley is an immediate amendment to SI 347 of 2013 and includes goods vehicles first registered on or after 1 January 1980 and used only for social and domestic purposes; and goods trailers first registered on or after 1January 1980 and used only for social and domestic purposes.  It allows for a  similar testing frequency for post-1980 veteran trucks and trailers as per the regulations for motor caravans.  That is section 6, SI 347 of 2013, and that was from the Irish Vintage Veteran Trucks Association.  We need to adapt and implement the amendment in order to move it forward.  It is a very small request in view of the importance of such vehicles. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200006#H00600","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1394618400,"counter":364,"content":"<p>I welcome the delegations.

It is like the Department of Health telling a sportsperson that he or she is not allowed to play a game unless he or she proves fitness.  A coach will know whether the person is fit enough to play.

The contribution that they and their fellow enthusiasts make is massive because if the work of restoring vehicles had not been done in the past, we would have lost a very valuable part of our heritage.  In my area John Mitchell and his family have given a lifetime to restoring lorries, trucks, motorbikes and other vehicles which will be handed down to the children in the future  <\/p><p>  I agree with Deputy Timmy Dooley's suggestion.  A strong message must be sent from this meeting to the Minister that we respect the work the Road Safety Authority and similar bodies have done.  However, there is such a thing as going over the top and not having common sense and realising a vintage truck that has been restored should not have to comply with the same regulations as a truck that leaves Cork every day for Dublin with a full load and repeats the journey twice or three times daily.  Where is the common sense in what the Minister has proposed?  If a Minister does not have common sense, surely the officials in his or her Department have it.  Somewhere along the line somebody has to realise it is not right to put the vehicles of the associations' members through the roadworthiness test.  There are many individuals who have restored one or two vehicles who are not members of any club.  We are here to speak on their behalf also because they will be adversely affected by what the Minister is proposing.  Common sense will have to prevail.  Of course, there would have to be an amendment to the legislation to provide for an exemption for trucks, cars, motorbikes and any other vintage vehicle.  While we want all vehicles to be safe, at the same time one cannot ask people to ensure an old vehicle complies with the regulations of today.  It just does not and cannot work.  It is very important that the Chairman has invited the delegation to appear before the committee.  The Minister and his officials will have to wake up and take note of the delegations' concerns.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200007#J00600","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394619000,"counter":374,"content":"<p>Everybody knows when he or she steps outside the door that there is an issue with health and safety.  Many of the events we attend are not necessarily organised by us, but we have a duty of care in arriving at somebody else's show and have a shared responsibility so far as health and safety issues are concerned.  Historically, up until 1980, similar to cars and motorbikes, we always enjoyed an exemption from testing.  From our point of view, there is no reason to change that exemption provision because nothing adverse has happened, although I know we hear about a tragedy here and there.  The way some insurance companies approach the issue initially in respect of older vehicles is by asking for an engineer's report on a vehicle that has been restored.  In other words, as this is the first time the vehicle has been insured and there is no history available, the insurance company will ask for an engineer's report.  Prior to NCT-type testing an insurance company would have had an agent who would have tested the vehicle.  There are still engineers available who could conduct such a test.  It is more like a visual test, perhaps, involving a smoke test, but it does not carry the regulatory burden attached to a full DOE commercial test.  I do not see why something along these lines could not done, say, every five years.  When a vehicle was being put on the road initially, it would have to be certified.  That would be reasonable.<\/p><p>  Some issues arise from the point of view of health and safety.  In modern trucks, as the tyres are nearest to the road, it is vital that they be correct, have the E mark and be stamp-dated.  There are many tyres that were produced prior to the introduction of E-marking and date-stamping which are still perfectly good and serviceable.  As responsible owners of vintage vehicles participating in runs, we are not going to put bad tyres on a vehicle, but at the same time we do not want to use ultra-modern tyres because many of them do not fit and do not look right.  An insurance policy usually provides for limited mileage.  That there is a reduced tax rate reflects the fact that they are rarely used.  An engineer's report would address the health and safety issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200007#J00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Alan Doyle"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394619000,"counter":375,"content":"<p>One of the problems, if one submits vehicles to a testing regime, is the lack of flexibility to take account of vehicles built 30, 40, 50, 60, 80 or 90 years ago.  Some members of the Irish Veteran Vintage Club have experienced difficulties.  A number of them had vintage cars for hire for weddings.  For that purpose they had to be licensed as either hackneys or limousines and were required to be submitted for annual testing.  The difficulty was that facilities were not in place to test them.  The type of test proposed initially could not be undertaken.  For example, one of the tests carried out at an NCT centre on a modern car is carried out on the body.  If the same test was conducted on a vehicle such as a 1920s or 1930s Rolls Royce, it would simply break it.  The facilities to carry out that type of test are not in place.  Many of these trucks might be on the road twice or three times a year and the fourth time they are put on the road it is to take them to have a test carried out.<\/p>  <p>There is a lack of logic in doing this.<\/p><p> The other issue concerns whether tests could be abused.  It would make absolutely no commercial sense to use an historic truck for commercial purposes.  Irrespective of the cost of maintenance and fuel, nobody would use one as one would be losing money.  <\/p><p> Deputy Michael Healy-Rae mentioned Morris Minors.  About 20 years ago there were those who were starting to use a vehicle such as a Morris Minor as a second car because they might have been able to tax it cheaply.  This practice has declined completely because it makes no commercial sense.  One can buy a 15 year old Nissan, Toyota or Ford that is perfectly good, costs a lot less to run and is much more reliable than a 40 year old Morris Minor.  What has happened in the economy has ruled out the practice for cars and it has certainly been ruled out as a possibility in the case of trucks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200007#J00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Peadar Ward","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394619600,"counter":377,"content":"<p>I thank both delegates for their presentations.

I am retail operations director of An Post.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Liam Sheehan, director of sales and marketing.  Our appearance is timely and welcome, given the debate of recent weeks on the future of the national post office network.<\/p><p>  In recent years we have had a number of interactions with the committee and much of what I will outline in my opening remarks will be familiar to members.  Let me start by saying An Post does not have a plan or proposal to close post offices, nor is it part of our business strategy to allow post offices to close by stealth.  In fact, the opposite is actually true.  We continue to invest heavily in the retail business.<\/p><p>  As Mr. Connell, the chief executive, previously told the committee, the size of the post office network is crucial to our commercial agenda and its very scale allows us to service our customers&rsquo; needs across the country.  Scale is a key factor in our retaining and winning more business.  It is worth repeating that the reach of our network has attracted business as diverse as bill payment and banking services for major organisations, the provision of social welfare payments, savings, foreign exchange and retail products such as PostFone and gift vouchers.  Our analysis, using our geodirectory data, shows that 99% of addresses in the country are within 10 km of a post office and that 93% are within 5 km.  In the recent contract we signed with the Department of Social Protection the Department specified that outlets must be available within 3 km of 95% of customers in an urban area and within 15 km of 95% of customers in a rural area.  The post office network comfortably exceeds these requirements.<\/p>  <p>The post office network is the largest retail network in Ireland.  We handle some 1.7 million customer visits to post offices nationwide each week.  We have 1,147 offices nationwide, 57 of which are operated directly by An Post, with the remainder run by independent retailers - postmasters - as contractors.  Postmasters are largely paid based on the level of business they perform and they have benefitted well from the increase in business in the last number of years.<\/p><p> We run this network in a business environment that is tough both for us and, perhaps most importantly, for all of our customers.  We trade in difficult conditions, not least of which has been a sharp decline in mail volumes.<\/p><p> In the past few years, we have introduced a number of new products, some of which, such as our foreign exchange, FX, business, are very successful.  We started with foreign exchange cash and last year enhanced the service through the introduction of sterling and US dollar PostFX cards.  We are actively looking at introducing further currencies based on feedback from our customers.  We estimate that we have more than 30% of the consumer foreign exchange market after only three years in the business.  This is an illustration of the type of sustainable business we are seeking to introduce in the post office network.<\/p><p> We have continued to expand our banking business with AIB and Danske Bank, the latter of which, unfortunately, is withdrawing from personal banking this year, and we are talking to other financial institutions about extending the service.<\/p><p> In 2013, we grew the State savings funds, on behalf of NTMA, by another &euro;1.9 billion.  This demonstrates the trust our customers have in these products and in the An Post brand and the post office network.  We have also introduced dedicated insurance zones in a number of larger post offices where customers can get quotes for their motor, home and travel insurance needs or for life assurance.  In post offices where these zones are not present, customers can provide their details and our call centre will contact them directly to discuss their insurance needs.<\/p><p> The provision of Government services is a key part of what we do.  The breakdown of retail income is as follows: mail services, 15%; Department of Social Protection services, 29%; the successful State savings products, 27%; bill payments on behalf of local authorities and energy and other utilities, 10%; licence services, 6%; money transmission, including foreign exchange, 7%; and the remaining 6% is accounted for by banking and other services, such as gift vouchers.  It can be clearly seen from these figures that the network is dependent on revenue from the two key Government contracts, the Department of Social Protection and the NTMA, which together directly account for 56% of revenues in the retail business of An Post.<\/p><p> We were recently successful in retaining the Department of Social Protection cash payments business by winning the tender for these services.  This contract is for two years and can be extended for up to another four years.  Retaining this contract was critical because, as we have previously told the committee, the DSP business is a significant part of our activity and our revenue.  DSP clients, as well as collecting their welfare payments, are major users of other services at post offices, such as bill payments, savings, mobile top-up and money transmission.  The winning of this contract provides certainty for the foreseeable future to welfare clients who receive their payments in cash at their local post offices.<\/p><p> We are aware that the Department of Social Protection is moving through a phase of significant transformation aimed at delivering more modern and efficient services to their clients and providing value for taxpayers and the economy.  This transformation includes moving to electronic payments and bank accounts over the coming years.<\/p><p> An Post is determined, within the context of a workable business model, to further develop products in order to compete for any future tenders.  We believe that An Post and post offices can play a major part in the area of financial inclusiveness in the future.  As leaders in the development and application of post office counter technology, we will continue to innovate and invest in next-generation systems and products to ensure we can continue to meet the needs of the Department and our other current and future corporate customers.  We have demonstrated, through our links to the AIB and Danske Bank systems among others, our ability to perform efficient transaction processing on behalf of many clients.  We note the publication by the financial inclusion working group of the report on the standard bank account, which lists, in the group's view, the key elements required for a successful national roll-out of this type of bank account.  One of these listed elements is that there must be greater involvement by the credit unions and An Post to have the best possible channel for reaching the target cohorts, in particular, making the standard bank account available through the credit unions or An Post.  We welcome the opportunity to discuss the potential business in this area that can be undertaken in post offices nationwide.<\/p><p> There is much discussion about financial inclusiveness and the cashless society.  An Post supports the Government's programmes, and in this regard we believe we can play a major part in ensuring their success.  Many of those without bank accounts currently use the post office as their preferred location for the management of their finances, including collecting their social welfare entitlements; paying their bills, many on a part-payment basis; saving through the Post Office Savings Bank for important family events such as first communions and Christmas; topping up their mobile phones; buying gift vouchers as gifts; obtaining foreign currency when travelling abroad; and using our postal money order, sterling draft and Western Union services if they want to send money either nationally or abroad.  Many citizens are nervous about banks, bank charges and direct debits, and by using our services they can manage their money efficiently in a cost-effective manner.<\/p><p> In addition to providing additional services to our customers, we continue to invest in the network in other ways.  In recent years we have invested significantly in updating our security, with additional alarms, CCTV, etc.  This is to ensure that staff, postmasters, their staff and our customers can conduct their business in a safe and secure environment.  We also continue to invest in significant marketing of our post office network and the products we provide.<\/p><p> We are continually looking at our service standards and the standards of our post offices.  I am sure many members will have seen significant improvements in many offices around the country.  We have opened new offices in City West in Dublin and Glencar in Letterkenny, both of which are performing well.  Recently, we reopened an office in Terenure in Dublin.  In the past two years, we have renovated or relocated almost 80 post offices.  These include offices such as Newcastle West in Limerick, Walkinstown and Malahide in Dublin, Gracedieu in Waterford and Ballisodare in Sligo.  Customers all around the country are reacting favourably to these improvements and this is evidenced by increased sales and activity in these post offices.<\/p><p> A good example is our office in Blackpool in Cork, which was relocated about this time last year.  Customers have reacted favourably, so much so that on Sunday last this office was named as the Customer Plus Post Office of the Year for 2013, based on the increase in sales and the improved customer service offering.  I take this opportunity to again congratulate it and all of the other post offices which have invested in new or improved offices and have seen their business increase as a result.<\/p><p> We undertake mystery shopping on a monthly basis at 300 of our busiest offices.  This is done on our behalf by an internationally recognised organisation in this field.  In the last number of years, we have seen an increase in the scores given for customer service.  Just as importantly, we have seen an increase in our net promoter score, which is measured by the mystery shopper's willingness to recommend the office to family and friends; this increased by 11 percentage points in 2013.  This is further evidence of the strength of the post office network and the level of customers' trust and satisfaction in us.<\/p><p> Much of the network was developed at a time when Ireland was a very different place and, like so many organisations, it has not been immune to the considerable social and economic changes in the country.  Over the years we have seen a reduction in the number of post offices, reflecting decisions by local contractors to leave the business.  In many instances, this decision has been prompted by a belief that local levels of business are no longer sustainable as their customers choose to shop in other locations.  In large part, we have worked to maintain the network at something approaching its current level of coverage.  However, from time to time one of our contractors may decide to retire or pursue other business opportunities and terminate his or her contract with us.  There are also circumstances in which contractors die, or in rare circumstances we terminate a contract as a result of irregularities in the running of an office.<\/p>  <p>In these cases we assess the need for the retention of the office in question, and if we are of the view that services should continue in that location we will advertise the contract as usual.  In cases in which we determine that we can serve our customers just as effectively at our other post offices, we notify this to the local communities, we seek comments from interested parties and we then consider any inputs before making a decision.  This was a process that we put in place following my last visit to this committee.  During this process we take into account the following parameters: national network coverage, because we need to maintain the geographical national network spread; business levels; customer access; the requirements of our mail delivery service; and the capacity of neighbouring offices to satisfactorily handle the business that would be transferred to them.  I stress that it is the viability of the overall network that is important to us in reaching any decision.<\/p><p> The drive for change and improvement must continue and we must have the flexibility to add new goods and services as we work to maintain the network.  We must also continue to take decisions on a commercial basis so that our costs match our revenues.<\/p><p> As I outlined, there is much that we already do in acting as the trusted intermediary between the State and its citizens, who are our customers, and there is more that we can do.  It is in no one's interest to talk down the future of post office network or talk up the challenges we face.  We are very clear about the impact of change and the challenges we face but we are confident in our ability to deliver new services and adapt.  All new business has to be done in a sustainable way.<\/p><p> We welcome the huge level of goodwill towards the post office network and our staff, as evidenced by the debate in recent weeks.  We were also heartened by the level of support for the post office network during last week's D&aacute;il debate.  We particularly welcome the Government's motion, which endorses a whole-of-government consideration of the issue, proposes the post office network as a \"front office of government\", and encourages the maintenance of the post office network at the heart of national and local community life.  <\/p><p> We have proven that we have the capacity, technology and flexibility to process multiple services for our customers.  We have shown the ambition to grow our business.  We are ready, as always, to work with the Government, postmasters and our customers and business partners to generate extra business for our post offices and ensure the success of the national post office network.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200008#K01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394620800,"counter":390,"content":"<p>Before I call the members, I have a few questions for Mr. Daly.  As he said, this issue has been highlighted at this committee and during a debate on a Private Members' motion in recent weeks.  To set the platform for the debate today and the questions members may have, we have heard during the debate in recent weeks that everyone - An Post, the Irish Postmasters' Union, the Minister and the communities - wants to retain the post offices and the post office network, but at the same time there is a great deal of crossfire from all the different groups.  They all say they want to retain the post office network, but everyone is blaming everyone else for the reason it is under threat.  That is a summary of the debate so far.<br\/>When representatives of the Irish Postmasters' Union appeared before the committee two weeks ago, they spoke about all of the major stakeholders engaging in a period of a consultation or negotiation, as there has not been meaningful consultation.  They would say it is<i>a fait accompli<\/i>when there is engagement between An Post and the IPU; in other words, that there has not been meaningful negotiation.  I believe I am reflecting what they said in that respect.  I would be interested to hear Mr. Daly's comments on that.  <br\/>Another big issue that arose in the debate in recent weeks is the partnership between An Post and Tesco in recent times.  I believe there is a pilot partnership between the two.  Mr. Daly might comment on that.  It is happening, but does it not conflict with or dilute the service that the post office offers?  While it is slightly different in large urban areas, if the post office service in Swinford, a town of a few thousand people in my own constituency, went into the Tesco branch in the town, it would destroy the business of the local post office.  That would be a major issue locally.<br\/>Mr. Daly mentioned that following his last visit to the committee An Post had changed its consultation process with communities in regard to their local post offices.  As he will be aware, we had a report that pushed hard for that.  I was pushing at the time for something more than that.  The major stakeholders are the communities.  There are allegations that even though consultation takes place, at the end of the day sometimes the decision is made without reference to that.  I am only saying what is reflected in what we hear.  Could this be taken a stage further - that is, if a worrying trend was developing in an area, could the community be offered the opportunity to demonstrate over a trial period that it wanted to keep its post office?  I would like to get Mr. Daly's observation on that suggestion.<br\/>Mr. Daly mentioned that An Post is in discussion with banks and so on, because the issue of banking facilities arose.  I believe it is in discussion with Ulster Bank.  He might comment on that.<br\/>Another issue reflected in the recent debate was that the post offices have delivered efficient services in the provision of passports, property tax collection and so on.  I would like to hear Mr. Daly's ideas on how such services could be expanded.  <br\/>A further issue is the contracts with postmasters.  Are the contracts for five years?  Has there been consultation on that?  In the past a post office could be passed on to a family member, but I believe that practice has finished.  Those issues are causing concern on the ground.  There are a fair few points there and Mr. Daly might comment on those before I call the members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200010#M00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394620800,"counter":391,"content":"<p>I will comment on some of those points and I will ask Mr. Liam Sheehan to comment on the others.  We continue to engage with the IPU.  Its members might get a little frustrated at times that we do not engage with them as early as they might like, but that comes about when we are in confidential discussions with parties and we are subject to non-disclosure agreements.  We communicate with them and with the Communications Workers' Union with regard to our staff at the earliest opportunity.  We have also had several meetings with them to discuss the potential for the future of the social welfare business.  We have told them that we are in discussions with several parties and that when we have established possible sustainable business models we will engage further with them.  I do not accept that we have not engaged with them, as I believe we continue to do so.<\/p><p>  In terms of the consultation process, since the last meeting we have gone through the process in eight locations.  In two of those, Broadford in County Clare and Greencastle in County Donegal, our final decision was to advertise the offices.  In the other six locations, we had a mix of representations from the local community, ranging from many to almost none in some cases.  We have listened to the local communities and in six cases we decided that the business could be done at alternative nearby post offices that have the capacity and that, in our view, were a suitable distance away.<\/p><p>  In terms of trial periods, our decisions are not made on the commercial viability of each individual post office.  If we had to make a decision on every individual post office, there would be many more post offices, which would not be financially sustainable.  We look at the network as a whole, and the bigger offices subsidise the smaller offices in the network.  If we were to look at individual offices on a financially sustainable basis, a lot more would close.  We do not look at it like that but according to the criteria I outlined - namely, the distance to other offices, the capacity of other offices, etc.  <\/p><p>  The contract with the postmasters has been in place for a very long time, as has the payments system; in fact, it has been in place since well before the foundation of An Post.<\/p>  <p>It is incumbent on us, like any other organisation, to review contracts and payment systems from time to time to get the best value and customer service regarding standards of premises and service, etc.  That is what we are doing.  We introduced the five years in 2012.  Approximately 35 offices have a five-year contract.  We do not believe a contract for life, which the old contract effectively was, is appropriate in the commercial world in which we live.<\/p><p> The same issue arises regarding family transfers.  Because we provide State contracts we have an obligation to advertise all posts rather than just hand contracts to individual people.  In many cases the family members will be in a prime position to go for an office that is advertised, particularly if they have experience of running the office.  In may cases the family member will be at an advantage even before we begin.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200010#M00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Daly","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394621400,"counter":393,"content":"<p>Post and Pay is not a partnership with Tesco.

The whole point of this initiative is that, in common with most European posts, we have significant challenges in postal volumes.  One of the ways to address that is to increase one's distribution of those items.  There has also been a change in people's shopping patterns.  Post offices have a very loyal clientele.  Some people do not go to post offices and it is about trying to match our offer as best we can with modern shopping habits.  For instance, Post and Pay does not have social welfare, NTMA products, banking products or cash foreign exchange.  It is designed on a very limited product set, which is aligned to what PostPoint is already offering through 2,000 non-post office outlets.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200011#N01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Liam Sheehan"},{"type":"speech","time":1394621400,"counter":402,"content":"<p>Mr. Sheehan said some people do not go to post offices.

After Mr. Sheehan's brief exchange with the Chairman, I am even more fearful.  It is very worrying if the management of An Post think, in their wisdom, that having PostPoint in Tesco or any other retail outfit is not going to cannibalise the network and they will stop the trial if this happens.  The dogs on the street would realise that if An Post is going to proceed with the trials, which were not mentioned in the opening remarks, it will cannibalise them.  That is common sense.  Regarding changing the way people do business, and the Chairman alluded to this, putting the points in Tesco, SuperValu or any other places will pull them away from the existing networks.  It is so fundamental to our communities, both urban and rural that there should be a provision put into An Post that the networks must be maintained.  Then, maybe, An Post might go after the business to maintain these post offices.<\/p><p>  When was the last time An Post did a huge media advertising campaign on what is available in the post offices, rural or urban?  I want to know not just about the investments but about what is available in the average post office throughout the country.  The witnesses have outlined what they are doing regarding discussions with banks, financial institutions and utility companies etc. to bring the message in there.  There is a serious issue with marketing.  The witnesses have talked about communities losing their post offices and family members not taking them up and the policies.  The perception out there is that there is no attempt by An Post management to say we have these retail outlets and strengths, we can lose them and bring it all back to base, or we can go out and source business for these retail outlets.  There are many companies out there that would die for An Post's retail outlets.<\/p><p>  What is An Post's policy on parcel deliveries?  Some parcel delivery companies have come in behind An Post.  It beggars belief that the witnesses can come here and tell us that the trials with Tesco or others will not have a detrimental effect on the retail outlets.  The dogs on the street would see that as a threat.  Whatever the trials will be, if that is the route An Post wants to take it will be the death knell.  An Post must be honest with the people.  It is high time that An Post was directed to maintain the existing network.  Then, maybe, the management of An Post would go after the business to maintain these post office because there is plenty of business to maintain them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200011#N01300","speaker":"987"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394621400,"counter":405,"content":"<p>As I outlined in my address, we have never done as many activities as we currently do in post offices.

If we do not go into these locations, where people like to do their shopping and go more often, our competition will grow and we will create even bigger competitors.  The pilot is about increasing our market share in these products and preventing the competition from growing even further.  One can pay bills in many retailers.

I am from Newcastle West in County Limerick and between the mid-1990s and 2005 eight post offices in a ring around the town closed for the reasons described by Mr. Daly.  People opted for places with increased footfall and the commercial viability of the post offices was affected.  An enhanced relationship between An Post and retail outlets such as Tesco, SuperValu or Dunnes Stores will make centralising footfall par for the course and a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Centralising a service to where there is increased footfall will invariably lead to having more than the original ten locations.  How many more of these locations does An Post estimate there will be?  What are their successes at present?  Are the rates of pay for staff comparable to the rates of pay for staff working for postmasters or in An Post-owned offices throughout the country?<\/p><p>  Online shopping is a fact of life for many people throughout the country.  While I see people availing of Internet-based shopping I see little evidence of An Post being a driver for the delivery of parcels.  Its competitors are streets ahead.<\/p><p>  Last week we met the postmasters and we have also had discussions with other stakeholders.  What level of engagement has An Post had with the NTMA, the Department of Finance and the credit union movement with a view to enhancing the banking services available?  A very good savings scheme is available but in isolated rural areas there may be a lack of critical mass between the credit union, the post office and the bank.  A person could go into the post office to draw down a small loan regardless of the bank involved.<\/p><p>  There is no point in putting 500 people into a hall on the night it is announced the post office will close because it is already gone.  Has An Post ever considered an early warning system, on an annual basis or every three or four years, so a community could see how much support its post office receives locally?  There is a rush to support them when it is too late.  The witnesses stated they want An Post to go into areas of high footfall to take on its competitors but this draws people out of communities already in danger.<\/p><p>  Mr. Daly stated up to 95% of the population live within 5 km of a post office.  This means more than 250,000 people live more than 5 km from a post office.  I could almost identify where these people are.  They are west and south of the Shannon in massive geographical areas.  Some of them may be more than 15 km from a post office and the round trip is what exercises people.<\/p><p>  I presume An Post has a social commitment.  I know it has a commercial remit and it must wash its own face but there is a social element.  Not everybody has a SuperValu or Tesco in their community.  A concentration on this mentality will have implications for the post office network and communities, but also for the staff working in post offices.  On what basis has this concept been formed?  Is it fair?  Are the rates of pay, the opening hours and the services the same?  We have seen this happen before.

Will An Post explore its relationship with the Irish Postmasters Union, IPU?  There seems to have been a breakdown of communications.  The word on the street we heard was there is deep distrust in the IPU of An Post.  Is there a liaison committee by which the IPU is kept fully informed or is it a case it is met when a new initiative is announced?  It would be much more productive to have a regular structured meeting format.  The feedback we receive is it is not kept informed on what is going on.  I came to the conclusion the problem lay not so much with the Government but with An Post itself because it does not give any indication of its business model.  The witnesses have outlined much in their presentation, but they have not sold the idea An Post promotes, supports and defends the post office network.  This is not what comes across I must say.<\/p><p>  The last time representatives from An Post came before the committee I raised the issue of its marketing.  I am astonished to hear it spends &euro;3 million.  Perhaps it is time for it to revise its marketing strategy.  Perhaps it might consider that it may not be productive to spend all of the money internally.  Perhaps it should spend more on radio, television and social networks giving more details of the type of services it provides.  A slogan used by the IPU for years was use it or lose it.  This does not come across at all.  I understand perfectly the sensitivities involved and that An Post does not want to spread a message the network is in danger.<\/p><p>  Did An Post make representations to the Government on the changes in the interest rates?  The banks seemed to go in the back door when An Post went out the front door, in that An Post enjoyed a superior interest rate which was very attractive to savers and could have been built on.<\/p>  <p>The ground was swept from under An Post by a Government decision that seemed to have resulted from lobbying by the banks to reduce the interest rate on An Post products and make them more competitive with bank interest rates, which seems to be an oxymoron.<\/p><p> What I think is important is communication between An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union and better marketing of services.

I will respond to Senator Paschal Mooney's questions as he must leave early.<\/p><p>  We provide State savings products on behalf of the National Treasury Management Agency.  The interest rates on An Post products were out of step with what was happening in the marketplace and the NTMA sought to bring them back into line with rates in the marketplace.  We did not make representations to the Department of Finance or other bodies because we perform these services on behalf of the NTMA and it is the agency that sets the rates.  Our rates have changed a number of times in the past 18 months or so, but these changes have not impacted on the level of inflows into the Post Office Savings Bank, prize bonds, saving certificates or bonds.  As I stated in my address, in spite of cuts in interest rates, we took in &euro;1.9 billion last year and continue to take in savings in very high figures every week.  The interest rate changes have not impacted on savings.  The NTMA was bringing the rates back into line with those in the marketplace, not into line with what the banks were insisting on.  I am not aware of what happened with the banks, but I know our rates are back into line with those in the marketplace.<\/p><p>  An Post engages with the Irish Postmasters Union and is constantly in contact with its general secretary, not only when issues arise but all the time.

We are concerned about the sustainability of post offices, as is An Post.  Will the delegates address the issue of the sustainability of An Post?  There are 1,147 post offices in the network.  I presume this figure incorporates very large facilities, as well as smaller and dedicated facilities and facilities that form part of a family store, that open one or two days a week.  I would like to receive a breakdown of the number of 1,147 post offices.  I wish to know whether all of them have an IT infrastructure that is capable of processing electronic transactions.  Is there a standard template for the security measures needed in handling cash in all 1,147 post offices or does it vary, depending on the size or nature of the outlet?<\/p><p>  An Post states it is discussing the question of extending services to customers.  I am aware that it was in discussions with the Irish League of Credit Unions and other financial institutions.  While I understand the need for sensitivity surrounding these discussions, I do not believe we have the luxury of time.  With banks closing down, opportunities will arise and An Post should be ready to take up the slack.  An undue delay will result in a missed opportunity.<\/p>  <p>We are not going to stop electronic funds transfer, so An Post will have to consider - and from what has been said here, it is considering - its business model.  It is an opportunity for further work and exploration of the business model.  <\/p><p>  According to the Grant Thornton report the level of closures has reduced.  Up to two years ago there were roughly 200 closures, but that number has fallen.  Were the closures predominantly due to a lack of facilities or IT infrastructure?  What was the main reason for the closure of 200 premises?<\/p><p> If I accept that neither the Government nor An Post wants to close post offices, given that the service is dependent on either footfall or the volume of electronic transactions, is there a list of endangered outlets in An Post?  Is there an amber alert system that would remind An Post to talk to the people who work in the post offices - the postmasters - and the communities?  If communities were aware of the potential risk to \"their\" post office - and that is the how people consider them - perhaps they could do more to safeguard their facility.<\/p><p> Either Mr. Sheehan or Mr. Daly said that newspaper headlines claiming the network was at risk were unhelpful.  I accept that the Government and An Post have said they have no plan to close post offices, but today was the first time anybody explained the Tesco and PostPoint link-up.  That fact has not been made clear to the public and to politicians.  Perhaps something was sent to me but I did not notice it.  We need to know what services will continue to be made available at post offices rather than through the PostPoint facility and at Tesco or other retail outlets, and we need to know what will be available through these facilities but not at post offices.  I found the same confusion in the Minister's response to a question on post office closures last week.  He said it was not the Government's wish to close post offices, but a little later he said An Post would be foolish to ignore the reality of high-footfall locations in major retail areas.  I interpreted that to mean that the aim was to shut down the high street in every town and village, so it is not just post offices that should be concerned.  The public and politicians need more information on the matter.  Those are all of my questions for the moment.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200013#P01400","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1394623200,"counter":427,"content":"<p>The 1,147 post offices provide a full service with full hours and are fully computerised, so there is no difference between them.

We have had an interesting dialogue about a subject that is dear to all of our hearts.<\/p><p>  As was said at the beginning, communities have an affinity with their post offices and the same happens with our neighbours in the UK.  However, we all must be realistic and realise that we have a generation - and I refer to anyone under the age of 30 - most of whose members have never been through the door of a post office and in all probability will never be in one.  That is not An Post's fault because it is swimming against the tide in terms of technology, which the delegation referred to earlier.<\/p>  <p>Nobody is against technology.  If we were to attempt to pass a Bill to prohibit online shopping or e-mails there would be riots on the street.  It is not going to happen.  Technology moves on.  An Post and the Royal Mail in Britain have been subject to some pain because of that.  An Post has been hit on all fronts, as the technology generation is not using its services.  I do not think it is always appreciated that An Post is in competition with private operators, be it in the delivery of mail or parcel post.  I have met people working for the private operators who are earning the minimum wage.  In fairness to An Post - or should I say, in fairness to CWU, which is a very good trade union - the standard of pay and conditions in An Post is good.  In some respects An Post is operating with one hand tied behind its back, given that these operators can function with cheaper labour.  I emphasise I do not apply that to all operators.  It is similar to the situation of banks closing and people no longer using them.  It it is quite understandable that they do not.  If one can use a computer one can use online banking, and one need never set foot inside a bank again.  I am one of those who is glad not to do that, because online banking is so efficient in terms of time.<\/p><p> The witness made the point that we cherish the postal service and that some post offices are subsidising other post offices.  Whatever about our ideology - there are many things I like about Cuba, including its postal service - I do not think people here would go out in great numbers to nationalise everything and anything.  It just would not happen.  As Deputy Patrick O'Donovan said earlier, we might have a sentimental view about An Post but then we go home at night and do our online shopping.

An Post should advertise its products so that the public is made aware of the convenience of utilising all the available services.<\/p><p>  Local development partnerships, which are prevalent in every corner of the country, should liaise with An Post.  Is there any communication with those companies, given that they are operating on the ground in rural areas and are positive for the upkeep of those areas?  I believe there is a role for the partnerships, and perhaps An Post should be in contact with them to ascertain the demands of the local community and any additional enhanced services that may be required.<\/p><p>  Currently the national lottery is operated by a consortium including An Post.  The least that could be done is that the lotto be made available in all 1,147 outlets, where people can buy their weekly lotto ticket.  Does An Post have plans to upgrade any of its 150 agencies?  I believe there is a possibility that some of those could be upgraded.  Again, I emphasise the importance of advertising and a sense of awareness.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200015#R00500","speaker":"1050"},{"type":"speech","time":1394623800,"counter":447,"content":"<p>I will finish with the members and then call Deputy Michael Healy-Rae.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200015#R00600","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1394623800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>I welcome Mr. John Daly and Mr. Liam Sheehan to the committee.  This is an important engagement following the debate last week.  They will have heard there is genuine concern among stakeholders in regard to the future of the post office network.  I am not one for scaremongering but I believe we must listen when alarm bells are ringing.  The online environment alone represents a challenge.  I could have sent 100 e-mails while the witnesses were speaking; I could have paid bills; I could have consulted with my bank accounts, all online and in real time.  As previous speakers have said, there is nothing one can do about that.  There are also services such as electronic financial transactions, online shopping and online bill paying, much of which was traditionally done through the post office.  This poses a huge challenge for An Post.<\/p><p>  What are we to do about it and what does the future hold?  In this regard I wish to put a direct question to the management in An Post, which has huge trust and respect throughout the country.  That is not something we can take for granted.  As modern challenges present themselves, does An Post carry out risk management strategies on the various sectors that are now challenging its business?  If so, surely these would identify where the challenges are coming from and where new opportunities might arise.<\/p>  <p>Mr. Daly spelled out where An Post gained business traction, for example, with vouchers.  In the presentation, he mentioned new savings products, money transmission, banking, vouchers and other products offered by An Post, but there should be an alignment of strategy between An Post and its stakeholders.  When I say stakeholders, the post office network is an important stakeholder.  They are on the front line and hear and see the challenges, and I presume they are feeding back to An Post, as their business partner.  I wonder what level of engagement An Post has with those to manage the risk that is presenting itself.<\/p><p> Government is also an important stakeholder.  I note Mr. Daly welcomes the announcement by the Minister last week that there will be a review and the Government would like the post office network to be the front office of government.  There are such opportunities, whether in motor tax, HSE payments, identification and other financial transfers, that could be explored further and realistically by An Post.  That is an area in which Mr. Daly would need to get more involved.<\/p><p> I am concerned about the PostPoint initiatives as well.  I understand why An Post wants to compete with competitors and why it needs to get out there, but there is a real risk of displacement or undermining existing networks.  Tesco is not in every community but, let us be honest about it, members of every community shop in Tesco.  I would like to see a more real engagement with An Post's existing network to see how it can enhance or empower those to do more before it goes down the route of centralising.  If they are made fully aware of that service and it is made available to them, An Post might find that consumers will vote with their feet and go where the service is traditionally.  Certainly, that would be the hope of us all.  If the network is to remain sustainable, as I stated in the D&aacute;il, the citizens and the communities need to be proactive as well and need to realise that when they do not put business through their post office or their network, if it cannot sustain itself, it is at risk of closing.<\/p><p> I have a criticism here because of my experience of the communication or consultation with communities when a post office is at risk.  I had a direct experience in mid-County Waterford, the constituency I represent, when Kill Post Office closed and the initial engagements between An Post and the communities was poor as regards consultation and information.  I respect the commercial or security sensitivities there might be in some cases, but when a post office serving a mid-county geographical area with a 10 km radius is closing, there is a need for real engagement so that residents will understand exactly what is going on.  I attended public meetings there.  Further to the closure, the community made realistic proposals to An Post to try to keep the post office open.  Despite a former postmistress being willing to take it over and the community having identified business opportunities and received petitions that residents would commit to supporting the post office, unfortunately, it all fell on deaf ears.  It was as if the decision was made and that was the end of the business.  Even if that is the end of the business and the decision is made, An Post should learn from such experiences and engage in a more open and transparent way with communities rather than after the event, which is what I experienced and certainly did not like.<\/p><p> Finally, what realistic proposals has An Post made to Government to compete for and attract new business in areas such as motor tax and HSE payments?  Mr. Daly briefly mentioned Irish Water as well.  He might outline, as far as he can, what real engagement he is making with Departments to pitch for that type of business.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200015#R00700","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394624400,"counter":450,"content":"<p>I was getting fairly fed up with this for the past month or so and I suppose at the outset I must declare that I am a postmaster and contractor with An Post.<\/p><p>  On a personal point, Mr. Daly, in his presentation, describes us as \"independent retailers - postmasters - as contractors\".  My office is a stand-alone post office.  I could not tell him how many stand-alone offices there are in the country.  It is not aligned to any other store, shop, retail unit or anything else.  Maybe this is the way the thinking has shifted within An Post.  We now become independent retailers - postmasters.  I would have thought that would have been the other way around.  That is merely a personal gripe.  I hope it does not reflect the attitudes in An Post.<\/p><p>  I will address an important point under the discussion on security.  I get concerned when I hear discussions about post offices' cash holdings, etc.  I acknowledge An Post's support over the past number of years, with the co-operation of the postmasters, in beefing up security, not only in procedures but in equipment.  A strong message should go out that the suite of time-lock safes, safes, alarms, CCTV, counter technology, etc., will more often than not leave empty-handed anybody who wishes to take it on.  It would be a dangerous idea to put about that post offices are easy targets.  Post offices are not easy targets, not anymore anyway.  I look forward to continuing engagement with An Post in that regard.<\/p><p>  I welcome the new system where a post office or local communities might be alerted to the possibility of closure.  Regrettably, it is far too late for 800 or 900 offices that have closed over the past decade or more, but it brings me to another point.  This is a partnership approach between An Post, the post offices, Government and the communities, and it gives communities a chance to react.  I am encouraged by Mr. Daly's figures that An Post has reversed or offered contracts in a few cases where communities engaged.  Regrettably, sometimes, as a previous speaker mentioned, the only time they realise a post office is there is when they get a notice that there is a closure.  That is in a minority of cases, but, unfortunately, that happens.  An amber alert system to communities on a use-it-or-lose-it basis is important.<\/p><p>  I have a few direct questions.  Has An Post entered into any negotiations with Government, Government agencies or Departments?  I refer, in particular, to looking at issues such as delivering citizens' information, MABS services, outreach services, outreach social protection information services, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine outreach services, particularly for rural areas, where An Post could become strong agents of Government agencies or Departments.  In many cases, some post offices do that business anyway, and they do it for nothing.  I have seen it so often in my own office.  We can come in with a social protection client, complete the form and, quite often, it is satisfactory.  Sometimes, the last question seeks the person's payment preference as his or her local post office or bank, and the person prefers to go to the bank and thanks us for filling out the form stating that the bank is much more convenient, and one is left frustrated.  What if we could turn that around?  Has An Post held any negotiations or had communications with State agencies or Department to see whether post offices can attract that business because there are many rural areas in which those agencies do not have a full-time presence?  We could provide those outreach services for our customers and for the citizens.<\/p><p>  The technology in the post offices is modern and has been since the automation was introduced in the early 1990s.  It continues to be state-of-the-art, but there are significant deficiencies in providing services to customers.  For example, on a daily basis we receive memos but we cannot sent a memo back.  If we communicate with somebody, even with An Post, it is over the telephone, which is laborious and time consuming.<\/p>  <p>There could be some way of addressing the issue to provide the consumer with the full suite, including customer complaints and extra information based on increased business for post offices.<\/p><p> The contract issue is a serious one for smaller offices with lower numbers of business transactions.  It is still important to note that the An Post payment is per transaction, it is not a salary.  The vast majority of business is conducted on the basis of a fee per transaction on a sliding scale that decreases with the volume of transactions.  There is support for very small post offices - I hope I do not fall into that category - but I am concerned that the support for smaller rural and urban offices will be withdrawn.  An Post could return in 18 months or two years time and state it did not actively seek to close the post offices.  However, what will have happened is that it made it difficult for them to sustain themselves.  If a contract comes up for renewal, no one will be bothered to take up because the remuneration will not be worth it.  Complying with security requirements, providing the counter and for the different options that must be provided for will not be worth it and the community will lose out.  I am very concerned that support be maintained for smaller post offices in rural areas to maintain proximity to the consumer and the citizen.<\/p><p> I welcome what the delegates said about the need for further business.  Most post offices depend too strongly on two major contracts, those from the Department of Social Protection and the NTMA.  Having all eggs in one basket is a precarious position to be in for smaller offices and communities.  The debate in the past few weeks has highlighted that post offices will not survive if people do not use them.  People have options in every area.  They can receive payments from the Department of Social Protection through the bank or they can make bill payments through direct debits.  They can still use these options free of charge in 99% of cases through An Post.  The debate on what is an ongoing issue is worthwhile.  The Government, the company and contractors must put in place the building blocks required.  If not, consumers will vote with their feet.  As sure as night follows day, post offices will close and we will have public meetings to attend.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200016#S00200","speaker":"995","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394625000,"counter":452,"content":"<p>On a lighter note to Deputy Noel Harrington, on the Kerry side of the border, when we are filling in the forms, we fill the last part first.

I must register my disappointment that the CEO is unable to attend.  Everyone is busy and people have different places to be, but I cannot think of where is more important for the CEO of this organisation than before the committee.  Mr. Daly and Mr. Sheehan are perfectly credible and efficient delegates but the CEO should be here.<br\/>I must declare that I am a postmaster.  For generations, postmasters had a contractual right to apply to transfer their appointment to a family member or, in some cases, an assistant who had been <i>in situ<\/i>for many years.  This contributed to post offices being held by families for generations and providing continuity for communities.  The same families served the same families for decades.  The Irish Postmasters Union, IPU, stated An Post had removed this right for families to apply for a transfer and it has caused difficulties for many postmasters and their families.  Why was this done?  This loss of opportunity for postmasters to hand on the post office to the next generation is unfair.  The An Post delegates may respond that it is a requirement that the post office contract be put out to open tender, but our post office is about community and continuity of service more than anything else.<br\/>The delegates referred to the trials they were carrying out.  I highlight the commitment of Tesco to its customers in a frank way.  In the town of Killarney Tesco became involved in the retail business selling petrol and reduced prices to such a level that existing service stations could not buy fuel at the Tesco sales price.  Tesco continued for weeks and months and, after a couple of years, succeeded in closing down 12 or 13 family run businesses that had been operating in the town of Killarney for decades.  When that was done and it realised it would not get rid of anymore, it controlled the price by increasing it.  Today it is kept grossly high because it has done away with the competition.  The delegates think it is proper to take An Post services to people who deal in that way, but it is wrong.  Although I cannot use the word, it is criminal to do what An Post is doing.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200017#T00500","speaker":"1049"},{"type":"speech","time":1394625000,"counter":456,"content":"<p>The Deputy used the word, even though he said he would not do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200017#T00600","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speech","time":1394625000,"counter":457,"content":"<p>Yes, but I said I did not want to use it.  It is criminal.  Two weeks ago the Minister said that if people were not shopping on the high street we would put the service where they were going for fear of losing business.  He repeated this yesterday in response to Deputy Michael Moynihan at Question Time and the An Post delegates seem to have the same idea.  If we nurture and promote the 1,100 post offices and work together to provide more services, we will get over this hump and retain the network.  I am glad that in December 2006 a Fine Gael motion tabled by the excellent Deputy Bernard J. Durkan was supported by Fine Gael.  I was disappointed that it did not do the same two weeks ago in respect of a motion tabled by the IPU through the Technical Group.  We all want to ensure we will hold what we have and that we will not lose more post offices, but as sure as night follows day, by carrying out trials, the delegates will help to send us down the slippery slope.  People will say they will go to Tesco and do it all there, including their shopping and buying petrol, and conduct the business they should be doing in the local post office.  When this happens, when more post offices are closed down and when we lose half of the network, people will cry and say it is wrong.  Deputy Paudie Coffey said he did not want to have to go into a hall to fight a big campaign about how it was a fright people had lost their post office, but An Post is a big player in retaining the post office network.<\/p><p>  When they are leaving this meeting, the delegates should be rubbing shoulders with representatives of the IPU and going into a quiet room to ask what they can do to work together to ensure Government policy will be to retain services and the way in which they can enhance and attract more business and provide more services.<\/p>  <p>They should think about how to make leaving the high street and moving to the big shopping centres less attractive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2014031200017#T00700","speaker":"1049","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1394625600,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Much of what Deputy Healy-Rae says is right, but 200 post offices were closed when his father supported the previous Government, and since this Government came into office fewer than 20 have been closed.
