Students entering post graduate programmes who meet the qualifying conditions for the special rate of grant under the Student Grant Scheme are eligible to have their post-graduate tuition fees paid up to the maximum fee limit of &euro;6,270.

The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of Special Education supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.  The NCSE has published details of the allocations for SNA support that have been made to schools for the 2013\/2014 school year.  These details are available on the NCSE website, www.ncse.ie, and detail the allocations made for each school on a per county basis, including details of the SNA allocations made for schools in County Kerry.<\/p><p>  The NCSE allocates a quantum of SNA support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support. The deployment of SNAs within schools is then a matter for the individual Principal\/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.<\/p><p>  Schools can contact the NCSE if they have enrolled children who were not considered at the time that the revised SNA allocations were made to schools, or where they are seeking a revision to the quantum of SNA support which has been allocated to them. In general, a revision to SNA allocations will only be made in circumstances where schools have enrolled new pupils, or where schools can demonstrate that they do not have sufficient SNA posts to cater for the care needs of all of the qualifying children in their school.  The NCSE invited schools to make applications for SNA support for the coming 2014\/15 school year by 26th March, 2014.<\/p><p>  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040900064#WRN00600","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Schools Refurbishment","counter":186,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040900064#WRN00650"},{"type":"question","counter":187,"qnumday":76,"qnumall":"[16978\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040900064#WRN00700","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to explain the position regarding funding in respect of a school (details supplied) in County Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":188,"content":"<p>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the school to which he refers has been approved significant devolved funding for the provision of an on-suite mainstream classroom, special needs facilities and a Resource Room.

These actions focus on support for schools, teacher training, research and awareness raising and aim to ensure that all forms of bullying, including cyber bullying, are addressed.  New National Anti-Bullying Procedures, which include a specific reference to cyberbullying, were published last September.  These will be adopted and form the basis for anti-bullying policies in all schools during this school year.  The new procedures are available on my Department's website www.education.ie and include reporting and oversight arrangements.<\/p><p>  The recommended approach is for schools to aim to prevent bullying in schools and, where it does happen, to take the steps required to address the issue at local level.  There is no obligation on school authorities to report incidents of bullying to my Department and my Department does not collate data on individual bullying incidents.  Central to promoting safer use of the Internet by young people is a strong commitment to changing behaviour and raising the knowledge, skills and attitudes around preventing, responding to and reporting cyber bullying incidents.  The continued implementation of the Action Plan on Bullying will increase capacity in these areas and build on my Department's current strategy to ensure that internet safety is mainstreamed throughout schools' teaching, learning and other practices.  Resources are available on www.webwise.ie and include guidelines on developing Acceptable Use Policies.<\/p><p>  Awareness raising initiatives on cyberbullying, including &quot;Up2Us&quot;, a new resource to tackle cyberbullying, are provided through the internet safety initiative, Webwise.

Training materials for parents, teachers and Boards of Management are also being developed and rolled out.Implementation of these and the other actions identified in the Plan will continue in 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040900066#WRP01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1035"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Third Level Admissions Entry Requirements","counter":228,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040900066#WRP01150"},{"type":"question","counter":229,"qnumday":90,"qnumall":"[17017\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040900066#WRP01200","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 355 of 25 March 2014, and based on the response (details supplied), if he will encourage third level institutions which require mature student applicants with previous degrees to complete the MSAP examination, to consider changing their admission policy in the future.","asker":"1048","askee":"1035"},{"type":"speech","counter":230,"content":"<p>The MSAP (Mature Students Admission Pathway) is designed to assess a range of competencies considered important for success in tertiary study.

Details of broadband services available in each County including County Meath can be found on a number of websites, including the websites of individual commercial operators.  The Government&rsquo;s National Broadband Plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing: a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment, and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.<\/p><p>  Since the publication of the Plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway and in some instances have been accelerated in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services.

Mobile operators have also made announcements regarding network upgrades and are rolling out enhanced product offerings.

BGE developed a detailed programme initiation document within the framework of this strategy, which outlined all of the tasks required to establish a fully functioning integrated public water utility and provided this to my Department in August 2012. They also provided an associated budget to my Department which outlined the costs involved in each area of activity, totalling &euro;150m, plus &euro;30m contingency, and reflecting both the use of BGE and external resources. The budget reflected the range of tasks to be undertaken from financial, governance, regulatory business capability, systems, brand management and customer engagement perspectives. In addition, Irish Water has progressed the domestic water metering programme, the full cost of which is &euro;539m excluding VAT. <\/p><p>  All costs incurred by Irish Water in 2013 were financed by a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), with the exception of a grant of &euro;0.57m for a pilot metering study funded by the Department. No other Exchequer funds or voted Department expenditure was provided to Irish Water in 2013. <\/p><p>  The establishment costs will be included in the overall funding model for Irish Water; accordingly, they will also be examined by the Commission for Energy Regulation as an integral element of the independent economic regulation of Irish Water. I also expect that establishment costs and metering costs will be included in the regulatory asset base for Irish Water. <\/p><p>  In 2014, Irish Water, which now has statutory responsibility for water services, will receive &euro;240m in equity from the Minister for Finance and &euro;4 86.5 m from the Local Government Fund.  No funding will be provided through my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  It is anticipated that Irish Water will finance other costs from non-domestic water charge revenues of some &euro;190m and from borrowing, which will be the subject of appropriate ministerial consents in due course.

Only households in developments in Categories 3 and 4 are eligible for the waiver from payment of the Charge.<\/p><p>The list of developments in which households are eligible for the Household Charge waiver is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) (Amendment) Regulations 2013. Consequently, if an estate is not named in the Schedule prescribed by these Regulations, then properties in that estate are not eligible for the waiver provided for relating to unfinished housing estates.<\/p><p>An exemption from the Local Property Tax (LPT) applies to developments listed in the Schedule to the Finance (Local Property Tax) Regulations 2013. The list of unfinished housing developments eligible for the exemption was compiled by local authorities based on data from the National Housing Survey 2012, which was carried out over the course of summer 2012 by my Department in conjunction with local authorities and the Housing Agency. A similar approach to that which applied to the waiver of the Household Charge was followed but using the revised methodology used in the 2012 Survey which included a new criterion identifying developments in a &ldquo;seriously problematic condition&rdquo; and to which the LPT waiver was applied.<\/p><p>My Department does not hold information in relation to the solvency of particular developers\/builders.

Can I say at the outset that the overwhelming majority of migrants in Ireland are here lawfully and do not in any way engage in abuses of the immigration system. They range across a broad spectrum including those coming here to work having been granted work permits by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, students and those coming for business reasons, etc.  Indeed, I have introduced a series of measures of encourage inward investment and job creation from non-EEA nationals by the introduction of the Entrepreneur and Investor schemes and by promoting increased tourism numbers through the Visa Waiver programme, leading to the roll-out in the Autumn of reciprocal arrangements for short-term visa holders so that they can move freely within the Common Travel Area.<\/p><p>  That said, all modern States must operate appropriate controls on immigration and in this regard Ireland is no different than its fellow EU Member States. This includes a range of measures including border controls with specific checks at ports of entry and determinations on the making of Deportation \/ Removal Orders. In this regard over 2,200 persons were deported\/removed from the State in 2013 including almost 1,900 persons who were refused entry into the State at ports of entry and were returned to the place from where they had come.  In addition, 210 failed asylum seekers and illegal migrants were deported from the State in 2013 with a further 63 EU nationals returned to their countries of origin on foot of an EU Removal Order.  A total of 84 asylum seekers were also transferred to the EU member state in which they first applied for asylum under the Dublin Regulation.<\/p><p>  Specifically, the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service works very closely with their UK counterparts on maintaining the integrity of the Common Travel Area to ensure that it is not abused.  This is achieved in a number of ways including sharing of information and data and close day to day cooperation.  In addition, the Garda National Immigration Bureau carry out operations at ports of entry and on the border with Northern Ireland to detect such abuses.  Since assuming office as Minister for Justice and Equality, I have introduced specific legislative measures to address potential immigration abuses such as the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking)(Amendment) Act 2013 which strengthens Ireland's anti-human trafficking provisions in line with recent European initiatives.  In addition, Part II of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 strengthens the powers of Immigration Officers to require production of identity documents by foreign nationals entering and residing in the State.  Further measures to underpin the integrity of the immigration system will be provided for in the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill, which I intend to republish later this year.  In addition, from January this year I introduced a policy document for family re-unification which sets out the framework of rules for persons from abroad who wish to join family members already in the State.<\/p><p>  When dealing with illegal immigrant cases clearly they are not all the same and must be dealt with on a case by case basis taking account of their individual circumstances.   At one end of the scale are those where the person's illegal status is through no fault of their own and my Department continues to deal with cases of this nature on an ongoing basis.  However there are also much more egregious instances of immigration abuse, often at considerable expense to the State and it does not follow that such persons should profit from their conduct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040900074#WRX00300","answer":true,"speaker":"1025"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Retirements","counter":356,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040900074#WRX00350"},{"type":"question","counter":357,"qnumday":134,"qnumall":"[16964\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040900074#WRX00400","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"further to Parliamentary Question No. 410 of 1 April 2014 in which he stated that the previous Garda Commissioner was also granted an extension to his term is it the cases that the previous Garda Commissioner had to go through the courts to get his extension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1049","askee":"1025"},{"type":"speech","counter":358,"content":"<p>There was no legal action or threat of legal action in relation to the extension of the term of office of former Commissioner Fachtna Murphy.

However, in managing the final years of expenditure under these Schemes, it is a priority for my Department to ensure that all of the remaining available EU funds under the RDP 2007-2013 will be fully drawn down by the end of 2015.<table><tr><th><b>Axis \/ measure<\/b><\/th><th><b>RDP Allocation based on 8th Amendment of RDP &euro;<\/b><\/th><th><b>Total Expenditure 2007 - end 2013<\/b>&euro;<\/th><\/tr><tr><td><b>AXIS 1 &ndash; Competitiveness<\/b><\/td><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Vocational training [REPs]<\/b><\/td><td><b>- <\/b><\/td><td>7,314,707<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Installation Aid<\/td><td>12,942,430<\/td><td>12,892,430<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Early Retirement<\/td><td>225,858,724<\/td><td>226,011,197<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Farm Modernisation<\/td><td>122,391,229<\/td><td>90,162,411<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>TOTAL AXIS 1<\/b><\/td><td><b>368,607,103<\/b><\/td><td><b>336,380,745<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Axis 2 &ndash; Environment and land management<\/b><\/td><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Less Favoured Areas<\/td><td>1,440,572,861<\/td><td>1,441,459,189<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Natura 2000<\/td><td>95,738,297<\/td><td>95,038,737<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Agri-environment<\/td><td>2,067,950,808<\/td><td>1,974,015,339<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Non productive investment<\/td><td>15,982,800<\/td><td>12,490,996<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>TOTAL AXIS 2<\/b><\/td><td><b>3,620,244,766<\/b><\/td><td><b>3,523,004,261<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Axis 3<\/b><\/td><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Broadband<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>TOTAL AXIS 3<\/b><\/td><td><b>0<\/b><\/td><td>0<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Axis 4<\/b><\/td><td><b>-<\/b><\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Competitiveness<\/b><\/td><td><b>- <\/b><\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Food Projects.<\/b><\/td><td>5,000,000<\/td><td>374,338<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Implementing Local Development Strategies - quality of Life<\/td><td>266,458,746<\/td><td>177,119,933<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Co-operation Projects<\/td><td>7,878,000<\/td><td>3,205,975<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Running of LAGS<\/td><td>62,464,000<\/td><td>62,802,749<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>TOTAL AXIS 4<\/b><\/td><td><b>341,800,746<\/b><\/td><td><b>243,502,995<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Axis 5 &ndash; <\/b><\/td><td>-<\/td><td>- <\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>Technical Assistance<\/b><\/td><td><b>4,320,000<\/b><\/td><td><b>1,822,364<\/b><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><b>OVERALL RDP<\/b><\/td><td><b>4,334,972,615<\/b><\/td><td><b>4,104,710,365<\/b><\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>It should be noted that the expenditure figures for agri-environment, and consequently of Axis 2 and the overall RDP, in the table have been revised downward by &euro;12m following further examination, since PQ No. 34 of the 26 March 2014.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040900077#WRAA00600","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Fish Farming","counter":415,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040900077#WRAA00650"},{"type":"question","counter":416,"qnumday":154,"qnumall":"[16999\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014040900077#WRAA00700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of fishermen who have applied for grants for loss of lobster pots and shrimp pots, respectively, due to the storms this winter; the number who have received payment to date; the total payment made under this scheme to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1044","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":417,"content":"<p>Earlier this year, in response to the exceptional loss of pots reported by fishermen as a result of the severe storms experienced in January and February, I introduced a Shellfish Pot Replacement Scheme to assist pot fishermen with the cost of replacing lobster, crab and shrimp pots.

Last year I announced a Pre-School Quality Agenda to address issues of quality in the pre-school sector and it was in this context that I decided to introduce a minimum qualification for all staff working directly with children across the childcare sector.  <\/p><p>  I am now introducing a requirement that all staff working directly with children in pre-school services must hold a major award in early childhood care and education at FETAC Level 5 or the equivalent, and that all pre-school leaders delivering the ECCE programme must hold a major award in early childhood care and education at FETAC Level 6 or the equivalent.  These minimum qualification requirements will apply to existing pre-school services from September 2015.  They will apply from September 2014 in respect of pre-school services registering with the Child and Family Agency from that date. <\/p><p>  I have obtained a funding allocation of &euro;3m over the years 2014\/2015 in order to support childcare workers, both in the community and in the private sector, seeking to obtain the necessary qualifications.  This funding will be administered by Pobal through the Learner Fund initiative, which I recently announced.  Pobal will be assisted in the administration of the Fund by the local City and County Childcare Committees.  The Fund will assist existing staff working directly with children in registered early years services to meet the new requirements and will be used to subsidise the cost for eligible learners to undertake accredited Level 5 and Level 6 courses provided by certain approved training providers. Training courses subsidised under this Fund are expected to commence in September 2014. Full details of the eligibility criteria and how to apply are available on the Pobal website.  Information was also provided through the Childcare Committees and through voluntary childcare organisations, as well as on my Department's website.<\/p><p>  In relation to the person referred to by the Deputy, she did not obtain an exit award at Level 5 or Level 6 on the National Framework of Qualifications (NFQ).  The completion of Stage 1 of the BA in Montessori (which was offered through the College of Commerce in association with St Nicholas Montessori) does not equate to a Major Award at Level 6.

The decision to limit smear tests to women aged 25 and over was made following careful consideration of the risks of cervical cancer and the benefits of population screening, based on the examination of evidence by both Irish and international experts.  In that regard the recommendation from the International Agency on Cancer Research is that effective population based cervical screening programmes should be aimed at women aged over 25 years.<\/p><p>  Cancer of the cervix is extremely rare in women aged under 25.   While changes in the cells of the cervix are very common for this age cohort, in the vast majority of cases, these changes will settle and return to normal without intervention.
