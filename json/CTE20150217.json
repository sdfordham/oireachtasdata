We are on first name terms at this stage.  On the three previous occasions, I was representing the Donegal island fisherman.  At our last meeting on the advice of the Joint Sub-Committee on Fisheries, which is recommendation 20 of the report, we were advised to organise and set up an all-islands body, which I am glad to say we have done.  I am chair and spokesperson of this group called the Irish Islands Marine Resource Organisation, IIMRO.  I am joined by Mr. John Walsh, from Bere Island, County Cork; Mr. Enda Conneely, from Inis O&iacute;rr, County Galway; and Mr. James O'Toole, from Clare Island, County Mayo.  Unfortunately Mr. John O'Brien was left on the island and he could not get off it this morning.  That is the beauty of island life, I suppose.<br\/><br\/>This group has done much work setting up a committee and we are in constant contact on matters pertaining to fisheries and the marine on our islands.  We refer to the report of Joint Sub-Committee on Fisheries, which was launched on Inis O&iacute;rr in January 2014.  We welcomed many of the report's recommendations, but now we feel these recommendations must be implemented.  IIMRO has prioritised four of these recommendations to be implemented initially.<br\/><br\/>For example, recommendation No. 10 refers to the feasibility of the issuance of a heritage licence to island communities.  This recommendation is of great importance and we feel that it needs to be acted on immediately.<br\/><br\/>IIMRO proposed to co-ordinate with existing groups such as the interdepartmental marine co-ordination group, MCG.  While that may not be possible, it could be some other group.  That group is chaired by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine and it meets monthly.  We propose we should have input into the MCG as part of a working group that deals with the report's recommendations.  We welcome the newly formed fisheries forum the Minister has set up to deal with the inshore fisheries.  I am part of that nationally and regionally.  However, this group's terms of reference do not address the full concerns of islanders and island life.<br\/><br\/>I will elaborate on recommendation No. 10 after I give my colleagues a chance to introduce themselves.<br\/><br\/>Much voluntary time and effort has gone into setting up this group and we feel that we have held up our end of the bargain.  We now feel that this committee has a responsibility to implement the recommendations, as it promised to do in January 2014.  We were assured this report would not gather dust, and it is to be hoped that with the help of members of the committee, this will not be the case.<br\/><br\/>The revised Common Fisheries Policy Basic Regulations 2014 state:<blockquote>Member States should endeavour to give preferential access for small scale, artisanal or coastal fishermen.<br \/><br \/>Small offshore islands which are dependent on fishing should, where appropriate, be especially recognised and supported in order to enable them to survive and prosper in the future.<\/blockquote>This was a huge recognition, but we need help from the Government and from this committee to get the benefits down to an island level.  IIMRO is totally committed to working with the State to make this possible, but we need resources, guidance and help to move things forward.<br\/><br\/>Once again, I thank members of the committee for their time and I hope that after this meeting we will finally have a roadmap to sustainable island communities which we can all feed into and be a part of.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Early"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":11,"content":"<p>Mr. Early said he had four of the recommendations.

The committee does not have the power to implement recommendations but it can push for them to be implemented.

A heritage licence is one recommendation, but which of the other recommendations should be prioritised?  We should have departmental officials attend and put them to the pin of their collar to determine why this is not happening or what progress has been made.  Perhaps there has been some, but we should find out what it is in order that we can relay it to the witnesses.<\/p><p> On a recent delegation to Brussels, we raised with Commission officials the issue of the heritage licence.  They told us that the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, seemed like it would be a useful mechanism for implementing the likes of a heritage licence.  We referenced the report in detail, a copy of which the officials had seen, and asked whether any of its recommendations could not be implemented in Ireland.  They saw no major issue with any of them.  In terms of the funding mechanisms for a number of the recommendations, however, they stated that they would have to examine EMFF proposals before allowing applications for funding further down the line.  A hearing with the Department on the EMFF guidelines might be useful.  I understand that it is drafting them currently by using Brussels' guidelines and putting an Irish slant on them.  They will outline what schemes will be available under the EMFF.  Which recommendation would the witnesses prioritise for funding through the EMFF or other mechanisms?<\/p><p> An issue pertinent to the islands has arisen since the report was conducted, namely, the Leader funding of Comhar na nOile&aacute;n.  Another source of funding of which islanders are able to avail, it is hanging in the balance and no one is clear how matters stand.  What are the implications for the fisheries industry and people living on the islands?  Perhaps we should address the matter and add further recommendations relating to it.<\/p><p> A number of people have raised issues about fish farming and aquaculture.  The Minister has stated that, since entering office, he has issued no aquaculture licences.

It is good to have them here.  I must admit that I know little about fishing, but I am prepared to learn.  I come from County Leitrim, which has a short coastline of only 2 km.  There is not much fishing.  Normally, the first salmon of the year is caught in the Drowes but, as far as I know, people are still waiting.  I saw gentlemen fishing at the Drowes yesterday.  Previously, the committee discussed the problem of salmon not coming from Donegal.<\/p> <p>  Two or two and a half years ago, I met a gentleman in Galway who had a problem.  He had a processing factory and felt that it was difficult for smaller fishermen to operate because large boats were coming in and taking away much of the mackerel and herring from his area.  However, some of the Minister's work has helped him.  Since I met him, he has gone back into business and employs approximately ten people.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the issues raised by the witnesses, I will work with my colleagues to ensure that whatever can be done will be done.

What we have put down is a wish list.  However, when it is recommended in a Common Fisheries Policy, it is more than that.  Whether through the forums around the country or through a directive from the Department, we need to get that sort of action plan into the mind set of those forums so that it can become a reality on the ground.  Mr. Early referenced recommendation No. 10.  Recommendations Nos. 11, 12, 13 and 14 are very relevant to the island communities in particular.  Recommendation No. 15, on extending the 12 mile limit, may be something we should examine further, but that will take a lot of effort.  The other recommendations are tailored to island and coastal communities and traditional inshore fishing.  We must try to get a formula to develop an implementation group.  A lot of work went into this report from our end.  From a job satisfaction point of view, we do not want it to end up on a shelf.  We want to see some action.  This is why the delegates are here today, as an initial point of engagement.  <\/p><p> We would be glad to hear the delegates' views on the questions asked.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#G00200","speaker":"1124","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":22,"content":"<p>I will introduce myself to the committee.  My name is John Walsh and I am from Bere Island.  I am the chairman of Comhar na nOile&aacute;n.  This is my second time attending before the committee.  On the last occasion when we were invited to make a submission on behalf of the islands, we used research on the fishing industry which had been carried out by Comhdh&aacute;il Oile&aacute;in na h&Eacute;ireann, the islands' representative group.  It hired a man called Nick Pfeiffer, who is an expert in the area, to carry out research on the fishing industry.  He interviewed all the fishermen across the islands.  We presented his report to the committee and much of the report found its way into the committee's report, which was great, and we appreciated it.<\/p> <p>  The recommendation we got from the committee on that previous occasion was for the islands to get together because we were too dispersed.  We went away and did that.  We are back here today to tell the committee that we have pulled ourselves together.  We got fishermen from Cork, Galway, Mayo and Donegal together.  We had two or three meetings in Galway.  We held a conference there with experts from different places to speak to the fishermen.  We are now asking the committee where we should go now.  We need its assistance.  The Chairman spoke about an implementation group.  We would be looking for this as well.  This could be a working group which we could part of and through which we could work with other people.  We consider a partnership approach is needed.  We are not going to do it on our own; the committee will not do it on its own.  If we work together, we will achieve something.  <\/p> <p>  The islands are under pressure population-wise.  The national inshore fisheries forum is only being bedded in at the moment.  We are in more of a hurry than that.  We need to work with it, but we need an independent islands group because the islands are different.  From my experience of work with islands, whether fishing, tourism or farming, it always needs something a bit different.  The recommendation from the Common Fisheries Policy shows that Europe sees this now as well.  If we all work together, we can definitely achieve something.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Early referred to the recommendations, and especially No. 10 on heritage licensing.  I spoke to many fishermen in west Cork over the past few days.  They see boats coming in with 400 or 500 pots and they have just their punts and 50 or 60 pots.  They always managed to make a living, but the islands life was always based on seasonality where the people did a bit of farming, a bit of fishing and a bit of tourism.  This kept the islands going.  The main industries of fishing and farming are going.  The population is being eroded as well.  It is vital, therefore, that we get all the parts to start working together again to ensure the sustainability of the islands.  I am also a member of the fisheries local area development scheme, FLAG.  To my mind, there are definitely opportunities in this for the islands.  However, more than funding is required.  It needs partnership working.  If we get a group together in a room and we all have the common approach that we need to do something and work together, everything else will fall into place.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#H00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":23,"content":"<p>When the report was prepared by the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, we did not have any say in the recommendations.

From our perspective, the NIFF is not specialised enough to deal with the issues specific to islands.  We need a specialist approach.<\/p> <p>  The FLAG situation involves regional areas and communities.  It is only funded at the present time to deal with small-scale issues.  That brings us back to the islands and scale.  Deputy &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned the current issues peculiar to aquaculture.  The agencies are using EU funding which we think should be directed towards coastal communities.  The funding seems to be going to large multinational entities rather than areas of future potential.  It seems to be focused on one particular form of aquaculture which we would consider to be nearing the end of its current life span.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Enda Conneely:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We must be very careful about how EU funding is targeted and spent.  We need to have an aquaculture industry that is of a scale suitable to islands but which also encompasses different species.  We should be looking to lead the new wave that is coming in this area rather than what is happening at the moment, namely, that funding is being targeted in one particular direction.<\/p><p> In regard to the Common Fisheries Policy, there is a European-wide issue because islands are recognised as special cases.  We have a scale issue in that we are quite small.  We have been there for generations and have operated with the resources we had.  There is a danger at the moment in that we need to focus in some way on retaining the ownership of, for instance, seaweed rights that we have traditionally had on the islands.  Even a pilot scheme in this regard would be useful to see how we might deal with these types of issue as islands.  If we had, say, a zone of control or some other mechanism that would allow us to have input into what actually happens, that would be helpful.  It would not necessarily be up to the 12-mile limit, because that is a longer-term issue, but some immediate measure that would allow us to have some local management and access to earmarked resources for the islands would be a start.<\/p><p>Reference was made to the first salmon of the year.  There are rivers in Ireland with very low salmon stocks.  One option would be to look at the Alaskan model which involves restocking and a form of ranching.  It is something that has not been analysed too carefully, as far as I can see, but it is an idea we could explore, especially for the Donegal islands.<\/p><p> Returning to the question of scale, we see in other European countries that boats can come into a small port and people can buy the fish directly off it.  That is established practice all over Europe.  If one goes anywhere in Italy, France or Spain, for instance, it is possible to buy top-quality fish in a local area.  We are constrained by seasons and by size in that we have only a small inshore fleet, but there is scope there and it would tie in nicely with the Wild Atlantic Way initiative.  The inhabited islands should be included in that initiative.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#K00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Enda Conneely","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":38,"content":"<p>Although it does not relate directly to fishing, I note the additional measures under Pillar 2 of the rural development plan whereby islands have been given enhanced payments, which is helpful to the farming sector.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#L00200","speaker":"1103"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":39,"content":"<p>With all due respect to the Chairman, we are not here to represent farmers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#L00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Jerry Early"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":40,"content":"<p>I accept that.

It is an honour to attend.<\/p> <p>  As members will see, we are seeking a &euro;790 million allocation for 2015.  We can stand over the value that we are yielding from the budgets the committee is giving us.  The amount is broken down into capital expenditure of &euro;489 million and current expenditure of &euro;301 million.  Our capital expenditure shows a modest improvement and we continue to make savings on the current side.  The one factor that members must watch out for is the 27th pay day in 2015, which may result in a change.  There is also a technical adjustment, in that &euro;39 million is being switched from the current side of the capital side.  Members should bear these factors in mind when assessing the Estimate.<\/p> <p>  This is a year in which we can expect solid progress across all of the areas in which we operate.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland had a record year.  Significantly, Enterprise Ireland's net employment creation exceeded that of IDA Ireland for the first time in a number of years.  This shows the powerful recovery that is occurring in many Irish-owned, export-oriented enterprises.  I do not know whether the figures are presented in this document, but members will also see that there has been a diversification in Enterprise Ireland companies' export destinations.  Many committee members have been keen to see this, with emerging markets becoming a more significant player.  What economists call Irish companies' export propensity - in other words, the percentage of their output that they export - is steadily increasing.  The committee is seeing a strong fight back by Irish companies finding new markets and using exports as a key driver of recovery.  We are improving in competitiveness rankings.  As the Minister of State, Deputy English, will undoubtedly point out, our ranking in terms of the impact of our innovation spend is also improving.  We are showing good, solid progress.<\/p> <p>  We are also continuing to undertake structural reforms within the Department.

The reforms play an important part in ensuring that we yield value for money.  They are reflected in the Estimate.  In April, we dissolved the county enterprise boards, CEBs, and established local enterprise offices, LEOs.  Since then and under the new service-level agreement with Enterprise Ireland, there has been a new dynamic in those offices.  As the CEOs of local authorities, county and city managers are significant new drivers of enterprise.  This alliance is working well and the LEOs are showing a good impact.  They have rolled out new projects successfully, for example, for young entrepreneurs.  They are also showing an impact on micro-finance, where the take-up level has nearly doubled.  They have been key agents.<\/p> <p>  We have dissolved Forf&aacute;s.  Deputy Calleary is concerned that, since its functions were brought into the Department, we have blunted Forf&aacute;s, but that is not the case.  It has been key to driving the Action Plan for Jobs and, through the National Competitiveness Council, continues to have an edge in its work.  Shannon Development was formally dissolved.  We merged the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  The new commission is settling down well.  We passed the Companies Act 2014, which is major legislation.

He is also progressing the construction contracts legislation, which members will be aware had been held up.  <\/p><p> Looking to the future, we are seeking to identify the areas we need to continue to improve.  There is no doubt that the two main areas in this regard are entrepreneurship, where we can significantly improve our performance, and regional development.  Although every region has experienced overall employment growth, including through Enterprise Ireland and IDA, as measured by the QNHS there is no doubt that we can improve our capacity to exploit the potential of our regions.  This is something I am very keen to do.  We are starting a process this year which I hope will drive that forward in a way that has not been done before.  We are looking forward to a high quality of application for some of the competitive funds we are setting.  Our hope is that not only will this result in a more concerted action by the existing agencies in the regions, with a much more strategic look by those agencies at the regions, but that the process will act as a catalyst for the many other players in the regions in terms of their impact on enterprise growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#D00400","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":83,"content":"<p>We will now consider the Revised Estimate and, in particular, performance and expenditure proposals for 2015, programme by programme commencing with programme A - jobs and enterprise development.

However, is it a matter of concern to the Minister that while 15,012 jobs were created in 2014, 7,881 jobs were lost in IDA client companies, which equates to 52% of the number of jobs created?  It is a similar story in terms of Enterprise Ireland.  Is any work being done within the Department on identifying the reason for this high proportion of job losses?  Given the level of investment and fantastic effort that went into securing those 15,000 jobs, what work is being done to identify where those jobs are being lost?<\/p><p> The Minister announced last week that under the IDA building programme for 2015 onwards, it is proposed to construct more advance units.

The Deputy is correct to alert us to job losses, but that rate of job loss in the context of the IDA's total portfolio is 4%, which is one of the lowest on record.  It is marginally higher than last year, but last year it was at an extraordinarily low level.  We take a very keen interest in companies in difficulty.  The IDA has a substantial transformation programme targeted at identifying companies that need improvement in some area or another.  This year, for the first time, we are introducing a budget in the Action Plan for Jobs focused on lean processes to be applied in those companies and on management development to be available to the IDA.  Some of the EI programmes that were in place and which have established a track record are now being extended into the IDA.  Indeed, some of the lean process is done by EI on behalf of the IDA, so we are expanding the knowledge that was learned in Enterprise Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The same can be said of Enterprise Ireland, although I do not have the exact percentages.  Again, last year was higher than the previous year, but it was a very low number in the previous year.  What we saw in 2014 was something of a comeback in the level of job losses in some of the company base.  However, I expect that in the recession years there was a big shake-out and that left something of a dip, but we are well below what would traditionally be a norm for a job loss rate.  Nevertheless, the Deputy is correct and we are very alert to it.  It is key.  Maintaining a job is much easier than creating a new one, certainly in Enterprise Ireland companies.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the new units, the midland building is located at the IDA Garrycastle business and technology park.  It is 2,600 sq. m.  I will get the Deputy an update on the exact state of play on that, as I do not have the latest one with me.<\/p> <p>  On the LEO job creation, the LEOs are reporting full-time gains of 3,127 and part-time gains of 1,132.

I welcome the success in 2014.  Already this year, 2015, we have had major jobs announcements, including in my own area of Galway.  I welcome the increased allocations in the Estimates for those areas, including allocations for IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the future, it is grand, as far as I know, to allow Northern Ireland to set its own corporation tax rate.

Would this be an opportunity for Ireland?  Have IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland mentioned the development in their negotiations?  Jobs are not created overnight; it is a long-term process.  I would like the delegation to comment on the matter. <\/p> <p>  In regard to LEOs, there has been an increase in funding, and one of the outcomes is the implementation of 31 local enterprise development plans.  Is the Minister confident that each LEO is properly funded?  I am not talking about my own county.

The competition for foreign direct investment is fierce.  Anything that is good for the island of Ireland's economy is really good for all of us.  I have no concerns on that front.  We compete all the time and we will continue to compete.  Obviously what might happen in the United Kingdom referendum in 2017 is an issue on which one will comment with a certain level of caution.  Other people are making decisions about their future.  In the natural course of such things, it throws up threats and opportunities.  I think the balance of advantage for Ireland as a country is to see Britain remain in the European Union.  Britain is our main trading partner, but of course we do not control the outcome of the referendum and we have to look at how we minimise the threats and take the opportunities that come as a result of such decisions.  While there is very active assessment of this, we will not try to influence the decisions of the British.  We work with the UK all the time, we have a very close relationship and clearly that relationship will remain.<\/p><p> The local enterprise offices, LEOs were established with both the existing complement of staff from the county enterprise boards and an incoming complement of staff from the local authorities.

We have specific permission also to have a graduate programme so we will be introducing graduates not to replace the core strength of the existing LEOs but to improve customer delivery and service and so on.  Obviously we are looking at this very closely.  There are four positions for head of enterprise currently being advertised in different areas by the Public Appointments Service.  Some unevenness has been inherited from the existing structure but we are trying to ensure we deliver an even service, and as resources become available, we will strengthen services.

Does the Minister of State, Deputy English wish to make a brief opening statement?<\/p><p>I cannot repeat or stress often enough that innovation is at the heart of competitive advantage.  If one looks at the companies that are engaged in innovation and research and development, the case is proven by the increase in exports and the creation of more jobs.  Consecutive governments in the past 15 years have enjoyed success.  Our aim is to continue to build on that.  We invest &euro;730 million annually in research, which is a significant investment.  We constantly monitor it and keep working on it to ensure we get the results from it.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, commented on the question of global rankings, but let me add that we are first in the world for the availability of skilled labour, we are 11th in the global innovation index in 2014, and we are 13th in the world for university, industry preparation and research and development.  We are punching above our weight in some categories and that is where we want to be.<\/p><p> The key highlights for 2014 is the 102 high venture start-ups with a three-year commitment of more than 1,500 jobs.  There have been more than 1,700 collaborations between industry, third level institutions and Science Foundation Ireland researchers supporting the development of close business links between industry and research and the research system.  We are trying to build on that.  The plans for 2015 will be to enhance that relationship and to encourage more SMEs to get involved in the research community.  Five new research centres have been funded by SFI through an investment of &euro;155 million.  We thought it would have been two centres but five is a success story this year.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUS&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Some 475 students and researchers have been appointed on structured PhD and emerging technology programmes.  This is another example of something we want to encourage.  Since we last met, we have published Ireland's first national directory of research centres of scale.  Some Deputies will have a copy of the directory in front of them.  This important point of contact will flag to people looking in how the system works and where they can make contact.<\/p><p> The first national innovation showcase, which was held at the National Convention Centre, was a great success.  It was fully subscribed.  It was probably over-booked.  Over 2,000 entrepreneurs, industry representatives and researchers from around the country were involved that day.  It worked out very well.  Many relationships were developed and many connections were made on the day.  It is something we want to build on.  I am not sure when we will have the next one.  We will learn from this one.  Industry feedback has been very good.  We will be aiming to hold another event, in 2015 if possible.  The aim behind this is to develop our Horizon 2020 applications.  If we are to achieve our targets in this regard, there needs to be much more involvement from the SME sector and from the multinationals.  Our higher education institutions are probably doing their bit in terms of percentages, but we need to get a greater involvement from business as well.<\/p><p> I have touched on a few areas.

The view taken by the HSA is that resources need to be directed towards farm safety walks, discussions groups and this type of engagement.  Inspections in isolation do not seem to be bringing down the number of fatalities.  There is a huge job of work to be done by all of us to raise awareness.  We in public office and the representative organisations, including the IFA and the ICMSA, must work closely with the HSA and other relevant organisations to try to create a wider awareness of farm safety.  This is a priority for me.  The Health and Safety Authority and I plan over the next couple of months to hold a series of events throughout the country on what is called Workers' Memorial Day to raise awareness of safety in the workplace.  This will include farms as well.  I am quite positive about the approach being taken in terms of farm safety walks.  People in my community in Louth have engaged in such processes and have found them useful.

We have modelled this very closely on the budget for the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the arrangements will be the same.  It will be staffed, in an advisory capacity, by staff from the Department who will work to support the low pay commission.  The Estimate breaks down as &euro;270,000 current pay and &euro;230,000 current non-pay.  There will be significant resources, therefore, to allow it to carry out and commission research where gaps emerge.  For those who have seen the terms of reference, which I distributed to the committee recently, and the heads of the Bill, the data sets that the low pay commission will use to arrive at its annual recommendation for an appropriate national minimum wage are clear.  Where there are gaps, the commission will be enabled to initiate research to fill those gaps to ensure that it can arrive at a rate for the national minimum wage in an evidence-based and robust way.  The work will start very soon.

The truth is that Irish enterprise and Irish workers have shown remarkable resilience in the face of difficult circumstances.  We have seen them finding new markets, going further afield, applying innovation and applying more lean processes to become globally competitive.  They have been extraordinarily successful in this regard.  We have yet to see the confirmed Enterprise Ireland expert numbers but it appears they have performed exceptionally well in 2014, certainly beyond wildest expectations.  With their backs to the wall, people have shown fantastic ingenuity.<\/p> <p>  Another encouraging aspect is that we are beginning to see start-ups on a far wider scale.  It is heartening to see the growth in the numbers of people starting their own business.  Moreover, the indication is that the number of people who would consider starting their own business is even higher or at least showing greater growth.  There seems to be a good climate here.<\/p> <p>  The challenge for all of us is to ensure that the policy regimes sustain these changes.  This good growth has not happened by accident.  We have moved mountains across all Departments, not only ours, to consider the skills base, the tax mix as well as the things we do in the areas of health, education, the environment and infrastructure to make it easier.  These policies must be sustained.  We need to be competitive in the long term if we are to achieve sustainable full employment.<\/p> <p>  Twice in a generation I have seen a situation where the country has had within its grasp the capability of becoming a full employment economy on a sustainable basis.  However, we lost the run of ourselves and committed to unsustainable policies that simply fell flat on their face.  Significant damage was done.  One of the things we need to learn is that policy matters.  The type of sustained policies we have been trying to put in place are important for the long term for this economy as well as for our capacity to provide employment for people who genuinely want to stay here.  Perhaps this does not apply to everyone.  Some people will want to travel.  However, we need to be able to get back to a position where anyone who wishes it can choose to work in this economy, and we are on the way.  Unemployment and emigration are coming down, but we need to sustain the approach.<\/p><p>I wish to add to the comments of Deputy Conaghan.  It seems more jobs are becoming available as well.  There is an issue now in respect of ensuring we have the skills to fill all the jobs being created, now and in the months and years ahead.<\/p><p> Under the Action Plan for Jobs, one of the indicators of performance is the national talent drive.  This involves making sure we have a good deal of home-grown talent to fill these jobs, but it will make it a little easier to bring in talent from abroad, when necessary, to augment that supply.<\/p><p> This committee has considered reports over the years which have identified areas like apprenticeships, where we have to change how we do it.  The main aim of this year's Action Plan for Jobs is to have a further engagement between industry and the education system to ensure we are developing the skills and the jobs we need.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUS&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There may be a role, following on from some of the previous reports, in making that connection.  <\/p><p>The new apprenticeship council, which was formed before Christmas, has made a call for proposals from industry, representative bodies and so on for new apprenticeship suggestions.  Various Departments are now out beating the bushes to get people, organisations and industries interested and coming in with their ideas.  We need to do some work to make sure this happens.<\/p><p> We need to develop schemes that have on-the-job training, involve employers in identifying courses, needs and so on, and make sure they are involved in training and outputs.  This is important because there is no point in creating jobs in six months' time if we cannot fill them with people who are living in the country.  A lot of work needs to be done and we are focused on it.  It is in the Action Plan for Jobs.  The committee was part of that in recent years and we need to build on it.  <\/p><p> There is an awareness issue, and industry has to step up.  There is no point in members of the committee telling people around the country that they could employ 50 or 60 people if they will not get involved in training them to make sure the skills exist.

As a Minister of State with responsibility for SMEs, I have had the opportunity over the past few months to travel around the country and talk to SME owners and managers about their experiences.  We are now in an entirely different space even compared to two years ago.  There is now much more confidence out there.  The local enterprise office approach is working.  I visited quite a number of them over the past few weeks.  That is not to say there are not still challenges.  We need to keep a very close eye on their resources and make sure they are supported in developing over the next period and meeting the challenges that exist.  One of the most significant things Ministers and Ministers of State can do over the next period is to marshal through regional economic strategies.  It is no longer any use to try to create the impression that every region of the country is competing for the same type of foreign direct investment.  We need a balanced regional approach.  <\/p> <p>  The regional economic strategies will essentially be an action plan for jobs at a local and regional level.  That is a process initiated by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and Department officials.  It is a strategy that has been proven to work.  We will see a process whereby local agencies such as the IDA or Enterprise Ireland will take responsibility for driving these strategies and showing leadership at a local level - working with local authorities, third level institutes, local enterprise offices and so on - to make sure we get the balanced regional economic activity that we need.  There is very little point in having an economic recovery that is focused on our main cities.  We will spread that right across the country and will have a very involved process in terms of developing regional strategies.<\/p> <p>  It is also important that we have harmonious industrial relations and progressive legislation - it is recognised that our legislation is the best in developed economies - which is developed in partnership with employers and trade unions in the way that we seek to address issues around the REA and collective bargaining legislation.  It is important that we do that in collaboration and partnership with employers, trade unions and those who represent working people.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to balanced economic development, I do not mean just regional development.  I also mean making work pay and making sure that people are always better off in work rather than ensnared in a social welfare system from which they cannot get out.  The best thing we can do is to provide somebody with the dignity of a job, and that is what we are all committed to doing.  We have seen our economy recover considerably over the recent past.  There is still a lot to do, and we are all very focused on that in terms of regional strategies and all the work we are doing in the Department.  We can be positive and optimistic about the future.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to keep a sharper eye on small craft industries which sometimes go unnoticed.  One such industry started in a prefab in a VEC school in Ballyfermot 14 years ago and was the beginning of the modern film animation industry.

They might tap into institutes of education, for instance, or tap into a chamber of commerce with accountancy support.  There is scope to have an entrepreneur in residence or available as an advisory resource.  Those little hubs have good potential to step up their performance, and that is what we hope will come out of this regional call.  We want people to consider how they can tap into available resources and make more of what they currently have and are doing.  One idea might be seek the assistance of a local person who is recognised as an entrepreneur made good and get some momentum behind particular initiatives.

As part of the new rural development plan, that programme might not be approved until the end of year.  In other words, because of the changeover with the Common Agricultural Policy regime and the rural development programme, the programme is effectively in abeyance.  Will the Minister comment on that?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Nash, referred to the provision of rural broadband services.  I acknowledge that the roll-out plan is proceeding and there is European Commission approval for state aid.  However, it is vital that progress be made as quickly as possible.  Is there potential to expedite the tendering process?  Even though good plans have been put forward by Vodafone in co-operation with various groups, they are targeting places that already have adequate broadband.  In fact, there is reference to the 50 largest towns, which includes Dublin, Galway and other urban centres.  I understand there are commercial reasons for that, but the problem is that it is the areas outside these urban centres which are dealing with inadequate service.<\/p> <p>  My final point is more of a political one, but it seems okay to raise it as there are only Government Members present.  We are well on our way to achieving the target of creating 100,000 new jobs during the Government's term in office.  I am concerned, however, that the target of 40,000 for this year is a little ambitious.  Of course ambition is good and I hope the target is exceeded.  However, in the event that 35,000 or 38,000 new jobs are created, which would still be a tremendous achievement, my concern is that we will see headlines about the Government failing to meet its jobs target.  There has been great progress in recent years on the job creation front, but the Minister will understand my concern in this regard.<\/p><p>We see the regional enterprise strategy, like the Action Plan for Jobs, as being an annual event.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, is working on the issue of broadband provision and a tender will be drawn up later in the year, but there is a lot that can be done with our existing resources.  We are very much about looking to see what we can do today that will enhance the performance of a region in the next 12 months.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Richard Bruton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=119\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Richard Bruton\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUS&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Richard Bruton\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A year from now, we can consider what can be done afresh.  We should not stop what we are doing just because the Leader programme might be postponed.  At the end of March we will be calling on local enterprise offices and community enterprise centres to commence the process of encouraging people to consider how they might enhance the assets they already possess.<\/p><p> When we declared our ambition of creating 100,000 new jobs, people said we were overestimating what was possible.  All the critics stated that if various Departments' statistics were taken into account, it was obvious that what we were seeking to do could not happen.  However, it has happened.  I am of the view that there is an opportunity to push on in this regard.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland companies are performing strongly and the construction industry, although coming off a very low base, is moving again.  Parts of the retail sector will struggle as a result of the switch to trading online, but other areas of it are showing a strong recovery.  If we can put in place some of the things to which I refer, encourage entrepreneurship and make it easier to start up businesses, then we will deliver on those targets.  I would not be disappointed if, ultimately, we were to hit 95% and fall slightly short.  We have been in the businesses of setting stretched targets all through this process and we can stand over what we are delivering in this regard.<\/p><p>I congratulate the Minister and Ministers of State on the work they have done.  A Government Deputy would almost be expected to say that but I genuinely mean it.<br\/><br\/>We are in a different place now than was the case four years ago in the context of what is available for SMEs.  When one is driving to work, one regularly hears radio advertisements relating to the Credit Review Office, access to finance, etc.  However, is a person who owns a shop in Phibsborough, which I might pass on my way home, aware of what is available to him or her?  I accept that it is not possible to knock on the door of every SME throughout the country and spend an hour explaining to its owners the massive suite of options that exists and the fact that they may be able to avail of some of those options.  The Minister referred to the <i>actionplanforjobs.ie<\/i>website and there is also the online tool for SMEs.  These are great but what sort of checks are in place to ensure that the maximum number of people possible are using those tools?  In the computer age in which we live, websites are windows and those windows require to be changed almost daily.  I mean this in the most respectful way but I remain somewhat unconvinced with regard to this matter.  As the Minister and Ministers of State will be aware because they meet them regularly, there are those in the SME sector who perform three jobs, for which they receive a single salary, and who work around the clock.  Sometimes these people, when checking their post each day, might miss some material relating to that which we are discussing.  That material could take the form of a very important document which might, for example, highlight some of the really good things being done by the Government to improve the SME platform in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>What checks are in place to monitor whether the tools which have been developed, particularly those available online, are being used by sufficient numbers of people to ensure that <i>actionplanforjobs.ie<\/i>is both reaching its target audience and paying for itself?  Essentially, there is a job to be done in terms of monitoring the advertising of the various schemes to ensure that those schemes are working for us.  I am a member of the Ballymun Civic Alliance, which replaced Ballymun Regeneration.  The local enterprise office is represented on the alliance and one of the other members is an individual who runs a very successful business on Dublin's northside.  People, SMEs and other organisations involved with the Ballymun Civic Alliance and bodies like it are all clued in to what is happening.  I am concerned about those people who are not aware of what is going on because they are not involved in this way.  I am sometimes of the view that I might know more than the owners of SMEs about the various services that are available to them.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Lyons:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2307\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy John Lyons\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUS&amp;amp;memberid=2307&amp;amp;pid=JohnLyonsLab&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy John Lyons\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is not a criticism but a concern.

To assuage my concerns, will the Minister consider including a budget line for the National Competitiveness Council so I can see where the money is?<\/p><p>The National Competitiveness Council is a group of people serviced by the strategic policy unit of the Department.  It is not a spending centre.  It commissions consultancy reports and publishes reports, and is entirely independent.  A new chairman has just been appointed.  I strengthened the council by including industry partners who are actively engaged in key sectors and we have an effective body.  It is not a question of a line in the budget; the real issue is to ensure our strategic policy unit is a real driver of new thinking in the Department, and at present it is working on enterprise 2025.  Traditionally the Department has had strong agencies and a weak Department.  Forf&aacute;s was outsourced and largely run under the auspices of the agencies.  The idea of bringing it in is to give the Department a stronger arm in being able to think afresh, which we are determined to do.  We established a protocol at the very start to ensure Forf&aacute;s would not be sucked into line management and would retain its independence and capacity to produce reports without fear or favour.  It is not so much about Forf&aacute;s being a line in the budget, but about giving it this independence.

I intend to co-operate closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As I said to Deputy Kyne while the Deputy had stepped out, the number of farm fatalities are worrying.  The HSA will direct resources into the area of farm safety and walks, and also discussion groups.  They are important to get to the harder-to-reach farmers and I believe that has to come from the community with the support of the HSA.  That would be a progressive way of spending Health and Safety Authority resources.  Obviously inspections are very important but they, of themselves, do not save enough lives.  There is never an acceptable level of fatalities on farms.<\/p> <p>  The Irish Farmers' Association, IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, and other organisations work very well together.  I was very impressed when I visited them at the National Ploughing Championships.  Their level of commitment to this whole space is truly astonishing.  They see the importance of it, as do we and as does the whole system.  We must work hard to make sure we can get those numbers down.

We are beginning to see an energy from the people working in our State agencies and from the people with ideas now that there are supports in place that they can identify.  It is tremendous to meet and engage with them and see their energy and hear of their ideas and innovations.  A key factor is that supports are now in place.<br\/><br\/>I was lucky enough yesterday to be invited to Offaly Local Development Company's business development programme certificate launch for a number of the people who participated in it.

I will preface my remarks by addressing two issues.  First, I wish to inform the committee that the Institute of International and European Affairs has just finished editing a book on Great Britain and Europe that we expect to publish on the web early in March and as a printed book later in March so it may be of some help to the committee in its studies.<\/p> <p>  Second, the situation in the UK is very uncertain and entirely unpredictable.  The Prime Minister, David Cameron, has said that he wants to have a referendum in 2017.  We in the institute think that regardless of whether Mr. Cameron is re-elected, a referendum in the UK is likely in the next few years and that, in practice, this referendum will be of an \"in-out\" nature.  However, we do not know what the British want.  The Prime Minister has said that if he has a successful renegotiation with Europe, he will recommend a \"Yes\" vote.  The British Government has not made clear what it actually wants in a renegotiation so this is uncertain.  There will be one negotiation between now and whenever there is a referendum but we do not know what it will be and we do not know what the issues are.<\/p> <p>  When the referendum comes, we do not know whether it will result in a vote to remain within the EU or a vote to withdraw from it.  If it is a vote to withdraw from the EU, there will then be a negotiation period which will probably take the best part of two years.  This negotiation will essentially be led by the European Council but most of the work will be done by the European Commission.  There is a further question regarding what will happen internally in the UK if there is a vote to withdraw.  The Scottish National Party has already said that it does not want Scotland to withdraw unless there is a majority vote in Scotland to do so.  There is great uncertainty and the possibility of two negotiations, all of which would affect Ireland's relations with the UK and Europe.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to trade.  By trade, I mean both merchandise and services.  Trade is one of the key economic linkages between Ireland and the UK.  The impact on that trade will depend on what happens in the first negotiation and the second negotiation if this takes place.  At the moment, trade between Ireland and the UK, like trade between Ireland and the rest of the EU, takes place on the basis of the EU Internal Market - the Single Market.  The British appear to be quite happy with the Single Market.  From time to time, one sees commentaries in the British press stating that they would like to remain in the Single Market.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, as I am sure some of my colleagues will mention later, some of the basic freedoms in Europe underpinning that single market are freedoms about which people in Britain are demanding serious changes, such as the free movement of people.<\/p><p> If there are negotiations following a referendum to withdraw, there is no doubt but that trade between Britain and Ireland would be affected.  That is really what we need to examine.  We also need to know how much trade there is between Britain and Ireland.  In 2012, 43% of merchandise exports from Irish-owned firms went to the United Kingdom.  The proportion of exports from non-Irish-owned firms is much lower, at about 12%.  About 20% of our services exports went from Ireland to the UK.  Therefore, should there be a change in the arrangements about trade, there will obviously be very big implications indeed for Irish exports to the UK.  In the book I mentioned earlier, there is an attempt to quantify the result on this trade, and on Ireland, of a British withdrawal from the EU.  The argument is that the effect on Irish exports, were the UK to withdraw from the EU, could be in the order of a decrease of 3.6%.  I should mention that there are so many ifs and buts in this thing that we need to examine that figure with caution, but that is the way it looks.<\/p><p> Should the British succeed in a renegotiation of their terms of membership between now and the time of a referendum, and remain in the EU, that in itself could have an effect on our trade.  Should they withdraw, however, the effect is likely to be much greater.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":160,"content":"<p>Our next contributor is Ms Siobh&aacute;n Mullally, who is a professor of law and director of the Centre for Criminal Justice and Human Rights at UCC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#D00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":161,"content":"<p>I am going to talk about the possible implications of a UK withdrawal from the EU with regard to free movement of persons.  The debate concerning the UK's membership of the EU and a possible withdrawal has centred to a considerable extent on the free movement of persons.  Proponents of reform argue that the current EU legal framework does not provide adequate safeguards to ensure the free movement of persons without overburdening member states' public finances.<\/p> <p>  The free movement of persons is protected in the EU treaties and also in the charter of fundamental rights, where we also see a protection of access to social security benefits and social advantages.  Also of relevance here is the 2004 citizens directive.  Of the proposals to reform current EU free movement law as part of a possible precondition to the UK's remaining within the EU, several of the proposals that have been raised would require a treaty amendment and unanimous approval by each of the 28 member states, followed by enactment into domestic law.  Other proposals do not require such change.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, it should be noted that one of the key concerns for Ireland will be the continuing functioning of the common travel area.  Movement between Ireland and the UK of EEA and non-EEA nationals is likely to be significantly affected should the British exit proceed.  As recently as December 2011, a joint programme of work was agreed to strengthen the security arrangements of the common travel area and to provide a framework for a more strategic approach for this co-operation.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Given this quite recent initiative and the existence of the common travel area arrangements, albeit relatively informally for a significant period, it seems likely that the UK would wish to treat Irish citizens differently from other EEA nationals should withdrawal proceed.<\/p><p> If withdrawal were to proceed, there would be a number of possible scenarios, which have been discussed.  There are uncertainties associated with each.  One possibility would be that the United Kingdom would remain as a member state of the EEA and continue to participate in the Single Market with a status similar to that currently enjoyed by Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, for example.  This would require little change to free movement rights but is unlikely to be an option given that much of the debate on withdrawal has centred on limiting free movement rights.  Discrimination between EU citizens dependent on their country of origin is likely to be problematic as a matter of EU law.<\/p><p> A second possible scenario would be bilateral negotiations whereby the United Kingdom would negotiate bilateral arrangements with selected EU member states.  This, however, would lead to significant fragmentation of free movement rights and could create difficulties, particularly for Schengen area states if all Schengen area members were not to be included in such bilateral agreements.  As such, it is likely to be politically difficult for any individual member state to negotiate bilaterally with the United Kingdom.<\/p><p> A third option would be that domestic UK laws on immigration would apply, in which case we would see a repeal of the exceptions currently provided for EEA citizens.  In such a scenario, EEA citizens and family members already in the United Kingdom may be permitted to remain - as permanent residents, for example.  Those without rights to permanent residence, particularly jobseekers, would be easier to remove given that the current protections provided by free movement law would not apply.  What we would then see would be the introduction of visa requirements for entry for work, study or family reunification.  EEA nationals would effectively be treated as third country nationals are treated at present.  A range of possible restrictions could be introduced, including visa requirements, linked, for example, to minimum income requirements, language skills and the supply of biometric information.  We would see a phenomenon akin to the current five-tier points system that applies in UK immigration law being applied to EEA nationals.  There is concern that this would lead to significant reductions in migrant workers, including highly skilled workers, coming to the United Kingdom.  Any of these scenarios would be likely to have a significant impact on the operation of the common travel area between Ireland and the United Kingdom.<\/p><p> With regard to the possible reforms that are being mooted as a precondition to the United Kingdom remaining within the EU, a number of touch on free movement.  One covers access to social security payments, including a proposal limiting access to housing benefits, social housing and tax credits for a minimum period, possibly up to four or five years.  With regard to EU citizens who are categorised as workers as defined in EU law, a change in the EU treaties would be required.  Therefore, it would seem unlikely to come into effect.  For those who are jobseekers or do not meet the definition of \"worker\" or \"former worker\", this reform would be less problematic.  The European Court of Justice judgment in the Dano case in November 2014 confirmed that limits can be placed on access to non-contributory benefits, including a requirement that the residence conditions of the citizens directive be complied with.<\/p><p> A related proposal would be that the UK Government would seek to renegotiate the principle of exportability so origin states would remain legally responsible for covering unemployment or non-contributory benefits that would, for example, be required by their own citizens for a minimum period.<\/p><p> There is some commentary that these changes would not lead to any significant changes in terms of movement of EU or EEA nationals and that they may actually lead to more vulnerable persons falling through the cracks of social protection.  It could have a significant impact on UK nationals living in other EU countries.  This, of course, is of significant concern to a number of countries, including Ireland, Spain, France and Germany, where the costs of providing health care are high and where the number of ageing UK citizens would be significant.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> A second proposed reform would be in the area of rights to family unity and family protection.  The right to private and family life is protected in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights and also, of course, under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  A proposal to impose restrictions on the entry of non-EU citizen family members in light of the Metock judgment could create difficulties and may be viewed as requiring a treaty amendment, at least with regard to those persons categorised as workers and former workers - those who derive rights from the treaties.  Other proposals - for example, to link family reunion to minimum income requirements and language skills - have already led to some criticism from the European Court of Justice.<\/p><p> A third proposed area of reform relates to the possibility of limiting rights of entry for job seekers by imposing a requirement that an EU or EEA national seeking entry to the UK be in possession of a genuine job offer.  This could raise practical difficulties, but also legal difficulties.  Currently, an EU citizen can reside for a three-month period with a valid passport and without recourse to social assistance, and thereafter the right to reside is dependent on having sufficient resources and sickness insurance.  Those EU treaty rights to free movement also apply to job seekers, which is particularly relevant here, so long as they have a genuine chance of being engaged in employment.  It is likely that a treaty amendment would be required to effect such a reform, and this would be difficult given the protections of the right to private and family life in European human rights and fundamental rights law.  Linked to that is a proposal that job seekers who do not secure employment within a six-month period could be removed.  This also would lead to difficulties and would come into conflict with decisions already given by the European Court of Justice, notably in the Antonissen case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":164,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Alan Matthews, professor of European agricultural policy at the Department of Economics at Trinity College.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#F00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":165,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to talk to the committee about the implications of a British withdrawal from the European Union for the Irish agrifood sector.  My remarks summarise a somewhat longer submission, which I have made available to the secretariat.<br\/><br\/>The former ambassador, Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh, referred to the importance of trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom, but the trade links in the agrifood sector are even more important, and more important than for any other EU country.  Approximately 51% of Ireland's total agrifood imports are from the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom takes approximately 51% - the same percentage - of our total agrifood exports.  Therefore, more than half of imports and exports of agrifood products come from and go to the United Kingdom.  These are also much higher proportions than for Irish manufacturing.  A British exit, or &quot;Brexit&quot;, from the EU could potentially lead to significant disruption of this trade.<br\/><br\/>As the previous speakers have mentioned, much would depend on the nature of the trade relationship that is put in place between the UK and the EU post-Brexit.  The various alternatives that are on the table include: membership of the European Economic Area, as in the case of Norway; membership of European Free Trade Association, EFTA, combined with literally dozens of bilateral agreements approximating the Single Market, as in the case of Switzerland; a customs union, as in the case of Turkey; a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement, as negotiated with Canada; or trade on most-favoured-nation terms without a trade agreement.  I agree with the other guests that the UK is not likely to leave the EU because it dislikes some Single Market regulations, only to sign up to these again outside the EU.  Therefore, the most likely outcome is a free trade agreement in which the UK is no longer a member of the Single Market, tariffs on most - if not all - trade between the two partners are eliminated and the United Kingdom is free to set its own trade policy, including tariffs with third countries.  In my view, there is a good possibility that in that scenario trade in agrifood products would also remain tariff-free.  I will call that the good outcome, although it is clearly less desirable than the maintenance of the <i>status quo<\/i>.  In another scenario, tariffs might be reintroduced on some primary agricultural products and the primary element of processed products, which could include important Irish exports such as beef and dairy products.  I will refer to that as the bad outcome.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Alan Matthews:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Even in the good outcome, without the reintroduction of tariffs, there would be additional costs to trading compared to the current situation.  Trade conditions would revert to what they were in the early 1990s prior to the introduction of the Single Market.  Trade costs arising, for example, from the reintroduction of Customs controls, rules of origin checks, import licence requirements as well as the additional costs of complying with two different regulatory regimes where regulatory divergence occurs, would increase.  This would put downward pressure on producer prices in Ireland and upward pressure on consumer prices, an important issue given the close integration of supermarket supply chains between the two countries.<\/p><p> The United Kingdom, given what we know about its preferences regarding food and farm prices, would be likely to adopt a less protectionist trade policy with respect to third countries.  That means its average tariff on agrifood products would likely be lower than the EU tariff it applies today.  It may also find it easier to enter into free trade agreements with extensive agricultural concessions with partners such as New Zealand, Australia, Mercosur and the United States.  For both reasons, competition on the UK market will intensify for Irish exporters, even in the good scenario.<\/p><p> Food trade, more than most, is governed by detailed regulations governing plant and animal health and safety, marketing standards, labelling requirements, allowed food ingredients and many other areas.  The greater the degree of regulatory divergence between the UK and the EU, the greater will be the costs for Irish exporters and importers.  As aversion to EU regulations is one of the driving forces behind BrExit, one would expect the UK to adopt different regulations in many areas, although there are countervailing forces such as strong UK consumer, environmental and public health organisations which will seek to maintain high standards, as well as the fact that the EU will remain the UK's largest trading partner in food and agriculture, both of which will give it an incentive to keep its regulations harmonised with the EU, perhaps by continuing to transpose EU regulations into British law.  Nonetheless, examples where different regulatory regimes might emerge include the regulation of plant pesticide products, genetically modified crops and animals, and food labelling.  These are all areas where the UK position is at variance with the EU position at the moment.  Dealing with these different standards will imply higher costs for both exporters and importers.<\/p><p> If tariffs were to be reintroduced on some elements of agrifood trade between the UK and Ireland, in what I have called the bad outcome, trading costs could be increased by much more and, in some cases, could become prohibitive.  The question of tariffs is also relevant to the introduction of an economic border between North and South of the island.  Land borders between EU and non-EU countries are not unusual and in principle, under the good scenario, would not lead to problems additional to what I have already mentioned.  Even if the UK were to pursue a less protectionist and more consumer friendly farm and food policy after BrExit, the likely change in food prices North and South of the Border would be much smaller than what we observe today as a result of exchange rate fluctuations.  However, if tariffs were reintroduced there would again be incentives to smuggle those agricultural and food products subject to high tariffs.<\/p><p> There might be a temptation among some in Ireland to welcome Britain's exit from the EU because of its traditionally hostile attitude to the Common Agricultural Policy.  However, in my view the overall impact of UK withdrawal on the future of the CAP would be rather minimal.  Partly, the succession of CAP reforms and the greater flexibility provided to member states under the 2013 reform address many of the UK concerns.  It is true the EU would lose a voice arguing for fewer exemptions and more trade liberalisation in concluding trade agreements with, for example, Mercosur or the US but on the other hand the UK is a massive net contributor to the EU budget, the largest after Germany, and it made a net contribution to that budget amounting to almost &euro;11 billion in 2013.  If the remaining member states want to maintain farm support at currently foreseen levels, they must be prepared to contribute more to the EU budget to ensure this following a BrExit.  In this calculation, some member states that now see themselves as benefiting from high CAP spending could well move to the other side of the ledger.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Alan Matthews:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> In my view, BrExit is an outcome to be avoided if that can be achieved, but if it were to happen, the Irish agrifood sector should pursue a number of objectives in the subsequent negotiations on the UK-EU trade relationship.  These include minimising the disruption to agrifood trade and particularly to avoid the reintroduction of tariffs, but also to seek to minimise the impact of regulatory differences, through continued UK adhesion to Single Market rules, at least as it relates to items such as product standards, veterinary and phytosanitary rules or through mutual recognition agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":168,"content":"<p>Thank you, Professor Matthews.

The views I would like to express are mine and not those of either the British Irish Chamber of Commerce or Dublin City University - as I go through some of my remarks, members may wonder why I said that.  As I have this opportunity to talk to the members and to have heard what the three previous speakers said, nothing I say will contradict what they have done.  The main point I want to get across is that things have changed significantly and that change is unlikely to be reversed.<br\/><br\/>I would like to start by quoting both George Osborne and Peter Spencer, the chief economist at Ernst and Young.  George Osborne recently said: <blockquote>My... goal is for Britain to become the most prosperous of any major economy by the 2030s...  <br \/><br \/>It is within the power of my generation to achieve this ...  <br \/><br \/>The ingredients are all here: <br \/><br \/>We now have the most competitive tax rates of any in the G20.<br \/><br \/>We've sharpened work incentives with tax cuts for the low paid, welfare reforms and a higher minimum wage ... <br \/><br \/>[We have also invested significantly in research and development and] We've secured the number one place in the world index for investing in infrastructure.<br \/><br \/>We' re attracting more Chinese inward investment than Germany, France and Italy put together.<br \/><br \/>By 2030 we're set to have the largest economy in Europe.  <\/blockquote>These remarks have been covered by Peter Spencer, who said: <blockquote>However it's not all good news. The global economy has slowed and prospects for the Eurozone appear to be going from bad to worse. The euro has fallen to an all-time low against the dollar, which will help combat deflation and stimulate Eurozone exports at the expense of UK producers.  [However] Investors face the uncertainty of the UK General Election, followed by the possibility of a referendum on UK membership of the EU. Overall, the prospects have brightened - but remain ... risky.<\/blockquote>These two statements point to several of the significant factors running through current UK political and economic thinking in the lead up to the election.  These are that the UK economy is doing well, as is our own, and despite a significant debt burden, the UK's growth is outstripping that of Europe but the UK has more flexibility with its finance and economic policy than the eurozone.  That raises a question of the UK's involvement within Europe.<br\/><br\/>A second issue, as seen from an increasingly sceptical UK audience, is that the problems of the eurozone may not have been arrested and may be getting worse.  In the UK this is coupled with a subtext that the EU's attempts at stabilising and reflating the eurozone may no longer be a benign influence on the UK economy, but may be undermining attempts to achieve further growth in the UK.<br\/><br\/>There is a growing sense - I stress this is currently a minority opinion - in the city of London and several large corporations that I have had the opportunity to talk to that the comparative advantage for the UK of being part of the EU is being eroded.  Eurosceptisim, which until fairly recently was largely absent from major UK companies but which was getting a significant hearing within the SME community, is getting a much wider audience.  Mr. John Longworth, director of British Chamber of Commerce, at last week's British Chamber of Commerce Conference stated:<blockquote>Chamber members fundamentally support the Prime Minister's objective: Britain in a reformed Europe.  The next government must set out what it will do to protect the United Kingdom against the prospect of being in a club where all the decisions are made by, and for, the Eurozone.<br \/><br \/>More than any repatriation of powers, businesses want to know that the UK has safeguards against being drawn closer to the Eurozone <br \/><br \/>...Economic pragmatism - what's best for Britain, for British business, for our national growth ambitions - must win the day.<\/blockquote>Before I talk about the impact it is likely to have on us, there are some disruptive factors, as already alluded to by Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; &Oacute; Ceallaigh.  The first of those is with regard to the UK election.  There is an uncertain outcome both in the likely composition of government and in the role of parties such as the SNP, DUP, UKIP and the Greens.  As a subsidiary point, it may be postulated that some form of EU referendum, regardless of the composition of the government, may be on the agenda.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Steve Aiken:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is also noteworthy that the themes of this referendum will focus not on economic issues but on emotive issues such as sovereignty in certain decision-making processes and, in particular, migration and the free movement of people across the EU.<\/p><p> The second disruptive factor is the effect the success and stability of the eurozone will have on the EU, sentiment in the UK media and the markets.<\/p><p> While not an immediate impact, the nature of the UK and its relationships within these islands is changing and will change significantly.  An all-island corporation tax rate of 12.5%, similar arrangements for Scotland, and other regional attempts to gain competitive advantages to counter what is seen as the overwhelming influence of the south east will have an impact on us.  We will be measured against Northern Ireland, Scotland and other regions in the UK.<\/p><p> A more fundamental point is that, when the UK thinks of Europe, it looks east.  Even though we have a contiguous land border with the UK, in the vast majority of British thinking the EU is 25 miles away across the English Channel.  Ireland is not part of the equation in any significant or fundamental way.  This will have a considerable impact on us when we examine trade issues, particularly with our largest markets.<\/p><p> In terms of goods, services and trade policy, we must consider where the UK sees itself.  For example, the patent box, research and development investment, reducing corporation tax, investment in infrastructure and investment in education are key in its estimation of how to make itself as competitive as possible.  Given our success levels, we seek to take the same types of measure.  Increasingly, we may be seen to be in competition not just with the UK but also with its individual regions.<\/p><p> The question of the possible imposition of tariffs and border controls has been raised by many informed debaters in Ireland, including myself and Mr. O'Ceallaigh.  The implications of border controls and their political impact are recognised by those who are listening in the UK, but they are a relatively small group.  When people discuss the EU, they do not think about the wider relationship on this island.  It is not a significant calculation when dealing with the pro- and anti-EU lobbies.<\/p><p> The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, is another area of significant impact.  I am surprised that I have not heard it mentioned so far.  For Ireland and the UK, TTIP is one of the most important areas that we would like to see grow and develop.  The relationship with the US is particularly important, as both Britain and Ireland are Atlanticists in their outlook.  Seeking a greater relationship with the US that links the world's two largest trade zones is a key consideration.<\/p><p> We have already discussed the UK's competitive edge, but it will undoubtedly seek further competitive advantage.  A loosening of EU regulation will form part of that.  However, one of the main points that is constantly mentioned is the UK's access to the Single Market.<\/p><p> Taking all of this as the backdrop, what will happen to us and what will the difficulties be for us?  I had the opportunity to brief this committee two years ago, when I was asked directly whether I expected to see a \"Brexit\".  I stated that it would be unlikely, for many reasons; the situation is now uncertain.  For Ireland, it would impact on trade, agriculture, services, energy policy and so on.  In the widest strategic sense as well as an economic and trading sense, a vast variety of activity in Ireland's relationship with the UK is likely to be affected severely.  Regardless of the next UK general election and the referendum that will happen, though, the game has changed.  We are in a new dynamic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steve Aiken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":171,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Aiken.

It is often difficult to have European matters discussed in this country because much of the time people do not appreciate their relevance or potential impact.  It is very clear from all of the presentations that the public has not really zoned in on this topic, which is why this discussion is timely and helpful for our understanding of it.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Ceallaigh mentioned a period of negotiations, perhaps of two years, after any poll that might take place.  If this is the realistic timeframe in which these negotiations take place, people will be led into a false sense of security that we will get a deal which resolves the major issues between us and the UK, such as the agrifood sector, trade generally, human rights or the movement of people, and that all will be fine.  This might be the case in some areas, but we cannot end up on the other side of an exit of a country whereby that country gets the benefits and all the positives of these agreements.  This cannot be the case.  We must be careful.  The fact we have co-dependence in certain areas should not lull us into a false sense of security that we will reach an amicable agreement.  There is often conflict about issues which prevents the type of deals, arrangements or accommodations we want.  This is why we have the European Union in the first instance, to try to do this in a balanced way.<\/p> <p>  My concern is that industry and trade generally will believe there is such a level of co-dependence that an exit will not really matter and we will sort it out.  If this is the case, other countries will wonder what is the benefit for them of being restricted or constricted within a European Union and will consider going down the same road.  Then we will be in the proverbial manure business.  We must sell the argument that if one slate comes off the roof, the entire roof is in jeopardy.  Here, and perhaps to a greater extent in Britain, we must try collectively to get the message across that it will not just be a series of bilateral agreements which will get us through.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Ceallaigh spoke about the impact on exports of a 3% or 3.5% reduction.  I believe it would be greater.  For a while the co-dependence would assist in maintaining the level of activity, but then we would start getting into tariffs and these would have an impact on deals with other countries.  We would end up with this spiralling out of control and the consequences would become much greater than anything that might have been anticipated because of the complexity of the various arrangements which exist.  We have a job of work to do to create this level of concern in the minds of the people who will be impacted greatest.

Would they agree that those eurosceptics in Britain and across Europe might be taking solace from what is happening with Greece?  My worry is that there are so many people who are now becoming eurosceptics that they are seeing immigration.  My question on immigration is as follows.  Are UKIP, the Conservatives and the British people more concerned about the free movement of people from within the Union of 28 than what they perceive to be the influx around the Mediterranean from North Africa, of, for instance, Iraqis and Libyans?  There are hundreds of thousands of people trying to get to Europe.  Of course, Britain is conscious of its rail link with France and the horrors of significant numbers of stateless persons all trying to get across, either on ferries or on lorries, to Britain.  Is the worry immigration from outside or from within the Union?  We are in a horrible situation of an unstable world.  There is Russian expansionism in Ukraine, potential Russian expansionism in Latvia, and unstable relations from Moldova to God knows where.  Sadly, there are a considerable amount of people on the move - more than ever there has been.  Of course, Greece has been seen to be the leaky border that facilitates the through flow.  I am rambling.  Italy, Australia and Japan, amongst others, are taking specific steps on controlling immigration and the movement of people.

He said there will probably be a referendum.  Consider the consequences beyond the economic effect on Ireland if the United Kingdom leaves the Union.  There was a referendum in the United Kingdom in 1975.  Even with all Mr. Murdoch&rsquo;s media backing the UK Government at the time, the result was still two to one in favour of the United Kingdom staying in the Union, which was very close.  The United Kingdom rejected the single currency in 1999 and also the Maastricht treaty.  One may recall that Mr. John Major&rsquo;s Government almost collapsed in 1993.  It is very interesting that the Institute of Economic Affairs stated recently that the United Kingdom could be better off outside the European Union.  I believe it cites the cases of Switzerland, Iceland and Norway, which lie outside the Union but which are part of the European Free Trade Association.  They, apparently, enjoy all the benefits of the EU Internal Market.  I was listening to Mr. Nigel Farage some weeks ago.  He quotes organisations such as the institute and claims what it has outlined could be the case.  Even within the British Labour Party, some of whose members I know, there is a lot of scepticism that is not coming to the fore regarding the European Union.  It is not just coming from the Conservatives.  I do not believe the view on Mr. David Cameron because many of the businesses in England have railed against leaving the United Kingdom.  However, I believe it is inevitable there will be a referendum and that Mr. Cameron has to call one.<\/p> <p>  During the last few weeks of the campaign in England, the Labour Party itself will come under fierce pressure internally to call a referendum.  What is the delegates' view on the Institute of Economic Affairs, which appears to be contending the United Kingdom could very well be fine outside the European Union?  What is the delegates' view on Switzerland, Iceland and Norway?  Believe it or not, they indicated in recent months that they would have no interest whatsoever in being part of European Union because of the European Free Trade Association.  They seem to be doing quite well outside the Union.  If a referendum asking the UK electorate to leave the Union were called in the morning, it would be carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#M00200","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":181,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.

He said it would be in Britain's interests to keep its standards uniform with the rest of Europe.  Does that transpose across to other aspects of the economy?  One of the things to fear is that Britain gets all the benefits of leaving with none of the costs other European countries have arising from social or regulatory standards.  To what extent does Professor Matthews think that is possible, or will the balance be more in favour of Britain retaining the standards of the rest of the EU countries?<\/p> <p>  If the various measures currently being taken in Europe prove to be successful in reflating the European economy - for example, quantitative easing and the Juncker plan - to what extent does Professor Matthews think a European recovery could make a difference to the outcome?

These included the implementation of the Single Market, on which he will not find any disagreement here; competitiveness; the issue of the disconnect between citizens and Europe; and the need for national parliaments to use to a greater extent the powers that have become available to them since Lisbon.  All of which we agree with here.<br\/><br\/>When it came to a concrete list of proposals, the UK Government undertook to carry out a balance of competences review, going through each Department and identifying the type of power that could perhaps be returned to the UK national Parliament.  My understanding is that it was not a huge list of items that came out of that particular review.  From looking at the debate in the UK over the past 12 months, I feel the question is more focused towards freedom of people and workers.  I noticed in today's <i>Financial Times<\/i>that one of the most senior trade diplomats has said he does not think the programme of negotiation from Mr. Cameron is extremely ambitious.

I shall first address the question of whether there will be a referendum.  It is quite true that the Labour Party leadership is against a referendum.  However, there are two things which could bring about a change.  The first is political pressure, particularly in the run-up to the election.  Rather more importantly, Westminster passed legislation which stated that there would be a referendum were there to be treaty changes in the EU.  There is quite a possibility that there will be treaty changes in the EU within the foreseeable future.  It is my view, for what it is worth, that there will be a referendum in the UK in the foreseeable future, and that no matter what the wording is, in essence it will be a referendum about whether it stays in the Union or pulls out.<\/p> <p>  On the question of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Turkey and so on, none of the arrangements that those countries have with the European Union would suit the United Kingdom.  They all mean that those countries have to accept free movement of people.  Free movement of people is at the heart of the British problem - the question of immigration.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would mean, in effect, that Britain would have to implement all forms of European legislation, without being at the table when that legislation is being negotiated.  I do not believe the British would find any of the solutions that Switzerland, Norway, Turkey and Iceland have found acceptable.  If there is to be a new agreement with Britain outside the EU, it will have to be something specific to Britain.<br\/><br\/>Let us presume that the UK has a referendum and it decides to withdraw.  I agree that the negotiation will be extremely difficult, as has been said by one or two of the members of the committee.  I cannot imagine a member state wishing to give the United Kingdom a better deal outside the Union than it has inside the Union, particularly given the amount of time that the member states have had to spend up to now, not to mind between now and when the negotiation takes place, trying to assuage the British position.  The fact is that member states are losing patience with the British.  We hear that from all over Europe.  They feel that concessions were made to the UK in the Lisbon treaty which it was believed would settle the question of British membership for a considerable period, but that is not what happened.  Instead, British membership of the European Union is on the table at practically every meeting that takes place in Brussels or Strasbourg.  There is a lack of patience with the British within the Union.<br\/><br\/>The implications for Britain, should it withdraw, are very deep.  The leader of the Scottish National Party has said that she would like to see a majority one way or the other within Scotland, and that it is not sufficient for an overall majority in the United Kingdom to withdraw if there is a majority in Scotland that wishes to remain in the EU.  If the Scots take that position, it is quite likely that the Welsh will take the same position.  Northern Ireland is even more complex.  If the British take a decision to withdraw, there is a serious possibility that the United Kingdom could break up.  The unitary state with sovereignty in Westminster could break up in one way or another.  The Scottish question has not been settled.  The implications for Northern Ireland are enormous, as are the implications for our relationship with Northern Ireland.  These are matters we really need to ponder.<br\/><br\/>What should we do?  We should decide whether it is in our interests that the United Kingdom remains in the European Union.  If we decide that way, and the Government has made its position very clear, we should examine what we can do to try to ensure that it does remain in the Union.  There is one area where the British are not involved and, in my view, are very unlikely to be involved, if ever, and that is within the Eurogroup.  As a result of what has happened over the last five to seven years, that Eurogroup is becoming increasingly closer.  We might need to think of a relationship, or try to bring about a relationship, in which the United Kingdom remains within the European Union but with some type of special relationship with the Eurogroup.  As I said earlier, the special arrangements made with Norway or with Switzerland will not meet that situation.<br\/><br\/>It is correct, as the Chairman said, that in his Bloomberg speech Mr. Cameron indicated some areas of concern.  He also indicated more areas of concern in an article he wrote in the <i>Daily<\/i><i>Telegraph<\/i>about a year ago.  Frankly, I am sure solutions can be found in the seven or eight areas of concern he mentioned, but I believe the problem is much deeper.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As mentioned by Mr. Aiken there is a cultural problem here and a historical sense of British exceptionalism.

Many of the proposals for reform that have been put forward as a possible condition to the UK remaining within the EU would require reform of the treaties and of the core fundamental freedom of free movement and so would be difficult to secure, although not impossible.  They raise significant legal challenges and would be politically difficult given that free movement has been very much at the heart of the European project.<br\/><br\/>There is also concern that some of the proposals I mentioned would have significant implications for UK nationals living in other parts of the EU, including Ireland, Spain, France and Germany.  For example, should the type of reforms being proposed be proceeded with, the cost to other EU members states of providing the type of publicly funded health care provided by Spain to ageing UK nationals living there would be significantly difficult.  The desired approach of some UK parliamentarians is a type of <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i>approach to free movement, in other words, free movement negotiated with some member states but not all.  This, of course, would be legally problematic, would not fit with EU free movement rules and would be politically very difficult to secure.  The preference would be for bilateral negotiations with selected member states but not including all 28 member states and, most specifically, not including the newer member states that have acceded to the EU.<br\/><br\/>There is significant misinformation circulating around immigration and free movement.  There is little evidence to suggest that free movement is primarily for the purpose of, for example, securing access to social security rather than work and study opportunities.  Unfortunately, this type of misinformation does take root and hold.  With regard to third country nationals, non-EU and non-EEA nationals, there are already significant restrictions in place in terms of immigration under EU law.  As such, movement is already restricted and regulated.  In the UK context, the points system and five-tier system apply.  While there are already significant restrictions in place, the UK and other EU member states have taken a selective approach in terms of prioritising immigration for highly skilled nationals who meet the requirements of their job markets.<br\/><br\/>The right to seek asylum, the position of asylum seekers and those seeking protection was raised.  Withdrawal of the UK from the EU would not change the position in that regard in that the right to seek asylum and protection predates the coming into existence of the European Union.  The UK will continue to have obligations under international refugee law, including the 1951 convention relating to refugees to which it is a party, the UN convention against torture to which it is a party and the European Convention on Human Rights which protects against <i>refoulement,<\/i>namely, return of a person to a country where he or she would face a serious risk of torture, inhumane or degrading treatment.  The debate around the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act is a related but separate debate.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Of course, that has also become very problematic in the UK and has significant implications for Ireland, given the requirements of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p> With regard to the crisis concerning people fleeing from Syria, the burden of that is being borne primarily by Mediterranean states and with very little EU support in terms of meeting the significant responsibilities and burdens that have arisen.<\/p><p> Regarding the Abu Hamza type of scenario, this is something that arises under the European Convention on Human Rights and the non-refoulement obligations.  It raises a core question as to whether we consider that human rights protections apply to all persons, including those persons we may not like and who may not be considered desirable.  Is the protection from torture and inhuman and degrading treatment to be considered absolute?  It is under European human rights law and, of course, it has been very much valued in Ireland as we saw most recently in the request to the European Court of Human Rights to re-open the Ireland and UK case.  Again, significant misinformation circulates around something like that.  That protection would remain regardless of withdrawal from the EU in that it is provided for under the UN Convention against Torture, the refugee convention and the European Convention on Human Rights, for example.<\/p><p> With regard to the position of movement between Northern Ireland and the Republic and the safeguarding of the common travel area arrangements, it is likely that there would be an attempt to secure that and that it could be secured in some way.  However, managing that in practice would be very difficult given that there would be a need for strengthened border controls with regard to the movements of non-EEA nationals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":194,"content":"<p>We are outside Schengen at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#R00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":195,"content":"<p>Yes, but we still have a common travel area.

Again, this goes to whether it would be possible to negotiate a series of bilateral agreements or a position such as would be available as a member state of the EEA.  As I mentioned, that is very unlikely given that much of the debate has been around limiting free movement.  Giving that type of concession is unlikely either to meet the needs or desires of those proposing an opt-out for the UK or those seeking to leave the EU entirely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":196,"content":"<p>I will confine my remarks to the specific trade questions that were raised rather than the broader political issues, as the committee has heard some very helpful comments on that already and Steven Aiken will probably add to that when he speaks.<\/p> <p>  On the trade issues, I refer to the point made by Deputy Dooley to the effect that there might be a temptation among Irish businesses to think that as we have a special relationship with the UK, we can still manage to come to an accommodation which would ensure that our beef, dairy products and other products avoid any tariffs and so forth even if Britain leaves.  It is important to be clear that the rules regarding trade relationships have become much tighter since the days when we had the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  Even though, at least legally, it might be possible to think of the common travel area as a type of bilateral agreement, although as Professor Mullally has highlighted there could be very practical difficulties in introducing it, the idea of a bilateral trade relationship is completely out of the question.  First, the UK will remain a member of the World Trade Organization, WTO, which prohibits discriminatory trade arrangements except in the context of regional trade agreements.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Alan Matthews:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would only be possible for Ireland to have a special relationship if, from a purely theoretical point of view, there was a bilateral relationship.  As we know, external trade policy is now an exclusive competence of the European Union and we are not at liberty to enter into our own trade agreements with a third country.  If we want to protect our interests in a post-Brexit situation we have to do so through the arrangements that the EU as a whole will enter into with the UK, whatever they might be.  It is important to scotch the idea that somehow we can have some sort of bilateral old boys' network arrangement between the UK and Ireland, at least on trade issues.<\/p><p> Deputy Kyne raised the important issue of the UK's relationship with the Commonwealth and so on.  I referred to the matter in my opening remarks.  Certainly, the UK would, post-Brexit, be entitled to pursue its own trade policy.  That means it could set its own level of tariffs which would apply to other countries, including exports from the EU.  The UK could also enter into its own free trade agreements.  I suggested that it would be highly likely that the UK would find it easier to have a free trade agreement with New Zealand and Australia, because the world has changed since the old days of the Commonwealth, and also with Mercosur, the United States and so on.  The UK would be more willing to give agricultural concessions than perhaps the EU is in negotiations with the same groups of countries.  I agree with the Deputy that this is an obvious path for the UK to pursue in a post-Brexit situation.  That would imply, it seems to me, increased competition in the UK market for Irish exporters, because we would have to compete with cheaper Brazilian beef or New Zealand dairy products than we do at present.<\/p><p> A third comment which came across from a number of contributions is the idea that if Britain were to withdraw it could negotiate a deal which would give it the benefits of access to Single Market without having to accept the costs.  It is important to be clear on the matter.  Mr. O'Ceallaigh has explained the nature of the agreements with the European Economic Area countries and with Switzerland, which is a little different.  Switzerland has a free trade agreement but it also has a lot of bilateral agreements which link it very closely with the Single Market.  It is important to emphasise, as Mr. O'Ceallaigh did, that these countries, in return for getting access to the Single Market, commit to transposing every single EU directive directly into their domestic legislation without having any possibility of influencing it.  There are some consultation rights and so on, but these are not very meaningful.<\/p><p> Let us consider the apocalyptic situation in which we are faced with a Brexit and are trying, two years later, to negotiate a common EU arrangement with the United Kingdom.  For example, let us look at the key issue of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, which is no longer tariffs but has to do with regulatory co-operation.  I would have thought such co-operation would also be a key area in the post-Brexit trade negotiations.  At least in the case of agriculture and food, it may well be the case that the UK would be willing to continue with EU standards and might even be willing to accept, in certain limited areas, that it would simply adopt and transpose EU regulations in these areas.  Due to the importance of its own trade with the EU, the UK might be prepared in some limited areas to accept that loss of sovereignty in return for the access that these Single Market arrangements would give it.  Perhaps I am not as pessimistic, if we have a free trade agreement, about whether it will be possible to integrate some mutual recognition arrangements and so on.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">  Professor Alan Matthews: :<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would imply, I think, that the UK would simply have to agree that in these areas we will follow EU legislation to ensure we keep our access.<\/p><p> Senator Reilly raised two questions, and she has put me on the spot.  It seems to me that Brexit would not require any change in current arrangements.  She raised the question of a farmer with land on both sides of the Border. I think that farmer would not notice any big difference because as members are aware one's entitlements to direct payments - let us assume the UK keeps that entitlements type system - are not transferable across borders.  If one had a situation where one could transfer one's entitlements across members states in the European Union, then if Britain withdrew, that would affect it.  At present one's entitlements on land in the North and in the South are completely separate.  As I reflect on it, that would not be affected by Brexit.  Similarly, the cattle and the voluntary food labelling is the sort of bilateral agreement that could continue.  Although there could be significant disruption to trade, on both of these issues I do not see Brexit as having a major impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":199,"content":"<p>I will deal with the issues in the order in which they arose.  Senator Reilly raised the issue of beef supplies and Brexit.  When I was in the Chamber one of the things we looked at quite closely was what we called the circularity of trade.  The reality is that the UK, if it went alone could not source enough beef in the UK and would always look to Ireland.  For many of the larger supermarket chains and the fast food companies, British and Irish beef are synonymous with each other.  That would continue.  If we look at the large numbers of companies that are involved in that space, I cannot see that changing.  That would be quite significant.<\/p> <p>  The one thing that does bother me, as Senator Reilly mentioned, is the issue of the North-South economic relationship and what is likely to happen if there was a Brexit or any sort of change.  I am on the board of the Irish-British Association and one of the things we have been trying to do in the past couple of years is to raise this debate because there does not seem to be any critical thinking at the possible implications on a North-South relationship if we move toward Brexit.  Last October-November we hosted a conference in Queen's University Belfast and Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh and others in this room attended.  Quite a few academics were involved in the conversation, but significantly, of the political parties only UKIP turned up, which made it quite an interesting debate.  The reality is that this issue needs serious consideration.  <\/p> <p>  This leads me on to the answer to Deputy Byrne's question on what should Ireland be doing.  Ireland is in an unique position with the United Kingdom, because it is trusted as a trusted agent.  The United Kingdom views Ireland as a great friend to the United Kingdom, that thinks the same way on many issues.  In fact our views and opinions have a considerable degree of weight.  We might not think they do, but they do.  One of the things we should be doing is helping this advocation process of informing the United Kingdom about the importance of remaining within the EU  and talking to our European compatriots about the importance of keeping the UK in the tent.<\/p> <p>  That leads to a question about what we should be seeking to ask as well.  What would the UK be like outside the EU?  In the global context it would be much diminished.  It would have less influence on the world.  It would be still a significant economic power and it would be a significant power, whatever it wants to call itself, but it would be diminished.  I sat on several of the EU competency panels both in London and in various other places and one of the things that came through in the discussions and in the study is that it would not be in the UK's interests to be outside the EU.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Steve Aiken:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is not the same as saying the debate can be shaped among the British populace, or that it is the same sort of result for which they should be looking.  That would be the answer I would arrive at for that one as well.<\/p><p> Mr. O'Ceallaigh has already touched on the implications for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  I have had the opportunity to talk to various leaders from the Scottish National Party over a considerable period of time in the past three years.  It is quite clear that a major constitutional issue would arise if Scotland voted to stay in and England voted to go.  I would say there could be similar sorts of arrangements in Wales and in Northern Ireland.  If most of the constituent parts of the UK - by the national composition of the country, rather than by population - wished to remain in the EU but England, with a substantial body of population, particularly in the south east, was potentially looking towards moving out, that would represent a significant crisis point.  It would have major implications.  A steady hand, a reasoned debate and the voice of friendship from Ireland would be of considerable importance in that context.<\/p><p> I was also asked about the business position and the impact on business if the Brexit were to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Some businesses actually have a long-range horizon, whereas others do not.  Those that have a long-range horizon are already beginning to look at these issues as well.  If one listens to the debates within the Confederation of British Industry and the British chambers of commerce, one will be aware that their view is that some form of accommodation will be met.  It is an interesting point when we talk about imports and exports.  The activities of companies like Airbus and BMW motors as part of the prevailing \"just enough, just in time\" manufacturing process show how integrated the UK is within the European manufacturing chain.  I refer to the large-scale output from certain places as \"the Swindon effect\" because all of BMW's diesel engines are manufactured in Swindon before being put into vehicles in the US, Germany and Austria.  European countries have a great deal of interest in making sure the UK remains part of the process as well.<\/p><p> I was asked whether a European recovery would be of benefit to the pro-EU lobby in the UK.  Of course it would.  One of the reasons the euroscepticism debate seems to be gathering momentum relates to what is happening around Greece, its wider implications and what is happening in eastern Europe.  The UK is looking to show greater leadership in sorting out Europe's problems.  If the eurozone were to pull itself out of its current malaise, get the deflation business sorted out and begin to experience real growth again, particularly in key areas, it would be a very positive statement for the UK electorate when it is thinking about whether to remain in the EU.<\/p><p> I will conclude by setting out what I would advocate to encourage the UK to stay in when it votes on EU membership.  We have already spoken about the implications of the vote for the free movement of people and of ideas.  This is one of the areas we would probably need to look to.  The most significant thing we would probably need to do is to ensure the EU is looking at what is possible.  We need to make sure it is well signalled to the UK that the EU is willing to move at least in some direction to keep the UK within the EU.  Even to mention that the UK would be much better within the EU from the majority of the EU would probably be a very significant push.

We left this Bill on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in July 2014.  This was to ensure that we allowed for the member states to consider the legislation under the technical standards process.  This process is now complete and so the Bill can continue its journey through the House.<\/p> <p>  In 2013 I announced the intention to draft legislation to introduce this measure.  The Government approved and fully supported this approach.  At that time Ireland was the first and only country in Europe committed to introducing this measure.  Since that time I am very pleased to say that a number of countries are following Australia and Ireland's example in this regard.  New Zealand is developing legislation.  The UK Government announced its intention in January to proceed with regulations.  France, Norway and Finland have all indicated their intention to consider introducing standardised packaging in the future.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has always been a leader in tobacco control measures.  We can be proud of the path we have forged in the area of tobacco legislation.  We can be proud of the influence we have on other countries to follow us in this regard.  It is important, however, to realise that the battle against these harmful tobacco products is not yet complete and will not be complete until we can significantly reduce the numbers of young people starting to smoke.  Some 12% of children aged between ten and 17 years are reported as current smokers.  While the number of young people smoking has dropped considerably over the years, 12% is an unacceptable figure.<\/p> <p>  Members will have heard the arguments put by the tobacco industry: standardised packaging does not work, it will increase illicit trade, and Ireland should focus on educating young people about the harms of cigarettes.  We know from research that branded tobacco packaging is a critically important part of tobacco promotion.  We know that health warnings are more effective on plain backgrounds.  We know that standardised packs are less attractive and less appealing to consumers, particularly children.  This is a significant evidence base and it is showing us that standardised packaging works.  Evidence from Australia shows it is working.  Evidence from Australia has completely undermined the tobacco industry arguments.  Misrepresentation of evidence by the tobacco industry is a well-recognised tactic.  Another is the threat of legal challenges.  While a legal challenge by the tobacco industry cannot be ruled out - I say that very much with tongue in cheek - I am very confident that the research available to us demonstrates that standardised packaging will have a positive impact on health and that it is a proportionate and justified measure.  The threat of legal challenges should not be an obstacle to progressing public health policies.  We must press on with our mission to make Ireland tobacco-free by 2025.<\/p> <p>  As regards educating our young people about the harms of tobacco, we are already doing this.  Standardised packaging is one of a number of measures which combined will stop our young people smoking.  It is the combination of past, present and future tobacco control measures that will reduce tobacco consumption.  However, standardised packaging is very important as it is the next step in tackling tobacco advertising and promotion specifically.<\/p> <p>  Before we move to deal with the amendments proposed, I wish to indicate that I will be bringing some technical drafting amendments to the Bill on Report Stage.  I thank Members for their participation on Committee Stage.  I look forward to hearing Deputy Billy Kelleher speak on his amendments and the contributions of other members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#A00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":207,"content":"<p>Does any Member wish to make an opening statement?<\/p><p>I would like to make a brief comment.

Some of the initial figures indicate that we are making slow but steady incremental progress and anything that can enhance that is welcome.  Lest there be any doubt, I spoke in the D&aacute;il on the matter on numerous occasions and I put on record the efforts of the Minister when he was Minister for Health, in the context of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  The Minister used the platform very effectively in trying to encourage the EU to take a lead in public health.  I commend the Minister in that regard.<br\/><br\/>My amendments are designed to enhance the Bill and to assist in trying to ensure it is effective health policy and that it is also expeditious in trying to deal with tobacco consumption and the reduction of same.  We are talking about a wash-out phase in the Bill whereby its introduction will be postponed until 20 May 2017.  We are saying we should substitute the date with 20 July 2015.  That is an indication of the urgency with which we view the matter that we should try to bring forward plain packaging and standardisation as quickly as possible to ensure we send out a very strong message to people that we are serious about confronting the nefarious, insidious tobacco industry and that we set a lead and an example.  There might be good reason &ndash; the Minister can elaborate on that &ndash; but I would support the introduction of a blunt deadline in terms of the enactment of the legislation on 20 July 2015.  That would give the industry adequate time to respond.<br\/><br\/>I do not refer to retailers who sell tobacco products in shops in this country, but the international tobacco industry is nefarious and threatening.  It has tried, for example, to usurp the democratically people of Australia and its legislative process.  While the industry has the right to protect its copyright through the courts, our duty must be to the people, in particular young people who might be contemplating experimenting with tobacco, and trying to discourage people from taking it up and to encourage people to give it up.  That is the reason I have tabled the amendment.  The Irish Cancer Society takes a strong line on the issue and it has been a strong proponent of the legislation and fully endorses what the Minister is trying to do.

I am attracted to the spirit of the amendment.  The Minister can, and I have no doubt will, in his reply respond on the practicalities.  We can await the detail of that.<\/p> <p>  The spirit of the amendment is that rather than allow a period of time, there is an arguable need to impact not only in relation to the industry, but societally in terms of the importance of all of the measures.  There is no single measure that will be a panacea for the inordinate costs that we have to bear as a result of the health consequences of tobacco smoking.  This is one of a number of measures, some already implemented and other hopefully to follow, that will ultimately lead to a significant reduction in the number of people who smoke and further dissuade people from taking up smoking at an early age.<\/p> <p>  The little box I hold in my hand has been circulated as an example of what plain packaged cigarettes will look like.  It is important for people to recognise and realise that when we talk about plain packaging that it is going to be a white box.  It is not a white box, it is a very stark and unattractive product by any standard.  Any examination of it will confirm that.  What I have in my hand would not be an attractive device in terms of marketing the contents, quite the contrary.  For that reason alone it is a further aid to the process we all support, namely, a significant reduction in current smoker numbers and an even greater if at all possible reduction in the number of young people who take up the habit, so sadly, at a very early age, and with all the difficulties of giving up the habit.  I am open to the spirit of what Deputy Kelleher has said and I await the Minister&rsquo;s response on the practicalities of the proposition.<\/p><p>At the outset, I thank both speakers for their support.  I understand that Deputy Kelleher&rsquo;s proposals are meant in the best possible way and I fully accept the bona fides of his support.  Few people would be more enthusiastic than I to expedite the impact of the legislation but given the letter on the Chairman&rsquo;s desk and the letters that are in circulation, everybody involved in the area is not one bit surprised about the tactics of the tobacco industry.  I take the advice of the Attorney General on these matters.  The amendment suggested by Deputy Kelleher proposes to shorten the transition period allowed for in the Bill.  The transition provisions as outlined in the Bill allow retailers and manufacturers time to comply with the new measures.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=HE1&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Current packets may be manufactured until May 2016 and there will then be a one-year period in which to sell outstanding stocks.  Non-compliant retail packaging may not be manufactured from May 2016 and may not be sold after May 2017.<\/p><p> The introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland is a proportionate public health measure.  It is very important when introducing such measures that steps are taken to give the industry advance notice of the details of the measures.  Any reduction in the transitional period may undermine the State's arguments regarding the proportionality of this Bill.  The transitional times outlined in the Bill are in line with those set out in the EU 2014 tobacco products directive.  Provisions in that directive are essential elements to the success of standardised packaging.  The new tobacco directive provides for larger graphic warnings that are to be displayed on the front and back of packs.  The European Commission has developed a new library of images which cannot be introduced prior to 20 May 2016.  With this in mind, it is deemed reasonable to allow for all the changes required under the standardised packaging legislation and the new tobacco products directive to be introduced within the same timeframes.<\/p><p> As members know, the UK Government recently announced its decision to introduce regulations for standardised packaging.  Similar to Ireland, these regulations will come into force at the same time as the tobacco products directive, in May 2016.

Companies want to be able to stand out from the crowd on the shelf when selling a product.  There is an issue with regard to the shape and size of a tobacco product or the packaging.  We know there has been a move towards different sizes and types of boxes; for example, there is a lipstick-style box and so-called nano packaging.  These are primarily targeted at young females in society.  Companies obviously would make a calculated decision in the research context that these slim or extended packs are attractive and encourage young women and girls to start smoking.  We want to make the regulation as watertight as possible and I know the Minister has already thought of this.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not raise this in the context of existing concerns.  These packs could diminish what the legislation is trying to achieve, which is to make cigarettes bland and unattractive so as not to stand out from the crowd.  It is about ensuring that people are aware of the harm they will cause if consumed.  The deficiency in the legislation which could allow for those lipstick-type and nano packages on the shelves could lead to this being a retrograde step.  The tobacco companies have plenty of finance for research and I am sure they will move to this area very quickly.  One can see, even if one is not out too late, cigarettes from such packages being consumed primarily by younger female smokers.

We made a tactical strategic decision some time back not to put the two Bills together because the evidence around e-cigarettes was not as certain as the evidence that tobacco is detrimental to the people who consume it.  Facts are beginning to emerge and the information from America is that there have been more than 200 admissions of young people to hospital because of overdosing on nicotine and messing around with cartridges.  One of the entries in the Young Scientist Exhibition, and I apologise to the young lady from Derry whose name I cannot recall, was a project on tobacco substitutes that found that the product was labelled as having a certain number of milligrams per ml but on analysis some of them had up to 60 times as much as was advertised on the packet.  There are inherent dangers and I am very keen to have this area regulated.  I do not believe that e-cigarettes should be available outside of a pharmacy or under the direction of a pharmacist as an aid to cease smoking.  They should not be sold outside of that.

In response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who spoke extensively on pipe tobacco, I make the following points.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=HE1&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Members will remember that pipes were the first to be banned in cinemas and on aeroplanes because of the extensive smoke emanating from them.  If we cast our minds back to the role that the current Leader of the Opposition had in achieving the smoking ban in public places, the core principle was to protect workers from the harmful carcinogenic effect of environmental smoke and tobacco products.  Pipe tobacco is very much to the fore in that area and it would make no sense to me for it not to be included in this directive.  Some people may argue they do not inhale the smoke but the incidence of mouth, lip and throat cancers related to pipe smoking is well known.  One may argue that young people are not taking up that type of smoking and would not be likely to do so, but I would quibble with that.  If the vast billions of euro in the tobacco industry were focused on advertising this as a lifestyle choice, there could be unimaginable instruments for the consumption of pipe tobacco, and we would be amazed how quickly it might take off.  I have no intention of excluding that element.<\/p><p> Who in this room could possibly believe that one of the most advanced societies in Europe currently has a tobacco product that involves a person cutting one's gum and shoving tobacco under the lip to absorb it?  That country is Sweden.  Sales of snus, as it is referred to, continue to be substantial.  It is excluded from Europe's tobacco directive, as a compromise had to be made.  Do not underestimate the ability of the tobacco industry to attract people to its product through new and innovative methods.  As I have indicated here and in many other places, if there is a choice between jobs or lives, the choice will always be for lives.  I hope I have addressed the issues in a way that does not cause the committee to think we are not on the same page.  We all want to protect children from taking up this habit and we want to help those who become addicted to get away from this killer habit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#E00600","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":264,"content":"<p>I assure the Minister that my questioning had nothing to do with encouraging the return of pipe tobacco smoking in any variety of settings where smoking is currently illegal.

We really welcome the opportunity to set out our views on this very important issue.<\/p> <p>  I will start by stating our position very clearly.  My own and the Aer Lingus board's strongly held view is that a combination of Aer Lingus with IAG has a compelling strategic rationale and will deliver significant benefits to Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus's employees, Aer Lingus's customers and Ireland.  The board has concluded, based on advice from our financial advisers, that the price of &euro;2.55 per share should be recommended to shareholders.  <\/p> <p>  In recent weeks, we have listened carefully to the public debate regarding IAG's proposal.  During this period we have had further detailed discussions with representatives of IAG and the Aer Lingus board now has a greater understanding of IAG's intentions for the future of Aer Lingus and the proposed commitments IAG is prepared to make in regard to Aer Lingus to the Irish Government.  <\/p> <p>  These discussions have further confirmed that it is clearly in IAG's interest to continue to grow Aer Lingus within the IAG group. Aer Lingus being part of IAG represents a hugely positive opportunity for Aer Lingus and Ireland. This deal is about accelerated growth.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Stephen Kavanagh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This deal is about accelerated growth.  It provides real prospects for growth in Aer Lingus, the economy, global connectivity, international trade, tourism and employment.  I am surprised it can be represented in any other way.  It is on the basis of these understandings that I and the Aer Lingus board give our strong support to the proposed transaction.  The Aer Lingus team met last week with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the interdepartmental group established by the Minister.  We set out the board's view on the benefits of the proposed deal.  I will summarise these meetings regarding the benefits of IAG's proposal and key commercial drivers.  The proposal is viewed by the board as compelling and a significantly positive opportunity for Aer Lingus, its employees, its customers and Ireland.  Aer Lingus as part of IAG will enhance Ireland's position as a natural hub linking Europe and North America.  Ireland's location as the westernmost point in Europe makes it a natural gateway to connect the combined populations of Europe and North America.  Aer Lingus believes IAG's proposal can enable Ireland to become a central hub for European traffic across the Atlantic, resulting in better utilisation of the infrastructure investment in Irish airports. <\/p><p> The market between Europe and North America is about 75 million people per annum.  Increasing our share of this traffic, which is currently at 2%, to even 4 or 5% would mean bringing an additional 1 to 2 million passengers per year through Ireland, which would have huge positive benefits for Aer Lingus and its employees and for Irish airports and their employees and a myriad of ancillary support services.  With Aer Lingus as part of the IAG group, there would potential for the planned growth in transatlantic traffic to be significantly accelerated, with new US destinations added to its network.  There is an immediate prospect of accelerating our plans to open two new destinations in North America, one on the east coast and one on the west coast.  <\/p><p> Aer Lingus as part of IAG will deliver employment growth.  Initial transatlantic traffic and destination growth will create significant numbers of new jobs in Ireland. The new routes would require the acquisition of two more long-range aircraft and would provide at least two hundred direct and highly skilled jobs in Aer Lingus.  A multiple of this number would be employed in support services in the general economy and in the tourism sector.  Being part of IAG will enhance Aer Lingus's European growth.  Aer Lingus short-haul services, including the Dublin, Cork and Shannon to London Heathrow routes, will directly benefit from the sales and marketing activity conducted on its behalf by British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and the Oneworld partner sales forces.  This will strengthen the positions of the Cork and Shannon to Heathrow routes and provide additional visitor traffic to the southern and mid-west regions and the rest of the country.  Irish tourism will also benefit from greater exposure to the frequent flyer programme of Oneworld members, particularly British Airways and American Airlines.   <\/p><p> Expected benefits to Aer Lingus's Atlantic and European network, if Aer Lingus were part of IAG, include better connectivity to and from Ireland.  Being part of IAG will also allow greater access to a global cargo network.  Aer Lingus's cargo business will benefit from the global network reach and sales channels of IAG cargo business.  The cargo network enhancement is expected to deliver significant benefits and additional options to Irish businesses, particularly the pharmaceutical sector.  <\/p><p> Aer Lingus as part of IAG will be a separate operating business and the Aer Lingus brand will continue and flourish.  Aer Lingus has confirmed IAG's intentions to preserve Aer Lingus as a separately operating business within the group, with its own brand, management, head office and operations.  Willie Walsh confirmed this strongly and publicly to this committee last week.<\/p><p> It is the strong view of the Aer Lingus board that the prospect of Aer Lingus being part of IAG has compelling, strategic and commercial logic for Aer Lingus.  It would have significantly positive benefits for Aer Lingus and for Ireland, and the board is strongly supportive of the Government's two-airline policy.  Following a combination with IAG, Aer Lingus will have more attractive growth options that will significantly benefit Aer Lingus as a company, its employees, its customers, the tourism sector, Irish business and industry and the airports where Aer Lingus operates.<\/p><p> We are fully aware of concerns expressed by political parties.  Aer Lingus is willing to meet individual parties in order to clarify our position further.  We believe this is a very good opportunity for Aer Lingus and Ireland.  I hope we can give it the collective support it needs and deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Barrington","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":289,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kavanagh.

I will start by introducing Stobart Air, formerly Aer Arann.  Stobart Air is a franchise flying specialist flying for three airlines: Aer Lingus, Flybe and CityJet.  We employ 430 people, an increase of 100 in the past four years.  Our airline is all about high frequency, regional connectivity and feeding passengers into onward air journeys.  The Aer Lingus-Stobart Air partnership, which we operate under the Aer Lingus Regional banner, is proof of what can be achieved when a small airline partners with a larger one.  The partnership started in 2010 and now operates 25 routes to and from 18 airports across Ireland, the UK and France.  Aer Lingus Regional has increased its annual passenger numbers from 855,000 to 1.3 million in 2014, a 53% increase in just over four years.  In the coming weeks we will fly our five millionth passenger.  Aer Lingus Regional now contributes 12% of Aer Lingus overall passengers.  The partnership is testament to the commercial relationship between our airlines.  We have extended our contract to 2022.  It is also testament to how far we have come from the brink of bankruptcy just over four years ago. We have broadened our route network, invested &euro;150 million in new aircraft, increased our passenger numbers and added to our workforce.  The returns from our partnership are evident when you consider how Aer Lingus Regional feeds passengers to the Aer Lingus transatlantic route.  The combination of Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Regional and the US immigration pre-clearance in Ireland is a massive advantage that no other country enjoys.  Last year approximately 100,000 of our passengers arrived at Dublin, completed US pre-clearance and boarded an Aer Lingus transatlantic service to the US, or they arrived from one of Aer Lingus's North American services and boarded our aircraft to Dublin to connect onward.  The advantages this offers consumers are significant.  People can save up to two hours on a journey.  Passengers also avoid the hassle of more queues on arrival at US airports.  Nearly 100,000 transatlantic connections in 2014 is an 80% increase in just four years.  It is a core part of our business. It delivers the passengers Aer Lingus needs to expand its North American network.  Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus Regional will continue to increase transatlantic business.  It is our belief that if IAG takes over Aer Lingus this growth could be achieved faster and on a larger scale.  From a UK perspective, how can we get UK-originating passengers to choose Dublin instead of London, Paris or Amsterdam when travelling to the US?  Last year, 4.3 million people travelled to London Heathrow from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds Bradford, Manchester and Newcastle.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Sean Brogan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These are all cities that Aer Lingus currently serves.  Of these, at least 1.2 million passengers connected at Heathrow to other, mainly US, destinations.  I will discuss Newcastle specifically.  In 2014, Aer Lingus Regional carried 9,000 Newcastle passengers to or from the US through Dublin.  A further 300,000 passengers from Newcastle used Heathrow, not Dublin, as their connecting point.  These are passengers that Aer Lingus should win.  As part of IAG, Aer Lingus can win them.  Being part of a global airline family would fast-track the realisation of this opportunity.  This would help our airline to expand, meaning more aircraft and more jobs.  Aer Lingus would benefit from the passenger increase, as would Irish airports.  The overall economy would also benefit, particularly from more inbound US tourists.<\/p><p>  Consumers want choice and convenience, particularly when it comes to air traffic.  Consumers like the convenience of one website visit, one click to book, one check-in, straight through from start to finish on their journey.  An Aer Lingus alliance with IAG would realise these benefits for Irish consumers.  To drive and survive, airlines must constantly seek out and secure new opportunities.  Stobart Air believes that the IAG offer is such an opportunity.  The partnership of Stobart Air with a larger airline has enabled it to grow and has delivered significant consumer and employment benefits to the economy.  I believe the same can be replicated on an even larger scale if Aer Lingus joins forces with IAG.  That is why Stobart Air is backing the IAG bid for Aer Lingus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Brogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":292,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brogan.

Having had discussions with representatives of IAG and, indeed, listened to their contribution to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, it is apparent that IAG shares the same view as to the value of these opportunities; hence the proposal.  What is the opportunity?  Aer Lingus carried 1.3 million customers across the Atlantic last year and one in three of those customers was travelling between Europe and North America.  That additional business provided Aer Lingus with the ability to grow and sustain the frequency of existing services between Dublin or Shannon and North America.  Without that access to Europe and North American traffic, Aer Lingus would not be able to sustain the existing shape of the Aer Lingus transatlantic service.<\/p> <p>  That traffic also has a positive contribution to our short-haul network.  Simply put, if a passenger is travelling between Boston and Paris, Aer Lingus carries them to Dublin on the Atlantic aircraft.  It supports our connectivity to the UK and Europe and complements the natural demand between Ireland and the UK and Europe.  Aer Lingus sees this on a standalone basis as something that will allow it to grow into the future.  It will be challenging.  It is not without risk, given the scale of Aer Lingus and the shocks that are a feature of the aviation business.  However, it is a strategy that, as one can see from our financial results in recent years, has worked.  Aer Lingus believes that the geographic advantages that Ireland delivers in this regard are central to the proposition.  Rather than viewing Ireland's remote island status on the western periphery of Europe as a disadvantage, in this particular instance it is a key advantage.  It is an advantage from the customer's perspective because the time to traverse the Atlantic through Dublin is faster.  From an airline's perspective, the quicker the journey, the lower the cost.  The geography gives us natural economic advantages in serving the market.  The State has made the appropriate investments in terms of airport infrastructure.  The customs and border patrol facilities at Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport give Aer Lingus an added advantage.  <\/p> <p>   What is the additional opportunity with regard to IAG?  It is, in essence, scale.  Aer Lingus by itself will fight for its place in the market.  It has done so for close to 80 years and it will continue to do so.  What IAG brings to Aer Lingus is the ability to join forces; particularly in the Atlantic joint business, to have four airlines selling Aer Lingus seats as if they were their own allows Aer Lingus to compete.  It allows Aer Lingus to have more confidence in terms of the number of customers it can reach.  It allows Aer Lingus to have more confidence in terms of the costs to those customers because of the economies of scale.  Ultimately, it de-risks expansion for Aer Lingus.  The approach of four airlines selling jointly will accelerate opportunities that it would otherwise be challenging for Aer Lingus to exploit on its own.  This is a fast-track approach.  <\/p> <p>   The positives from an Aer Lingus perspective are not just to do with the Atlantic.  As I referenced earlier, those passengers have to be flown from the UK and Europe, hence the partnership with Stobart Air.  One hundred thousand customers use Stobart Air services.  More than 300,000 customers use Aer Lingus mainline transatlantic services from Dublin and Shannon.  Those services will be positively impacted not just by the incremental flow across the Atlantic but, further, by membership of the Oneworld alliance, as proposed by IAG, because in that instance there would be 15 global airlines selling seats to Shannon and Cork and Dublin.  So Aer Lingus sees the benefits in terms of the opportunity for accelerated growth.  In the absence of such a deal, the challenges will remain but there will be fewer opportunities and higher risks.  That scenario has direct implications for the confidence with which investment can be made.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Stephen Kavanagh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those are the circumstances under which we have no hesitation in recommending the proposal on the basis that it would be positive for Aer Lingus shareholders, for employees, for all stakeholders and ultimately for Ireland Inc. in terms of utilising the geographical advantages and retaining that economic opportunity within this economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":296,"content":"<p>What about the growth in Dublin <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>growth in the regions, including the regional airports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#D00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":297,"content":"<p>The growth will flow to all elements of the Aer Lingus network.

If British Airways is supplemented by the ability of all Oneworld members to sell seats on behalf of Aer Lingus between London and Shannon, there are no circumstances, from our analysis, on the basis of having more potential customers in a more cost-effective manner, under which the viability of the network is in any way compromised or less benefited than in the IAG proposal.  That is across the network.  It is about having an ability to reach more potential customers more cost-effectively.

There is opportunity in airports we service from Aberdeen to Edinburgh to Glasgow and right down through the UK.  We are taking passengers who select Aer Lingus, as opposed to the IAG platform, which would offer much greater exposure.  I put that down to the fact that since we formed the alliance with Aer Lingus, we have created 100 jobs.  That is on a much smaller scale.

I will be as quick as possible, because there are quite a few questions.  To clarify the issue that was raised regarding 200 versus 500 jobs, my understanding was that when Mr. Walsh was asked what he intended to bring to Aer Lingus, he said the contribution would be in terms of sales and supporting the efforts of Aer Lingus Regional to support its strategy, which was to deploy or to put on the fleet one wide-bodied aircraft per year for the next five years.  That is at variance with what Mr. Barrington has said, but maybe he can clarify that.<\/p> <p>  I listened with interest to what Mr. Barrington had to say.  He twice reminded us that this was the right strategic decision from a commercial point of view for Aer Lingus, for its employees, for its customers and for Ireland.  The only thing he has left out from that is the shareholders.  I would have thought that, as chairperson of the company, his primary objective was to work in the interest of the shareholders.  I am not sure where he stands on that.  He might help us to understand.  There has been some media comment about the directors of the company and how they, together with some senior management, will share in a &euro;30 million pot, some kind of bonus disbursal, as a result of the sale.  Maybe he could talk to us about that.  I would have liked to see before us today some of the independent directors on his board and be able to interact with them.  I would also have liked to see the directors appointed by the State, who, while they have a fiduciary duty to the company, also have a mandate from the Government to look at the broader regional aspects to the company's overall strategic direction.  Maybe Mr. Barrington can comment to some extent on that.<\/p> <p>  If this deal goes through, will there be an independent Aer Lingus board?  Mr. Kavanagh talked about management, head office, etc.  Will there be a board?  What has been going on in Aer Lingus?  Has there been long-term strategic planning or have the directors been working towards this day?  Has Aer Lingus been courting IAG or somebody in IAG's league?  Has it always been, in recent years, just about getting to a point at which the directors dispose of the airline, get their exit strategy and get to share that &euro;30 million pot?  I see a level of confusion between what the witnesses are telling me and what Willie Walsh tells me is their long-term strategy. If Mr. Brogan's interaction with them has been so successful, why have we not heard of Aer Lingus developing its own growth strategy as a relatively small independent operator?  My understanding was that there was an alliance with another airline about being able to buy aircraft relatively competitively.  If there was a long-term strategy, could it not have been achieved through a strategic link-up with IAG, rather than a capitulation or a sell-out?  Could Aer Lingus not have attempted to paddle its own canoe, to develop a strategic alliance whereby all the benefits that have been mentioned would still be there and would flow to the benefit of the company, the employees, the shareholders, and more importantly, this island nation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#D00600","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":301,"content":"<p>I will deal with some of those questions and perhaps Mr. Kavanagh might deal with some others.

That is why I mentioned the two that we can accelerate, plus what he mentioned, so I think we can do a bit better than that.  We do not need to agree with him on everything - he does not own us yet.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the shareholding and the &euro;30 million, I do not know where that figure came from.

We have competed between Europe and North America, hence the deliberate partnership and co-operation with our colleagues in Stobart Air and some of the arrangements we have made with partner airlines in North America to give us access to the US and Canadian markets and European hinterland.

We are not invalidating our current strategy.  The issue is the balance of opportunity, which will be increased, and risk, which will decrease.  That balance of opportunity and risk determines investment.  Both parties have a common view as to the level of the opportunity but our capacity to exploit that opportunity is reduced independently than it would be as part of IAG.  That is the just the reality of the position.  The committee should not take the view that we do not believe that we have a robust business that is capable of generating returns for shareholders and stakeholders.  That is not the stated position.  We are encouraged by the level of increased opportunity, which will generate incremental jobs.  That is an inevitability and they will be more sustainable as a result because they will be built on stronger foundations.  They will be high end, direct jobs ranging from pilots and cabin crew to engineers.  They will not just be incremental as there will be more promotion opportunities for colleagues are working in the enterprise.<\/p> <p>  Aer Lingus can realistically survive.  It has realistically survived thus far, although it is more challenged than ever because of the global nature of competition.  We serve the island and if we can continue to have that mindset, we will be increasingly vulnerable because that is a constrained market in terms of opportunity.  The opportunity for us is to compete and bring to the Europe-north America marketplace what we have been successfully doing for the Irish consumer and for those wishing to visit Ireland for the past 80 years.  That it the challenge.  The risk appetite is stopping us, and not just our personal risk appetite as we have to generate a return on other people's capital.  That return is more difficult to generate than the alternative within IAG but it does not preclude that investment.  It is then about the pace of that investment and, ultimately, the sustainability of that investment.<\/p> <p>  We are comfortable that we can get beyond 2%.  On a report in terms of competitive standings in Europe, one will go a long way before one will find 2% and, therefore, in many ways we are not relevant.  Once one becomes relevant, one becomes open to competition and to the challenges of what the large consolidated global carriers can do and that leaves us vulnerable.  It is a challenge we are up to.  We will continue to manage the costs in our business and to invest in the product but, undoubtedly, it is an additional challenge.  All this is simply a way of saying that the opportunity that the IAG proposal brings will be accelerated but also more sustainable growth.  The greatest protection any slot can have is sustainable profitability of the service provider that utilises it.  It is as simple as that.  We operate in the market.  The slots, as they are currently deployed, make a contribution.  Aer Lingus's primary role is to connect Ireland to the world.  Connecting Ireland to London is central to our product offering.  We are going nowhere on Cork, Shannon and Dublin to Heathrow Airport, but continued investment and competition is the greatest guarantee.  The capability of having One World partners and IAG partners selling those routes gives us added confidence that their sustainability can be only improved in that scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":327,"content":"<p>Last week Mr. Walsh referred to administrative job losses in the headquarters in Dublin.

We have partners who will actively sell Shannon.  Rather than having to make those decisions knowing that we will compromise, the objective is to have more demand than we have seats.  Ultimately, this is every airline planner's objective and this is what the proposed transaction brings to Aer Lingus.  Literally, it brings more customers for existing services, which sustains existing services, but also provides an ability to grow at a far more accelerated rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":334,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and congratulate Mr. Kavanagh on his appointment.  We have heard various opinions from the different groups that have attended this committee, but the overall opinion of people on the street is that Aer Lingus is doing well, passenger numbers are increasing, it is a modern airline and the hotel side and tourism are thriving and steadily and improving.  Why then would we look at trying to sell off an airline that seems to be doing well and making progress, albeit at a slow pace?  A slow pace is good.  Representatives from Stobart have said their business has grown 40% or 50%.  What more would one want?  Gradual improvement at that rate is steady progress.<br\/><br\/>What is lacking here is vision.  If I were CEO of Aer Lingus, I would be saying that I want to grow the airline on its own, for the shareholders, the State and everyone, and that is what I would be pushing for.  Senior executives stand to make money on their shares if Aer Lingus is sold.  I see this as a conflict of interest in the context of making a judgment and being objective.  In objective terms, they would say they should push ahead and work at growing the airline on a steady basis and open up routes.  This is happening and more connectivity is being developed.  I believe this is the way Aer Lingus should be going.<br\/><br\/>In regard to Stobart, what does it stand to gain financially in terms of shares?  Earlier we heard Aer Lingus is unsure how much senior executives will get.  I find that difficult to believe.  I am sure the board has a clear picture of how much each individual and each executive will get.  I would love to know how much Stobart stands to get.  Are pensions of both Aer Lingus and Stobart members involved in any deal?  Are Aer Lingus pensions invested in this?  What good is a five-year guarantee when we have a steady business that is making progress?<br\/><br\/>I found it interesting that Mr. Walsh mentioned the guarantees.  In an article in <i>The Guardian<\/i>last year or the previous year, he mentioned the main issue was long flights and that the slots in Heathrow were very important in this regard.  The 23 Aer Lingus slots are extremely important in the context of expanding business.  Is Aer Lingus aware that when the deal was made with the Spanish airline Iberia in 2011, more than 4,500 people were made redundant and even now more of that airline's staff are being laid off?  Can we accept the word of an organisation that is laying off people as we speak and that says it will create jobs?  We are told there is a possibility of 1,200 jobs being lost immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#G00200","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":335,"content":"<p>To repeat, Aer Lingus is successful by many measures.  This is testament to the efforts of many people over a long period.  What is under consideration here is an accelerated opportunity, an opportunity that may never be achievable on a stand alone basis.  That opportunity and valuation was part of the analysis and consideration of the proposal from IAG and we believe it fairly reflects the valuation and future potential of the business.<\/p> <p>  On why we would sell off Aer Lingus, I do not see it as a sell-off.  We are a plc.  What we are recommending is an ability to accelerate the value creation.  That is where not just shareholders, but stakeholders, employees and Ireland maintains a benefit.  The world does not stop to allow Aer Lingus to grow.  We carried 11 million customers in 2014, more than any time in our history, yet we do not make the top 50 carriers worldwide.  That is the nature of the business we compete in.  Increasingly, the airline business will consolidate.  There are significant economies of scale and significant cost benefits from having major fleets and significant revenue benefits from having global reach and partnership.  This is something we simply cannot ignore, albeit that - not waving a white flag - we have a solid business based on good fundamentals.  What is up for consideration here is the incremental opportunity.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the comparison or contrast with Iberia, first, I believe IAG sees the value inherent in the Aer Lingus strategy in terms of the opportunity to grow Ireland as a natural hub for transatlantic traffic.  Aer Lingus is a profitable business that has gone through many restructurings.  When British Airways and Iberia combined, Iberia was a deeply troubled business that needed to be restructured.  It is not comparable in any way to what IAG would be investing in if it was to secure Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus is a growth vehicle for IAG.  It is a &euro;1.4 billion investment from British Airways and IAG.  This is not an investment that will be recouped by redirecting passengers through Heathrow.  It is an investment that will be recovered and grown by exploiting the opportunity that exists for Aer Lingus, Dublin, Shannon and Cork to have a larger share of the Europe to North America market.<\/p> <p>  The inevitability of some back office support functions being lost is indisputable.  This is one of the rationales and is why consolidation is such a feature of the industry.  However, the opportunity here is the amount of direct employment that will be delivered from the growth, particularly of transatlantic capable aircraft, but also because of the support activities and because of the services provided not only by the airport but the businesses based on it and the spin-off.  Simply, having more access to the island generates more inbound tourism.  This has a significant indirect positive impact on levels of employment.<\/p> <p>  We have taken the time to consider deeply the implications of this offer.  The board and the executive management team are very conscious of the implications and the interests of stakeholders.  We have no hesitation in recommending the offer because we intuitively believe it is positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":336,"content":"<p>I wish to make just one comment.

That has happened and we have now started to fly with Flybe and CityJet.  The IAG proposal would allow us to continue that expansion but to express it.  We will continue to grow.  Aer Lingus Regional will only grow so far but Stobart Air will continue to grow and will continue to do so in a managed way.  To answer the Deputy's question about how big we want the airline to be, we intend to carry through on the commitments made at the time of the investment.

Some people are of the opinion that an airline must make massive leaps forward to be successful.  They suggest that smaller airlines must join forces with larger ones because consolidation is the way of the future.  I do not necessarily agree with that.  I believe that we should be taking steady steps, which we have done over the years.  The airline has steadily grown to 11 million passengers.

There is still an attachment to Aer Lingus on the part of many people.

IAG is buying a successful enterprise with a strong brand.  Swiss consumers still regularly use Swiss Air, which is owned by Lufthansa. Etihad owns Alitalia, while British Airways itself is owned by IAG.  This is a global business.  The corporate head office for British Airways is, notionally, in Madrid but that does not stop British consumers from viewing British Airways as the flag carrier.

Some of it shows that Aer Lingus has been operating under good management and is a profitable and growing company.  IAG will benefit from the takeover of Aer Lingus.  This is a change in the trend.  Iberia was really struggling and would have been a target for a takeover, as I imagine the balance sheet was not very strong.  With a strong brand and much potential, it would have been a realistic target for a takeover.  Aer Lingus is in a different place and is still growing, albeit at a slower pace than if the IAG takeover occurs.<\/p> <p>  I link that to the testimony of Mr. Brogan.  The relationship that Stobart Air and Aer Lingus Regional has with Aer Lingus has been hugely beneficial to his company.  I draw a comparison between that situation and Iberia and IAG.  In the case of Aer Lingus, it is completely different as it is a growing company in a takeover.  It is not a company on its own and there are codeshares.  Perhaps the witnesses can give me an idea of what this means for Aer Lingus if IAG is not in the room.  What does the codeshare with Star Alliance and Sky Team bring to Aer Lingus in terms of a global reach for consumers?<\/p> <p>  Equally, we can talk about the economies of scale that may be beneficial in the case of a takeover by IAG of Aer Lingus.  Can we hear about the benefits of the interline agreements with Etihad Airways, JetBlue and United Airlines, particularly in terms of procurement?  How will this change and what is the relative benefit of IAG becoming involved?  The IAG investment is &euro;1.4 billion.  This is the amount of funding on the table.  The company will not get it back from the Irish consumer.  The money will get a return from European and north American consumers and there will be only a marginal return in this country, based on a relative increase in activity.  Perhaps the witnesses will clarify how this will benefit the Irish consumer or the State in terms of an increase and how to link this to Aer Lingus growing on a faster and larger scale and the 6 million people living on this island, north and south.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#J00900","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":354,"content":"<p>Mr. Kavanagh mentioned the benefit of four airlines jointly selling seats on the same aircraft using a partnership approach.

It is not that company's record in Scotland according to the Government there.<br\/><br\/>I need all of the documentation on the slots.  It seems that in respect of the High Court judgment in London last Thursday, Aer Lingus was stating one thing here and another in the United Kingdom.  To quote from the judgment:<blockquote>Many of the potential competitive effects of the transaction that we considered [that is whether Ryanair should be a partner] would manifest themselves in terms of the absence of an action that might otherwise have been taken by Aer Lingus (for example, Aer Lingus being prevented from combining with another airline [which is what we are talking about today] or from disposing of Heathrow slots in the context of optimizing its route network and timetable).<\/blockquote>Was that case made by Aer Lingus in the UK courts?

It has identified London Heathrow, Madrid and Dublin Airport as the three hubs that are central to IAG competing for a share.  The impact on Scotland, the history of British Airways and the competitive dynamic in that marketplace are not matters on which I can comment.  What I can say is Scotland is a significant source market for Aer Lingus in transiting passengers between Scotland and North America.  I see no reason that would change.  In fact, it would improve in terms of our opportunity to compete in that marketplace.  Not only would we have British Airways selling Dublin on a neutral basis from Scotland, we would also have American Airlines selling seats to Scotland via Dublin Airport.<\/p> <p>  The issue for IAG from our analysis is competing for more of a share in the Europe to North America marketplace.  It is not a case of simply adding Aer Lingus to the IAG group and leaving it at that.  This is about growing the business.  It is about passengers choosing part of the product offering by IAG and its Atlantic joint business partner, rather than choosing to travel on United Airlines from Edinburgh.  This is about IAG diagnosing that the value proposition from Aer Lingus is capable of being competitive, that there is a growth opportunity and that ultimately two plus two equals five.<\/p> <p>  On preventing the disposal of slots, I have said the greatest protection slots have is delivering a sustainable economic return.  In circumstances where that is not possible, it is, of course, at the discretion of the State to purchase slots or to introduce a PSO to ensure connectivity.  Aer Lingus is a commercial enterprise.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Stephen Kavanagh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As a commercial enterprise, one of the issues with the Ryanair shareholding was that some of the commercial decisions would have been conflicted and restricted.  This is not to say Aer Lingus has immediate plans to dispose of slots.  As I said, the slots are core to the Aer Lingus customer proposition, given that Ireland-Heathrow is one of the busiest air routes on the globe.  It is also core to the British Airways network that Ireland retain its connectivity.  Shannon and Cork airports are key source routes for long-haul flow through Heathrow Airport.  The basic proposition is that the opportunity is to grow Dublin Airport as a hub.  This would benefit Aer Lingus and, ultimately, IAG because IAG would increase its share in the Europe to North America marketplace.

While they are strong, mutually beneficial relationships, there is not necessarily full alignment of mutual interests.  If United Airlines is selling a ticket between Chicago and Dublin, its first commercial instinct is to keep the customer in its own metal.  It will, therefore, attempt to direct the customer to Heathrow Airport and on to an Aer Lingus service from there to Dublin.  That is the natural conflict in the current code-share relationships.  The difference between such a relationship and the one suggested in IAG's proposal is that American Airlines would have an aligned and equivalent economic interest in selling a direct ticket from Chicago to Dublin.  While the current partner portfolio has worked very well for Aer Lingus and our partners, the depth of the relationships in terms of the co-ordination of schedules and customer proposition is constrained by regulations.  In the absence of an alignment of economic interests, there will always be competing demands between the two parties.  While Aer Lingus has strong, sustainable partnerships, we had diagnosed that deeper co-operation would be part of the next phase of our strategic road map, but before we had acted on it, we received IAG's proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":401,"content":"<p>I also asked about the alliance Aer Lingus had with Etihad and other airlines on issues such as procurement.

Etihad has an equity stake in Aer Lingus on the basis of which Aer Lingus has had access to some procurement benefits.  We work closely with our equity partner in Etihad to extract revenue benefits, for example, by having an Aer Lingus code on services to Australia and in procurement.  However, the benefits are limited because, given that Etihad owns 4% of Aer Lingus, it would not transfer the full economic benefit.  The combination of Aer Lingus as part of purchasing and procurement within Etihad gives Etihad more scale.

While it might sound trite, if one looks up on a spring morning at the contrails in the sky, they are passenger airlines flying from Europe to North America.  They are dropping customers in Heathrow Airport, Paris and Amsterdam.  Our proposition is that they should drop more customers in Dublin.  For Irish consumers, it would give more choice and, potentially, better value because, inevitably, flight prices will decrease over time.  The acceleration of growth will mean an acceleration of cost reductions and better value.  It is a virtuous circle and Dublin Airport's opportunity to compete.  Ireland's geography is our best advantage.  It is the shortest crossing, which is the most compelling advantage from a customer and cost perspective because one burns less fuel between Dublin and New York than between London and New York.  This natural advantage and the scale of Aer Lingus's operations at Dublin and Shannon airports in terms of our connectivity in Europe give us an ability to compete.  What we need is access to the marketplace.  In May we will not just be starting a Dublin to Washington route but also 60 routes that touch Washington, for example, Edinburgh-Dublin-Washington or Dublin-Washington-Boise, Idaho.  That is the power of a network and growth and capacity at a hub.  The quicker one has critical mass the more sustainable one is.

The witnesses might forgive me if some of the questions I intend to ask already have been asked.  On the presumption the witnesses have watched the joint committee's proceedings up to now in respect of the stakeholders that have appeared before members, I also presume they saw the presentation last week by Mr. Walsh, the chief executive officer of British Airways.  Specifically, last week he gave a commitment to Shannon and Cork in respect of the Heathrow slots but did not elaborate on transatlantic flights from the perspective of Shannon Airport.  In addition, he was somewhat reluctant to extend what is a five-year commitment beyond that.  I seek the witnesses' thoughts in this regard because from the point of view of the joint committee, the greater the commitment members can get, particularly for Shannon and Cork, the more that clarity will enter this debate.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate Mr. Kavanagh on his appointment.  How does he think the decision of Aer Lingus to come out in favour of the offer will be perceived in a region out of which Aer Lingus walked the last time there was talk of such a sale?  The bona fides of Aer Lingus in the mid-western region are not great because when the first tranche of shares was sold, Aer Lingus hightailed it out of Shannon Airport at the first opportunity.  When the 75% stake was sold, Aer Lingus left Shannon and left a sour taste in the region as a whole.  Does Mr. Kavanagh accept there is good reason for people, particularly in the mid-west, to be sceptical of what Aer Lingus now advocates based on previous experiences?  In addition, I note from the documentation received that the company's position has received board approval.  Mr. Kavanagh should elaborate on this board approval.  Was it unanimous?  Was there a vote at the board and were there dissenting voices or abstentions on the board?  The company has come clean, for want of a better phrase, on how it perceives the offer made by International Consolidated Airlines Group, IAG, to the Government.  Perhaps this is an opportunity for Aer Lingus to go the extra mile and throw out the whole lot as regards what were the deliberations within the board that resulted in the board giving its green light to the purchase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#O00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I will defer to the chairman with regard to the board because I am chief executive-designate and have not been necessarily present at all deliberations.  With regard to the Shannon to Heathrow route, let me put on record that the decision to remove service was a function of the level of losses, which were unsustainable.  Our position in Aer Lingus is that this unsustainability was reinforced through ill-judged incentives and subsidies that were given to a direct competitor at Shannon, whereby Aer Lingus was in the invidious position of paying full airport services and fees that were being transferred directly across the check-in counters to our direct competitor.  That did not work out well for Shannon Airport and we all have moved on in respect of the sustainability of the Shannon to Heathrow operation.  Today, that route makes a positive contribution to the Aer Lingus group.  We have, with the support of our colleagues in Shannon, restructured the business.  We are more efficient.  There also is far more transparency in the pricing and incentive regime at Shannon Airport.  While it is a little trite to state that times have changed, they have.  As I stated earlier, the greatest protection for the air service between Sharon and Heathrow is its profitability.  In addition, I believe that IAG has offered some guarantees as to the five-year commitment to maintain those services.  For a variety of reasons, I think that is a time limit which is a function of IAG's desire to maintain some commercial control over airport and vendor costs and so on.  It simply does not wish to transfer to an airport the security of being able to rely on this forever, thereby removing the commercial dynamic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":415,"content":"<p>On that basis, would it not make more sense to extend the guarantee to ten or 15 years because one then would have surety from the company's point of view as much as from that of the airport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#O00400","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":416,"content":"<p>Were the Deputy the airport operator, why would he give me a deal if I was saying I will be here for 15 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":417,"content":"<p>If I was the airport operator, why would I not ask for a deal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#O00600","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":418,"content":"<p>No, the airport operator, through its incentivisation and discounts of its charging regimes, can attract and sustain-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":419,"content":"<p>But is there not a win-win for both the airport and the airline if there is certainty regarding costs and everything into the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#O00800","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":420,"content":"<p>Not necessarily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":421,"content":"<p>Why?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#O01000","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":422,"content":"<p>Because going back every five years is far more advantageous in extracting value than is committing to a 15-year term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":423,"content":"<p>In terms of the region, is that not what this boils down to?

In a way, the presentations were much clearer than that made by Mr. Willie Walsh last week.  It is clear that both Aer Lingus and IAG intend to develop a hub in Ireland.  It is equally clear the hub will be based in Dublin Airport.  We have two State-owned airport groups, Shannon Airport and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA.  Is it possible to develop two hubs in a small country?  Mr. Walsh is of the view that it is not possible.  Mr. Kavanagh referred to Switzerland.  It is one of the few small countries with two, albeit relatively small, hubs in Geneva and Z&uuml;rich.  They are both connected with the state railway infrastructure.  There are many proposals to link Dublin Airport with the rail network, but I have not heard anybody mention Shannon Airport for ten years now.  Perhaps one cannot link one without the other because of state aid rules, but that is a different issue.  If Dublin Airport becomes a hub which, undoubtedly, would be good news for the airport, could Shannon Airport also become a hub?  Could it even survive as a transatlantic destination?  Would economies of scale inevitably pull all transatlantic flights from Ireland into Dublin Airport?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barrington referred to new Aer Lingus US destinations, one on the east coast and one on the west coast.  Will they fly into Dublin Airport or Shannon Airport?<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to be churlish, but Mr. Barrington has 300,000 shares in Aer Lingus.  If the IAG deal goes through, they will be worth &euro;765,000 to him.  There is nothing wrong with this, as that is how the corporate world works.  However, it is a lot of money.  Mr. Barrington&rsquo;s shareholding pales in comparison to that of the current chief executive.  Mr. Christoph M&uuml;ller received 1.5 million shares.  Now that Mr. Kavanagh is about to become chief executive officer, will he receive a similar share offering?  Is this standard for chief executive officers?  I am asking this question because I would find it very difficult to make a clear-sighted decision if the difference between one or the other was &euro;765,000.  I appreciate that the gentlemen concerned have much more business experience than I have, but these are real human emotions and motivations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#P01900","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":446,"content":"<p>We are looking after the taxpayers&rsquo; interests, namely, the 25.1% shareholding in the airline, as well as national and regional strategic interests.

When he was booking flights in May, he searched that service, as well as British Airways direct flights to and from Heathrow Airport, backtracking to Shannon Airport.

We all speak for our own regions and I am from County Mayo.  We are all delighted with the first charter flight from New York to Knock.  I know Aer Lingus played an important role in that coming about and Mr. Kavanagh in particular was instrumental.  In reality, what are the possibilities of us having more transatlantic charter flights, even schedule flights?  How feasible is that?  Would Mr. Kavanagh consider it?  Has he considered it as part of what he has agreed regarding this charter flight?  I know the appetite exists.  At the meeting last week I mentioned that, when the previous airline operated a transatlantic flight there, the route did not fail - there were other issues with that airline which caused the overall company to run into difficulty.  There is a massive appetite for this route and I know so many people who used it and would look forward to using it again.  <\/p> <p>  We are talking about the entire west and north-west area.  We have very poor connectivity in terms of roads.  If one were to draw a line from Galway up to Louth, there are no motorways, so this is a regional airport of significance.  I would like Aer Lingus to expand on that.  I know Deputy McNamara talked about the dangers of hubs and what that means for transatlantic traffic from Shannon, but I would like to think there could be further flights out of Knock.

I do not believe the same level of opportunity exists there because Shannon is not connected to Europe in the way Dublin is, nor will it be.  It is simply a fact that the demand for travel to and from Dublin is exponentially greater than the demand for travel to and from Shannon.  A hub needs connectivity.  The ability to flow passengers through Dublin, and the natural demand through Dublin, is on a different scale.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe that, as it builds out, Dublin will necessarily compete with or cannibalise Shannon.  There is resilient demand in Shannon.  The challenge always has been to profitably serve that demand.  The Dublin to New York route at peak has seven services a day, while Shannon to New York maintains two services a day in competition.  That is demonstrative of the resilience of routes at Shannon where there is demand.  The issue is the opportunity for growth and I see access to Oneworld selling access to other parties.  Actively selling Aer Lingus capacity neutrally can be only beneficial, but I do not see significant growth opportunities in terms of additional routes and frequencies.   It consolidates the opportunity that exists currently.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the basis of the valuation, I believe both the company and its advisers reviewed all of the assets - that was one of the criteria for valuation - as well as the more traditional valuation metrics, future earnings, past earnings, capital employed, etc.  All of the same criteria were used that would be used by the Government advisers in confirming the attractiveness or otherwise of the &euro;2.55 a share valuation.

After we entered a commitment, it was to prove that this vehicle was capable of delivering a sustainable profit and, thus, a sustainable service.<\/p> <p>  I will make a correction.  We never committed to providing a year-round, 365-day service to Boston and New York.  We signed a commercial arrangement with the Shannon Airport Authority that clearly stated the Shannon-New York service would be a nine-month one, with no service in the traditionally heavy loss-making and seasonally weakest first quarter.  Nevertheless, the Shannon-Boston route would be serviced on a 12-month basis.  We have fully met our commitments to the airport and communication at the time.  Be it a miscommunication or otherwise, we never committed to providing a year-round, twice daily service; rather, we committed to maintaining a year-round service.<\/p> <p>  The price of flights in this context could be expected and the consumer has more opportunities and choices.  It is the value proposition that will convert the consumer.  If one loses price competitiveness in an intensely competitive marketplace, one will lose traffic.  For example, Shannon Airport's customers have choices with United Airlines and Delta Airlines.  There is demand for services from the airport.  We should have confidence that there is a natural market between Shannon Airport and North America.  If British Airways or any other enterprise attempts to direct that traffic, competition will fill the vacuum.  That is what we see on a daily basis.  Across the world there are few monopolies in air transportation.  It is becoming transparent and in airlines' interests to maximise revenue, but there is always choice for consumers.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of Dublin Airport and pricing, I will use the San Francisco example.  If a consumer can find a cheaper route via Heathrow Airport, please let him or her make that choice.  We are operating a Dublin-San Francisco route.  Just as there are cheaper ways, in some instances, of getting to San Francisco from Dublin than with Aer Lingus, there are also cheaper ways of getting from Paris to San Francisco, some of which involve Aer Lingus, than using Air France's direct service.  That is the nature of competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#R01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":483,"content":"<p>I am talking about competition between Aer Lingus and IAG.

We enjoy working with the team at Knock airport and we were very interested in the opportunity to test the market for a service from New York.  The basic proposition is that we are in business to grow the business.  If demand between the US or Canada and Knock can be demonstrated we are open to servicing it.  I think, however, that any such demand would be on a fairly low scale and would be primarily seasonal, as was the case with the previous operator.<\/p> <p>  Our preference for a charter in this instance would be for somebody else to share some of the revenue risk.  In the case of a charter, a number of travel agents or committed parties commit to taking blocks of seats - a far less risky proposition than an airline independently attempting to sell 177 seats itself.  It is a market test and we will learn some things.  The scale from which we have benefited as a result of growth in the past number of years, including the addition of the Boeing 757 to our fleet to complement the wide-body A330s, gives us a greater capacity to trial and compete for business of this kind.  Let us see how it goes.  It was peak summer, it involved competing for very scarce aircraft resources and it won.  We are cautiously optimistic that it can be repeated.  It is a seasonal opportunity, though, and not even close to being a daily one, but it could deliver a service to Knock airport that did not previously exist.  We are here to grow the level of opportunity for Aer Lingus and, by default, for all the regions of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#S03500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":539,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Kavanagh envisage a once-a-week service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#S03600","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424183700,"counter":540,"content":"<p>If all the interested parties were to commit to a charter and produce the revenue required to sustain a year-round daily operation, I would gladly operate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/AGJ2015021700002#S03700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424183700,"counter":541,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Kavanagh describe who he considers would be the interested parties in the area?

If BA were to begin selling Knock as a destination, that bring us back to the basic point of this proposition, namely, that more people consider Knock as a destination.  Gatwick Airport is British Airways second most important hub.  It does not serve Dublin, Knock, or Belfast from Gatwick.  What Aer Lingus gains is that most powerful player in the UK market with significant loyalty based on a frequent flyer programme, to which Aer Lingus currently does not have access, and a vested interest in selling seats between London and Knock, which does not currently exist.

There are some processes within Aer Lingus that over time no longer had value for the customer, or the process has been replaced by automation or various things.  What I can say is that, ultimately, as Aer Lingus grows the level of employment in Aer Lingus will grow but the composition of that employment is dynamic.  A growing Aer Lingus in terms of fleet will ultimately require the workforce to accrue.  We are a relatively lean airline.  We have been through many restructurings in the past 20 years, in stark contrast to many carriers that continue to exist in Europe.  That is how we have managed to withstand fierce competition from a very successful local incumbent.  There will be job losses but there will be job losses in areas that do not add value to the enterprise.  Forgive me for being blunt, but if customers do not value the service, the service does not get produced.  Ultimately, however, there will be more employment opportunities created within the business in other areas.  That is what growth ultimately delivers.  Our proposition is that the growth and the opportunity that can be delivered is much greater under an IAG proposal than on a stand-alone basis but, as I said earlier, that does not invalidate our current business.

It is an honour to attend.<\/p> <p>  As members will see, we are seeking a &euro;790 million allocation for 2015.  We can stand over the value that we are yielding from the budgets the committee is giving us.  The amount is broken down into capital expenditure of &euro;489 million and current expenditure of &euro;301 million.  Our capital expenditure shows a modest improvement and we continue to make savings on the current side.  The one factor that members must watch out for is the 27th pay day in 2015, which may result in a change.  There is also a technical adjustment, in that &euro;39 million is being switched from the current side of the capital side.  Members should bear these factors in mind when assessing the Estimate.<\/p> <p>  This is a year in which we can expect solid progress across all of the areas in which we operate.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland had a record year.  Significantly, Enterprise Ireland's net employment creation exceeded that of IDA Ireland for the first time in a number of years.  This shows the powerful recovery that is occurring in many Irish-owned, export-oriented enterprises.  I do not know whether the figures are presented in this document, but members will also see that there has been a diversification in Enterprise Ireland companies' export destinations.  Many committee members have been keen to see this, with emerging markets becoming a more significant player.  What economists call Irish companies' export propensity - in other words, the percentage of their output that they export - is steadily increasing.  The committee is seeing a strong fight back by Irish companies finding new markets and using exports as a key driver of recovery.  We are improving in competitiveness rankings.  As the Minister of State, Deputy English, will undoubtedly point out, our ranking in terms of the impact of our innovation spend is also improving.  We are showing good, solid progress.<\/p> <p>  We are also continuing to undertake structural reforms within the Department.

The reforms play an important part in ensuring that we yield value for money.  They are reflected in the Estimate.  In April, we dissolved the county enterprise boards, CEBs, and established local enterprise offices, LEOs.  Since then and under the new service-level agreement with Enterprise Ireland, there has been a new dynamic in those offices.  As the CEOs of local authorities, county and city managers are significant new drivers of enterprise.  This alliance is working well and the LEOs are showing a good impact.  They have rolled out new projects successfully, for example, for young entrepreneurs.  They are also showing an impact on micro-finance, where the take-up level has nearly doubled.  They have been key agents.<\/p> <p>  We have dissolved Forf&aacute;s.  Deputy Calleary is concerned that, since its functions were brought into the Department, we have blunted Forf&aacute;s, but that is not the case.  It has been key to driving the Action Plan for Jobs and, through the National Competitiveness Council, continues to have an edge in its work.  Shannon Development was formally dissolved.  We merged the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.  The new commission is settling down well.  We passed the Companies Act 2014, which is major legislation.

He is also progressing the construction contracts legislation, which members will be aware had been held up.  <\/p><p> Looking to the future, we are seeking to identify the areas we need to continue to improve.  There is no doubt that the two main areas in this regard are entrepreneurship, where we can significantly improve our performance, and regional development.  Although every region has experienced overall employment growth, including through Enterprise Ireland and IDA, as measured by the QNHS there is no doubt that we can improve our capacity to exploit the potential of our regions.  This is something I am very keen to do.  We are starting a process this year which I hope will drive that forward in a way that has not been done before.  We are looking forward to a high quality of application for some of the competitive funds we are setting.  Our hope is that not only will this result in a more concerted action by the existing agencies in the regions, with a much more strategic look by those agencies at the regions, but that the process will act as a catalyst for the many other players in the regions in terms of their impact on enterprise growth.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#D00400","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":592,"content":"<p>We will now consider the Revised Estimate and, in particular, performance and expenditure proposals for 2015, programme by programme commencing with programme A - jobs and enterprise development.

However, is it a matter of concern to the Minister that while 15,012 jobs were created in 2014, 7,881 jobs were lost in IDA client companies, which equates to 52% of the number of jobs created?  It is a similar story in terms of Enterprise Ireland.  Is any work being done within the Department on identifying the reason for this high proportion of job losses?

The Deputy is correct to alert us to job losses, but that rate of job loss in the context of the IDA's total portfolio is 4%, which is one of the lowest on record.  It is marginally higher than last year, but last year it was at an extraordinarily low level.  We take a very keen interest in companies in difficulty.  The IDA has a substantial transformation programme targeted at identifying companies that need improvement in some area or another.  This year, for the first time, we are introducing a budget in the Action Plan for Jobs focused on lean processes to be applied in those companies and on management development to be available to the IDA.  Some of the EI programmes that were in place and which have established a track record are now being extended into the IDA.  Indeed, some of the lean process is done by EI on behalf of the IDA, so we are expanding the knowledge that was learned in Enterprise Ireland.<\/p> <p>  The same can be said of Enterprise Ireland, although I do not have the exact percentages.  Again, last year was higher than the previous year, but it was a very low number in the previous year.  What we saw in 2014 was something of a comeback in the level of job losses in some of the company base.  However, I expect that in the recession years there was a big shake-out and that left something of a dip, but we are well below what would traditionally be a norm for a job loss rate.  Nevertheless, the Deputy is correct and we are very alert to it.  It is key.  Maintaining a job is much easier than creating a new one, certainly in Enterprise Ireland companies.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the new units, the midland building is located at the IDA Garrycastle business and technology park.  It is 2,600 sq. m.  I will get the Deputy an update on the exact state of play on that, as I do not have the latest one with me.<\/p> <p>  On the LEO job creation, the LEOs are reporting full-time gains of 3,127 and part-time gains of 1,132.

I welcome the success in 2014.  Already this year, 2015, we have had major jobs announcements, including in my own area of Galway.  I welcome the increased allocations in the Estimates for those areas, including allocations for IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the LEOs.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the future, it is grand, as far as I know, to allow Northern Ireland to set its own corporation tax rate.  Can the Ministers let me know the strategies IDA Ireland will adopt to anticipate the move?  <\/p> <p>  My next question relates to the debate that is taking place in my other committee, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, on the possible exit of Britain from the EU.  Would this be an opportunity for Ireland?  Have IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland mentioned the development in their negotiations?  Jobs are not created overnight; it is a long-term process.  I would like the delegation to comment on the matter. <\/p> <p>  In regard to LEOs, there has been an increase in funding, and one of the outcomes is the implementation of 31 local enterprise development plans.  Is the Minister confident that each LEO is properly funded?  I am not talking about my own county.  Having talked to colleagues whose counties have LEOs, I heard one express the view that the LEO office consisted of two individuals.  Are counties monitored individually to track the staffing level in LEOs and whether they have the resources to complete the work they need to do?<\/p><p>I thank the Deputy for his acknowledgement of the progress being made.  Some exciting announcements have been made, particularly on the Enterprise Ireland side.  One can genuinely say we have Mittelstand companies, as they would be described in Germany, such as the likes of Combilift and Ribworld.  There are several that are now proving their capacity to be global players and they have the ambition to match.<\/p><p> I see no problem or threat in Northern Ireland having its own capacity to set corporate tax rates.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Richard Bruton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=119\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Richard Bruton\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUS&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Richard Bruton\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->One is competing daily with other European destinations or Singapore.  The competition for foreign direct investment is fierce.  Anything that is good for the island of Ireland's economy is really good for all of us.  I have no concerns on that front.  We compete all the time and we will continue to compete.  Obviously what might happen in the United Kingdom referendum in 2017 is an issue on which one will comment with a certain level of caution.  Other people are making decisions about their future.  In the natural course of such things, it throws up threats and opportunities.  I think the balance of advantage for Ireland as a country is to see Britain remain in the European Union.  Britain is our main trading partner, but of course we do not control the outcome of the referendum and we have to look at how we minimise the threats and take the opportunities that come as a result of such decisions.  While there is very active assessment of this, we will not try to influence the decisions of the British.  We work with the UK all the time, we have a very close relationship and clearly that relationship will remain.<\/p><p> The local enterprise offices, LEOs were established with both the existing complement of staff from the county enterprise boards and an incoming complement of staff from the local authorities.  It was bringing in the local authority business units, so there is no LEO operating with a lower staff complement than it had in the beginning.  We are conducting a review of resources and clearly we will be looking at the adequacy of the support in all cases.  We have specific permission also to have a graduate programme so we will be introducing graduates not to replace the core strength of the existing LEOs but to improve customer delivery and service and so on.  Obviously we are looking at this very closely.  There are four positions for head of enterprise currently being advertised in different areas by the Public Appointments Service.  Some unevenness has been inherited from the existing structure but we are trying to ensure we deliver an even service, and as resources become available, we will strengthen services.  We have specific opportunities to place graduates.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#G00800","speaker":"1110","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":613,"content":"<p>We will now deal with programme B - Innovations.  Does the Minister of State, Deputy English wish to make a brief opening statement?<\/p><p>I cannot repeat or stress often enough that innovation is at the heart of competitive advantage.  If one looks at the companies that are engaged in innovation and research and development, the case is proven by the increase in exports and the creation of more jobs.  Consecutive governments in the past 15 years have enjoyed success.  Our aim is to continue to build on that.  We invest &euro;730 million annually in research, which is a significant investment.  We constantly monitor it and keep working on it to ensure we get the results from it.<\/p><p>  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, commented on the question of global rankings, but let me add that we are first in the world for the availability of skilled labour, we are 11th in the global innovation index in 2014, and we are 13th in the world for university, industry preparation and research and development.  We are punching above our weight in some categories and that is where we want to be.<\/p><p> The key highlights for 2014 is the 102 high venture start-ups with a three-year commitment of more than 1,500 jobs.  There have been more than 1,700 collaborations between industry, third level institutions and Science Foundation Ireland researchers supporting the development of close business links between industry and research and the research system.  We are trying to build on that.  The plans for 2015 will be to enhance that relationship and to encourage more SMEs to get involved in the research community.  Five new research centres have been funded by SFI through an investment of &euro;155 million.  We thought it would have been two centres but five is a success story this year.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUS&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Some 475 students and researchers have been appointed on structured PhD and emerging technology programmes.  This is another example of something we want to encourage.  Since we last met, we have published Ireland's first national directory of research centres of scale.  Some Deputies will have a copy of the directory in front of them.  This important point of contact will flag to people looking in how the system works and where they can make contact.<\/p><p> The first national innovation showcase, which was held at the National Convention Centre, was a great success.  It was fully subscribed.  It was probably over-booked.  Over 2,000 entrepreneurs, industry representatives and researchers from around the country were involved that day.  It worked out very well.  Many relationships were developed and many connections were made on the day.  It is something we want to build on.  I am not sure when we will have the next one.  We will learn from this one.  Industry feedback has been very good.  We will be aiming to hold another event, in 2015 if possible.  The aim behind this is to develop our Horizon 2020 applications.  If we are to achieve our targets in this regard, there needs to be much more involvement from the SME sector and from the multinationals.  Our higher education institutions are probably doing their bit in terms of percentages, but we need to get a greater involvement from business as well.<\/p><p> I have touched on a few areas.  We are attempting to prioritise the funding that is available for the prioritisation agenda, which covers the 14 main areas.  I suppose our science sectors of excellence will push that agenda as well.

The view taken by the HSA is that resources need to be directed towards farm safety walks, discussions groups and this type of engagement.  Inspections in isolation do not seem to be bringing down the number of fatalities.  There is a huge job of work to be done by all of us to raise awareness.  We in public office and the representative organisations, including the IFA and the ICMSA, must work closely with the HSA and other relevant organisations to try to create a wider awareness of farm safety.  This is a priority for me.  The Health and Safety Authority and I plan over the next couple of months to hold a series of events throughout the country on what is called Workers' Memorial Day to raise awareness of safety in the workplace.  This will include farms as well.  I am quite positive about the approach being taken in terms of farm safety walks.

There will be significant resources, therefore, to allow it to carry out and commission research where gaps emerge.  For those who have seen the terms of reference, which I distributed to the committee recently, and the heads of the Bill, the data sets that the low pay commission will use to arrive at its annual recommendation for an appropriate national minimum wage are clear.  Where there are gaps, the commission will be enabled to initiate research to fill those gaps to ensure that it can arrive at a rate for the national minimum wage in an evidence-based and robust way.

The truth is that Irish enterprise and Irish workers have shown remarkable resilience in the face of difficult circumstances.  We have seen them finding new markets, going further afield, applying innovation and applying more lean processes to become globally competitive.  They have been extraordinarily successful in this regard.  We have yet to see the confirmed Enterprise Ireland expert numbers but it appears they have performed exceptionally well in 2014, certainly beyond wildest expectations.  With their backs to the wall, people have shown fantastic ingenuity.<\/p> <p>  Another encouraging aspect is that we are beginning to see start-ups on a far wider scale.  It is heartening to see the growth in the numbers of people starting their own business.  Moreover, the indication is that the number of people who would consider starting their own business is even higher or at least showing greater growth.  There seems to be a good climate here.<\/p> <p>  The challenge for all of us is to ensure that the policy regimes sustain these changes.  This good growth has not happened by accident.  We have moved mountains across all Departments, not only ours, to consider the skills base, the tax mix as well as the things we do in the areas of health, education, the environment and infrastructure to make it easier.  These policies must be sustained.  We need to be competitive in the long term if we are to achieve sustainable full employment.<\/p> <p>  Twice in a generation I have seen a situation where the country has had within its grasp the capability of becoming a full employment economy on a sustainable basis.  However, we lost the run of ourselves and committed to unsustainable policies that simply fell flat on their face.  Significant damage was done.  One of the things we need to learn is that policy matters.  The type of sustained policies we have been trying to put in place are important for the long term for this economy as well as for our capacity to provide employment for people who genuinely want to stay here.  Perhaps this does not apply to everyone.  Some people will want to travel.  However, we need to be able to get back to a position where anyone who wishes it can choose to work in this economy, and we are on the way.  Unemployment and emigration are coming down, but we need to sustain the approach.<\/p><p>I wish to add to the comments of Deputy Conaghan.  It seems more jobs are becoming available as well.  There is an issue now in respect of ensuring we have the skills to fill all the jobs being created, now and in the months and years ahead.<\/p><p> Under the Action Plan for Jobs, one of the indicators of performance is the national talent drive.  This involves making sure we have a good deal of home-grown talent to fill these jobs, but it will make it a little easier to bring in talent from abroad, when necessary, to augment that supply.<\/p><p> This committee has considered reports over the years which have identified areas like apprenticeships, where we have to change how we do it.  The main aim of this year's Action Plan for Jobs is to have a further engagement between industry and the education system to ensure we are developing the skills and the jobs we need.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Damien English:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1781\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUS&amp;amp;memberid=1781&amp;amp;pid=DamienEnglishFG&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Damien English\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->There may be a role, following on from some of the previous reports, in making that connection.  <\/p><p>The new apprenticeship council, which was formed before Christmas, has made a call for proposals from industry, representative bodies and so on for new apprenticeship suggestions.  Various Departments are now out beating the bushes to get people, organisations and industries interested and coming in with their ideas.  We need to do some work to make sure this happens.<\/p><p> We need to develop schemes that have on-the-job training, involve employers in identifying courses, needs and so on, and make sure they are involved in training and outputs.  This is important because there is no point in creating jobs in six months' time if we cannot fill them with people who are living in the country.  A lot of work needs to be done and we are focused on it.  It is in the Action Plan for Jobs.  The committee was part of that in recent years and we need to build on it.  <\/p><p> There is an awareness issue, and industry has to step up.  There is no point in members of the committee telling people around the country that they could employ 50 or 60 people if they will not get involved in training them to make sure the skills exist.  It is a challenge and a sign of recovery, but we have to build on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#L00400","speaker":"1016","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":638,"content":"<p>I welcome Deputy Conaghan's remarks.  As a Minister of State with responsibility for SMEs, I have had the opportunity over the past few months to travel around the country and talk to SME owners and managers about their experiences.  We are now in an entirely different space even compared to two years ago.  There is now much more confidence out there.  The local enterprise office approach is working.  I visited quite a number of them over the past few weeks.  That is not to say there are not still challenges.  We need to keep a very close eye on their resources and make sure they are supported in developing over the next period and meeting the challenges that exist.  One of the most significant things Ministers and Ministers of State can do over the next period is to marshal through regional economic strategies.  It is no longer any use to try to create the impression that every region of the country is competing for the same type of foreign direct investment.  We need a balanced regional approach.  <\/p> <p>  The regional economic strategies will essentially be an action plan for jobs at a local and regional level.  That is a process initiated by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and Department officials.  It is a strategy that has been proven to work.  We will see a process whereby local agencies such as the IDA or Enterprise Ireland will take responsibility for driving these strategies and showing leadership at a local level - working with local authorities, third level institutes, local enterprise offices and so on - to make sure we get the balanced regional economic activity that we need.  There is very little point in having an economic recovery that is focused on our main cities.  We will spread that right across the country and will have a very involved process in terms of developing regional strategies.<\/p> <p>  It is also important that we have harmonious industrial relations and progressive legislation - it is recognised that our legislation is the best in developed economies - which is developed in partnership with employers and trade unions in the way that we seek to address issues around the REA and collective bargaining legislation.  It is important that we do that in collaboration and partnership with employers, trade unions and those who represent working people.  <\/p> <p>  With regard to balanced economic development, I do not mean just regional development.  I also mean making work pay and making sure that people are always better off in work rather than ensnared in a social welfare system from which they cannot get out.  The best thing we can do is to provide somebody with the dignity of a job, and that is what we are all committed to doing.  We have seen our economy recover considerably over the recent past.  There is still a lot to do, and we are all very focused on that in terms of regional strategies and all the work we are doing in the Department.  We can be positive and optimistic about the future.<\/p><p>I ask the Minister of State to keep a sharper eye on small craft industries which sometimes go unnoticed.  One such industry started in a prefab in a VEC school in Ballyfermot 14 years ago and was the beginning of the modern film animation industry.  It has now been to Hollywood on four occasions for the Oscars.  There are other people in creative categories who may need to put their heads over the water.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Michael Conaghan:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2291\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Michael Conaghan\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUS&amp;amp;memberid=2291&amp;amp;pid=MichaelConaghan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Michael Conaghan\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->We must let the people involved in those types of small-scale initiatives know there are supports and funding available to assist them.  I was on the board of that school at the time the project was launched.  Initiatives like that can be multiplied several times, as I am sure is happening throughout the country, but they need recognition and support from the beginning.  We must keep a sharper eye out for those types of creative efforts.  It would be enormously encouraging for those involved if somebody could reach out to them at an early stage in their development and offer a small grant or other types of support.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#M00200","speaker":"1067","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":641,"content":"<p>The local enterprise offices are effectively first-stop shops for all such initiatives, but we are also stepping up the advertising of the more than 80 programmes that are available to small and start-up businesses.

Many of these schemes have take-up way below their capability, and we want to see progress in that regard.<br\/><br\/>As the Minister of State, Deputy Nash, outlined, the thinking behind the regional enterprise strategy is that there are many opportunities for community enterprise centres to become much more innovative in what they offer their client base.  They might tap into institutes of education, for instance, or tap into a chamber of commerce with accountancy support.  There is scope to have an entrepreneur in residence or available as an advisory resource.  Those little hubs have good potential to step up their performance, and that is what we hope will come out of this regional call.  We want people to consider how they can tap into available resources and make more of what they currently have and are doing.  One idea might be seek the assistance of a local person who is recognised as an entrepreneur made good and get some momentum behind particular initiatives.  There are great ideas out there and there are people doing great things, but we need to tap into them at regional level.

As part of the new rural development plan, that programme might not be approved until the end of year.  In other words, because of the changeover with the Common Agricultural Policy regime and the rural development programme, the programme is effectively in abeyance.  Will the Minister comment on that?<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Nash, referred to the provision of rural broadband services.  I acknowledge that the roll-out plan is proceeding and there is European Commission approval for state aid.  However, it is vital that progress be made as quickly as possible.  Is there potential to expedite the tendering process?  Even though good plans have been put forward by Vodafone in co-operation with various groups, they are targeting places that already have adequate broadband.  In fact, there is reference to the 50 largest towns, which includes Dublin, Galway and other urban centres.  I understand there are commercial reasons for that, but the problem is that it is the areas outside these urban centres which are dealing with inadequate service.<\/p> <p>  My final point is more of a political one, but it seems okay to raise it as there are only Government Members present.  We are well on our way to achieving the target of creating 100,000 new jobs during the Government's term in office.  I am concerned, however, that the target of 40,000 for this year is a little ambitious.  Of course ambition is good and I hope the target is exceeded.  However, in the event that 35,000 or 38,000 new jobs are created, which would still be a tremendous achievement, my concern is that we will see headlines about the Government failing to meet its jobs target.  There has been great progress in recent years on the job creation front, but the Minister will understand my concern in this regard.<\/p><p>We see the regional enterprise strategy, like the Action Plan for Jobs, as being an annual event.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, is working on the issue of broadband provision and a tender will be drawn up later in the year, but there is a lot that can be done with our existing resources.  We are very much about looking to see what we can do today that will enhance the performance of a region in the next 12 months.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy Richard Bruton:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=119\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy Richard Bruton\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUS&amp;amp;memberid=119&amp;amp;pid=RichardBruton&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy Richard Bruton\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->A year from now, we can consider what can be done afresh.  We should not stop what we are doing just because the Leader programme might be postponed.  At the end of March we will be calling on local enterprise offices and community enterprise centres to commence the process of encouraging people to consider how they might enhance the assets they already possess.<\/p><p> When we declared our ambition of creating 100,000 new jobs, people said we were overestimating what was possible.  All the critics stated that if various Departments' statistics were taken into account, it was obvious that what we were seeking to do could not happen.  However, it has happened.  I am of the view that there is an opportunity to push on in this regard.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland companies are performing strongly and the construction industry, although coming off a very low base, is moving again.  Parts of the retail sector will struggle as a result of the switch to trading online, but other areas of it are showing a strong recovery.  If we can put in place some of the things to which I refer, encourage entrepreneurship and make it easier to start up businesses, then we will deliver on those targets.  I would not be disappointed if, ultimately, we were to hit 95% and fall slightly short.  We have been in the businesses of setting stretched targets all through this process and we can stand over what we are delivering in this regard.<\/p><p>I congratulate the Minister and Ministers of State on the work they have done.  A Government Deputy would almost be expected to say that but I genuinely mean it.<br\/><br\/>We are in a different place now than was the case four years ago in the context of what is available for SMEs.  When one is driving to work, one regularly hears radio advertisements relating to the Credit Review Office, access to finance, etc.  However, is a person who owns a shop in Phibsborough, which I might pass on my way home, aware of what is available to him or her?  I accept that it is not possible to knock on the door of every SME throughout the country and spend an hour explaining to its owners the massive suite of options that exists and the fact that they may be able to avail of some of those options.  The Minister referred to the <i>actionplanforjobs.ie<\/i>website and there is also the online tool for SMEs.  These are great but what sort of checks are in place to ensure that the maximum number of people possible are using those tools?  In the computer age in which we live, websites are windows and those windows require to be changed almost daily.  I mean this in the most respectful way but I remain somewhat unconvinced with regard to this matter.  As the Minister and Ministers of State will be aware because they meet them regularly, there are those in the SME sector who perform three jobs, for which they receive a single salary, and who work around the clock.  Sometimes these people, when checking their post each day, might miss some material relating to that which we are discussing.  That material could take the form of a very important document which might, for example, highlight some of the really good things being done by the Government to improve the SME platform in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>What checks are in place to monitor whether the tools which have been developed, particularly those available online, are being used by sufficient numbers of people to ensure that <i>actionplanforjobs.ie<\/i>is both reaching its target audience and paying for itself?  Essentially, there is a job to be done in terms of monitoring the advertising of the various schemes to ensure that those schemes are working for us.  I am a member of the Ballymun Civic Alliance, which replaced Ballymun Regeneration.  The local enterprise office is represented on the alliance and one of the other members is an individual who runs a very successful business on Dublin's northside.  People, SMEs and other organisations involved with the Ballymun Civic Alliance and bodies like it are all clued in to what is happening.  I am concerned about those people who are not aware of what is going on because they are not involved in this way.  I am sometimes of the view that I might know more than the owners of SMEs about the various services that are available to them.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy John Lyons:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2307\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy John Lyons\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUS&amp;amp;memberid=2307&amp;amp;pid=JohnLyonsLab&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy John Lyons\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This is not a criticism but a concern.

To assuage my concerns, will the Minister consider including a budget line for the National Competitiveness Council so I can see where the money is?<\/p><p>The National Competitiveness Council is a group of people serviced by the strategic policy unit of the Department.  It is not a spending centre.  It commissions consultancy reports and publishes reports, and is entirely independent.  A new chairman has just been appointed.  I strengthened the council by including industry partners who are actively engaged in key sectors and we have an effective body.  It is not a question of a line in the budget; the real issue is to ensure our strategic policy unit is a real driver of new thinking in the Department, and at present it is working on enterprise 2025.  Traditionally the Department has had strong agencies and a weak Department.  Forf&aacute;s was outsourced and largely run under the auspices of the agencies.  The idea of bringing it in is to give the Department a stronger arm in being able to think afresh, which we are determined to do.  We established a protocol at the very start to ensure Forf&aacute;s would not be sucked into line management and would retain its independence and capacity to produce reports without fear or favour.  It is not so much about Forf&aacute;s being a line in the budget, but about giving it this independence.

I intend to co-operate closely with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  As I said to Deputy Kyne while the Deputy had stepped out, the number of farm fatalities are worrying.  The HSA will direct resources into the area of farm safety and walks, and also discussion groups.  They are important to get to the harder-to-reach farmers and I believe that has to come from the community with the support of the HSA.

However, if they do not have broadband, they cannot do that.  That is critical for certain areas, and particularly those that have enterprise parks.

I will preface my remarks by addressing two issues.  First, I wish to inform the committee that the Institute of International and European Affairs has just finished editing a book on Great Britain and Europe that we expect to publish on the web early in March and as a printed book later in March so it may be of some help to the committee in its studies.<\/p> <p>  Second, the situation in the UK is very uncertain and entirely unpredictable.  The Prime Minister, David Cameron, has said that he wants to have a referendum in 2017.  We in the institute think that regardless of whether Mr. Cameron is re-elected, a referendum in the UK is likely in the next few years and that, in practice, this referendum will be of an \"in-out\" nature.  However, we do not know what the British want.  The Prime Minister has said that if he has a successful renegotiation with Europe, he will recommend a \"Yes\" vote.  The British Government has not made clear what it actually wants in a renegotiation so this is uncertain.  There will be one negotiation between now and whenever there is a referendum but we do not know what it will be and we do not know what the issues are.<\/p> <p>  When the referendum comes, we do not know whether it will result in a vote to remain within the EU or a vote to withdraw from it.  If it is a vote to withdraw from the EU, there will then be a negotiation period which will probably take the best part of two years.  This negotiation will essentially be led by the European Council but most of the work will be done by the European Commission.  There is a further question regarding what will happen internally in the UK if there is a vote to withdraw.  The Scottish National Party has already said that it does not want Scotland to withdraw unless there is a majority vote in Scotland to do so.  There is great uncertainty and the possibility of two negotiations, all of which would affect Ireland's relations with the UK and Europe.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to trade.  By trade, I mean both merchandise and services.  Trade is one of the key economic linkages between Ireland and the UK.  The impact on that trade will depend on what happens in the first negotiation and the second negotiation if this takes place.  At the moment, trade between Ireland and the UK, like trade between Ireland and the rest of the EU, takes place on the basis of the EU Internal Market - the Single Market.  The British appear to be quite happy with the Single Market.  From time to time, one sees commentaries in the British press stating that they would like to remain in the Single Market.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, as I am sure some of my colleagues will mention later, some of the basic freedoms in Europe underpinning that single market are freedoms about which people in Britain are demanding serious changes, such as the free movement of people.<\/p><p> If there are negotiations following a referendum to withdraw, there is no doubt but that trade between Britain and Ireland would be affected.  That is really what we need to examine.  We also need to know how much trade there is between Britain and Ireland.  In 2012, 43% of merchandise exports from Irish-owned firms went to the United Kingdom.  The proportion of exports from non-Irish-owned firms is much lower, at about 12%.  About 20% of our services exports went from Ireland to the UK.  Therefore, should there be a change in the arrangements about trade, there will obviously be very big implications indeed for Irish exports to the UK.  In the book I mentioned earlier, there is an attempt to quantify the result on this trade, and on Ireland, of a British withdrawal from the EU.  The argument is that the effect on Irish exports, were the UK to withdraw from the EU, could be in the order of a decrease of 3.6%.  I should mention that there are so many ifs and buts in this thing that we need to examine that figure with caution, but that is the way it looks.<\/p><p> Should the British succeed in a renegotiation of their terms of membership between now and the time of a referendum, and remain in the EU, that in itself could have an effect on our trade.  Should they withdraw, however, the effect is likely to be much greater.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":669,"content":"<p>Our next contributor is Ms Siobh&aacute;n Mullally, who is a professor of law and director of the Centre for Criminal Justice and Human Rights at UCC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#D00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":670,"content":"<p>I am going to talk about the possible implications of a UK withdrawal from the EU with regard to free movement of persons.  The debate concerning the UK's membership of the EU and a possible withdrawal has centred to a considerable extent on the free movement of persons.  Proponents of reform argue that the current EU legal framework does not provide adequate safeguards to ensure the free movement of persons without overburdening member states' public finances.<\/p> <p>  The free movement of persons is protected in the EU treaties and also in the charter of fundamental rights, where we also see a protection of access to social security benefits and social advantages.  Also of relevance here is the 2004 citizens directive.  Of the proposals to reform current EU free movement law as part of a possible precondition to the UK's remaining within the EU, several of the proposals that have been raised would require a treaty amendment and unanimous approval by each of the 28 member states, followed by enactment into domestic law.  Other proposals do not require such change.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, it should be noted that one of the key concerns for Ireland will be the continuing functioning of the common travel area.  Movement between Ireland and the UK of EEA and non-EEA nationals is likely to be significantly affected should the British exit proceed.  As recently as December 2011, a joint programme of work was agreed to strengthen the security arrangements of the common travel area and to provide a framework for a more strategic approach for this co-operation.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Given this quite recent initiative and the existence of the common travel area arrangements, albeit relatively informally for a significant period, it seems likely that the UK would wish to treat Irish citizens differently from other EEA nationals should withdrawal proceed.<\/p><p> If withdrawal were to proceed, there would be a number of possible scenarios, which have been discussed.  There are uncertainties associated with each.  One possibility would be that the United Kingdom would remain as a member state of the EEA and continue to participate in the Single Market with a status similar to that currently enjoyed by Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, for example.  This would require little change to free movement rights but is unlikely to be an option given that much of the debate on withdrawal has centred on limiting free movement rights.  Discrimination between EU citizens dependent on their country of origin is likely to be problematic as a matter of EU law.<\/p><p> A second possible scenario would be bilateral negotiations whereby the United Kingdom would negotiate bilateral arrangements with selected EU member states.  This, however, would lead to significant fragmentation of free movement rights and could create difficulties, particularly for Schengen area states if all Schengen area members were not to be included in such bilateral agreements.  As such, it is likely to be politically difficult for any individual member state to negotiate bilaterally with the United Kingdom.<\/p><p> A third option would be that domestic UK laws on immigration would apply, in which case we would see a repeal of the exceptions currently provided for EEA citizens.  In such a scenario, EEA citizens and family members already in the United Kingdom may be permitted to remain - as permanent residents, for example.  Those without rights to permanent residence, particularly jobseekers, would be easier to remove given that the current protections provided by free movement law would not apply.  What we would then see would be the introduction of visa requirements for entry for work, study or family reunification.  EEA nationals would effectively be treated as third country nationals are treated at present.  A range of possible restrictions could be introduced, including visa requirements, linked, for example, to minimum income requirements, language skills and the supply of biometric information.  We would see a phenomenon akin to the current five-tier points system that applies in UK immigration law being applied to EEA nationals.  There is concern that this would lead to significant reductions in migrant workers, including highly skilled workers, coming to the United Kingdom.  Any of these scenarios would be likely to have a significant impact on the operation of the common travel area between Ireland and the United Kingdom.<\/p><p> With regard to the possible reforms that are being mooted as a precondition to the United Kingdom remaining within the EU, a number of touch on free movement.  One covers access to social security payments, including a proposal limiting access to housing benefits, social housing and tax credits for a minimum period, possibly up to four or five years.  With regard to EU citizens who are categorised as workers as defined in EU law, a change in the EU treaties would be required.  Therefore, it would seem unlikely to come into effect.  For those who are jobseekers or do not meet the definition of \"worker\" or \"former worker\", this reform would be less problematic.  The European Court of Justice judgment in the Dano case in November 2014 confirmed that limits can be placed on access to non-contributory benefits, including a requirement that the residence conditions of the citizens directive be complied with.<\/p><p> A related proposal would be that the UK Government would seek to renegotiate the principle of exportability so origin states would remain legally responsible for covering unemployment or non-contributory benefits that would, for example, be required by their own citizens for a minimum period.<\/p><p> There is some commentary that these changes would not lead to any significant changes in terms of movement of EU or EEA nationals and that they may actually lead to more vulnerable persons falling through the cracks of social protection.  It could have a significant impact on UK nationals living in other EU countries.  This, of course, is of significant concern to a number of countries, including Ireland, Spain, France and Germany, where the costs of providing health care are high and where the number of ageing UK citizens would be significant.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> A second proposed reform would be in the area of rights to family unity and family protection.  The right to private and family life is protected in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights and also, of course, under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  A proposal to impose restrictions on the entry of non-EU citizen family members in light of the Metock judgment could create difficulties and may be viewed as requiring a treaty amendment, at least with regard to those persons categorised as workers and former workers - those who derive rights from the treaties.  Other proposals - for example, to link family reunion to minimum income requirements and language skills - have already led to some criticism from the European Court of Justice.<\/p><p> A third proposed area of reform relates to the possibility of limiting rights of entry for job seekers by imposing a requirement that an EU or EEA national seeking entry to the UK be in possession of a genuine job offer.  This could raise practical difficulties, but also legal difficulties.  Currently, an EU citizen can reside for a three-month period with a valid passport and without recourse to social assistance, and thereafter the right to reside is dependent on having sufficient resources and sickness insurance.  Those EU treaty rights to free movement also apply to job seekers, which is particularly relevant here, so long as they have a genuine chance of being engaged in employment.  It is likely that a treaty amendment would be required to effect such a reform, and this would be difficult given the protections of the right to private and family life in European human rights and fundamental rights law.  Linked to that is a proposal that job seekers who do not secure employment within a six-month period could be removed.  This also would lead to difficulties and would come into conflict with decisions already given by the European Court of Justice, notably in the Antonissen case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":673,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Alan Matthews, professor of European agricultural policy at the Department of Economics at Trinity College.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#F00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":674,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to talk to the committee about the implications of a British withdrawal from the European Union for the Irish agrifood sector.  My remarks summarise a somewhat longer submission, which I have made available to the secretariat.<br\/><br\/>The former ambassador, Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh, referred to the importance of trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom, but the trade links in the agrifood sector are even more important, and more important than for any other EU country.  Approximately 51% of Ireland's total agrifood imports are from the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom takes approximately 51% - the same percentage - of our total agrifood exports.  Therefore, more than half of imports and exports of agrifood products come from and go to the United Kingdom.  These are also much higher proportions than for Irish manufacturing.  A British exit, or &quot;Brexit&quot;, from the EU could potentially lead to significant disruption of this trade.<br\/><br\/>As the previous speakers have mentioned, much would depend on the nature of the trade relationship that is put in place between the UK and the EU post-Brexit.  The various alternatives that are on the table include: membership of the European Economic Area, as in the case of Norway; membership of European Free Trade Association, EFTA, combined with literally dozens of bilateral agreements approximating the Single Market, as in the case of Switzerland; a customs union, as in the case of Turkey; a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement, as negotiated with Canada; or trade on most-favoured-nation terms without a trade agreement.  I agree with the other guests that the UK is not likely to leave the EU because it dislikes some Single Market regulations, only to sign up to these again outside the EU.  Therefore, the most likely outcome is a free trade agreement in which the UK is no longer a member of the Single Market, tariffs on most - if not all - trade between the two partners are eliminated and the United Kingdom is free to set its own trade policy, including tariffs with third countries.  In my view, there is a good possibility that in that scenario trade in agrifood products would also remain tariff-free.  I will call that the good outcome, although it is clearly less desirable than the maintenance of the <i>status quo<\/i>.  In another scenario, tariffs might be reintroduced on some primary agricultural products and the primary element of processed products, which could include important Irish exports such as beef and dairy products.  I will refer to that as the bad outcome.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Alan Matthews:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Even in the good outcome, without the reintroduction of tariffs, there would be additional costs to trading compared to the current situation.  Trade conditions would revert to what they were in the early 1990s prior to the introduction of the Single Market.  Trade costs arising, for example, from the reintroduction of Customs controls, rules of origin checks, import licence requirements as well as the additional costs of complying with two different regulatory regimes where regulatory divergence occurs, would increase.  This would put downward pressure on producer prices in Ireland and upward pressure on consumer prices, an important issue given the close integration of supermarket supply chains between the two countries.<\/p><p> The United Kingdom, given what we know about its preferences regarding food and farm prices, would be likely to adopt a less protectionist trade policy with respect to third countries.  That means its average tariff on agrifood products would likely be lower than the EU tariff it applies today.  It may also find it easier to enter into free trade agreements with extensive agricultural concessions with partners such as New Zealand, Australia, Mercosur and the United States.  For both reasons, competition on the UK market will intensify for Irish exporters, even in the good scenario.<\/p><p> Food trade, more than most, is governed by detailed regulations governing plant and animal health and safety, marketing standards, labelling requirements, allowed food ingredients and many other areas.  The greater the degree of regulatory divergence between the UK and the EU, the greater will be the costs for Irish exporters and importers.  As aversion to EU regulations is one of the driving forces behind BrExit, one would expect the UK to adopt different regulations in many areas, although there are countervailing forces such as strong UK consumer, environmental and public health organisations which will seek to maintain high standards, as well as the fact that the EU will remain the UK's largest trading partner in food and agriculture, both of which will give it an incentive to keep its regulations harmonised with the EU, perhaps by continuing to transpose EU regulations into British law.  Nonetheless, examples where different regulatory regimes might emerge include the regulation of plant pesticide products, genetically modified crops and animals, and food labelling.  These are all areas where the UK position is at variance with the EU position at the moment.  Dealing with these different standards will imply higher costs for both exporters and importers.<\/p><p> If tariffs were to be reintroduced on some elements of agrifood trade between the UK and Ireland, in what I have called the bad outcome, trading costs could be increased by much more and, in some cases, could become prohibitive.  The question of tariffs is also relevant to the introduction of an economic border between North and South of the island.  Land borders between EU and non-EU countries are not unusual and in principle, under the good scenario, would not lead to problems additional to what I have already mentioned.  Even if the UK were to pursue a less protectionist and more consumer friendly farm and food policy after BrExit, the likely change in food prices North and South of the Border would be much smaller than what we observe today as a result of exchange rate fluctuations.  However, if tariffs were reintroduced there would again be incentives to smuggle those agricultural and food products subject to high tariffs.<\/p><p> There might be a temptation among some in Ireland to welcome Britain's exit from the EU because of its traditionally hostile attitude to the Common Agricultural Policy.  However, in my view the overall impact of UK withdrawal on the future of the CAP would be rather minimal.  Partly, the succession of CAP reforms and the greater flexibility provided to member states under the 2013 reform address many of the UK concerns.  It is true the EU would lose a voice arguing for fewer exemptions and more trade liberalisation in concluding trade agreements with, for example, Mercosur or the US but on the other hand the UK is a massive net contributor to the EU budget, the largest after Germany, and it made a net contribution to that budget amounting to almost &euro;11 billion in 2013.  If the remaining member states want to maintain farm support at currently foreseen levels, they must be prepared to contribute more to the EU budget to ensure this following a BrExit.  In this calculation, some member states that now see themselves as benefiting from high CAP spending could well move to the other side of the ledger.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Alan Matthews:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> In my view, BrExit is an outcome to be avoided if that can be achieved, but if it were to happen, the Irish agrifood sector should pursue a number of objectives in the subsequent negotiations on the UK-EU trade relationship.  These include minimising the disruption to agrifood trade and particularly to avoid the reintroduction of tariffs, but also to seek to minimise the impact of regulatory differences, through continued UK adhesion to Single Market rules, at least as it relates to items such as product standards, veterinary and phytosanitary rules or through mutual recognition agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":677,"content":"<p>Thank you, Professor Matthews.

The views I would like to express are mine and not those of either the British Irish Chamber of Commerce or Dublin City University - as I go through some of my remarks, members may wonder why I said that.  As I have this opportunity to talk to the members and to have heard what the three previous speakers said, nothing I say will contradict what they have done.  The main point I want to get across is that things have changed significantly and that change is unlikely to be reversed.<br\/><br\/>I would like to start by quoting both George Osborne and Peter Spencer, the chief economist at Ernst and Young.  George Osborne recently said: <blockquote>My... goal is for Britain to become the most prosperous of any major economy by the 2030s...  <br \/><br \/>It is within the power of my generation to achieve this ...  <br \/><br \/>The ingredients are all here: <br \/><br \/>We now have the most competitive tax rates of any in the G20.<br \/><br \/>We've sharpened work incentives with tax cuts for the low paid, welfare reforms and a higher minimum wage ... <br \/><br \/>[We have also invested significantly in research and development and] We've secured the number one place in the world index for investing in infrastructure.<br \/><br \/>We' re attracting more Chinese inward investment than Germany, France and Italy put together.<br \/><br \/>By 2030 we're set to have the largest economy in Europe.  <\/blockquote>These remarks have been covered by Peter Spencer, who said: <blockquote>However it's not all good news. The global economy has slowed and prospects for the Eurozone appear to be going from bad to worse. The euro has fallen to an all-time low against the dollar, which will help combat deflation and stimulate Eurozone exports at the expense of UK producers.  [However] Investors face the uncertainty of the UK General Election, followed by the possibility of a referendum on UK membership of the EU. Overall, the prospects have brightened - but remain ... risky.<\/blockquote>These two statements point to several of the significant factors running through current UK political and economic thinking in the lead up to the election.  These are that the UK economy is doing well, as is our own, and despite a significant debt burden, the UK's growth is outstripping that of Europe but the UK has more flexibility with its finance and economic policy than the eurozone.  That raises a question of the UK's involvement within Europe.<br\/><br\/>A second issue, as seen from an increasingly sceptical UK audience, is that the problems of the eurozone may not have been arrested and may be getting worse.  In the UK this is coupled with a subtext that the EU's attempts at stabilising and reflating the eurozone may no longer be a benign influence on the UK economy, but may be undermining attempts to achieve further growth in the UK.<br\/><br\/>There is a growing sense - I stress this is currently a minority opinion - in the city of London and several large corporations that I have had the opportunity to talk to that the comparative advantage for the UK of being part of the EU is being eroded.  Eurosceptisim, which until fairly recently was largely absent from major UK companies but which was getting a significant hearing within the SME community, is getting a much wider audience.  Mr. John Longworth, director of British Chamber of Commerce, at last week's British Chamber of Commerce Conference stated:<blockquote>Chamber members fundamentally support the Prime Minister's objective: Britain in a reformed Europe.  The next government must set out what it will do to protect the United Kingdom against the prospect of being in a club where all the decisions are made by, and for, the Eurozone.<br \/><br \/>More than any repatriation of powers, businesses want to know that the UK has safeguards against being drawn closer to the Eurozone <br \/><br \/>...Economic pragmatism - what's best for Britain, for British business, for our national growth ambitions - must win the day.<\/blockquote>Before I talk about the impact it is likely to have on us, there are some disruptive factors, as already alluded to by Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; &Oacute; Ceallaigh.  The first of those is with regard to the UK election.  There is an uncertain outcome both in the likely composition of government and in the role of parties such as the SNP, DUP, UKIP and the Greens.  As a subsidiary point, it may be postulated that some form of EU referendum, regardless of the composition of the government, may be on the agenda.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Steve Aiken:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is also noteworthy that the themes of this referendum will focus not on economic issues but on emotive issues such as sovereignty in certain decision-making processes and, in particular, migration and the free movement of people across the EU.<\/p><p> The second disruptive factor is the effect the success and stability of the eurozone will have on the EU, sentiment in the UK media and the markets.<\/p><p> While not an immediate impact, the nature of the UK and its relationships within these islands is changing and will change significantly.  An all-island corporation tax rate of 12.5%, similar arrangements for Scotland, and other regional attempts to gain competitive advantages to counter what is seen as the overwhelming influence of the south east will have an impact on us.  We will be measured against Northern Ireland, Scotland and other regions in the UK.<\/p><p> A more fundamental point is that, when the UK thinks of Europe, it looks east.  Even though we have a contiguous land border with the UK, in the vast majority of British thinking the EU is 25 miles away across the English Channel.  Ireland is not part of the equation in any significant or fundamental way.  This will have a considerable impact on us when we examine trade issues, particularly with our largest markets.<\/p><p> In terms of goods, services and trade policy, we must consider where the UK sees itself.  For example, the patent box, research and development investment, reducing corporation tax, investment in infrastructure and investment in education are key in its estimation of how to make itself as competitive as possible.  Given our success levels, we seek to take the same types of measure.  Increasingly, we may be seen to be in competition not just with the UK but also with its individual regions.<\/p><p> The question of the possible imposition of tariffs and border controls has been raised by many informed debaters in Ireland, including myself and Mr. O'Ceallaigh.  The implications of border controls and their political impact are recognised by those who are listening in the UK, but they are a relatively small group.  When people discuss the EU, they do not think about the wider relationship on this island.  It is not a significant calculation when dealing with the pro- and anti-EU lobbies.<\/p><p> The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, is another area of significant impact.  I am surprised that I have not heard it mentioned so far.  For Ireland and the UK, TTIP is one of the most important areas that we would like to see grow and develop.  The relationship with the US is particularly important, as both Britain and Ireland are Atlanticists in their outlook.  Seeking a greater relationship with the US that links the world's two largest trade zones is a key consideration.<\/p><p> We have already discussed the UK's competitive edge, but it will undoubtedly seek further competitive advantage.  A loosening of EU regulation will form part of that.  However, one of the main points that is constantly mentioned is the UK's access to the Single Market.<\/p><p> Taking all of this as the backdrop, what will happen to us and what will the difficulties be for us?  I had the opportunity to brief this committee two years ago, when I was asked directly whether I expected to see a \"Brexit\".  I stated that it would be unlikely, for many reasons; the situation is now uncertain.  For Ireland, it would impact on trade, agriculture, services, energy policy and so on.  In the widest strategic sense as well as an economic and trading sense, a vast variety of activity in Ireland's relationship with the UK is likely to be affected severely.  Regardless of the next UK general election and the referendum that will happen, though, the game has changed.  We are in a new dynamic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steve Aiken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":680,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Aiken.

It is often difficult to have European matters discussed in this country because much of the time people do not appreciate their relevance or potential impact.  It is very clear from all of the presentations that the public has not really zoned in on this topic, which is why this discussion is timely and helpful for our understanding of it.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Ceallaigh mentioned a period of negotiations, perhaps of two years, after any poll that might take place.  If this is the realistic timeframe in which these negotiations take place, people will be led into a false sense of security that we will get a deal which resolves the major issues between us and the UK, such as the agrifood sector, trade generally, human rights or the movement of people, and that all will be fine.  This might be the case in some areas, but we cannot end up on the other side of an exit of a country whereby that country gets the benefits and all the positives of these agreements.  This cannot be the case.  We must be careful.  The fact we have co-dependence in certain areas should not lull us into a false sense of security that we will reach an amicable agreement.  There is often conflict about issues which prevents the type of deals, arrangements or accommodations we want.  This is why we have the European Union in the first instance, to try to do this in a balanced way.<\/p> <p>  My concern is that industry and trade generally will believe there is such a level of co-dependence that an exit will not really matter and we will sort it out.  If this is the case, other countries will wonder what is the benefit for them of being restricted or constricted within a European Union and will consider going down the same road.  Then we will be in the proverbial manure business.  We must sell the argument that if one slate comes off the roof, the entire roof is in jeopardy.  Here, and perhaps to a greater extent in Britain, we must try collectively to get the message across that it will not just be a series of bilateral agreements which will get us through.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Ceallaigh spoke about the impact on exports of a 3% or 3.5% reduction.  I believe it would be greater.  For a while the co-dependence would assist in maintaining the level of activity, but then we would start getting into tariffs and these would have an impact on deals with other countries.  We would end up with this spiralling out of control and the consequences would become much greater than anything that might have been anticipated because of the complexity of the various arrangements which exist.  We have a job of work to do to create this level of concern in the minds of the people who will be impacted greatest.  There is a responsibility, particularly on those involved in active trade between the two countries, to spell out Ireland's concerns to their associates, whether customers or suppliers, on the other end to try to feed into it at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p> <p>  The presentations were very solid and did not lend themselves to too many questions.  I thank the witnesses for their assistance in our work.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions on agriculture and North-South economic relations.  With regard to food labelling, a voluntary beef label was agreed in November 2014 under the voluntary label scheme to deal with the issue of nomad cattle.  How do the witnesses think a British exit would affect the market for beef from mixed-origin cattle such as those which are traditionally exported to the North for fattening and slaughter?<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kathryn Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2355\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Senator Kathryn Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2355&amp;amp;pid=KathrynReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Senator Kathryn Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This issue was fairly contentious and it has only recently been bedded down, for example, under the voluntary scheme.

However, I am sorry to say I have been made deeply depressed by the contributions, particularly when our little dream that the referendum may not be held is, according to Mr. Aiken's position, unrealistic, notwithstanding that the election has not yet occurred and the Tories have not yet won, and all the ifs and buts that go with the United Kingdom's internal dynamics in terms of Scotland and, to a lesser extent, Wales.<br\/><br\/>We were also dealing with the notion that, no matter what happens, there must be a significant amount of negotiations before the fact, even if the Tories win the United Kingdom election.  I do not know how long that might take.  Presumably it would take years, because we would be talking about a considerable process of unravelling.  What will happen with the internal dynamic, for instance, within Northern Ireland, with the Unionists and Sinn F&eacute;in, and with Northern Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the majority of Scottish MPs?  There are still a lot of balls in the air.<br\/><br\/>Frankly, the debate about Europe needed Greece like it needed a hole in the head.  Would they agree that those eurosceptics in Britain and across Europe might be taking solace from what is happening with Greece?  My worry is that there are so many people who are now becoming eurosceptics that they are seeing immigration.  My question on immigration is as follows.  Are UKIP, the Conservatives and the British people more concerned about the free movement of people from within the Union of 28 than what they perceive to be the influx around the Mediterranean from North Africa, of, for instance, Iraqis and Libyans?  There are hundreds of thousands of people trying to get to Europe.  Of course, Britain is conscious of its rail link with France and the horrors of significant numbers of stateless persons all trying to get across, either on ferries or on lorries, to Britain.  Is the worry immigration from outside or from within the Union?  We are in a horrible situation of an unstable world.  There is Russian expansionism in Ukraine, potential Russian expansionism in Latvia, and unstable relations from Moldova to God knows where.  Sadly, there are a considerable amount of people on the move - more than ever there has been.  Of course, Greece has been seen to be the leaky border that facilitates the through flow.  I am rambling.  Italy, Australia and Japan, amongst others, are taking specific steps on controlling immigration and the movement of people.

He said there will probably be a referendum.  Consider the consequences beyond the economic effect on Ireland if the United Kingdom leaves the Union.  There was a referendum in the United Kingdom in 1975.  Even with all Mr. Murdoch&rsquo;s media backing the UK Government at the time, the result was still two to one in favour of the United Kingdom staying in the Union, which was very close.  The United Kingdom rejected the single currency in 1999 and also the Maastricht treaty.  One may recall that Mr. John Major&rsquo;s Government almost collapsed in 1993.  It is very interesting that the Institute of Economic Affairs stated recently that the United Kingdom could be better off outside the European Union.  I believe it cites the cases of Switzerland, Iceland and Norway, which lie outside the Union but which are part of the European Free Trade Association.  They, apparently, enjoy all the benefits of the EU Internal Market.  I was listening to Mr. Nigel Farage some weeks ago.  He quotes organisations such as the institute and claims what it has outlined could be the case.  Even within the British Labour Party, some of whose members I know, there is a lot of scepticism that is not coming to the fore regarding the European Union.  It is not just coming from the Conservatives.  I do not believe the view on Mr. David Cameron because many of the businesses in England have railed against leaving the United Kingdom.  However, I believe it is inevitable there will be a referendum and that Mr. Cameron has to call one.<\/p> <p>  During the last few weeks of the campaign in England, the Labour Party itself will come under fierce pressure internally to call a referendum.  What is the delegates' view on the Institute of Economic Affairs, which appears to be contending the United Kingdom could very well be fine outside the European Union?  What is the delegates' view on Switzerland, Iceland and Norway?  Believe it or not, they indicated in recent months that they would have no interest whatsoever in being part of European Union because of the European Free Trade Association.  They seem to be doing quite well outside the Union.  If a referendum asking the UK electorate to leave the Union were called in the morning, it would be carried.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#M00200","speaker":"1094"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":690,"content":"<p>I apologise for being late.

I have not seen individual polling figures, but is there a possibility that Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland could vote \"No\", yet if England votes \"Yes\", the \"Yes\" side would win?

What impact might that have?  <\/p> <p>  Professor Matthews made an interesting point on standards in the agricultural sector.  He said it would be in Britain's interests to keep its standards uniform with the rest of Europe.  Does that transpose across to other aspects of the economy?  One of the things to fear is that Britain gets all the benefits of leaving with none of the costs other European countries have arising from social or regulatory standards.  To what extent does Professor Matthews think that is possible, or will the balance be more in favour of Britain retaining the standards of the rest of the EU countries?<\/p> <p>  If the various measures currently being taken in Europe prove to be successful in reflating the European economy - for example, quantitative easing and the Juncker plan - to what extent does Professor Matthews think a European recovery could make a difference to the outcome?  How much of a factor is a European recovery?  There seems to be a view in Britain which says they have done very well outside the eurozone, the strategies they have followed have proven to be the correct ones and they do not need Europe.

These included the implementation of the Single Market, on which he will not find any disagreement here; competitiveness; the issue of the disconnect between citizens and Europe; and the need for national parliaments to use to a greater extent the powers that have become available to them since Lisbon.  All of which we agree with here.<br\/><br\/>When it came to a concrete list of proposals, the UK Government undertook to carry out a balance of competences review, going through each Department and identifying the type of power that could perhaps be returned to the UK national Parliament.

From looking at the debate in the UK over the past 12 months, I feel the question is more focused towards freedom of people and workers.

I shall first address the question of whether there will be a referendum.  It is quite true that the Labour Party leadership is against a referendum.  However, there are two things which could bring about a change.  The first is political pressure, particularly in the run-up to the election.  Rather more importantly, Westminster passed legislation which stated that there would be a referendum were there to be treaty changes in the EU.  There is quite a possibility that there will be treaty changes in the EU within the foreseeable future.  It is my view, for what it is worth, that there will be a referendum in the UK in the foreseeable future, and that no matter what the wording is, in essence it will be a referendum about whether it stays in the Union or pulls out.<\/p> <p>  On the question of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Turkey and so on, none of the arrangements that those countries have with the European Union would suit the United Kingdom.  They all mean that those countries have to accept free movement of people.  Free movement of people is at the heart of the British problem - the question of immigration.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would mean, in effect, that Britain would have to implement all forms of European legislation, without being at the table when that legislation is being negotiated.  I do not believe the British would find any of the solutions that Switzerland, Norway, Turkey and Iceland have found acceptable.  If there is to be a new agreement with Britain outside the EU, it will have to be something specific to Britain.<br\/><br\/>Let us presume that the UK has a referendum and it decides to withdraw.  I agree that the negotiation will be extremely difficult, as has been said by one or two of the members of the committee.  I cannot imagine a member state wishing to give the United Kingdom a better deal outside the Union than it has inside the Union, particularly given the amount of time that the member states have had to spend up to now, not to mind between now and when the negotiation takes place, trying to assuage the British position.  The fact is that member states are losing patience with the British.  We hear that from all over Europe.  They feel that concessions were made to the UK in the Lisbon treaty which it was believed would settle the question of British membership for a considerable period, but that is not what happened.  Instead, British membership of the European Union is on the table at practically every meeting that takes place in Brussels or Strasbourg.  There is a lack of patience with the British within the Union.<br\/><br\/>The implications for Britain, should it withdraw, are very deep.  The leader of the Scottish National Party has said that she would like to see a majority one way or the other within Scotland, and that it is not sufficient for an overall majority in the United Kingdom to withdraw if there is a majority in Scotland that wishes to remain in the EU.  If the Scots take that position, it is quite likely that the Welsh will take the same position.  Northern Ireland is even more complex.  If the British take a decision to withdraw, there is a serious possibility that the United Kingdom could break up.  The unitary state with sovereignty in Westminster could break up in one way or another.  The Scottish question has not been settled.  The implications for Northern Ireland are enormous, as are the implications for our relationship with Northern Ireland.  These are matters we really need to ponder.<br\/><br\/>What should we do?  We should decide whether it is in our interests that the United Kingdom remains in the European Union.  If we decide that way, and the Government has made its position very clear, we should examine what we can do to try to ensure that it does remain in the Union.  There is one area where the British are not involved and, in my view, are very unlikely to be involved, if ever, and that is within the Eurogroup.  As a result of what has happened over the last five to seven years, that Eurogroup is becoming increasingly closer.  We might need to think of a relationship, or try to bring about a relationship, in which the United Kingdom remains within the European Union but with some type of special relationship with the Eurogroup.  As I said earlier, the special arrangements made with Norway or with Switzerland will not meet that situation.<br\/><br\/>It is correct, as the Chairman said, that in his Bloomberg speech Mr. Cameron indicated some areas of concern.  He also indicated more areas of concern in an article he wrote in the <i>Daily<\/i><i>Telegraph<\/i>about a year ago.  Frankly, I am sure solutions can be found in the seven or eight areas of concern he mentioned, but I believe the problem is much deeper.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As mentioned by Mr. Aiken there is a cultural problem here and a historical sense of British exceptionalism.  As stated in our book which will be published shortly, it may be that we have reached the endgame in terms of finding new arrangements which keep the United Kingdom within the European Union without inhibiting the drive within the eurozone to go forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":701,"content":"<p>A number of speakers mentioned that free movement rights have been very much at the heart of the push to consider withdrawal from the European Union.  Many of the proposals for reform that have been put forward as a possible condition to the UK remaining within the EU would require reform of the treaties and of the core fundamental freedom of free movement and so would be difficult to secure, although not impossible.  They raise significant legal challenges and would be politically difficult given that free movement has been very much at the heart of the European project.<br\/><br\/>There is also concern that some of the proposals I mentioned would have significant implications for UK nationals living in other parts of the EU, including Ireland, Spain, France and Germany.  For example, should the type of reforms being proposed be proceeded with, the cost to other EU members states of providing the type of publicly funded health care provided by Spain to ageing UK nationals living there would be significantly difficult.  The desired approach of some UK parliamentarians is a type of <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i>approach to free movement, in other words, free movement negotiated with some member states but not all.  This, of course, would be legally problematic, would not fit with EU free movement rules and would be politically very difficult to secure.  The preference would be for bilateral negotiations with selected member states but not including all 28 member states and, most specifically, not including the newer member states that have acceded to the EU.<br\/><br\/>There is significant misinformation circulating around immigration and free movement.  There is little evidence to suggest that free movement is primarily for the purpose of, for example, securing access to social security rather than work and study opportunities.  Unfortunately, this type of misinformation does take root and hold.  With regard to third country nationals, non-EU and non-EEA nationals, there are already significant restrictions in place in terms of immigration under EU law.  As such, movement is already restricted and regulated.  In the UK context, the points system and five-tier system apply.  While there are already significant restrictions in place, the UK and other EU member states have taken a selective approach in terms of prioritising immigration for highly skilled nationals who meet the requirements of their job markets.<br\/><br\/>The right to seek asylum, the position of asylum seekers and those seeking protection was raised.  Withdrawal of the UK from the EU would not change the position in that regard in that the right to seek asylum and protection predates the coming into existence of the European Union.  The UK will continue to have obligations under international refugee law, including the 1951 convention relating to refugees to which it is a party, the UN convention against torture to which it is a party and the European Convention on Human Rights which protects against <i>refoulement,<\/i>namely, return of a person to a country where he or she would face a serious risk of torture, inhumane or degrading treatment.  The debate around the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act is a related but separate debate.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Of course, that has also become very problematic in the UK and has significant implications for Ireland, given the requirements of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p> With regard to the crisis concerning people fleeing from Syria, the burden of that is being borne primarily by Mediterranean states and with very little EU support in terms of meeting the significant responsibilities and burdens that have arisen.<\/p><p> Regarding the Abu Hamza type of scenario, this is something that arises under the European Convention on Human Rights and the non-refoulement obligations.  It raises a core question as to whether we consider that human rights protections apply to all persons, including those persons we may not like and who may not be considered desirable.  Is the protection from torture and inhuman and degrading treatment to be considered absolute?  It is under European human rights law and, of course, it has been very much valued in Ireland as we saw most recently in the request to the European Court of Human Rights to re-open the Ireland and UK case.  Again, significant misinformation circulates around something like that.  That protection would remain regardless of withdrawal from the EU in that it is provided for under the UN Convention against Torture, the refugee convention and the European Convention on Human Rights, for example.<\/p><p> With regard to the position of movement between Northern Ireland and the Republic and the safeguarding of the common travel area arrangements, it is likely that there would be an attempt to secure that and that it could be secured in some way.  However, managing that in practice would be very difficult given that there would be a need for strengthened border controls with regard to the movements of non-EEA nationals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":703,"content":"<p>We are outside Schengen at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#R00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":704,"content":"<p>Yes, but we still have a common travel area.

That would be quite difficult in practice as well as legally.<\/p> <p>  The final point relates to a comment that was made as to whether the benefits of free movement could be retained.  Again, this goes to whether it would be possible to negotiate a series of bilateral agreements or a position such as would be available as a member state of the EEA.  As I mentioned, that is very unlikely given that much of the debate has been around limiting free movement.  Giving that type of concession is unlikely either to meet the needs or desires of those proposing an opt-out for the UK or those seeking to leave the EU entirely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":705,"content":"<p>I will confine my remarks to the specific trade questions that were raised rather than the broader political issues, as the committee has heard some very helpful comments on that already and Steven Aiken will probably add to that when he speaks.<\/p> <p>  On the trade issues, I refer to the point made by Deputy Dooley to the effect that there might be a temptation among Irish businesses to think that as we have a special relationship with the UK, we can still manage to come to an accommodation which would ensure that our beef, dairy products and other products avoid any tariffs and so forth even if Britain leaves.  It is important to be clear that the rules regarding trade relationships have become much tighter since the days when we had the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  Even though, at least legally, it might be possible to think of the common travel area as a type of bilateral agreement, although as Professor Mullally has highlighted there could be very practical difficulties in introducing it, the idea of a bilateral trade relationship is completely out of the question.  First, the UK will remain a member of the World Trade Organization, WTO, which prohibits discriminatory trade arrangements except in the context of regional trade agreements.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Alan Matthews:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would only be possible for Ireland to have a special relationship if, from a purely theoretical point of view, there was a bilateral relationship.  As we know, external trade policy is now an exclusive competence of the European Union and we are not at liberty to enter into our own trade agreements with a third country.  If we want to protect our interests in a post-Brexit situation we have to do so through the arrangements that the EU as a whole will enter into with the UK, whatever they might be.  It is important to scotch the idea that somehow we can have some sort of bilateral old boys' network arrangement between the UK and Ireland, at least on trade issues.<\/p><p> Deputy Kyne raised the important issue of the UK's relationship with the Commonwealth and so on.  I referred to the matter in my opening remarks.  Certainly, the UK would, post-Brexit, be entitled to pursue its own trade policy.  That means it could set its own level of tariffs which would apply to other countries, including exports from the EU.  The UK could also enter into its own free trade agreements.  I suggested that it would be highly likely that the UK would find it easier to have a free trade agreement with New Zealand and Australia, because the world has changed since the old days of the Commonwealth, and also with Mercosur, the United States and so on.  The UK would be more willing to give agricultural concessions than perhaps the EU is in negotiations with the same groups of countries.  I agree with the Deputy that this is an obvious path for the UK to pursue in a post-Brexit situation.  That would imply, it seems to me, increased competition in the UK market for Irish exporters, because we would have to compete with cheaper Brazilian beef or New Zealand dairy products than we do at present.<\/p><p> A third comment which came across from a number of contributions is the idea that if Britain were to withdraw it could negotiate a deal which would give it the benefits of access to Single Market without having to accept the costs.  It is important to be clear on the matter.  Mr. O'Ceallaigh has explained the nature of the agreements with the European Economic Area countries and with Switzerland, which is a little different.  Switzerland has a free trade agreement but it also has a lot of bilateral agreements which link it very closely with the Single Market.  It is important to emphasise, as Mr. O'Ceallaigh did, that these countries, in return for getting access to the Single Market, commit to transposing every single EU directive directly into their domestic legislation without having any possibility of influencing it.  There are some consultation rights and so on, but these are not very meaningful.<\/p><p> Let us consider the apocalyptic situation in which we are faced with a Brexit and are trying, two years later, to negotiate a common EU arrangement with the United Kingdom.  For example, let us look at the key issue of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, which is no longer tariffs but has to do with regulatory co-operation.  I would have thought such co-operation would also be a key area in the post-Brexit trade negotiations.  At least in the case of agriculture and food, it may well be the case that the UK would be willing to continue with EU standards and might even be willing to accept, in certain limited areas, that it would simply adopt and transpose EU regulations in these areas.  Due to the importance of its own trade with the EU, the UK might be prepared in some limited areas to accept that loss of sovereignty in return for the access that these Single Market arrangements would give it.  Perhaps I am not as pessimistic, if we have a free trade agreement, about whether it will be possible to integrate some mutual recognition arrangements and so on.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">  Professor Alan Matthews: :<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would imply, I think, that the UK would simply have to agree that in these areas we will follow EU legislation to ensure we keep our access.<\/p><p> Senator Reilly raised two questions, and she has put me on the spot.  It seems to me that Brexit would not require any change in current arrangements.  She raised the question of a farmer with land on both sides of the Border. I think that farmer would not notice any big difference because as members are aware one's entitlements to direct payments - let us assume the UK keeps that entitlements type system - are not transferable across borders.  If one had a situation where one could transfer one's entitlements across members states in the European Union, then if Britain withdrew, that would affect it.  At present one's entitlements on land in the North and in the South are completely separate.  As I reflect on it, that would not be affected by Brexit.  Similarly, the cattle and the voluntary food labelling is the sort of bilateral agreement that could continue.  Although there could be significant disruption to trade, on both of these issues I do not see Brexit as having a major impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":708,"content":"<p>I will deal with the issues in the order in which they arose.  Senator Reilly raised the issue of beef supplies and Brexit.  When I was in the Chamber one of the things we looked at quite closely was what we called the circularity of trade.  The reality is that the UK, if it went alone could not source enough beef in the UK and would always look to Ireland.  For many of the larger supermarket chains and the fast food companies, British and Irish beef are synonymous with each other.  That would continue.  If we look at the large numbers of companies that are involved in that space, I cannot see that changing.  That would be quite significant.<\/p> <p>  The one thing that does bother me, as Senator Reilly mentioned, is the issue of the North-South economic relationship and what is likely to happen if there was a Brexit or any sort of change.  I am on the board of the Irish-British Association and one of the things we have been trying to do in the past couple of years is to raise this debate because there does not seem to be any critical thinking at the possible implications on a North-South relationship if we move toward Brexit.  Last October-November we hosted a conference in Queen's University Belfast and Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh and others in this room attended.  Quite a few academics were involved in the conversation, but significantly, of the political parties only UKIP turned up, which made it quite an interesting debate.  The reality is that this issue needs serious consideration.  <\/p> <p>  This leads me on to the answer to Deputy Byrne's question on what should Ireland be doing.  Ireland is in an unique position with the United Kingdom, because it is trusted as a trusted agent.  The United Kingdom views Ireland as a great friend to the United Kingdom, that thinks the same way on many issues.  In fact our views and opinions have a considerable degree of weight.  We might not think they do, but they do.  One of the things we should be doing is helping this advocation process of informing the United Kingdom about the importance of remaining within the EU  and talking to our European compatriots about the importance of keeping the UK in the tent.<\/p> <p>  That leads to a question about what we should be seeking to ask as well.  What would the UK be like outside the EU?  In the global context it would be much diminished.  It would have less influence on the world.  It would be still a significant economic power and it would be a significant power, whatever it wants to call itself, but it would be diminished.  I sat on several of the EU competency panels both in London and in various other places and one of the things that came through in the discussions and in the study is that it would not be in the UK's interests to be outside the EU.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Steve Aiken:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is not the same as saying the debate can be shaped among the British populace, or that it is the same sort of result for which they should be looking.  That would be the answer I would arrive at for that one as well.<\/p><p> Mr. O'Ceallaigh has already touched on the implications for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  I have had the opportunity to talk to various leaders from the Scottish National Party over a considerable period of time in the past three years.  It is quite clear that a major constitutional issue would arise if Scotland voted to stay in and England voted to go.  I would say there could be similar sorts of arrangements in Wales and in Northern Ireland.  If most of the constituent parts of the UK - by the national composition of the country, rather than by population - wished to remain in the EU but England, with a substantial body of population, particularly in the south east, was potentially looking towards moving out, that would represent a significant crisis point.  It would have major implications.  A steady hand, a reasoned debate and the voice of friendship from Ireland would be of considerable importance in that context.<\/p><p> I was also asked about the business position and the impact on business if the Brexit were to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Some businesses actually have a long-range horizon, whereas others do not.  Those that have a long-range horizon are already beginning to look at these issues as well.  If one listens to the debates within the Confederation of British Industry and the British chambers of commerce, one will be aware that their view is that some form of accommodation will be met.  It is an interesting point when we talk about imports and exports.  The activities of companies like Airbus and BMW motors as part of the prevailing \"just enough, just in time\" manufacturing process show how integrated the UK is within the European manufacturing chain.  I refer to the large-scale output from certain places as \"the Swindon effect\" because all of BMW's diesel engines are manufactured in Swindon before being put into vehicles in the US, Germany and Austria.  European countries have a great deal of interest in making sure the UK remains part of the process as well.<\/p><p> I was asked whether a European recovery would be of benefit to the pro-EU lobby in the UK.  Of course it would.  One of the reasons the euroscepticism debate seems to be gathering momentum relates to what is happening around Greece, its wider implications and what is happening in eastern Europe.  The UK is looking to show greater leadership in sorting out Europe's problems.  If the eurozone were to pull itself out of its current malaise, get the deflation business sorted out and begin to experience real growth again, particularly in key areas, it would be a very positive statement for the UK electorate when it is thinking about whether to remain in the EU.<\/p><p> I will conclude by setting out what I would advocate to encourage the UK to stay in when it votes on EU membership.  We have already spoken about the implications of the vote for the free movement of people and of ideas.  This is one of the areas we would probably need to look to.  The most significant thing we would probably need to do is to ensure the EU is looking at what is possible.  We need to make sure it is well signalled to the UK that the EU is willing to move at least in some direction to keep the UK within the EU.  Even to mention that the UK would be much better within the EU from the majority of the EU would probably be a very significant push.

We left this Bill on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in July 2014.  This was to ensure that we allowed for the member states to consider the legislation under the technical standards process.  This process is now complete and so the Bill can continue its journey through the House.<\/p> <p>  In 2013 I announced the intention to draft legislation to introduce this measure.  The Government approved and fully supported this approach.  At that time Ireland was the first and only country in Europe committed to introducing this measure.  Since that time I am very pleased to say that a number of countries are following Australia and Ireland's example in this regard.  New Zealand is developing legislation.  The UK Government announced its intention in January to proceed with regulations.  France, Norway and Finland have all indicated their intention to consider introducing standardised packaging in the future.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has always been a leader in tobacco control measures.  We can be proud of the path we have forged in the area of tobacco legislation.  We can be proud of the influence we have on other countries to follow us in this regard.  It is important, however, to realise that the battle against these harmful tobacco products is not yet complete and will not be complete until we can significantly reduce the numbers of young people starting to smoke.  Some 12% of children aged between ten and 17 years are reported as current smokers.  While the number of young people smoking has dropped considerably over the years, 12% is an unacceptable figure.<\/p> <p>  Members will have heard the arguments put by the tobacco industry: standardised packaging does not work, it will increase illicit trade, and Ireland should focus on educating young people about the harms of cigarettes.  We know from research that branded tobacco packaging is a critically important part of tobacco promotion.  We know that health warnings are more effective on plain backgrounds.  We know that standardised packs are less attractive and less appealing to consumers, particularly children.  This is a significant evidence base and it is showing us that standardised packaging works.  Evidence from Australia shows it is working.  Evidence from Australia has completely undermined the tobacco industry arguments.  Misrepresentation of evidence by the tobacco industry is a well-recognised tactic.  Another is the threat of legal challenges.  While a legal challenge by the tobacco industry cannot be ruled out - I say that very much with tongue in cheek - I am very confident that the research available to us demonstrates that standardised packaging will have a positive impact on health and that it is a proportionate and justified measure.  The threat of legal challenges should not be an obstacle to progressing public health policies.  We must press on with our mission to make Ireland tobacco-free by 2025.<\/p> <p>  As regards educating our young people about the harms of tobacco, we are already doing this.  Standardised packaging is one of a number of measures which combined will stop our young people smoking.  It is the combination of past, present and future tobacco control measures that will reduce tobacco consumption.  However, standardised packaging is very important as it is the next step in tackling tobacco advertising and promotion specifically.<\/p> <p>  Before we move to deal with the amendments proposed, I wish to indicate that I will be bringing some technical drafting amendments to the Bill on Report Stage.  I thank Members for their participation on Committee Stage.  I look forward to hearing Deputy Billy Kelleher speak on his amendments and the contributions of other members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#A00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":716,"content":"<p>Does any Member wish to make an opening statement?<\/p><p>I would like to make a brief comment.

Some of the initial figures indicate that we are making slow but steady incremental progress and anything that can enhance that is welcome.  Lest there be any doubt, I spoke in the D&aacute;il on the matter on numerous occasions and I put on record the efforts of the Minister when he was Minister for Health, in the context of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  The Minister used the platform very effectively in trying to encourage the EU to take a lead in public health.  I commend the Minister in that regard.<br\/><br\/>My amendments are designed to enhance the Bill and to assist in trying to ensure it is effective health policy and that it is also expeditious in trying to deal with tobacco consumption and the reduction of same.  We are talking about a wash-out phase in the Bill whereby its introduction will be postponed until 20 May 2017.  We are saying we should substitute the date with 20 July 2015.  That is an indication of the urgency with which we view the matter that we should try to bring forward plain packaging and standardisation as quickly as possible to ensure we send out a very strong message to people that we are serious about confronting the nefarious, insidious tobacco industry and that we set a lead and an example.  There might be good reason &ndash; the Minister can elaborate on that &ndash; but I would support the introduction of a blunt deadline in terms of the enactment of the legislation on 20 July 2015.  That would give the industry adequate time to respond.<br\/><br\/>I do not refer to retailers who sell tobacco products in shops in this country, but the international tobacco industry is nefarious and threatening.  It has tried, for example, to usurp the democratically people of Australia and its legislative process.  While the industry has the right to protect its copyright through the courts, our duty must be to the people, in particular young people who might be contemplating experimenting with tobacco, and trying to discourage people from taking it up and to encourage people to give it up.  That is the reason I have tabled the amendment.  The Irish Cancer Society takes a strong line on the issue and it has been a strong proponent of the legislation and fully endorses what the Minister is trying to do.  The purpose of the amendment is to strengthen the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#B00600","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":724,"content":"<p>I was anxious to hear what Deputy Kelleher would have to say.  I am attracted to the spirit of the amendment.  The Minister can, and I have no doubt will, in his reply respond on the practicalities.  We can await the detail of that.<\/p> <p>  The spirit of the amendment is that rather than allow a period of time, there is an arguable need to impact not only in relation to the industry, but societally in terms of the importance of all of the measures.  There is no single measure that will be a panacea for the inordinate costs that we have to bear as a result of the health consequences of tobacco smoking.  This is one of a number of measures, some already implemented and other hopefully to follow, that will ultimately lead to a significant reduction in the number of people who smoke and further dissuade people from taking up smoking at an early age.<\/p> <p>  The little box I hold in my hand has been circulated as an example of what plain packaged cigarettes will look like.  It is important for people to recognise and realise that when we talk about plain packaging that it is going to be a white box.  It is not a white box, it is a very stark and unattractive product by any standard.  Any examination of it will confirm that.  What I have in my hand would not be an attractive device in terms of marketing the contents, quite the contrary.  For that reason alone it is a further aid to the process we all support, namely, a significant reduction in current smoker numbers and an even greater if at all possible reduction in the number of young people who take up the habit, so sadly, at a very early age, and with all the difficulties of giving up the habit.  I am open to the spirit of what Deputy Kelleher has said and I await the Minister&rsquo;s response on the practicalities of the proposition.<\/p><p>At the outset, I thank both speakers for their support.  I understand that Deputy Kelleher&rsquo;s proposals are meant in the best possible way and I fully accept the bona fides of his support.  Few people would be more enthusiastic than I to expedite the impact of the legislation but given the letter on the Chairman&rsquo;s desk and the letters that are in circulation, everybody involved in the area is not one bit surprised about the tactics of the tobacco industry.  I take the advice of the Attorney General on these matters.  The amendment suggested by Deputy Kelleher proposes to shorten the transition period allowed for in the Bill.  The transition provisions as outlined in the Bill allow retailers and manufacturers time to comply with the new measures.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=HE1&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Current packets may be manufactured until May 2016 and there will then be a one-year period in which to sell outstanding stocks.  Non-compliant retail packaging may not be manufactured from May 2016 and may not be sold after May 2017.<\/p><p> The introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland is a proportionate public health measure.  It is very important when introducing such measures that steps are taken to give the industry advance notice of the details of the measures.  Any reduction in the transitional period may undermine the State's arguments regarding the proportionality of this Bill.  The transitional times outlined in the Bill are in line with those set out in the EU 2014 tobacco products directive.  Provisions in that directive are essential elements to the success of standardised packaging.  The new tobacco directive provides for larger graphic warnings that are to be displayed on the front and back of packs.  The European Commission has developed a new library of images which cannot be introduced prior to 20 May 2016.  With this in mind, it is deemed reasonable to allow for all the changes required under the standardised packaging legislation and the new tobacco products directive to be introduced within the same timeframes.<\/p><p> As members know, the UK Government recently announced its decision to introduce regulations for standardised packaging.  Similar to Ireland, these regulations will come into force at the same time as the tobacco products directive, in May 2016.  The UK's regulations will also allow the same transitional time as the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill, which is until 2017.<\/p><p> I understand the Deputy, like me, would like the legislation commenced sooner rather than later, as I have said.  However, in the interests of introducing proportionate measures, there is an obligation on the State to allow reasonable time for the industry, first, to prepare for the new measure and, second, to allow for the sale of old stock.  On this basis, I regret I am unable to accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#B00700","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":727,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's statement that, on the advice of the Attorney General, we must be seen to be acting proportionately and that the industry must have time to respond.

In Australia, it was able to respond within two months of the legislation enacted.  It had to wash out branded packaging to comply with the legislation.

Companies want to be able to stand out from the crowd on the shelf when selling a product.  There is an issue with regard to the shape and size of a tobacco product or the packaging.  We know there has been a move towards different sizes and types of boxes; for example, there is a lipstick-style box and so-called nano packaging.  These are primarily targeted at young females in society.  Companies obviously would make a calculated decision in the research context that these slim or extended packs are attractive and encourage young women and girls to start smoking.  We want to make the regulation as watertight as possible and I know the Minister has already thought of this.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not raise this in the context of existing concerns.  These packs could diminish what the legislation is trying to achieve, which is to make cigarettes bland and unattractive so as not to stand out from the crowd.  It is about ensuring that people are aware of the harm they will cause if consumed.  The deficiency in the legislation which could allow for those lipstick-type and nano packages on the shelves could lead to this being a retrograde step.  The tobacco companies have plenty of finance for research and I am sure they will move to this area very quickly.  One can see, even if one is not out too late, cigarettes from such packages being consumed primarily by younger female smokers.

Cigarette packs cannot therefore be any smaller than these minimum requirements.  In effect, this indirectly sets a minimum pack size.  The directive provision will be introduced at the same time as the provisions in this Bill.<\/p> <p>  The minimum size of the warnings eliminates those enticing small lipstick-style packs, as alluded to by the Deputy and which I have shown to members in the past.

We are talking about individual cigarettes as opposed to the packet.  We suggest that while manufacturers can put an alpha-numeric code on a cigarette nothing else should be allowed on it.  When plain packaging and standardised packaging is introduced, is there anything to stop tobacco companies from putting anything other than an alpha-numeric code on individual cigarettes?  I am concerned that manufacturers could present cigarettes in such a way that they would be enticing and that they would stand out from other cigarettes.  Has any thought been given to the matter of individual cigarettes?  While we will have a standardised package and graphic details showing the damage smoking can cause, once a pack is open and a cigarette is extracted is it not possible that manufacturers could put advertising on individual cigarettes?  Nice, attractive coded messages could be put on cigarettes which would defeat the purpose.  Individual cigarettes should be standardised in order to ensure there is no enticement or inducement possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#D00700","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":749,"content":"<p>This amendment seeks to prohibit a brand and variant name from appearing on a cigarette stick and instead place an alpha-numeric code.

That will pre-empt us having to return in a number of years to again pass specific laws on those other tobacco products which will become a major focus of the tobacco industry should it find, as it will indeed find, that plain packaging has resulted in a huge reduction in the number of people smoking cigarettes in this country.<\/p> <p>  The situation around e-cigarettes has become quite worrying.  In one survey in the UK 4% of children are vaping, who never smoked and in America the rate of young people vaping is up to 17%.  The tobacco companies are buying up the smaller e-cigarette companies and it is being promoted now as a lifestyle choice as opposed to an aid to help kick the habit of smoking.  One can see where this vastly well-resourced industry focuses its attention.  As it finds one door closing it seeks to find a window somewhere else open.  On the basis of tobacco being harmful, regardless of the form in which it is used, the legislation applies to all tobacco products.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#D02400","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":766,"content":"<p>I can accept the Minister's point.  We need to broaden the debate as the issue is not just tobacco but nicotine.  Nicotine is being consumed through vaping.  Once a person is addicted to nicotine it can lead him or her towards the path of smoking and tobacco substitutes.  We will have to confront this issue at some stage.  The concern is that a young person may start out by vaping, thinking it is harmless.  It may be harmless in the context of not damaging his or her health initially but he or she may become addicted to nicotine.  When the urge comes on and they do not have the vapouriser, they will reach for a cigarette.  I, too, have major concerns and we will have to look at this in order that we do not allow another generation to become slaves to nicotine.  How they get the nicotine into their body is the question and that can lead to the drift from vaping, to nicotine addiction to people taking up cigarettes at a later stage.<\/p> <p>  I understand there is an exemption under the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 for cigars and pipe tobacco products.

The tobacco is placed in a utility, whereas there is direct oral engagement in smoking cigarettes and cigars.  Given that the Minister is proposing to address the issue of the presentation of the tobacco product, has he an example of how pipe tobacco will be presented?  We have the example of the presentation of the cigarette.  How does he envisage pipe tobacco will be presented given that it takes a variety of different shapes and sizes and can come in a plug, a tin, pre-cut or uncut?  As far as I can see, packaging is not provided for in any standardised way.  The Minister is quite specific on the packaging of cigarettes.  Has he considered the impact of the legislation in respect of pipe tobacco products?  I would not want to see anyone encouraged to take up pipe smoking.  I do not see that risk as a by-product of the Bill's intent of ameliorating the effects of tobacco across the board.  I cannot for a moment imagine young people starting to light up pipes.  In my view, thankfully, that is most unlikely.  The numbers who smoke a pipe are declining.  It is a fact of life.  The outlets that I am speaking of provide an array of products for people who have this interest and smoke pipe tobacco.  Obviously there will be a concern about the viability of those retail outlets and the employment they provide.

I am loth to get into this because it is not part of the Bill.  Having said that, I am very concerned about e-cigarettes and their availability to people under 18 years.  I am very concerned that they would be used to sell a lifestyle and to normalise the habit of smoking, which is something we are trying to de-normalise to protect our children.  We made a tactical strategic decision some time back not to put the two Bills together because the evidence around e-cigarettes was not as certain as the evidence that tobacco is detrimental to the people who consume it.  Facts are beginning to emerge and the information from America is that there have been more than 200 admissions of young people to hospital because of overdosing on nicotine and messing around with cartridges.  One of the entries in the Young Scientist Exhibition, and I apologise to the young lady from Derry whose name I cannot recall, was a project on tobacco substitutes that found that the product was labelled as having a certain number of milligrams per ml but on analysis some of them had up to 60 times as much as was advertised on the packet.  There are inherent dangers and I am very keen to have this area regulated.  I do not believe that e-cigarettes should be available outside of a pharmacy or under the direction of a pharmacist as an aid to cease smoking.  They should not be sold outside of that.  That is a matter for the Oireachtas and for the Minister for Health and me to discuss further, particularly the issue of them being classified as illegal.  I am absolutely clear that they should not be legally available to children and people under 18.<\/p> <p>  I do not mean to be trite, but on the issue of whether it is possible under the regulations of 2002 Act, I do not propose to change the Bill in respect of cigars or pipe tobacco.  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who spoke extensively on pipe tobacco, I make the following points.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=HE1&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Members will remember that pipes were the first to be banned in cinemas and on aeroplanes because of the extensive smoke emanating from them.  If we cast our minds back to the role that the current Leader of the Opposition had in achieving the smoking ban in public places, the core principle was to protect workers from the harmful carcinogenic effect of environmental smoke and tobacco products.  Pipe tobacco is very much to the fore in that area and it would make no sense to me for it not to be included in this directive.  Some people may argue they do not inhale the smoke but the incidence of mouth, lip and throat cancers related to pipe smoking is well known.  One may argue that young people are not taking up that type of smoking and would not be likely to do so, but I would quibble with that.  If the vast billions of euro in the tobacco industry were focused on advertising this as a lifestyle choice, there could be unimaginable instruments for the consumption of pipe tobacco, and we would be amazed how quickly it might take off.  I have no intention of excluding that element.<\/p><p> Who in this room could possibly believe that one of the most advanced societies in Europe currently has a tobacco product that involves a person cutting one's gum and shoving tobacco under the lip to absorb it?  That country is Sweden.  Sales of snus, as it is referred to, continue to be substantial.  It is excluded from Europe's tobacco directive, as a compromise had to be made.  Do not underestimate the ability of the tobacco industry to attract people to its product through new and innovative methods.  As I have indicated here and in many other places, if there is a choice between jobs or lives, the choice will always be for lives.  I hope I have addressed the issues in a way that does not cause the committee to think we are not on the same page.  We all want to protect children from taking up this habit and we want to help those who become addicted to get away from this killer habit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#E00600","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":773,"content":"<p>I assure the Minister that my questioning had nothing to do with encouraging the return of pipe tobacco smoking in any variety of settings where smoking is currently illegal.

We really welcome the opportunity to set out our views on this very important issue.<\/p> <p>  I will start by stating our position very clearly.  My own and the Aer Lingus board's strongly held view is that a combination of Aer Lingus with IAG has a compelling strategic rationale and will deliver significant benefits to Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus's employees, Aer Lingus's customers and Ireland.  The board has concluded, based on advice from our financial advisers, that the price of &euro;2.55 per share should be recommended to shareholders.  <\/p> <p>  In recent weeks, we have listened carefully to the public debate regarding IAG's proposal.  During this period we have had further detailed discussions with representatives of IAG and the Aer Lingus board now has a greater understanding of IAG's intentions for the future of Aer Lingus and the proposed commitments IAG is prepared to make in regard to Aer Lingus to the Irish Government.  <\/p> <p>  These discussions have further confirmed that it is clearly in IAG's interest to continue to grow Aer Lingus within the IAG group. Aer Lingus being part of IAG represents a hugely positive opportunity for Aer Lingus and Ireland. This deal is about accelerated growth.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Stephen Kavanagh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This deal is about accelerated growth.  It provides real prospects for growth in Aer Lingus, the economy, global connectivity, international trade, tourism and employment.  I am surprised it can be represented in any other way.  It is on the basis of these understandings that I and the Aer Lingus board give our strong support to the proposed transaction.  The Aer Lingus team met last week with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the interdepartmental group established by the Minister.  We set out the board's view on the benefits of the proposed deal.  I will summarise these meetings regarding the benefits of IAG's proposal and key commercial drivers.  The proposal is viewed by the board as compelling and a significantly positive opportunity for Aer Lingus, its employees, its customers and Ireland.  Aer Lingus as part of IAG will enhance Ireland's position as a natural hub linking Europe and North America.  Ireland's location as the westernmost point in Europe makes it a natural gateway to connect the combined populations of Europe and North America.  Aer Lingus believes IAG's proposal can enable Ireland to become a central hub for European traffic across the Atlantic, resulting in better utilisation of the infrastructure investment in Irish airports. <\/p><p> The market between Europe and North America is about 75 million people per annum.  Increasing our share of this traffic, which is currently at 2%, to even 4 or 5% would mean bringing an additional 1 to 2 million passengers per year through Ireland, which would have huge positive benefits for Aer Lingus and its employees and for Irish airports and their employees and a myriad of ancillary support services.  With Aer Lingus as part of the IAG group, there would potential for the planned growth in transatlantic traffic to be significantly accelerated, with new US destinations added to its network.  There is an immediate prospect of accelerating our plans to open two new destinations in North America, one on the east coast and one on the west coast.  <\/p><p> Aer Lingus as part of IAG will deliver employment growth.  Initial transatlantic traffic and destination growth will create significant numbers of new jobs in Ireland. The new routes would require the acquisition of two more long-range aircraft and would provide at least two hundred direct and highly skilled jobs in Aer Lingus.  A multiple of this number would be employed in support services in the general economy and in the tourism sector.  Being part of IAG will enhance Aer Lingus's European growth.  Aer Lingus short-haul services, including the Dublin, Cork and Shannon to London Heathrow routes, will directly benefit from the sales and marketing activity conducted on its behalf by British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and the Oneworld partner sales forces.  This will strengthen the positions of the Cork and Shannon to Heathrow routes and provide additional visitor traffic to the southern and mid-west regions and the rest of the country.  Irish tourism will also benefit from greater exposure to the frequent flyer programme of Oneworld members, particularly British Airways and American Airlines.   <\/p><p> Expected benefits to Aer Lingus's Atlantic and European network, if Aer Lingus were part of IAG, include better connectivity to and from Ireland.  Being part of IAG will also allow greater access to a global cargo network.  Aer Lingus's cargo business will benefit from the global network reach and sales channels of IAG cargo business.  The cargo network enhancement is expected to deliver significant benefits and additional options to Irish businesses, particularly the pharmaceutical sector.  <\/p><p> Aer Lingus as part of IAG will be a separate operating business and the Aer Lingus brand will continue and flourish.  Aer Lingus has confirmed IAG's intentions to preserve Aer Lingus as a separately operating business within the group, with its own brand, management, head office and operations.  Willie Walsh confirmed this strongly and publicly to this committee last week.<\/p><p> It is the strong view of the Aer Lingus board that the prospect of Aer Lingus being part of IAG has compelling, strategic and commercial logic for Aer Lingus.  It would have significantly positive benefits for Aer Lingus and for Ireland, and the board is strongly supportive of the Government's two-airline policy.  Following a combination with IAG, Aer Lingus will have more attractive growth options that will significantly benefit Aer Lingus as a company, its employees, its customers, the tourism sector, Irish business and industry and the airports where Aer Lingus operates.<\/p><p> We are fully aware of concerns expressed by political parties.  Aer Lingus is willing to meet individual parties in order to clarify our position further.  We believe this is a very good opportunity for Aer Lingus and Ireland.

I will start by introducing Stobart Air, formerly Aer Arann.  Stobart Air is a franchise flying specialist flying for three airlines: Aer Lingus, Flybe and CityJet.  We employ 430 people, an increase of 100 in the past four years.  Our airline is all about high frequency, regional connectivity and feeding passengers into onward air journeys.  The Aer Lingus-Stobart Air partnership, which we operate under the Aer Lingus Regional banner, is proof of what can be achieved when a small airline partners with a larger one.  The partnership started in 2010 and now operates 25 routes to and from 18 airports across Ireland, the UK and France.  Aer Lingus Regional has increased its annual passenger numbers from 855,000 to 1.3 million in 2014, a 53% increase in just over four years.  In the coming weeks we will fly our five millionth passenger.  Aer Lingus Regional now contributes 12% of Aer Lingus overall passengers.  The partnership is testament to the commercial relationship between our airlines.  We have extended our contract to 2022.  It is also testament to how far we have come from the brink of bankruptcy just over four years ago. We have broadened our route network, invested &euro;150 million in new aircraft, increased our passenger numbers and added to our workforce.  The returns from our partnership are evident when you consider how Aer Lingus Regional feeds passengers to the Aer Lingus transatlantic route.  The combination of Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Regional and the US immigration pre-clearance in Ireland is a massive advantage that no other country enjoys.  Last year approximately 100,000 of our passengers arrived at Dublin, completed US pre-clearance and boarded an Aer Lingus transatlantic service to the US, or they arrived from one of Aer Lingus's North American services and boarded our aircraft to Dublin to connect onward.  The advantages this offers consumers are significant.  People can save up to two hours on a journey.  Passengers also avoid the hassle of more queues on arrival at US airports.  Nearly 100,000 transatlantic connections in 2014 is an 80% increase in just four years.  It is a core part of our business. It delivers the passengers Aer Lingus needs to expand its North American network.  Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus Regional will continue to increase transatlantic business.  It is our belief that if IAG takes over Aer Lingus this growth could be achieved faster and on a larger scale.  From a UK perspective, how can we get UK-originating passengers to choose Dublin instead of London, Paris or Amsterdam when travelling to the US?  Last year, 4.3 million people travelled to London Heathrow from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds Bradford, Manchester and Newcastle.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Sean Brogan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These are all cities that Aer Lingus currently serves.  Of these, at least 1.2 million passengers connected at Heathrow to other, mainly US, destinations.  I will discuss Newcastle specifically.  In 2014, Aer Lingus Regional carried 9,000 Newcastle passengers to or from the US through Dublin.  A further 300,000 passengers from Newcastle used Heathrow, not Dublin, as their connecting point.  These are passengers that Aer Lingus should win.  As part of IAG, Aer Lingus can win them.  Being part of a global airline family would fast-track the realisation of this opportunity.  This would help our airline to expand, meaning more aircraft and more jobs.  Aer Lingus would benefit from the passenger increase, as would Irish airports.  The overall economy would also benefit, particularly from more inbound US tourists.<\/p><p>  Consumers want choice and convenience, particularly when it comes to air traffic.  Consumers like the convenience of one website visit, one click to book, one check-in, straight through from start to finish on their journey.  An Aer Lingus alliance with IAG would realise these benefits for Irish consumers.  To drive and survive, airlines must constantly seek out and secure new opportunities.  Stobart Air believes that the IAG offer is such an opportunity.  The partnership of Stobart Air with a larger airline has enabled it to grow and has delivered significant consumer and employment benefits to the economy.  I believe the same can be replicated on an even larger scale if Aer Lingus joins forces with IAG.  That is why Stobart Air is backing the IAG bid for Aer Lingus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Brogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":801,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brogan.  Both Mr. Kavanagh and Mr. Brogan have said in their presentations that a successful IAG bid to take over Aer Lingus would have a positive outcome.  Mr. Barrington referred to 200 new jobs based on new transatlantic traffic; last week Mr. Walsh suggested 500 new jobs.  Could Mr. Barrington comment on this figure?  The important issues are jobs, connectivity, and growth.  If the IAG bid to take over Aer Lingus is not successful, is there still a possibility of growth?  Are there any disadvantages to a successful bid by IAG to take over Aer Lingus?  Will the growth be limited to Dublin Airport?  What about growth in Shannon, Cork, and the regional airports?  Coming from the west of Ireland, I have a particular interest in Ireland West Airport Knock.  Mr. Kavanagh has been instrumental in organising a transatlantic flight to and from Knock, which will begin in summer 2015.  If the IAG bid is successful, is it more likely that this service will be expanded into seasonal charter flights?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#C00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":802,"content":"<p>I will start with the 200 new jobs.  I was specifically referring to the prospect of Aer Lingus operating services to two new destinations, one on both the east and west coast of the United States.  Those two new destinations would require one more aircraft each and that would mean approximately 100 new jobs per aircraft.  Over the next five years, between now and 2020, we could see the more than 500 direct jobs that Mr. Walsh referred to last week.  Aer Lingus could increase its current transatlantic fleet from 10 aircraft to close to 20 aircraft, and if those targets were achieved more than 500 jobs would be created in total.  I believe Mr. Walsh was referring to what IAG might add to the two new services proposed by Aer Lingus.  Would Mr. Kavanagh discuss the possibility of growth if the IAG bid to take over Aer Lingus is unsuccessful?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Barrington"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":803,"content":"<p>Aer Lingus believes that opportunities are growing to serve Europe and compete for traffic between Europe and North America.  Having had discussions with representatives of IAG and, indeed, listened to their contribution to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, it is apparent that IAG shares the same view as to the value of these opportunities; hence the proposal.  What is the opportunity?  Aer Lingus carried 1.3 million customers across the Atlantic last year and one in three of those customers was travelling between Europe and North America.  That additional business provided Aer Lingus with the ability to grow and sustain the frequency of existing services between Dublin or Shannon and North America.  Without that access to Europe and North American traffic, Aer Lingus would not be able to sustain the existing shape of the Aer Lingus transatlantic service.<\/p> <p>  That traffic also has a positive contribution to our short-haul network.  Simply put, if a passenger is travelling between Boston and Paris, Aer Lingus carries them to Dublin on the Atlantic aircraft.  It supports our connectivity to the UK and Europe and complements the natural demand between Ireland and the UK and Europe.  Aer Lingus sees this on a standalone basis as something that will allow it to grow into the future.  It will be challenging.  It is not without risk, given the scale of Aer Lingus and the shocks that are a feature of the aviation business.  However, it is a strategy that, as one can see from our financial results in recent years, has worked.  Aer Lingus believes that the geographic advantages that Ireland delivers in this regard are central to the proposition.  Rather than viewing Ireland's remote island status on the western periphery of Europe as a disadvantage, in this particular instance it is a key advantage.  It is an advantage from the customer's perspective because the time to traverse the Atlantic through Dublin is faster.  From an airline's perspective, the quicker the journey, the lower the cost.  The geography gives us natural economic advantages in serving the market.  The State has made the appropriate investments in terms of airport infrastructure.  The customs and border patrol facilities at Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport give Aer Lingus an added advantage.  <\/p> <p>   What is the additional opportunity with regard to IAG?  It is, in essence, scale.  Aer Lingus by itself will fight for its place in the market.  It has done so for close to 80 years and it will continue to do so.  What IAG brings to Aer Lingus is the ability to join forces; particularly in the Atlantic joint business, to have four airlines selling Aer Lingus seats as if they were their own allows Aer Lingus to compete.  It allows Aer Lingus to have more confidence in terms of the number of customers it can reach.  It allows Aer Lingus to have more confidence in terms of the costs to those customers because of the economies of scale.  Ultimately, it de-risks expansion for Aer Lingus.  The approach of four airlines selling jointly will accelerate opportunities that it would otherwise be challenging for Aer Lingus to exploit on its own.  This is a fast-track approach.  <\/p> <p>   The positives from an Aer Lingus perspective are not just to do with the Atlantic.  As I referenced earlier, those passengers have to be flown from the UK and Europe, hence the partnership with Stobart Air.  One hundred thousand customers use Stobart Air services.  More than 300,000 customers use Aer Lingus mainline transatlantic services from Dublin and Shannon.  Those services will be positively impacted not just by the incremental flow across the Atlantic but, further, by membership of the Oneworld alliance, as proposed by IAG, because in that instance there would be 15 global airlines selling seats to Shannon and Cork and Dublin.  So Aer Lingus sees the benefits in terms of the opportunity for accelerated growth.  In the absence of such a deal, the challenges will remain but there will be fewer opportunities and higher risks.  That scenario has direct implications for the confidence with which investment can be made.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Stephen Kavanagh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those are the circumstances under which we have no hesitation in recommending the proposal on the basis that it would be positive for Aer Lingus shareholders, for employees, for all stakeholders and ultimately for Ireland Inc. in terms of utilising the geographical advantages and retaining that economic opportunity within this economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":805,"content":"<p>What about the growth in Dublin <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>growth in the regions, including the regional airports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#D00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":806,"content":"<p>The growth will flow to all elements of the Aer Lingus network.

If British Airways is supplemented by the ability of all Oneworld members to sell seats on behalf of Aer Lingus between London and Shannon, there are no circumstances, from our analysis, on the basis of having more potential customers in a more cost-effective manner, under which the viability of the network is in any way compromised or less benefited than in the IAG proposal.

There is opportunity in airports we service from Aberdeen to Edinburgh to Glasgow and right down through the UK.  We are taking passengers who select Aer Lingus, as opposed to the IAG platform, which would offer much greater exposure.  I put that down to the fact that since we formed the alliance with Aer Lingus, we have created 100 jobs.  That is on a much smaller scale.

I will be as quick as possible, because there are quite a few questions.  To clarify the issue that was raised regarding 200 versus 500 jobs, my understanding was that when Mr. Walsh was asked what he intended to bring to Aer Lingus, he said the contribution would be in terms of sales and supporting the efforts of Aer Lingus Regional to support its strategy, which was to deploy or to put on the fleet one wide-bodied aircraft per year for the next five years.  That is at variance with what Mr. Barrington has said, but maybe he can clarify that.<\/p> <p>  I listened with interest to what Mr. Barrington had to say.  He twice reminded us that this was the right strategic decision from a commercial point of view for Aer Lingus, for its employees, for its customers and for Ireland.  The only thing he has left out from that is the shareholders.  I would have thought that, as chairperson of the company, his primary objective was to work in the interest of the shareholders.  I am not sure where he stands on that.  He might help us to understand.  There has been some media comment about the directors of the company and how they, together with some senior management, will share in a &euro;30 million pot, some kind of bonus disbursal, as a result of the sale.  Maybe he could talk to us about that.  I would have liked to see before us today some of the independent directors on his board and be able to interact with them.  I would also have liked to see the directors appointed by the State, who, while they have a fiduciary duty to the company, also have a mandate from the Government to look at the broader regional aspects to the company's overall strategic direction.  Maybe Mr. Barrington can comment to some extent on that.<\/p> <p>  If this deal goes through, will there be an independent Aer Lingus board?  Mr. Kavanagh talked about management, head office, etc.  Will there be a board?  What has been going on in Aer Lingus?  Has there been long-term strategic planning or have the directors been working towards this day?  Has Aer Lingus been courting IAG or somebody in IAG's league?  Has it always been, in recent years, just about getting to a point at which the directors dispose of the airline, get their exit strategy and get to share that &euro;30 million pot?  I see a level of confusion between what the witnesses are telling me and what Willie Walsh tells me is their long-term strategy. If Mr. Brogan's interaction with them has been so successful, why have we not heard of Aer Lingus developing its own growth strategy as a relatively small independent operator?  My understanding was that there was an alliance with another airline about being able to buy aircraft relatively competitively.  If there was a long-term strategy, could it not have been achieved through a strategic link-up with IAG, rather than a capitulation or a sell-out?  Could Aer Lingus not have attempted to paddle its own canoe, to develop a strategic alliance whereby all the benefits that have been mentioned would still be there and would flow to the benefit of the company, the employees, the shareholders, and more importantly, this island nation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#D00600","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":810,"content":"<p>I will deal with some of those questions and perhaps Mr. Kavanagh might deal with some others.

We do not need to agree with him on everything - he does not own us yet.<\/p> <p>  In terms of the shareholding and the &euro;30 million, I do not know where that figure came from.

We are not invalidating our current strategy.  The issue is the balance of opportunity, which will be increased, and risk, which will decrease.  That balance of opportunity and risk determines investment.  Both parties have a common view as to the level of the opportunity but our capacity to exploit that opportunity is reduced independently than it would be as part of IAG.  That is the just the reality of the position.  The committee should not take the view that we do not believe that we have a robust business that is capable of generating returns for shareholders and stakeholders.  That is not the stated position.  We are encouraged by the level of increased opportunity, which will generate incremental jobs.  That is an inevitability and they will be more sustainable as a result because they will be built on stronger foundations.  They will be high end, direct jobs ranging from pilots and cabin crew to engineers.  They will not just be incremental as there will be more promotion opportunities for colleagues are working in the enterprise.<\/p> <p>  Aer Lingus can realistically survive.  It has realistically survived thus far, although it is more challenged than ever because of the global nature of competition.  We serve the island and if we can continue to have that mindset, we will be increasingly vulnerable because that is a constrained market in terms of opportunity.  The opportunity for us is to compete and bring to the Europe-north America marketplace what we have been successfully doing for the Irish consumer and for those wishing to visit Ireland for the past 80 years.  That it the challenge.  The risk appetite is stopping us, and not just our personal risk appetite as we have to generate a return on other people's capital.  That return is more difficult to generate than the alternative within IAG but it does not preclude that investment.  It is then about the pace of that investment and, ultimately, the sustainability of that investment.<\/p> <p>  We are comfortable that we can get beyond 2%.  On a report in terms of competitive standings in Europe, one will go a long way before one will find 2% and, therefore, in many ways we are not relevant.  Once one becomes relevant, one becomes open to competition and to the challenges of what the large consolidated global carriers can do and that leaves us vulnerable.  It is a challenge we are up to.  We will continue to manage the costs in our business and to invest in the product but, undoubtedly, it is an additional challenge.  All this is simply a way of saying that the opportunity that the IAG proposal brings will be accelerated but also more sustainable growth.  The greatest protection any slot can have is sustainable profitability of the service provider that utilises it.  It is as simple as that.  We operate in the market.  The slots, as they are currently deployed, make a contribution.  Aer Lingus's primary role is to connect Ireland to the world.  Connecting Ireland to London is central to our product offering.  We are going nowhere on Cork, Shannon and Dublin to Heathrow Airport, but continued investment and competition is the greatest guarantee.  The capability of having One World partners and IAG partners selling those routes gives us added confidence that their sustainability can be only improved in that scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":836,"content":"<p>Last week Mr. Walsh referred to administrative job losses in the headquarters in Dublin.

We have heard various opinions from the different groups that have attended this committee, but the overall opinion of people on the street is that Aer Lingus is doing well, passenger numbers are increasing, it is a modern airline and the hotel side and tourism are thriving and steadily and improving.  Why then would we look at trying to sell off an airline that seems to be doing well and making progress, albeit at a slow pace?  A slow pace is good.  Representatives from Stobart have said their business has grown 40% or 50%.  What more would one want?  Gradual improvement at that rate is steady progress.<br\/><br\/>What is lacking here is vision.  If I were CEO of Aer Lingus, I would be saying that I want to grow the airline on its own, for the shareholders, the State and everyone, and that is what I would be pushing for.  Senior executives stand to make money on their shares if Aer Lingus is sold.  I see this as a conflict of interest in the context of making a judgment and being objective.  In objective terms, they would say they should push ahead and work at growing the airline on a steady basis and open up routes.  This is happening and more connectivity is being developed.  I believe this is the way Aer Lingus should be going.<br\/><br\/>In regard to Stobart, what does it stand to gain financially in terms of shares?  Earlier we heard Aer Lingus is unsure how much senior executives will get.  I find that difficult to believe.  I am sure the board has a clear picture of how much each individual and each executive will get.  I would love to know how much Stobart stands to get.  Are pensions of both Aer Lingus and Stobart members involved in any deal?  Are Aer Lingus pensions invested in this?  What good is a five-year guarantee when we have a steady business that is making progress?<br\/><br\/>I found it interesting that Mr. Walsh mentioned the guarantees.  In an article in <i>The Guardian<\/i>last year or the previous year, he mentioned the main issue was long flights and that the slots in Heathrow were very important in this regard.  The 23 Aer Lingus slots are extremely important in the context of expanding business.  Is Aer Lingus aware that when the deal was made with the Spanish airline Iberia in 2011, more than 4,500 people were made redundant and even now more of that airline's staff are being laid off?  Can we accept the word of an organisation that is laying off people as we speak and that says it will create jobs?  We are told there is a possibility of 1,200 jobs being lost immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#G00200","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":844,"content":"<p>To repeat, Aer Lingus is successful by many measures.  This is testament to the efforts of many people over a long period.  What is under consideration here is an accelerated opportunity, an opportunity that may never be achievable on a stand alone basis.  That opportunity and valuation was part of the analysis and consideration of the proposal from IAG and we believe it fairly reflects the valuation and future potential of the business.<\/p> <p>  On why we would sell off Aer Lingus, I do not see it as a sell-off.  We are a plc.  What we are recommending is an ability to accelerate the value creation.  That is where not just shareholders, but stakeholders, employees and Ireland maintains a benefit.  The world does not stop to allow Aer Lingus to grow.  We carried 11 million customers in 2014, more than any time in our history, yet we do not make the top 50 carriers worldwide.  That is the nature of the business we compete in.  Increasingly, the airline business will consolidate.  There are significant economies of scale and significant cost benefits from having major fleets and significant revenue benefits from having global reach and partnership.  This is something we simply cannot ignore, albeit that - not waving a white flag - we have a solid business based on good fundamentals.  What is up for consideration here is the incremental opportunity.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the comparison or contrast with Iberia, first, I believe IAG sees the value inherent in the Aer Lingus strategy in terms of the opportunity to grow Ireland as a natural hub for transatlantic traffic.  Aer Lingus is a profitable business that has gone through many restructurings.  When British Airways and Iberia combined, Iberia was a deeply troubled business that needed to be restructured.  It is not comparable in any way to what IAG would be investing in if it was to secure Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus is a growth vehicle for IAG.  It is a &euro;1.4 billion investment from British Airways and IAG.  This is not an investment that will be recouped by redirecting passengers through Heathrow.  It is an investment that will be recovered and grown by exploiting the opportunity that exists for Aer Lingus, Dublin, Shannon and Cork to have a larger share of the Europe to North America market.<\/p> <p>  The inevitability of some back office support functions being lost is indisputable.  This is one of the rationales and is why consolidation is such a feature of the industry.  However, the opportunity here is the amount of direct employment that will be delivered from the growth, particularly of transatlantic capable aircraft, but also because of the support activities and because of the services provided not only by the airport but the businesses based on it and the spin-off.  Simply, having more access to the island generates more inbound tourism.  This has a significant indirect positive impact on levels of employment.<\/p> <p>  We have taken the time to consider deeply the implications of this offer.  The board and the executive management team are very conscious of the implications and the interests of stakeholders.  We have no hesitation in recommending the offer because we intuitively believe it is positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":845,"content":"<p>I wish to make just one comment.

That has happened and we have now started to fly with Flybe and CityJet.  The IAG proposal would allow us to continue that expansion but to express it.  We will continue to grow.  Aer Lingus Regional will only grow so far but Stobart Air will continue to grow and will continue to do so in a managed way.

Any owner of Aer Lingus that ignores the sentimental attachment of its customer base is putting the business at risk and I simply cannot believe that this investment proposition is based on that view.  IAG is buying a successful enterprise with a strong brand.  Swiss consumers still regularly use Swiss Air, which is owned by Lufthansa. Etihad owns Alitalia, while British Airways itself is owned by IAG.  This is a global business.  The corporate head office for British Airways is, notionally, in Madrid but that does not stop British consumers from viewing British Airways as the flag carrier.  That is where I would see Aer Lingus positioned within the IAG group proposal.<br\/><br\/>On outsourcing, I do not see it being on the agenda and that has been communicated from IAG.  In terms of direct employment of pilots and cabin crew, this will be incremental and will give more opportunities to those already employed.  Dublin will be a hub, similar to the rest of the hub operations in IAG.  It is the <i>modus operandi<\/i>of IAG to resource its hub operations because it is as efficient, when one has critical mass and scale, to do it oneself.  One gets more control over the quality of service and the guarantee of the mutuality of interests between those delivering the service and those resourcing it.  Again, at the Irish bases, the greatest protection is growth and the sustainability of the operation.  It is our view that all of those criteria are improved through Aer Lingus's combination with the IAG group.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#H00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":854,"content":"<p>The Aer Lingus Regional contribution of 12% to overall Aer Lingus numbers is certainly impressive.

I congratulate Mr. Kavanagh on his appointment and I wish him the best of luck.  We have heard a lot of testimony over the past few weeks.  Some of it shows that Aer Lingus has been operating under good management and is a profitable and growing company.  IAG will benefit from the takeover of Aer Lingus.  This is a change in the trend.  Iberia was really struggling and would have been a target for a takeover, as I imagine the balance sheet was not very strong.  With a strong brand and much potential, it would have been a realistic target for a takeover.  Aer Lingus is in a different place and is still growing, albeit at a slower pace than if the IAG takeover occurs.<\/p> <p>  I link that to the testimony of Mr. Brogan.  The relationship that Stobart Air and Aer Lingus Regional has with Aer Lingus has been hugely beneficial to his company.  I draw a comparison between that situation and Iberia and IAG.  In the case of Aer Lingus, it is completely different as it is a growing company in a takeover.  It is not a company on its own and there are codeshares.  Perhaps the witnesses can give me an idea of what this means for Aer Lingus if IAG is not in the room.  What does the codeshare with Star Alliance and Sky Team bring to Aer Lingus in terms of a global reach for consumers?<\/p> <p>  Equally, we can talk about the economies of scale that may be beneficial in the case of a takeover by IAG of Aer Lingus.  Can we hear about the benefits of the interline agreements with Etihad Airways, JetBlue and United Airlines, particularly in terms of procurement?  How will this change and what is the relative benefit of IAG becoming involved?  The IAG investment is &euro;1.4 billion.  This is the amount of funding on the table.  The company will not get it back from the Irish consumer.  The money will get a return from European and north American consumers and there will be only a marginal return in this country, based on a relative increase in activity.  Perhaps the witnesses will clarify how this will benefit the Irish consumer or the State in terms of an increase and how to link this to Aer Lingus growing on a faster and larger scale and the 6 million people living on this island, north and south.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#J00900","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":863,"content":"<p>Mr. Kavanagh mentioned the benefit of four airlines jointly selling seats on the same aircraft using a partnership approach.

With a public listed company of its size, that is always going to be a fact of commercial life because there are rational reasons consolidation will continue to be a feature of the industry.

However, we have to make the right commercial decision to ensure that, as an independent business, the company remains viable.  I took the decision and stand by it, but I do not close the door on Shannon Airport.  We will continue to monitor the position as the market changes.  The Senator should bear in mind that one thing that happened to us at Shannon Airport was that the forces of competition were brought to bear there also.  To give an example, one of our busier routes was Shannon to Manchester which became a heavily competed for route.

It is not that company's record in Scotland according to the Government there.<br\/><br\/>I need all of the documentation on the slots.  It seems that in respect of the High Court judgment in London last Thursday, Aer Lingus was stating one thing here and another in the United Kingdom.  To quote from the judgment:<blockquote>Many of the potential competitive effects of the transaction that we considered [that is whether Ryanair should be a partner] would manifest themselves in terms of the absence of an action that might otherwise have been taken by Aer Lingus (for example, Aer Lingus being prevented from combining with another airline [which is what we are talking about today] or from disposing of Heathrow slots in the context of optimizing its route network and timetable).<\/blockquote>Was that case made by Aer Lingus in the UK courts?

It has identified London Heathrow, Madrid and Dublin Airport as the three hubs that are central to IAG competing for a share.  The impact on Scotland, the history of British Airways and the competitive dynamic in that marketplace are not matters on which I can comment.  What I can say is Scotland is a significant source market for Aer Lingus in transiting passengers between Scotland and North America.  I see no reason that would change.  In fact, it would improve in terms of our opportunity to compete in that marketplace.  Not only would we have British Airways selling Dublin on a neutral basis from Scotland, we would also have American Airlines selling seats to Scotland via Dublin Airport.<\/p> <p>  The issue for IAG from our analysis is competing for more of a share in the Europe to North America marketplace.  It is not a case of simply adding Aer Lingus to the IAG group and leaving it at that.  This is about growing the business.  It is about passengers choosing part of the product offering by IAG and its Atlantic joint business partner, rather than choosing to travel on United Airlines from Edinburgh.  This is about IAG diagnosing that the value proposition from Aer Lingus is capable of being competitive, that there is a growth opportunity and that ultimately two plus two equals five.<\/p> <p>  On preventing the disposal of slots, I have said the greatest protection slots have is delivering a sustainable economic return.  In circumstances where that is not possible, it is, of course, at the discretion of the State to purchase slots or to introduce a PSO to ensure connectivity.

This is not to say Aer Lingus has immediate plans to dispose of slots.  As I said, the slots are core to the Aer Lingus customer proposition, given that Ireland-Heathrow is one of the busiest air routes on the globe.  It is also core to the British Airways network that Ireland retain its connectivity.  Shannon and Cork airports are key source routes for long-haul flow through Heathrow Airport.  The basic proposition is that the opportunity is to grow Dublin Airport as a hub.  This would benefit Aer Lingus and, ultimately, IAG because IAG would increase its share in the Europe to North America marketplace.

While they are strong, mutually beneficial relationships, there is not necessarily full alignment of mutual interests.  If United Airlines is selling a ticket between Chicago and Dublin, its first commercial instinct is to keep the customer in its own metal.  It will, therefore, attempt to direct the customer to Heathrow Airport and on to an Aer Lingus service from there to Dublin.  That is the natural conflict in the current code-share relationships.  The difference between such a relationship and the one suggested in IAG's proposal is that American Airlines would have an aligned and equivalent economic interest in selling a direct ticket from Chicago to Dublin.  While the current partner portfolio has worked very well for Aer Lingus and our partners, the depth of the relationships in terms of the co-ordination of schedules and customer proposition is constrained by regulations.  In the absence of an alignment of economic interests, there will always be competing demands between the two parties.  While Aer Lingus has strong, sustainable partnerships, we had diagnosed that deeper co-operation would be part of the next phase of our strategic road map, but before we had acted on it, we received IAG's proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":910,"content":"<p>I also asked about the alliance Aer Lingus had with Etihad and other airlines on issues such as procurement.

Etihad has an equity stake in Aer Lingus on the basis of which Aer Lingus has had access to some procurement benefits.  We work closely with our equity partner in Etihad to extract revenue benefits, for example, by having an Aer Lingus code on services to Australia and in procurement.  However, the benefits are limited because, given that Etihad owns 4% of Aer Lingus, it would not transfer the full economic benefit.  The combination of Aer Lingus as part of purchasing and procurement within Etihad gives Etihad more scale.

While it might sound trite, if one looks up on a spring morning at the contrails in the sky, they are passenger airlines flying from Europe to North America.  They are dropping customers in Heathrow Airport, Paris and Amsterdam.  Our proposition is that they should drop more customers in Dublin.  For Irish consumers, it would give more choice and, potentially, better value because, inevitably, flight prices will decrease over time.  The acceleration of growth will mean an acceleration of cost reductions and better value.  It is a virtuous circle and Dublin Airport's opportunity to compete.  Ireland's geography is our best advantage.  It is the shortest crossing, which is the most compelling advantage from a customer and cost perspective because one burns less fuel between Dublin and New York than between London and New York.  This natural advantage and the scale of Aer Lingus's operations at Dublin and Shannon airports in terms of our connectivity in Europe give us an ability to compete.  What we need is access to the marketplace.  In May we will not just be starting a Dublin to Washington route but also 60 routes that touch Washington, for example, Edinburgh-Dublin-Washington or Dublin-Washington-Boise, Idaho.  That is the power of a network and growth and capacity at a hub.  The quicker one has critical mass the more sustainable one is.

The witnesses might forgive me if some of the questions I intend to ask already have been asked.  On the presumption the witnesses have watched the joint committee's proceedings up to now in respect of the stakeholders that have appeared before members, I also presume they saw the presentation last week by Mr. Walsh, the chief executive officer of British Airways.  Specifically, last week he gave a commitment to Shannon and Cork in respect of the Heathrow slots but did not elaborate on transatlantic flights from the perspective of Shannon Airport.  In addition, he was somewhat reluctant to extend what is a five-year commitment beyond that.  I seek the witnesses' thoughts in this regard because from the point of view of the joint committee, the greater the commitment members can get, particularly for Shannon and Cork, the more that clarity will enter this debate.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate Mr. Kavanagh on his appointment.  How does he think the decision of Aer Lingus to come out in favour of the offer will be perceived in a region out of which Aer Lingus walked the last time there was talk of such a sale?  The bona fides of Aer Lingus in the mid-western region are not great because when the first tranche of shares was sold, Aer Lingus hightailed it out of Shannon Airport at the first opportunity.  When the 75% stake was sold, Aer Lingus left Shannon and left a sour taste in the region as a whole.  Does Mr. Kavanagh accept there is good reason for people, particularly in the mid-west, to be sceptical of what Aer Lingus now advocates based on previous experiences?  In addition, I note from the documentation received that the company's position has received board approval.  Mr. Kavanagh should elaborate on this board approval.  Was it unanimous?  Was there a vote at the board and were there dissenting voices or abstentions on the board?  The company has come clean, for want of a better phrase, on how it perceives the offer made by International Consolidated Airlines Group, IAG, to the Government.  Perhaps this is an opportunity for Aer Lingus to go the extra mile and throw out the whole lot as regards what were the deliberations within the board that resulted in the board giving its green light to the purchase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#O00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":923,"content":"<p>I will defer to the chairman with regard to the board because I am chief executive-designate and have not been necessarily present at all deliberations.  With regard to the Shannon to Heathrow route, let me put on record that the decision to remove service was a function of the level of losses, which were unsustainable.  Our position in Aer Lingus is that this unsustainability was reinforced through ill-judged incentives and subsidies that were given to a direct competitor at Shannon, whereby Aer Lingus was in the invidious position of paying full airport services and fees that were being transferred directly across the check-in counters to our direct competitor.  That did not work out well for Shannon Airport and we all have moved on in respect of the sustainability of the Shannon to Heathrow operation.  Today, that route makes a positive contribution to the Aer Lingus group.  We have, with the support of our colleagues in Shannon, restructured the business.  We are more efficient.  There also is far more transparency in the pricing and incentive regime at Shannon Airport.  While it is a little trite to state that times have changed, they have.  As I stated earlier, the greatest protection for the air service between Sharon and Heathrow is its profitability.  In addition, I believe that IAG has offered some guarantees as to the five-year commitment to maintain those services.  For a variety of reasons, I think that is a time limit which is a function of IAG's desire to maintain some commercial control over airport and vendor costs and so on.  It simply does not wish to transfer to an airport the security of being able to rely on this forever, thereby removing the commercial dynamic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":924,"content":"<p>On that basis, would it not make more sense to extend the guarantee to ten or 15 years because one then would have surety from the company's point of view as much as from that of the airport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#O00400","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":925,"content":"<p>Were the Deputy the airport operator, why would he give me a deal if I was saying I will be here for 15 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":926,"content":"<p>If I was the airport operator, why would I not ask for a deal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#O00600","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":927,"content":"<p>No, the airport operator, through its incentivisation and discounts of its charging regimes, can attract and sustain-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":928,"content":"<p>But is there not a win-win for both the airport and the airline if there is certainty regarding costs and everything into the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#O00800","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":929,"content":"<p>Not necessarily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":930,"content":"<p>Why?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#O01000","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":931,"content":"<p>Because going back every five years is far more advantageous in extracting value than is committing to a 15-year term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":932,"content":"<p>In terms of the region, is that not what this boils down to?

In a way, the presentations were much clearer than that made by Mr. Willie Walsh last week.  It is clear that both Aer Lingus and IAG intend to develop a hub in Ireland.  It is equally clear the hub will be based in Dublin Airport.  We have two State-owned airport groups, Shannon Airport and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA.  Is it possible to develop two hubs in a small country?  Mr. Walsh is of the view that it is not possible.  Mr. Kavanagh referred to Switzerland.  It is one of the few small countries with two, albeit relatively small, hubs in Geneva and Z&uuml;rich.  They are both connected with the state railway infrastructure.  There are many proposals to link Dublin Airport with the rail network, but I have not heard anybody mention Shannon Airport for ten years now.  Perhaps one cannot link one without the other because of state aid rules, but that is a different issue.  If Dublin Airport becomes a hub which, undoubtedly, would be good news for the airport, could Shannon Airport also become a hub?  Could it even survive as a transatlantic destination?  Would economies of scale inevitably pull all transatlantic flights from Ireland into Dublin Airport?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barrington referred to new Aer Lingus US destinations, one on the east coast and one on the west coast.  Will they fly into Dublin Airport or Shannon Airport?<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to be churlish, but Mr. Barrington has 300,000 shares in Aer Lingus.  If the IAG deal goes through, they will be worth &euro;765,000 to him.  There is nothing wrong with this, as that is how the corporate world works.  However, it is a lot of money.  Mr. Barrington&rsquo;s shareholding pales in comparison to that of the current chief executive.  Mr. Christoph M&uuml;ller received 1.5 million shares.  Now that Mr. Kavanagh is about to become chief executive officer, will he receive a similar share offering?  Is this standard for chief executive officers?  I am asking this question because I would find it very difficult to make a clear-sighted decision if the difference between one or the other was &euro;765,000.  I appreciate that the gentlemen concerned have much more business experience than I have, but these are real human emotions and motivations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#P01900","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":955,"content":"<p>We are looking after the taxpayers&rsquo; interests, namely, the 25.1% shareholding in the airline, as well as national and regional strategic interests.

When he was booking flights in May, he searched that service, as well as British Airways direct flights to and from Heathrow Airport, backtracking to Shannon Airport.

I know Aer Lingus played an important role in that coming about and Mr. Kavanagh in particular was instrumental.  In reality, what are the possibilities of us having more transatlantic charter flights, even schedule flights?  How feasible is that?  Would Mr. Kavanagh consider it?  Has he considered it as part of what he has agreed regarding this charter flight?  I know the appetite exists.  At the meeting last week I mentioned that, when the previous airline operated a transatlantic flight there, the route did not fail - there were other issues with that airline which caused the overall company to run into difficulty.  There is a massive appetite for this route and I know so many people who used it and would look forward to using it again.  <\/p> <p>  We are talking about the entire west and north-west area.  We have very poor connectivity in terms of roads.  If one were to draw a line from Galway up to Louth, there are no motorways, so this is a regional airport of significance.  I would like Aer Lingus to expand on that.

I do not believe the same level of opportunity exists there because Shannon is not connected to Europe in the way Dublin is, nor will it be.  It is simply a fact that the demand for travel to and from Dublin is exponentially greater than the demand for travel to and from Shannon.  A hub needs connectivity.  The ability to flow passengers through Dublin, and the natural demand through Dublin, is on a different scale.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe that, as it builds out, Dublin will necessarily compete with or cannibalise Shannon.  There is resilient demand in Shannon.  The challenge always has been to profitably serve that demand.  The Dublin to New York route at peak has seven services a day, while Shannon to New York maintains two services a day in competition.  That is demonstrative of the resilience of routes at Shannon where there is demand.  The issue is the opportunity for growth and I see access to Oneworld selling access to other parties.  Actively selling Aer Lingus capacity neutrally can be only beneficial, but I do not see significant growth opportunities in terms of additional routes and frequencies.   It consolidates the opportunity that exists currently.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the basis of the valuation, I believe both the company and its advisers reviewed all of the assets - that was one of the criteria for valuation - as well as the more traditional valuation metrics, future earnings, past earnings, capital employed, etc.  All of the same criteria were used that would be used by the Government advisers in confirming the attractiveness or otherwise of the &euro;2.55 a share valuation.

After we entered a commitment, it was to prove that this vehicle was capable of delivering a sustainable profit and, thus, a sustainable service.<\/p> <p>  I will make a correction.  We never committed to providing a year-round, 365-day service to Boston and New York.  We signed a commercial arrangement with the Shannon Airport Authority that clearly stated the Shannon-New York service would be a nine-month one, with no service in the traditionally heavy loss-making and seasonally weakest first quarter.  Nevertheless, the Shannon-Boston route would be serviced on a 12-month basis.  We have fully met our commitments to the airport and communication at the time.  Be it a miscommunication or otherwise, we never committed to providing a year-round, twice daily service; rather, we committed to maintaining a year-round service.<\/p> <p>  The price of flights in this context could be expected and the consumer has more opportunities and choices.  It is the value proposition that will convert the consumer.  If one loses price competitiveness in an intensely competitive marketplace, one will lose traffic.  For example, Shannon Airport's customers have choices with United Airlines and Delta Airlines.  There is demand for services from the airport.  We should have confidence that there is a natural market between Shannon Airport and North America.  If British Airways or any other enterprise attempts to direct that traffic, competition will fill the vacuum.  That is what we see on a daily basis.  Across the world there are few monopolies in air transportation.  It is becoming transparent and in airlines' interests to maximise revenue, but there is always choice for consumers.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of Dublin Airport and pricing, I will use the San Francisco example.  If a consumer can find a cheaper route via Heathrow Airport, please let him or her make that choice.  We are operating a Dublin-San Francisco route.  Just as there are cheaper ways, in some instances, of getting to San Francisco from Dublin than with Aer Lingus, there are also cheaper ways of getting from Paris to San Francisco, some of which involve Aer Lingus, than using Air France's direct service.  That is the nature of competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#R01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":992,"content":"<p>I am talking about competition between Aer Lingus and IAG.

We enjoy working with the team at Knock airport and we were very interested in the opportunity to test the market for a service from New York.  The basic proposition is that we are in business to grow the business.  If demand between the US or Canada and Knock can be demonstrated we are open to servicing it.  I think, however, that any such demand would be on a fairly low scale and would be primarily seasonal, as was the case with the previous operator.<\/p> <p>  Our preference for a charter in this instance would be for somebody else to share some of the revenue risk.  In the case of a charter, a number of travel agents or committed parties commit to taking blocks of seats - a far less risky proposition than an airline independently attempting to sell 177 seats itself.  It is a market test and we will learn some things.  The scale from which we have benefited as a result of growth in the past number of years, including the addition of the Boeing 757 to our fleet to complement the wide-body A330s, gives us a greater capacity to trial and compete for business of this kind.  Let us see how it goes.  It was peak summer, it involved competing for very scarce aircraft resources and it won.  We are cautiously optimistic that it can be repeated.  It is a seasonal opportunity, though, and not even close to being a daily one, but it could deliver a service to Knock airport that did not previously exist.  We are here to grow the level of opportunity for Aer Lingus and, by default, for all the regions of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#S03500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":1048,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Kavanagh envisage a once-a-week service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#S03600","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424180100,"counter":1049,"content":"<p>If all the interested parties were to commit to a charter and produce the revenue required to sustain a year-round daily operation, I would gladly operate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BUS2015021700002#S03700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424180100,"counter":1050,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Kavanagh describe who he considers would be the interested parties in the area?

If BA were to begin selling Knock as a destination, that bring us back to the basic point of this proposition, namely, that more people consider Knock as a destination.  Gatwick Airport is British Airways second most important hub.  It does not serve Dublin, Knock, or Belfast from Gatwick.  What Aer Lingus gains is that most powerful player in the UK market with significant loyalty based on a frequent flyer programme, to which Aer Lingus currently does not have access, and a vested interest in selling seats between London and Knock, which does not currently exist.

There are some processes within Aer Lingus that over time no longer had value for the customer, or the process has been replaced by automation or various things.  What I can say is that, ultimately, as Aer Lingus grows the level of employment in Aer Lingus will grow but the composition of that employment is dynamic.  A growing Aer Lingus in terms of fleet will ultimately require the workforce to accrue.  We are a relatively lean airline.  We have been through many restructurings in the past 20 years, in stark contrast to many carriers that continue to exist in Europe.  That is how we have managed to withstand fierce competition from a very successful local incumbent.  There will be job losses but there will be job losses in areas that do not add value to the enterprise.  Forgive me for being blunt, but if customers do not value the service, the service does not get produced.  Ultimately, however, there will be more employment opportunities created within the business in other areas.  That is what growth ultimately delivers.  Our proposition is that the growth and the opportunity that can be delivered is much greater under an IAG proposal than on a stand-alone basis but, as I said earlier, that does not invalidate our current business.

I will preface my remarks by addressing two issues.  First, I wish to inform the committee that the Institute of International and European Affairs has just finished editing a book on Great Britain and Europe that we expect to publish on the web early in March and as a printed book later in March so it may be of some help to the committee in its studies.<\/p> <p>  Second, the situation in the UK is very uncertain and entirely unpredictable.  The Prime Minister, David Cameron, has said that he wants to have a referendum in 2017.  We in the institute think that regardless of whether Mr. Cameron is re-elected, a referendum in the UK is likely in the next few years and that, in practice, this referendum will be of an \"in-out\" nature.  However, we do not know what the British want.  The Prime Minister has said that if he has a successful renegotiation with Europe, he will recommend a \"Yes\" vote.  The British Government has not made clear what it actually wants in a renegotiation so this is uncertain.  There will be one negotiation between now and whenever there is a referendum but we do not know what it will be and we do not know what the issues are.<\/p> <p>  When the referendum comes, we do not know whether it will result in a vote to remain within the EU or a vote to withdraw from it.  If it is a vote to withdraw from the EU, there will then be a negotiation period which will probably take the best part of two years.  This negotiation will essentially be led by the European Council but most of the work will be done by the European Commission.  There is a further question regarding what will happen internally in the UK if there is a vote to withdraw.  The Scottish National Party has already said that it does not want Scotland to withdraw unless there is a majority vote in Scotland to do so.  There is great uncertainty and the possibility of two negotiations, all of which would affect Ireland's relations with the UK and Europe.<\/p> <p>  I will now turn to trade.  By trade, I mean both merchandise and services.  Trade is one of the key economic linkages between Ireland and the UK.  The impact on that trade will depend on what happens in the first negotiation and the second negotiation if this takes place.  At the moment, trade between Ireland and the UK, like trade between Ireland and the rest of the EU, takes place on the basis of the EU Internal Market - the Single Market.  The British appear to be quite happy with the Single Market.  From time to time, one sees commentaries in the British press stating that they would like to remain in the Single Market.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->However, as I am sure some of my colleagues will mention later, some of the basic freedoms in Europe underpinning that single market are freedoms about which people in Britain are demanding serious changes, such as the free movement of people.<\/p><p> If there are negotiations following a referendum to withdraw, there is no doubt but that trade between Britain and Ireland would be affected.  That is really what we need to examine.  We also need to know how much trade there is between Britain and Ireland.  In 2012, 43% of merchandise exports from Irish-owned firms went to the United Kingdom.  The proportion of exports from non-Irish-owned firms is much lower, at about 12%.  About 20% of our services exports went from Ireland to the UK.  Therefore, should there be a change in the arrangements about trade, there will obviously be very big implications indeed for Irish exports to the UK.  In the book I mentioned earlier, there is an attempt to quantify the result on this trade, and on Ireland, of a British withdrawal from the EU.  The argument is that the effect on Irish exports, were the UK to withdraw from the EU, could be in the order of a decrease of 3.6%.  I should mention that there are so many ifs and buts in this thing that we need to examine that figure with caution, but that is the way it looks.<\/p><p> Should the British succeed in a renegotiation of their terms of membership between now and the time of a referendum, and remain in the EU, that in itself could have an effect on our trade.  Should they withdraw, however, the effect is likely to be much greater.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1097,"content":"<p>Our next contributor is Ms Siobh&aacute;n Mullally, who is a professor of law and director of the Centre for Criminal Justice and Human Rights at UCC.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#D00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1098,"content":"<p>I am going to talk about the possible implications of a UK withdrawal from the EU with regard to free movement of persons.  The debate concerning the UK's membership of the EU and a possible withdrawal has centred to a considerable extent on the free movement of persons.  Proponents of reform argue that the current EU legal framework does not provide adequate safeguards to ensure the free movement of persons without overburdening member states' public finances.<\/p> <p>  The free movement of persons is protected in the EU treaties and also in the charter of fundamental rights, where we also see a protection of access to social security benefits and social advantages.  Also of relevance here is the 2004 citizens directive.  Of the proposals to reform current EU free movement law as part of a possible precondition to the UK's remaining within the EU, several of the proposals that have been raised would require a treaty amendment and unanimous approval by each of the 28 member states, followed by enactment into domestic law.  Other proposals do not require such change.<\/p> <p>  At the outset, it should be noted that one of the key concerns for Ireland will be the continuing functioning of the common travel area.  Movement between Ireland and the UK of EEA and non-EEA nationals is likely to be significantly affected should the British exit proceed.  As recently as December 2011, a joint programme of work was agreed to strengthen the security arrangements of the common travel area and to provide a framework for a more strategic approach for this co-operation.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Given this quite recent initiative and the existence of the common travel area arrangements, albeit relatively informally for a significant period, it seems likely that the UK would wish to treat Irish citizens differently from other EEA nationals should withdrawal proceed.<\/p><p> If withdrawal were to proceed, there would be a number of possible scenarios, which have been discussed.  There are uncertainties associated with each.  One possibility would be that the United Kingdom would remain as a member state of the EEA and continue to participate in the Single Market with a status similar to that currently enjoyed by Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, for example.  This would require little change to free movement rights but is unlikely to be an option given that much of the debate on withdrawal has centred on limiting free movement rights.  Discrimination between EU citizens dependent on their country of origin is likely to be problematic as a matter of EU law.<\/p><p> A second possible scenario would be bilateral negotiations whereby the United Kingdom would negotiate bilateral arrangements with selected EU member states.  This, however, would lead to significant fragmentation of free movement rights and could create difficulties, particularly for Schengen area states if all Schengen area members were not to be included in such bilateral agreements.  As such, it is likely to be politically difficult for any individual member state to negotiate bilaterally with the United Kingdom.<\/p><p> A third option would be that domestic UK laws on immigration would apply, in which case we would see a repeal of the exceptions currently provided for EEA citizens.  In such a scenario, EEA citizens and family members already in the United Kingdom may be permitted to remain - as permanent residents, for example.  Those without rights to permanent residence, particularly jobseekers, would be easier to remove given that the current protections provided by free movement law would not apply.  What we would then see would be the introduction of visa requirements for entry for work, study or family reunification.  EEA nationals would effectively be treated as third country nationals are treated at present.  A range of possible restrictions could be introduced, including visa requirements, linked, for example, to minimum income requirements, language skills and the supply of biometric information.  We would see a phenomenon akin to the current five-tier points system that applies in UK immigration law being applied to EEA nationals.  There is concern that this would lead to significant reductions in migrant workers, including highly skilled workers, coming to the United Kingdom.  Any of these scenarios would be likely to have a significant impact on the operation of the common travel area between Ireland and the United Kingdom.<\/p><p> With regard to the possible reforms that are being mooted as a precondition to the United Kingdom remaining within the EU, a number of touch on free movement.  One covers access to social security payments, including a proposal limiting access to housing benefits, social housing and tax credits for a minimum period, possibly up to four or five years.  With regard to EU citizens who are categorised as workers as defined in EU law, a change in the EU treaties would be required.  Therefore, it would seem unlikely to come into effect.  For those who are jobseekers or do not meet the definition of \"worker\" or \"former worker\", this reform would be less problematic.  The European Court of Justice judgment in the Dano case in November 2014 confirmed that limits can be placed on access to non-contributory benefits, including a requirement that the residence conditions of the citizens directive be complied with.<\/p><p> A related proposal would be that the UK Government would seek to renegotiate the principle of exportability so origin states would remain legally responsible for covering unemployment or non-contributory benefits that would, for example, be required by their own citizens for a minimum period.<\/p><p> There is some commentary that these changes would not lead to any significant changes in terms of movement of EU or EEA nationals and that they may actually lead to more vulnerable persons falling through the cracks of social protection.  It could have a significant impact on UK nationals living in other EU countries.  This, of course, is of significant concern to a number of countries, including Ireland, Spain, France and Germany, where the costs of providing health care are high and where the number of ageing UK citizens would be significant.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> A second proposed reform would be in the area of rights to family unity and family protection.  The right to private and family life is protected in the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights and also, of course, under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  A proposal to impose restrictions on the entry of non-EU citizen family members in light of the Metock judgment could create difficulties and may be viewed as requiring a treaty amendment, at least with regard to those persons categorised as workers and former workers - those who derive rights from the treaties.  Other proposals - for example, to link family reunion to minimum income requirements and language skills - have already led to some criticism from the European Court of Justice.<\/p><p> A third proposed area of reform relates to the possibility of limiting rights of entry for job seekers by imposing a requirement that an EU or EEA national seeking entry to the UK be in possession of a genuine job offer.  This could raise practical difficulties, but also legal difficulties.  Currently, an EU citizen can reside for a three-month period with a valid passport and without recourse to social assistance, and thereafter the right to reside is dependent on having sufficient resources and sickness insurance.  Those EU treaty rights to free movement also apply to job seekers, which is particularly relevant here, so long as they have a genuine chance of being engaged in employment.  It is likely that a treaty amendment would be required to effect such a reform, and this would be difficult given the protections of the right to private and family life in European human rights and fundamental rights law.  Linked to that is a proposal that job seekers who do not secure employment within a six-month period could be removed.  This also would lead to difficulties and would come into conflict with decisions already given by the European Court of Justice, notably in the Antonissen case.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#D00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1101,"content":"<p>The next speaker is Alan Matthews, professor of European agricultural policy at the Department of Economics at Trinity College.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#F00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1102,"content":"<p>I am grateful for the opportunity to talk to the committee about the implications of a British withdrawal from the European Union for the Irish agrifood sector.  My remarks summarise a somewhat longer submission, which I have made available to the secretariat.<br\/><br\/>The former ambassador, Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh, referred to the importance of trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom, but the trade links in the agrifood sector are even more important, and more important than for any other EU country.  Approximately 51% of Ireland's total agrifood imports are from the United Kingdom, and the United Kingdom takes approximately 51% - the same percentage - of our total agrifood exports.  Therefore, more than half of imports and exports of agrifood products come from and go to the United Kingdom.  These are also much higher proportions than for Irish manufacturing.  A British exit, or &quot;Brexit&quot;, from the EU could potentially lead to significant disruption of this trade.<br\/><br\/>As the previous speakers have mentioned, much would depend on the nature of the trade relationship that is put in place between the UK and the EU post-Brexit.  The various alternatives that are on the table include: membership of the European Economic Area, as in the case of Norway; membership of European Free Trade Association, EFTA, combined with literally dozens of bilateral agreements approximating the Single Market, as in the case of Switzerland; a customs union, as in the case of Turkey; a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement, as negotiated with Canada; or trade on most-favoured-nation terms without a trade agreement.  I agree with the other guests that the UK is not likely to leave the EU because it dislikes some Single Market regulations, only to sign up to these again outside the EU.  Therefore, the most likely outcome is a free trade agreement in which the UK is no longer a member of the Single Market, tariffs on most - if not all - trade between the two partners are eliminated and the United Kingdom is free to set its own trade policy, including tariffs with third countries.  In my view, there is a good possibility that in that scenario trade in agrifood products would also remain tariff-free.  I will call that the good outcome, although it is clearly less desirable than the maintenance of the <i>status quo<\/i>.  In another scenario, tariffs might be reintroduced on some primary agricultural products and the primary element of processed products, which could include important Irish exports such as beef and dairy products.  I will refer to that as the bad outcome.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Alan Matthews:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> Even in the good outcome, without the reintroduction of tariffs, there would be additional costs to trading compared to the current situation.  Trade conditions would revert to what they were in the early 1990s prior to the introduction of the Single Market.  Trade costs arising, for example, from the reintroduction of Customs controls, rules of origin checks, import licence requirements as well as the additional costs of complying with two different regulatory regimes where regulatory divergence occurs, would increase.  This would put downward pressure on producer prices in Ireland and upward pressure on consumer prices, an important issue given the close integration of supermarket supply chains between the two countries.<\/p><p> The United Kingdom, given what we know about its preferences regarding food and farm prices, would be likely to adopt a less protectionist trade policy with respect to third countries.  That means its average tariff on agrifood products would likely be lower than the EU tariff it applies today.  It may also find it easier to enter into free trade agreements with extensive agricultural concessions with partners such as New Zealand, Australia, Mercosur and the United States.  For both reasons, competition on the UK market will intensify for Irish exporters, even in the good scenario.<\/p><p> Food trade, more than most, is governed by detailed regulations governing plant and animal health and safety, marketing standards, labelling requirements, allowed food ingredients and many other areas.  The greater the degree of regulatory divergence between the UK and the EU, the greater will be the costs for Irish exporters and importers.  As aversion to EU regulations is one of the driving forces behind BrExit, one would expect the UK to adopt different regulations in many areas, although there are countervailing forces such as strong UK consumer, environmental and public health organisations which will seek to maintain high standards, as well as the fact that the EU will remain the UK's largest trading partner in food and agriculture, both of which will give it an incentive to keep its regulations harmonised with the EU, perhaps by continuing to transpose EU regulations into British law.  Nonetheless, examples where different regulatory regimes might emerge include the regulation of plant pesticide products, genetically modified crops and animals, and food labelling.  These are all areas where the UK position is at variance with the EU position at the moment.  Dealing with these different standards will imply higher costs for both exporters and importers.<\/p><p> If tariffs were to be reintroduced on some elements of agrifood trade between the UK and Ireland, in what I have called the bad outcome, trading costs could be increased by much more and, in some cases, could become prohibitive.  The question of tariffs is also relevant to the introduction of an economic border between North and South of the island.  Land borders between EU and non-EU countries are not unusual and in principle, under the good scenario, would not lead to problems additional to what I have already mentioned.  Even if the UK were to pursue a less protectionist and more consumer friendly farm and food policy after BrExit, the likely change in food prices North and South of the Border would be much smaller than what we observe today as a result of exchange rate fluctuations.  However, if tariffs were reintroduced there would again be incentives to smuggle those agricultural and food products subject to high tariffs.<\/p><p> There might be a temptation among some in Ireland to welcome Britain's exit from the EU because of its traditionally hostile attitude to the Common Agricultural Policy.  However, in my view the overall impact of UK withdrawal on the future of the CAP would be rather minimal.  Partly, the succession of CAP reforms and the greater flexibility provided to member states under the 2013 reform address many of the UK concerns.  It is true the EU would lose a voice arguing for fewer exemptions and more trade liberalisation in concluding trade agreements with, for example, Mercosur or the US but on the other hand the UK is a massive net contributor to the EU budget, the largest after Germany, and it made a net contribution to that budget amounting to almost &euro;11 billion in 2013.  If the remaining member states want to maintain farm support at currently foreseen levels, they must be prepared to contribute more to the EU budget to ensure this following a BrExit.  In this calculation, some member states that now see themselves as benefiting from high CAP spending could well move to the other side of the ledger.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Alan Matthews:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span--> In my view, BrExit is an outcome to be avoided if that can be achieved, but if it were to happen, the Irish agrifood sector should pursue a number of objectives in the subsequent negotiations on the UK-EU trade relationship.  These include minimising the disruption to agrifood trade and particularly to avoid the reintroduction of tariffs, but also to seek to minimise the impact of regulatory differences, through continued UK adhesion to Single Market rules, at least as it relates to items such as product standards, veterinary and phytosanitary rules or through mutual recognition agreements.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>Thank you, Professor Matthews.

The views I would like to express are mine and not those of either the British Irish Chamber of Commerce or Dublin City University - as I go through some of my remarks, members may wonder why I said that.  As I have this opportunity to talk to the members and to have heard what the three previous speakers said, nothing I say will contradict what they have done.  The main point I want to get across is that things have changed significantly and that change is unlikely to be reversed.<br\/><br\/>I would like to start by quoting both George Osborne and Peter Spencer, the chief economist at Ernst and Young.  George Osborne recently said: <blockquote>My... goal is for Britain to become the most prosperous of any major economy by the 2030s...  <br \/><br \/>It is within the power of my generation to achieve this ...  <br \/><br \/>The ingredients are all here: <br \/><br \/>We now have the most competitive tax rates of any in the G20.<br \/><br \/>We've sharpened work incentives with tax cuts for the low paid, welfare reforms and a higher minimum wage ... <br \/><br \/>[We have also invested significantly in research and development and] We've secured the number one place in the world index for investing in infrastructure.<br \/><br \/>We' re attracting more Chinese inward investment than Germany, France and Italy put together.<br \/><br \/>By 2030 we're set to have the largest economy in Europe.  <\/blockquote>These remarks have been covered by Peter Spencer, who said: <blockquote>However it's not all good news. The global economy has slowed and prospects for the Eurozone appear to be going from bad to worse. The euro has fallen to an all-time low against the dollar, which will help combat deflation and stimulate Eurozone exports at the expense of UK producers.  [However] Investors face the uncertainty of the UK General Election, followed by the possibility of a referendum on UK membership of the EU. Overall, the prospects have brightened - but remain ... risky.<\/blockquote>These two statements point to several of the significant factors running through current UK political and economic thinking in the lead up to the election.  These are that the UK economy is doing well, as is our own, and despite a significant debt burden, the UK's growth is outstripping that of Europe but the UK has more flexibility with its finance and economic policy than the eurozone.  That raises a question of the UK's involvement within Europe.<br\/><br\/>A second issue, as seen from an increasingly sceptical UK audience, is that the problems of the eurozone may not have been arrested and may be getting worse.  In the UK this is coupled with a subtext that the EU's attempts at stabilising and reflating the eurozone may no longer be a benign influence on the UK economy, but may be undermining attempts to achieve further growth in the UK.<br\/><br\/>There is a growing sense - I stress this is currently a minority opinion - in the city of London and several large corporations that I have had the opportunity to talk to that the comparative advantage for the UK of being part of the EU is being eroded.  Eurosceptisim, which until fairly recently was largely absent from major UK companies but which was getting a significant hearing within the SME community, is getting a much wider audience.  Mr. John Longworth, director of British Chamber of Commerce, at last week's British Chamber of Commerce Conference stated:<blockquote>Chamber members fundamentally support the Prime Minister's objective: Britain in a reformed Europe.  The next government must set out what it will do to protect the United Kingdom against the prospect of being in a club where all the decisions are made by, and for, the Eurozone.<br \/><br \/>More than any repatriation of powers, businesses want to know that the UK has safeguards against being drawn closer to the Eurozone <br \/><br \/>...Economic pragmatism - what's best for Britain, for British business, for our national growth ambitions - must win the day.<\/blockquote>Before I talk about the impact it is likely to have on us, there are some disruptive factors, as already alluded to by Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; &Oacute; Ceallaigh.  The first of those is with regard to the UK election.  There is an uncertain outcome both in the likely composition of government and in the role of parties such as the SNP, DUP, UKIP and the Greens.  As a subsidiary point, it may be postulated that some form of EU referendum, regardless of the composition of the government, may be on the agenda.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Steve Aiken:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It is also noteworthy that the themes of this referendum will focus not on economic issues but on emotive issues such as sovereignty in certain decision-making processes and, in particular, migration and the free movement of people across the EU.<\/p><p> The second disruptive factor is the effect the success and stability of the eurozone will have on the EU, sentiment in the UK media and the markets.<\/p><p> While not an immediate impact, the nature of the UK and its relationships within these islands is changing and will change significantly.  An all-island corporation tax rate of 12.5%, similar arrangements for Scotland, and other regional attempts to gain competitive advantages to counter what is seen as the overwhelming influence of the south east will have an impact on us.  We will be measured against Northern Ireland, Scotland and other regions in the UK.<\/p><p> A more fundamental point is that, when the UK thinks of Europe, it looks east.  Even though we have a contiguous land border with the UK, in the vast majority of British thinking the EU is 25 miles away across the English Channel.  Ireland is not part of the equation in any significant or fundamental way.  This will have a considerable impact on us when we examine trade issues, particularly with our largest markets.<\/p><p> In terms of goods, services and trade policy, we must consider where the UK sees itself.  For example, the patent box, research and development investment, reducing corporation tax, investment in infrastructure and investment in education are key in its estimation of how to make itself as competitive as possible.  Given our success levels, we seek to take the same types of measure.  Increasingly, we may be seen to be in competition not just with the UK but also with its individual regions.<\/p><p> The question of the possible imposition of tariffs and border controls has been raised by many informed debaters in Ireland, including myself and Mr. O'Ceallaigh.  The implications of border controls and their political impact are recognised by those who are listening in the UK, but they are a relatively small group.  When people discuss the EU, they do not think about the wider relationship on this island.  It is not a significant calculation when dealing with the pro- and anti-EU lobbies.<\/p><p> The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, is another area of significant impact.  I am surprised that I have not heard it mentioned so far.  For Ireland and the UK, TTIP is one of the most important areas that we would like to see grow and develop.  The relationship with the US is particularly important, as both Britain and Ireland are Atlanticists in their outlook.  Seeking a greater relationship with the US that links the world's two largest trade zones is a key consideration.<\/p><p> We have already discussed the UK's competitive edge, but it will undoubtedly seek further competitive advantage.  A loosening of EU regulation will form part of that.  However, one of the main points that is constantly mentioned is the UK's access to the Single Market.<\/p><p> Taking all of this as the backdrop, what will happen to us and what will the difficulties be for us?  I had the opportunity to brief this committee two years ago, when I was asked directly whether I expected to see a \"Brexit\".  I stated that it would be unlikely, for many reasons; the situation is now uncertain.  For Ireland, it would impact on trade, agriculture, services, energy policy and so on.  In the widest strategic sense as well as an economic and trading sense, a vast variety of activity in Ireland's relationship with the UK is likely to be affected severely.  Regardless of the next UK general election and the referendum that will happen, though, the game has changed.  We are in a new dynamic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#H00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Steve Aiken","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1108,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Aiken.

It is often difficult to have European matters discussed in this country because much of the time people do not appreciate their relevance or potential impact.  It is very clear from all of the presentations that the public has not really zoned in on this topic, which is why this discussion is timely and helpful for our understanding of it.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Ceallaigh mentioned a period of negotiations, perhaps of two years, after any poll that might take place.  If this is the realistic timeframe in which these negotiations take place, people will be led into a false sense of security that we will get a deal which resolves the major issues between us and the UK, such as the agrifood sector, trade generally, human rights or the movement of people, and that all will be fine.  This might be the case in some areas, but we cannot end up on the other side of an exit of a country whereby that country gets the benefits and all the positives of these agreements.  This cannot be the case.  We must be careful.  The fact we have co-dependence in certain areas should not lull us into a false sense of security that we will reach an amicable agreement.  There is often conflict about issues which prevents the type of deals, arrangements or accommodations we want.  This is why we have the European Union in the first instance, to try to do this in a balanced way.<\/p> <p>  My concern is that industry and trade generally will believe there is such a level of co-dependence that an exit will not really matter and we will sort it out.  If this is the case, other countries will wonder what is the benefit for them of being restricted or constricted within a European Union and will consider going down the same road.  Then we will be in the proverbial manure business.  We must sell the argument that if one slate comes off the roof, the entire roof is in jeopardy.  Here, and perhaps to a greater extent in Britain, we must try collectively to get the message across that it will not just be a series of bilateral agreements which will get us through.<\/p> <p>  Mr. O'Ceallaigh spoke about the impact on exports of a 3% or 3.5% reduction.  I believe it would be greater.  For a while the co-dependence would assist in maintaining the level of activity, but then we would start getting into tariffs and these would have an impact on deals with other countries.  We would end up with this spiralling out of control and the consequences would become much greater than anything that might have been anticipated because of the complexity of the various arrangements which exist.  We have a job of work to do to create this level of concern in the minds of the people who will be impacted greatest.  There is a responsibility, particularly on those involved in active trade between the two countries, to spell out Ireland's concerns to their associates, whether customers or suppliers, on the other end to try to feed into it at the earliest possible opportunity.<\/p> <p>  The presentations were very solid and did not lend themselves to too many questions.  I thank the witnesses for their assistance in our work.<\/p><p>I have a number of questions on agriculture and North-South economic relations.  With regard to food labelling, a voluntary beef label was agreed in November 2014 under the voluntary label scheme to deal with the issue of nomad cattle.  How do the witnesses think a British exit would affect the market for beef from mixed-origin cattle such as those which are traditionally exported to the North for fattening and slaughter?<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Senator Kathryn Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2355\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Senator Kathryn Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2355&amp;amp;pid=KathrynReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Senator Kathryn Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This issue was fairly contentious and it has only recently been bedded down, for example, under the voluntary scheme.

However, I am sorry to say I have been made deeply depressed by the contributions, particularly when our little dream that the referendum may not be held is, according to Mr. Aiken's position, unrealistic, notwithstanding that the election has not yet occurred and the Tories have not yet won, and all the ifs and buts that go with the United Kingdom's internal dynamics in terms of Scotland and, to a lesser extent, Wales.<br\/><br\/>We were also dealing with the notion that, no matter what happens, there must be a significant amount of negotiations before the fact, even if the Tories win the United Kingdom election.  I do not know how long that might take.  Presumably it would take years, because we would be talking about a considerable process of unravelling.  What will happen with the internal dynamic, for instance, within Northern Ireland, with the Unionists and Sinn F&eacute;in, and with Northern Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>the majority of Scottish MPs?  There are still a lot of balls in the air.<br\/><br\/>Frankly, the debate about Europe needed Greece like it needed a hole in the head.  Would they agree that those eurosceptics in Britain and across Europe might be taking solace from what is happening with Greece?  My worry is that there are so many people who are now becoming eurosceptics that they are seeing immigration.  My question on immigration is as follows.  Are UKIP, the Conservatives and the British people more concerned about the free movement of people from within the Union of 28 than what they perceive to be the influx around the Mediterranean from North Africa, of, for instance, Iraqis and Libyans?  There are hundreds of thousands of people trying to get to Europe.  Of course, Britain is conscious of its rail link with France and the horrors of significant numbers of stateless persons all trying to get across, either on ferries or on lorries, to Britain.  Is the worry immigration from outside or from within the Union?  We are in a horrible situation of an unstable world.  There is Russian expansionism in Ukraine, potential Russian expansionism in Latvia, and unstable relations from Moldova to God knows where.  Sadly, there are a considerable amount of people on the move - more than ever there has been.  Of course, Greece has been seen to be the leaky border that facilitates the through flow.  I am rambling.  Italy, Australia and Japan, amongst others, are taking specific steps on controlling immigration and the movement of people.

He said there will probably be a referendum.  Consider the consequences beyond the economic effect on Ireland if the United Kingdom leaves the Union.  There was a referendum in the United Kingdom in 1975.  Even with all Mr. Murdoch&rsquo;s media backing the UK Government at the time, the result was still two to one in favour of the United Kingdom staying in the Union, which was very close.  The United Kingdom rejected the single currency in 1999 and also the Maastricht treaty.  One may recall that Mr. John Major&rsquo;s Government almost collapsed in 1993.  It is very interesting that the Institute of Economic Affairs stated recently that the United Kingdom could be better off outside the European Union.  I believe it cites the cases of Switzerland, Iceland and Norway, which lie outside the Union but which are part of the European Free Trade Association.  They, apparently, enjoy all the benefits of the EU Internal Market.  I was listening to Mr. Nigel Farage some weeks ago.  He quotes organisations such as the institute and claims what it has outlined could be the case.  Even within the British Labour Party, some of whose members I know, there is a lot of scepticism that is not coming to the fore regarding the European Union.  It is not just coming from the Conservatives.  I do not believe the view on Mr. David Cameron because many of the businesses in England have railed against leaving the United Kingdom.  However, I believe it is inevitable there will be a referendum and that Mr. Cameron has to call one.<\/p> <p>  During the last few weeks of the campaign in England, the Labour Party itself will come under fierce pressure internally to call a referendum.  What is the delegates' view on the Institute of Economic Affairs, which appears to be contending the United Kingdom could very well be fine outside the European Union?  What is the delegates' view on Switzerland, Iceland and Norway?  Believe it or not, they indicated in recent months that they would have no interest whatsoever in being part of European Union because of the European Free Trade Association.  They seem to be doing quite well outside the Union.

He said it would be in Britain's interests to keep its standards uniform with the rest of Europe.  Does that transpose across to other aspects of the economy?  One of the things to fear is that Britain gets all the benefits of leaving with none of the costs other European countries have arising from social or regulatory standards.  To what extent does Professor Matthews think that is possible, or will the balance be more in favour of Britain retaining the standards of the rest of the EU countries?<\/p> <p>  If the various measures currently being taken in Europe prove to be successful in reflating the European economy - for example, quantitative easing and the Juncker plan - to what extent does Professor Matthews think a European recovery could make a difference to the outcome?  How much of a factor is a European recovery?  There seems to be a view in Britain which says they have done very well outside the eurozone, the strategies they have followed have proven to be the correct ones and they do not need Europe.  If Europe was to start turning the corner, however, would that have an influence on matters?<\/p> <p>  The UK is the EU's single biggest market.  Professor Matthews might correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that the UK imports more from the entire EU than it exports.  In other words, it is a net importer of all EU goods.  How important is that as a factor in the negotiations for other EU countries in trying to influence the UK's outcome?  As regards the negotiations, how much are other EU countries willing to concede?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#N00200","speaker":"1172"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1121,"content":"<p>Before returning to our speakers I wish to comment on the likelihood of a referendum.

On that occasion, he identified a number of issues on which he would like to see reform in Europe, as well as many other things.  I think there were five in all.  These included the implementation of the Single Market, on which he will not find any disagreement here; competitiveness; the issue of the disconnect between citizens and Europe; and the need for national parliaments to use to a greater extent the powers that have become available to them since Lisbon.  All of which we agree with here.<br\/><br\/>When it came to a concrete list of proposals, the UK Government undertook to carry out a balance of competences review, going through each Department and identifying the type of power that could perhaps be returned to the UK national Parliament.  My understanding is that it was not a huge list of items that came out of that particular review.  From looking at the debate in the UK over the past 12 months, I feel the question is more focused towards freedom of people and workers.  I noticed in today's <i>Financial Times<\/i>that one of the most senior trade diplomats has said he does not think the programme of negotiation from Mr. Cameron is extremely ambitious.  He thinks there is a very small list of requests from the UK Government.  It is suggested that perhaps, as a result, a negotiation process could be undertaken and resolved quite quickly post-election, in advance of a referendum.<br\/><br\/>Can our guests tell us their views on what needs to be changed in order to meet a minimum requirement for the UK Government to advocate a stay-in vote if there is a referendum?  Clearly, if the Conservative Government does win, then what we in this country would like to see is for the Government to advocate a &quot;Yes&quot; vote.  What is required from Europe?  What changes do the witnesses think would be the minimum required to convince the UK Government to advocate a &quot;Yes&quot; vote?  A lot of questions have been asked.

I shall first address the question of whether there will be a referendum.  It is quite true that the Labour Party leadership is against a referendum.  However, there are two things which could bring about a change.  The first is political pressure, particularly in the run-up to the election.  Rather more importantly, Westminster passed legislation which stated that there would be a referendum were there to be treaty changes in the EU.  There is quite a possibility that there will be treaty changes in the EU within the foreseeable future.  It is my view, for what it is worth, that there will be a referendum in the UK in the foreseeable future, and that no matter what the wording is, in essence it will be a referendum about whether it stays in the Union or pulls out.<\/p> <p>  On the question of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, Turkey and so on, none of the arrangements that those countries have with the European Union would suit the United Kingdom.  They all mean that those countries have to accept free movement of people.  Free movement of people is at the heart of the British problem - the question of immigration.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would mean, in effect, that Britain would have to implement all forms of European legislation, without being at the table when that legislation is being negotiated.  I do not believe the British would find any of the solutions that Switzerland, Norway, Turkey and Iceland have found acceptable.  If there is to be a new agreement with Britain outside the EU, it will have to be something specific to Britain.<br\/><br\/>Let us presume that the UK has a referendum and it decides to withdraw.  I agree that the negotiation will be extremely difficult, as has been said by one or two of the members of the committee.  I cannot imagine a member state wishing to give the United Kingdom a better deal outside the Union than it has inside the Union, particularly given the amount of time that the member states have had to spend up to now, not to mind between now and when the negotiation takes place, trying to assuage the British position.  The fact is that member states are losing patience with the British.  We hear that from all over Europe.  They feel that concessions were made to the UK in the Lisbon treaty which it was believed would settle the question of British membership for a considerable period, but that is not what happened.  Instead, British membership of the European Union is on the table at practically every meeting that takes place in Brussels or Strasbourg.  There is a lack of patience with the British within the Union.<br\/><br\/>The implications for Britain, should it withdraw, are very deep.  The leader of the Scottish National Party has said that she would like to see a majority one way or the other within Scotland, and that it is not sufficient for an overall majority in the United Kingdom to withdraw if there is a majority in Scotland that wishes to remain in the EU.  If the Scots take that position, it is quite likely that the Welsh will take the same position.  Northern Ireland is even more complex.  If the British take a decision to withdraw, there is a serious possibility that the United Kingdom could break up.  The unitary state with sovereignty in Westminster could break up in one way or another.  The Scottish question has not been settled.  The implications for Northern Ireland are enormous, as are the implications for our relationship with Northern Ireland.  These are matters we really need to ponder.<br\/><br\/>What should we do?  We should decide whether it is in our interests that the United Kingdom remains in the European Union.  If we decide that way, and the Government has made its position very clear, we should examine what we can do to try to ensure that it does remain in the Union.  There is one area where the British are not involved and, in my view, are very unlikely to be involved, if ever, and that is within the Eurogroup.  As a result of what has happened over the last five to seven years, that Eurogroup is becoming increasingly closer.  We might need to think of a relationship, or try to bring about a relationship, in which the United Kingdom remains within the European Union but with some type of special relationship with the Eurogroup.  As I said earlier, the special arrangements made with Norway or with Switzerland will not meet that situation.<br\/><br\/>It is correct, as the Chairman said, that in his Bloomberg speech Mr. Cameron indicated some areas of concern.  He also indicated more areas of concern in an article he wrote in the <i>Daily<\/i><i>Telegraph<\/i>about a year ago.  Frankly, I am sure solutions can be found in the seven or eight areas of concern he mentioned, but I believe the problem is much deeper.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As mentioned by Mr. Aiken there is a cultural problem here and a historical sense of British exceptionalism.  As stated in our book which will be published shortly, it may be that we have reached the endgame in terms of finding new arrangements which keep the United Kingdom within the European Union without inhibiting the drive within the eurozone to go forward.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#O00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1129,"content":"<p>A number of speakers mentioned that free movement rights have been very much at the heart of the push to consider withdrawal from the European Union.  Many of the proposals for reform that have been put forward as a possible condition to the UK remaining within the EU would require reform of the treaties and of the core fundamental freedom of free movement and so would be difficult to secure, although not impossible.  They raise significant legal challenges and would be politically difficult given that free movement has been very much at the heart of the European project.<br\/><br\/>There is also concern that some of the proposals I mentioned would have significant implications for UK nationals living in other parts of the EU, including Ireland, Spain, France and Germany.  For example, should the type of reforms being proposed be proceeded with, the cost to other EU members states of providing the type of publicly funded health care provided by Spain to ageing UK nationals living there would be significantly difficult.  The desired approach of some UK parliamentarians is a type of <i>&agrave; la carte<\/i>approach to free movement, in other words, free movement negotiated with some member states but not all.  This, of course, would be legally problematic, would not fit with EU free movement rules and would be politically very difficult to secure.  The preference would be for bilateral negotiations with selected member states but not including all 28 member states and, most specifically, not including the newer member states that have acceded to the EU.<br\/><br\/>There is significant misinformation circulating around immigration and free movement.  There is little evidence to suggest that free movement is primarily for the purpose of, for example, securing access to social security rather than work and study opportunities.  Unfortunately, this type of misinformation does take root and hold.  With regard to third country nationals, non-EU and non-EEA nationals, there are already significant restrictions in place in terms of immigration under EU law.  As such, movement is already restricted and regulated.  In the UK context, the points system and five-tier system apply.  While there are already significant restrictions in place, the UK and other EU member states have taken a selective approach in terms of prioritising immigration for highly skilled nationals who meet the requirements of their job markets.<br\/><br\/>The right to seek asylum, the position of asylum seekers and those seeking protection was raised.  Withdrawal of the UK from the EU would not change the position in that regard in that the right to seek asylum and protection predates the coming into existence of the European Union.  The UK will continue to have obligations under international refugee law, including the 1951 convention relating to refugees to which it is a party, the UN convention against torture to which it is a party and the European Convention on Human Rights which protects against <i>refoulement,<\/i>namely, return of a person to a country where he or she would face a serious risk of torture, inhumane or degrading treatment.  The debate around the European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act is a related but separate debate.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Of course, that has also become very problematic in the UK and has significant implications for Ireland, given the requirements of the Good Friday Agreement.<\/p><p> With regard to the crisis concerning people fleeing from Syria, the burden of that is being borne primarily by Mediterranean states and with very little EU support in terms of meeting the significant responsibilities and burdens that have arisen.<\/p><p> Regarding the Abu Hamza type of scenario, this is something that arises under the European Convention on Human Rights and the non-refoulement obligations.  It raises a core question as to whether we consider that human rights protections apply to all persons, including those persons we may not like and who may not be considered desirable.  Is the protection from torture and inhuman and degrading treatment to be considered absolute?  It is under European human rights law and, of course, it has been very much valued in Ireland as we saw most recently in the request to the European Court of Human Rights to re-open the Ireland and UK case.  Again, significant misinformation circulates around something like that.  That protection would remain regardless of withdrawal from the EU in that it is provided for under the UN Convention against Torture, the refugee convention and the European Convention on Human Rights, for example.<\/p><p> With regard to the position of movement between Northern Ireland and the Republic and the safeguarding of the common travel area arrangements, it is likely that there would be an attempt to secure that and that it could be secured in some way.  However, managing that in practice would be very difficult given that there would be a need for strengthened border controls with regard to the movements of non-EEA nationals.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1131,"content":"<p>We are outside Schengen at present.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#R00200","speaker":"1076"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1132,"content":"<p>Yes, but we still have a common travel area.

That would be quite difficult in practice as well as legally.<\/p> <p>  The final point relates to a comment that was made as to whether the benefits of free movement could be retained.  Again, this goes to whether it would be possible to negotiate a series of bilateral agreements or a position such as would be available as a member state of the EEA.  As I mentioned, that is very unlikely given that much of the debate has been around limiting free movement.  Giving that type of concession is unlikely either to meet the needs or desires of those proposing an opt-out for the UK or those seeking to leave the EU entirely.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#R00300","nonspeaker":"Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1133,"content":"<p>I will confine my remarks to the specific trade questions that were raised rather than the broader political issues, as the committee has heard some very helpful comments on that already and Steven Aiken will probably add to that when he speaks.<\/p> <p>  On the trade issues, I refer to the point made by Deputy Dooley to the effect that there might be a temptation among Irish businesses to think that as we have a special relationship with the UK, we can still manage to come to an accommodation which would ensure that our beef, dairy products and other products avoid any tariffs and so forth even if Britain leaves.  It is important to be clear that the rules regarding trade relationships have become much tighter since the days when we had the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.  Even though, at least legally, it might be possible to think of the common travel area as a type of bilateral agreement, although as Professor Mullally has highlighted there could be very practical difficulties in introducing it, the idea of a bilateral trade relationship is completely out of the question.  First, the UK will remain a member of the World Trade Organization, WTO, which prohibits discriminatory trade arrangements except in the context of regional trade agreements.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Professor Alan Matthews:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would only be possible for Ireland to have a special relationship if, from a purely theoretical point of view, there was a bilateral relationship.  As we know, external trade policy is now an exclusive competence of the European Union and we are not at liberty to enter into our own trade agreements with a third country.  If we want to protect our interests in a post-Brexit situation we have to do so through the arrangements that the EU as a whole will enter into with the UK, whatever they might be.  It is important to scotch the idea that somehow we can have some sort of bilateral old boys' network arrangement between the UK and Ireland, at least on trade issues.<\/p><p> Deputy Kyne raised the important issue of the UK's relationship with the Commonwealth and so on.  I referred to the matter in my opening remarks.  Certainly, the UK would, post-Brexit, be entitled to pursue its own trade policy.  That means it could set its own level of tariffs which would apply to other countries, including exports from the EU.  The UK could also enter into its own free trade agreements.  I suggested that it would be highly likely that the UK would find it easier to have a free trade agreement with New Zealand and Australia, because the world has changed since the old days of the Commonwealth, and also with Mercosur, the United States and so on.  The UK would be more willing to give agricultural concessions than perhaps the EU is in negotiations with the same groups of countries.  I agree with the Deputy that this is an obvious path for the UK to pursue in a post-Brexit situation.  That would imply, it seems to me, increased competition in the UK market for Irish exporters, because we would have to compete with cheaper Brazilian beef or New Zealand dairy products than we do at present.<\/p><p> A third comment which came across from a number of contributions is the idea that if Britain were to withdraw it could negotiate a deal which would give it the benefits of access to Single Market without having to accept the costs.  It is important to be clear on the matter.  Mr. O'Ceallaigh has explained the nature of the agreements with the European Economic Area countries and with Switzerland, which is a little different.  Switzerland has a free trade agreement but it also has a lot of bilateral agreements which link it very closely with the Single Market.  It is important to emphasise, as Mr. O'Ceallaigh did, that these countries, in return for getting access to the Single Market, commit to transposing every single EU directive directly into their domestic legislation without having any possibility of influencing it.  There are some consultation rights and so on, but these are not very meaningful.<\/p><p> Let us consider the apocalyptic situation in which we are faced with a Brexit and are trying, two years later, to negotiate a common EU arrangement with the United Kingdom.  For example, let us look at the key issue of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP, which is no longer tariffs but has to do with regulatory co-operation.  I would have thought such co-operation would also be a key area in the post-Brexit trade negotiations.  At least in the case of agriculture and food, it may well be the case that the UK would be willing to continue with EU standards and might even be willing to accept, in certain limited areas, that it would simply adopt and transpose EU regulations in these areas.  Due to the importance of its own trade with the EU, the UK might be prepared in some limited areas to accept that loss of sovereignty in return for the access that these Single Market arrangements would give it.  Perhaps I am not as pessimistic, if we have a free trade agreement, about whether it will be possible to integrate some mutual recognition arrangements and so on.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">  Professor Alan Matthews: :<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->It would imply, I think, that the UK would simply have to agree that in these areas we will follow EU legislation to ensure we keep our access.<\/p><p> Senator Reilly raised two questions, and she has put me on the spot.  It seems to me that Brexit would not require any change in current arrangements.  She raised the question of a farmer with land on both sides of the Border. I think that farmer would not notice any big difference because as members are aware one's entitlements to direct payments - let us assume the UK keeps that entitlements type system - are not transferable across borders.  If one had a situation where one could transfer one's entitlements across members states in the European Union, then if Britain withdrew, that would affect it.  At present one's entitlements on land in the North and in the South are completely separate.  As I reflect on it, that would not be affected by Brexit.  Similarly, the cattle and the voluntary food labelling is the sort of bilateral agreement that could continue.  Although there could be significant disruption to trade, on both of these issues I do not see Brexit as having a major impact.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#R00400","nonspeaker":"Professor Alan Matthews","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1136,"content":"<p>I will deal with the issues in the order in which they arose.  Senator Reilly raised the issue of beef supplies and Brexit.  When I was in the Chamber one of the things we looked at quite closely was what we called the circularity of trade.  The reality is that the UK, if it went alone could not source enough beef in the UK and would always look to Ireland.  For many of the larger supermarket chains and the fast food companies, British and Irish beef are synonymous with each other.  That would continue.  If we look at the large numbers of companies that are involved in that space, I cannot see that changing.  That would be quite significant.<\/p> <p>  The one thing that does bother me, as Senator Reilly mentioned, is the issue of the North-South economic relationship and what is likely to happen if there was a Brexit or any sort of change.  I am on the board of the Irish-British Association and one of the things we have been trying to do in the past couple of years is to raise this debate because there does not seem to be any critical thinking at the possible implications on a North-South relationship if we move toward Brexit.  Last October-November we hosted a conference in Queen's University Belfast and Mr. D&aacute;ith&iacute; O'Ceallaigh and others in this room attended.  Quite a few academics were involved in the conversation, but significantly, of the political parties only UKIP turned up, which made it quite an interesting debate.  The reality is that this issue needs serious consideration.  <\/p> <p>  This leads me on to the answer to Deputy Byrne's question on what should Ireland be doing.  Ireland is in an unique position with the United Kingdom, because it is trusted as a trusted agent.  The United Kingdom views Ireland as a great friend to the United Kingdom, that thinks the same way on many issues.  In fact our views and opinions have a considerable degree of weight.  We might not think they do, but they do.  One of the things we should be doing is helping this advocation process of informing the United Kingdom about the importance of remaining within the EU  and talking to our European compatriots about the importance of keeping the UK in the tent.<\/p> <p>  That leads to a question about what we should be seeking to ask as well.  What would the UK be like outside the EU?  In the global context it would be much diminished.  It would have less influence on the world.  It would be still a significant economic power and it would be a significant power, whatever it wants to call itself, but it would be diminished.  I sat on several of the EU competency panels both in London and in various other places and one of the things that came through in the discussions and in the study is that it would not be in the UK's interests to be outside the EU.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Steve Aiken:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->That is not the same as saying the debate can be shaped among the British populace, or that it is the same sort of result for which they should be looking.  That would be the answer I would arrive at for that one as well.<\/p><p> Mr. O'Ceallaigh has already touched on the implications for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  I have had the opportunity to talk to various leaders from the Scottish National Party over a considerable period of time in the past three years.  It is quite clear that a major constitutional issue would arise if Scotland voted to stay in and England voted to go.  I would say there could be similar sorts of arrangements in Wales and in Northern Ireland.  If most of the constituent parts of the UK - by the national composition of the country, rather than by population - wished to remain in the EU but England, with a substantial body of population, particularly in the south east, was potentially looking towards moving out, that would represent a significant crisis point.  It would have major implications.  A steady hand, a reasoned debate and the voice of friendship from Ireland would be of considerable importance in that context.<\/p><p> I was also asked about the business position and the impact on business if the Brexit were to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Some businesses actually have a long-range horizon, whereas others do not.  Those that have a long-range horizon are already beginning to look at these issues as well.  If one listens to the debates within the Confederation of British Industry and the British chambers of commerce, one will be aware that their view is that some form of accommodation will be met.  It is an interesting point when we talk about imports and exports.  The activities of companies like Airbus and BMW motors as part of the prevailing \"just enough, just in time\" manufacturing process show how integrated the UK is within the European manufacturing chain.  I refer to the large-scale output from certain places as \"the Swindon effect\" because all of BMW's diesel engines are manufactured in Swindon before being put into vehicles in the US, Germany and Austria.  European countries have a great deal of interest in making sure the UK remains part of the process as well.<\/p><p> I was asked whether a European recovery would be of benefit to the pro-EU lobby in the UK.  Of course it would.  One of the reasons the euroscepticism debate seems to be gathering momentum relates to what is happening around Greece, its wider implications and what is happening in eastern Europe.  The UK is looking to show greater leadership in sorting out Europe's problems.  If the eurozone were to pull itself out of its current malaise, get the deflation business sorted out and begin to experience real growth again, particularly in key areas, it would be a very positive statement for the UK electorate when it is thinking about whether to remain in the EU.<\/p><p> I will conclude by setting out what I would advocate to encourage the UK to stay in when it votes on EU membership.  We have already spoken about the implications of the vote for the free movement of people and of ideas.  This is one of the areas we would probably need to look to.  The most significant thing we would probably need to do is to ensure the EU is looking at what is possible.  We need to make sure it is well signalled to the UK that the EU is willing to move at least in some direction to keep the UK within the EU.  Even to mention that the UK would be much better within the EU from the majority of the EU would probably be a very significant push.

I invite the Minister to make his opening remarks.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#A00200","speaker":"989"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1143,"content":"<p>I am delighted to be here to resume the legislative process for what I believe to be very significant and important legislation.  We left this Bill on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in July 2014.  This was to ensure that we allowed for the member states to consider the legislation under the technical standards process.  This process is now complete and so the Bill can continue its journey through the House.<\/p> <p>  In 2013 I announced the intention to draft legislation to introduce this measure.  The Government approved and fully supported this approach.  At that time Ireland was the first and only country in Europe committed to introducing this measure.  Since that time I am very pleased to say that a number of countries are following Australia and Ireland's example in this regard.  New Zealand is developing legislation.  The UK Government announced its intention in January to proceed with regulations.  France, Norway and Finland have all indicated their intention to consider introducing standardised packaging in the future.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has always been a leader in tobacco control measures.  We can be proud of the path we have forged in the area of tobacco legislation.  We can be proud of the influence we have on other countries to follow us in this regard.  It is important, however, to realise that the battle against these harmful tobacco products is not yet complete and will not be complete until we can significantly reduce the numbers of young people starting to smoke.  Some 12% of children aged between ten and 17 years are reported as current smokers.  While the number of young people smoking has dropped considerably over the years, 12% is an unacceptable figure.<\/p> <p>  Members will have heard the arguments put by the tobacco industry: standardised packaging does not work, it will increase illicit trade, and Ireland should focus on educating young people about the harms of cigarettes.  We know from research that branded tobacco packaging is a critically important part of tobacco promotion.  We know that health warnings are more effective on plain backgrounds.  We know that standardised packs are less attractive and less appealing to consumers, particularly children.  This is a significant evidence base and it is showing us that standardised packaging works.  Evidence from Australia shows it is working.  Evidence from Australia has completely undermined the tobacco industry arguments.  Misrepresentation of evidence by the tobacco industry is a well-recognised tactic.  Another is the threat of legal challenges.  While a legal challenge by the tobacco industry cannot be ruled out - I say that very much with tongue in cheek - I am very confident that the research available to us demonstrates that standardised packaging will have a positive impact on health and that it is a proportionate and justified measure.  The threat of legal challenges should not be an obstacle to progressing public health policies.  We must press on with our mission to make Ireland tobacco-free by 2025.<\/p> <p>  As regards educating our young people about the harms of tobacco, we are already doing this.  Standardised packaging is one of a number of measures which combined will stop our young people smoking.  It is the combination of past, present and future tobacco control measures that will reduce tobacco consumption.  However, standardised packaging is very important as it is the next step in tackling tobacco advertising and promotion specifically.<\/p> <p>  Before we move to deal with the amendments proposed, I wish to indicate that I will be bringing some technical drafting amendments to the Bill on Report Stage.  I thank Members for their participation on Committee Stage.  I look forward to hearing Deputy Billy Kelleher speak on his amendments and the contributions of other members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#A00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1144,"content":"<p>Does any Member wish to make an opening statement?<\/p><p>I would like to make a brief comment.

In that respect I record for the Minister's noting that I will be supporting the Bill in each of its Stages.

Some of the initial figures indicate that we are making slow but steady incremental progress and anything that can enhance that is welcome.  Lest there be any doubt, I spoke in the D&aacute;il on the matter on numerous occasions and I put on record the efforts of the Minister when he was Minister for Health, in the context of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  The Minister used the platform very effectively in trying to encourage the EU to take a lead in public health.  I commend the Minister in that regard.<br\/><br\/>My amendments are designed to enhance the Bill and to assist in trying to ensure it is effective health policy and that it is also expeditious in trying to deal with tobacco consumption and the reduction of same.  We are talking about a wash-out phase in the Bill whereby its introduction will be postponed until 20 May 2017.  We are saying we should substitute the date with 20 July 2015.  That is an indication of the urgency with which we view the matter that we should try to bring forward plain packaging and standardisation as quickly as possible to ensure we send out a very strong message to people that we are serious about confronting the nefarious, insidious tobacco industry and that we set a lead and an example.  There might be good reason &ndash; the Minister can elaborate on that &ndash; but I would support the introduction of a blunt deadline in terms of the enactment of the legislation on 20 July 2015.  That would give the industry adequate time to respond.<br\/><br\/>I do not refer to retailers who sell tobacco products in shops in this country, but the international tobacco industry is nefarious and threatening.  It has tried, for example, to usurp the democratically people of Australia and its legislative process.  While the industry has the right to protect its copyright through the courts, our duty must be to the people, in particular young people who might be contemplating experimenting with tobacco, and trying to discourage people from taking it up and to encourage people to give it up.  That is the reason I have tabled the amendment.  The Irish Cancer Society takes a strong line on the issue and it has been a strong proponent of the legislation and fully endorses what the Minister is trying to do.  The purpose of the amendment is to strengthen the legislation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#B00600","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1152,"content":"<p>I was anxious to hear what Deputy Kelleher would have to say.  I am attracted to the spirit of the amendment.  The Minister can, and I have no doubt will, in his reply respond on the practicalities.  We can await the detail of that.<\/p> <p>  The spirit of the amendment is that rather than allow a period of time, there is an arguable need to impact not only in relation to the industry, but societally in terms of the importance of all of the measures.  There is no single measure that will be a panacea for the inordinate costs that we have to bear as a result of the health consequences of tobacco smoking.  This is one of a number of measures, some already implemented and other hopefully to follow, that will ultimately lead to a significant reduction in the number of people who smoke and further dissuade people from taking up smoking at an early age.<\/p> <p>  The little box I hold in my hand has been circulated as an example of what plain packaged cigarettes will look like.  It is important for people to recognise and realise that when we talk about plain packaging that it is going to be a white box.  It is not a white box, it is a very stark and unattractive product by any standard.  Any examination of it will confirm that.  What I have in my hand would not be an attractive device in terms of marketing the contents, quite the contrary.  For that reason alone it is a further aid to the process we all support, namely, a significant reduction in current smoker numbers and an even greater if at all possible reduction in the number of young people who take up the habit, so sadly, at a very early age, and with all the difficulties of giving up the habit.  I am open to the spirit of what Deputy Kelleher has said and I await the Minister&rsquo;s response on the practicalities of the proposition.<\/p><p>At the outset, I thank both speakers for their support.  I understand that Deputy Kelleher&rsquo;s proposals are meant in the best possible way and I fully accept the bona fides of his support.  Few people would be more enthusiastic than I to expedite the impact of the legislation but given the letter on the Chairman&rsquo;s desk and the letters that are in circulation, everybody involved in the area is not one bit surprised about the tactics of the tobacco industry.  I take the advice of the Attorney General on these matters.  The amendment suggested by Deputy Kelleher proposes to shorten the transition period allowed for in the Bill.  The transition provisions as outlined in the Bill allow retailers and manufacturers time to comply with the new measures.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=HE1&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Current packets may be manufactured until May 2016 and there will then be a one-year period in which to sell outstanding stocks.  Non-compliant retail packaging may not be manufactured from May 2016 and may not be sold after May 2017.<\/p><p> The introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland is a proportionate public health measure.  It is very important when introducing such measures that steps are taken to give the industry advance notice of the details of the measures.  Any reduction in the transitional period may undermine the State's arguments regarding the proportionality of this Bill.  The transitional times outlined in the Bill are in line with those set out in the EU 2014 tobacco products directive.  Provisions in that directive are essential elements to the success of standardised packaging.  The new tobacco directive provides for larger graphic warnings that are to be displayed on the front and back of packs.  The European Commission has developed a new library of images which cannot be introduced prior to 20 May 2016.  With this in mind, it is deemed reasonable to allow for all the changes required under the standardised packaging legislation and the new tobacco products directive to be introduced within the same timeframes.<\/p><p> As members know, the UK Government recently announced its decision to introduce regulations for standardised packaging.  Similar to Ireland, these regulations will come into force at the same time as the tobacco products directive, in May 2016.  The UK's regulations will also allow the same transitional time as the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill, which is until 2017.<\/p><p> I understand the Deputy, like me, would like the legislation commenced sooner rather than later, as I have said.  However, in the interests of introducing proportionate measures, there is an obligation on the State to allow reasonable time for the industry, first, to prepare for the new measure and, second, to allow for the sale of old stock.  On this basis, I regret I am unable to accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#B00700","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1155,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's statement that, on the advice of the Attorney General, we must be seen to be acting proportionately and that the industry must have time to respond.

In Australia, it was able to respond within two months of the legislation enacted.  It had to wash out branded packaging to comply with the legislation.  It has happened in another jurisdiction with a similar basis for establishing the legislation.<\/p> <p>  I tabled the amendments because we must send out very strong messages that although proportionality is important in passing legislation, we should not be brow-beaten, intimidated or threatened.

Companies want to be able to stand out from the crowd on the shelf when selling a product.  There is an issue with regard to the shape and size of a tobacco product or the packaging.  We know there has been a move towards different sizes and types of boxes; for example, there is a lipstick-style box and so-called nano packaging.  These are primarily targeted at young females in society.  Companies obviously would make a calculated decision in the research context that these slim or extended packs are attractive and encourage young women and girls to start smoking.  We want to make the regulation as watertight as possible and I know the Minister has already thought of this.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not raise this in the context of existing concerns.  These packs could diminish what the legislation is trying to achieve, which is to make cigarettes bland and unattractive so as not to stand out from the crowd.  It is about ensuring that people are aware of the harm they will cause if consumed.  The deficiency in the legislation which could allow for those lipstick-type and nano packages on the shelves could lead to this being a retrograde step.  The tobacco companies have plenty of finance for research and I am sure they will move to this area very quickly.  One can see, even if one is not out too late, cigarettes from such packages being consumed primarily by younger female smokers.

We are talking about individual cigarettes as opposed to the packet.  We suggest that while manufacturers can put an alpha-numeric code on a cigarette nothing else should be allowed on it.  When plain packaging and standardised packaging is introduced, is there anything to stop tobacco companies from putting anything other than an alpha-numeric code on individual cigarettes?  I am concerned that manufacturers could present cigarettes in such a way that they would be enticing and that they would stand out from other cigarettes.  Has any thought been given to the matter of individual cigarettes?  While we will have a standardised package and graphic details showing the damage smoking can cause, once a pack is open and a cigarette is extracted is it not possible that manufacturers could put advertising on individual cigarettes?  Nice, attractive coded messages could be put on cigarettes which would defeat the purpose.  Individual cigarettes should be standardised in order to ensure there is no enticement or inducement possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#D00700","speaker":"983"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1177,"content":"<p>This amendment seeks to prohibit a brand and variant name from appearing on a cigarette stick and instead place an alpha-numeric code.

Cigars and pipe tobacco are tobacco and they do cause harm such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, impotence and a host of other problems.  Notwithstanding that those particular forms of smoking are not currently popular, one must consider what might happen if the other forms of tobacco become very unpopular.  Where do Members&rsquo; think the focus of the tobacco industry will go?  It will go onto cigars and piped tobacco of course.  The legislation covers all tobacco products and I believe that to be right and proper.  That will pre-empt us having to return in a number of years to again pass specific laws on those other tobacco products which will become a major focus of the tobacco industry should it find, as it will indeed find, that plain packaging has resulted in a huge reduction in the number of people smoking cigarettes in this country.<\/p> <p>  The situation around e-cigarettes has become quite worrying.  In one survey in the UK 4% of children are vaping, who never smoked and in America the rate of young people vaping is up to 17%.  The tobacco companies are buying up the smaller e-cigarette companies and it is being promoted now as a lifestyle choice as opposed to an aid to help kick the habit of smoking.  One can see where this vastly well-resourced industry focuses its attention.  As it finds one door closing it seeks to find a window somewhere else open.

We need to broaden the debate as the issue is not just tobacco but nicotine.  Nicotine is being consumed through vaping.  Once a person is addicted to nicotine it can lead him or her towards the path of smoking and tobacco substitutes.  We will have to confront this issue at some stage.  The concern is that a young person may start out by vaping, thinking it is harmless.  It may be harmless in the context of not damaging his or her health initially but he or she may become addicted to nicotine.  When the urge comes on and they do not have the vapouriser, they will reach for a cigarette.  I, too, have major concerns and we will have to look at this in order that we do not allow another generation to become slaves to nicotine.  How they get the nicotine into their body is the question and that can lead to the drift from vaping, to nicotine addiction to people taking up cigarettes at a later stage.<\/p> <p>  I understand there is an exemption under the Public Health (Tobacco) Act 2002 for cigars and pipe tobacco products.

We have the example of the presentation of the cigarette.  How does he envisage pipe tobacco will be presented given that it takes a variety of different shapes and sizes and can come in a plug, a tin, pre-cut or uncut?  As far as I can see, packaging is not provided for in any standardised way.  The Minister is quite specific on the packaging of cigarettes.  Has he considered the impact of the legislation in respect of pipe tobacco products?  I would not want to see anyone encouraged to take up pipe smoking.  I do not see that risk as a by-product of the Bill's intent of ameliorating the effects of tobacco across the board.  I cannot for a moment imagine young people starting to light up pipes.  In my view, thankfully, that is most unlikely.  The numbers who smoke a pipe are declining.  It is a fact of life.  The outlets that I am speaking of provide an array of products for people who have this interest and smoke pipe tobacco.

I am loth to get into this because it is not part of the Bill.  Having said that, I am very concerned about e-cigarettes and their availability to people under 18 years.  I am very concerned that they would be used to sell a lifestyle and to normalise the habit of smoking, which is something we are trying to de-normalise to protect our children.  We made a tactical strategic decision some time back not to put the two Bills together because the evidence around e-cigarettes was not as certain as the evidence that tobacco is detrimental to the people who consume it.  Facts are beginning to emerge and the information from America is that there have been more than 200 admissions of young people to hospital because of overdosing on nicotine and messing around with cartridges.  One of the entries in the Young Scientist Exhibition, and I apologise to the young lady from Derry whose name I cannot recall, was a project on tobacco substitutes that found that the product was labelled as having a certain number of milligrams per ml but on analysis some of them had up to 60 times as much as was advertised on the packet.  There are inherent dangers and I am very keen to have this area regulated.  I do not believe that e-cigarettes should be available outside of a pharmacy or under the direction of a pharmacist as an aid to cease smoking.  They should not be sold outside of that.  That is a matter for the Oireachtas and for the Minister for Health and me to discuss further, particularly the issue of them being classified as illegal.  I am absolutely clear that they should not be legally available to children and people under 18.<\/p> <p>  I do not mean to be trite, but on the issue of whether it is possible under the regulations of 2002 Act, I do not propose to change the Bill in respect of cigars or pipe tobacco.  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who spoke extensively on pipe tobacco, I make the following points.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=HE1&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Members will remember that pipes were the first to be banned in cinemas and on aeroplanes because of the extensive smoke emanating from them.  If we cast our minds back to the role that the current Leader of the Opposition had in achieving the smoking ban in public places, the core principle was to protect workers from the harmful carcinogenic effect of environmental smoke and tobacco products.  Pipe tobacco is very much to the fore in that area and it would make no sense to me for it not to be included in this directive.  Some people may argue they do not inhale the smoke but the incidence of mouth, lip and throat cancers related to pipe smoking is well known.  One may argue that young people are not taking up that type of smoking and would not be likely to do so, but I would quibble with that.  If the vast billions of euro in the tobacco industry were focused on advertising this as a lifestyle choice, there could be unimaginable instruments for the consumption of pipe tobacco, and we would be amazed how quickly it might take off.  I have no intention of excluding that element.<\/p><p> Who in this room could possibly believe that one of the most advanced societies in Europe currently has a tobacco product that involves a person cutting one's gum and shoving tobacco under the lip to absorb it?  That country is Sweden.  Sales of snus, as it is referred to, continue to be substantial.  It is excluded from Europe's tobacco directive, as a compromise had to be made.  Do not underestimate the ability of the tobacco industry to attract people to its product through new and innovative methods.  As I have indicated here and in many other places, if there is a choice between jobs or lives, the choice will always be for lives.  I hope I have addressed the issues in a way that does not cause the committee to think we are not on the same page.  We all want to protect children from taking up this habit and we want to help those who become addicted to get away from this killer habit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#E00600","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1201,"content":"<p>I assure the Minister that my questioning had nothing to do with encouraging the return of pipe tobacco smoking in any variety of settings where smoking is currently illegal.

We really welcome the opportunity to set out our views on this very important issue.<\/p> <p>  I will start by stating our position very clearly.  My own and the Aer Lingus board's strongly held view is that a combination of Aer Lingus with IAG has a compelling strategic rationale and will deliver significant benefits to Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus's employees, Aer Lingus's customers and Ireland.  The board has concluded, based on advice from our financial advisers, that the price of &euro;2.55 per share should be recommended to shareholders.  <\/p> <p>  In recent weeks, we have listened carefully to the public debate regarding IAG's proposal.  During this period we have had further detailed discussions with representatives of IAG and the Aer Lingus board now has a greater understanding of IAG's intentions for the future of Aer Lingus and the proposed commitments IAG is prepared to make in regard to Aer Lingus to the Irish Government.  <\/p> <p>  These discussions have further confirmed that it is clearly in IAG's interest to continue to grow Aer Lingus within the IAG group. Aer Lingus being part of IAG represents a hugely positive opportunity for Aer Lingus and Ireland. This deal is about accelerated growth.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Stephen Kavanagh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This deal is about accelerated growth.  It provides real prospects for growth in Aer Lingus, the economy, global connectivity, international trade, tourism and employment.  I am surprised it can be represented in any other way.  It is on the basis of these understandings that I and the Aer Lingus board give our strong support to the proposed transaction.  The Aer Lingus team met last week with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the interdepartmental group established by the Minister.  We set out the board's view on the benefits of the proposed deal.  I will summarise these meetings regarding the benefits of IAG's proposal and key commercial drivers.  The proposal is viewed by the board as compelling and a significantly positive opportunity for Aer Lingus, its employees, its customers and Ireland.  Aer Lingus as part of IAG will enhance Ireland's position as a natural hub linking Europe and North America.  Ireland's location as the westernmost point in Europe makes it a natural gateway to connect the combined populations of Europe and North America.  Aer Lingus believes IAG's proposal can enable Ireland to become a central hub for European traffic across the Atlantic, resulting in better utilisation of the infrastructure investment in Irish airports. <\/p><p> The market between Europe and North America is about 75 million people per annum.  Increasing our share of this traffic, which is currently at 2%, to even 4 or 5% would mean bringing an additional 1 to 2 million passengers per year through Ireland, which would have huge positive benefits for Aer Lingus and its employees and for Irish airports and their employees and a myriad of ancillary support services.  With Aer Lingus as part of the IAG group, there would potential for the planned growth in transatlantic traffic to be significantly accelerated, with new US destinations added to its network.  There is an immediate prospect of accelerating our plans to open two new destinations in North America, one on the east coast and one on the west coast.  <\/p><p> Aer Lingus as part of IAG will deliver employment growth.  Initial transatlantic traffic and destination growth will create significant numbers of new jobs in Ireland. The new routes would require the acquisition of two more long-range aircraft and would provide at least two hundred direct and highly skilled jobs in Aer Lingus.  A multiple of this number would be employed in support services in the general economy and in the tourism sector.  Being part of IAG will enhance Aer Lingus's European growth.  Aer Lingus short-haul services, including the Dublin, Cork and Shannon to London Heathrow routes, will directly benefit from the sales and marketing activity conducted on its behalf by British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and the Oneworld partner sales forces.  This will strengthen the positions of the Cork and Shannon to Heathrow routes and provide additional visitor traffic to the southern and mid-west regions and the rest of the country.  Irish tourism will also benefit from greater exposure to the frequent flyer programme of Oneworld members, particularly British Airways and American Airlines.   <\/p><p> Expected benefits to Aer Lingus's Atlantic and European network, if Aer Lingus were part of IAG, include better connectivity to and from Ireland.  Being part of IAG will also allow greater access to a global cargo network.  Aer Lingus's cargo business will benefit from the global network reach and sales channels of IAG cargo business.  The cargo network enhancement is expected to deliver significant benefits and additional options to Irish businesses, particularly the pharmaceutical sector.  <\/p><p> Aer Lingus as part of IAG will be a separate operating business and the Aer Lingus brand will continue and flourish.  Aer Lingus has confirmed IAG's intentions to preserve Aer Lingus as a separately operating business within the group, with its own brand, management, head office and operations.  Willie Walsh confirmed this strongly and publicly to this committee last week.<\/p><p> It is the strong view of the Aer Lingus board that the prospect of Aer Lingus being part of IAG has compelling, strategic and commercial logic for Aer Lingus.  It would have significantly positive benefits for Aer Lingus and for Ireland, and the board is strongly supportive of the Government's two-airline policy.  Following a combination with IAG, Aer Lingus will have more attractive growth options that will significantly benefit Aer Lingus as a company, its employees, its customers, the tourism sector, Irish business and industry and the airports where Aer Lingus operates.<\/p><p> We are fully aware of concerns expressed by political parties.  Aer Lingus is willing to meet individual parties in order to clarify our position further.  We believe this is a very good opportunity for Aer Lingus and Ireland.  I hope we can give it the collective support it needs and deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Barrington","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1226,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kavanagh.

I will start by introducing Stobart Air, formerly Aer Arann.  Stobart Air is a franchise flying specialist flying for three airlines: Aer Lingus, Flybe and CityJet.  We employ 430 people, an increase of 100 in the past four years.  Our airline is all about high frequency, regional connectivity and feeding passengers into onward air journeys.  The Aer Lingus-Stobart Air partnership, which we operate under the Aer Lingus Regional banner, is proof of what can be achieved when a small airline partners with a larger one.  The partnership started in 2010 and now operates 25 routes to and from 18 airports across Ireland, the UK and France.  Aer Lingus Regional has increased its annual passenger numbers from 855,000 to 1.3 million in 2014, a 53% increase in just over four years.  In the coming weeks we will fly our five millionth passenger.  Aer Lingus Regional now contributes 12% of Aer Lingus overall passengers.  The partnership is testament to the commercial relationship between our airlines.  We have extended our contract to 2022.  It is also testament to how far we have come from the brink of bankruptcy just over four years ago. We have broadened our route network, invested &euro;150 million in new aircraft, increased our passenger numbers and added to our workforce.  The returns from our partnership are evident when you consider how Aer Lingus Regional feeds passengers to the Aer Lingus transatlantic route.  The combination of Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Regional and the US immigration pre-clearance in Ireland is a massive advantage that no other country enjoys.  Last year approximately 100,000 of our passengers arrived at Dublin, completed US pre-clearance and boarded an Aer Lingus transatlantic service to the US, or they arrived from one of Aer Lingus's North American services and boarded our aircraft to Dublin to connect onward.  The advantages this offers consumers are significant.  People can save up to two hours on a journey.  Passengers also avoid the hassle of more queues on arrival at US airports.  Nearly 100,000 transatlantic connections in 2014 is an 80% increase in just four years.  It is a core part of our business. It delivers the passengers Aer Lingus needs to expand its North American network.  Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus Regional will continue to increase transatlantic business.  It is our belief that if IAG takes over Aer Lingus this growth could be achieved faster and on a larger scale.  From a UK perspective, how can we get UK-originating passengers to choose Dublin instead of London, Paris or Amsterdam when travelling to the US?  Last year, 4.3 million people travelled to London Heathrow from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds Bradford, Manchester and Newcastle.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Sean Brogan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These are all cities that Aer Lingus currently serves.  Of these, at least 1.2 million passengers connected at Heathrow to other, mainly US, destinations.  I will discuss Newcastle specifically.  In 2014, Aer Lingus Regional carried 9,000 Newcastle passengers to or from the US through Dublin.  A further 300,000 passengers from Newcastle used Heathrow, not Dublin, as their connecting point.  These are passengers that Aer Lingus should win.  As part of IAG, Aer Lingus can win them.  Being part of a global airline family would fast-track the realisation of this opportunity.  This would help our airline to expand, meaning more aircraft and more jobs.  Aer Lingus would benefit from the passenger increase, as would Irish airports.  The overall economy would also benefit, particularly from more inbound US tourists.<\/p><p>  Consumers want choice and convenience, particularly when it comes to air traffic.  Consumers like the convenience of one website visit, one click to book, one check-in, straight through from start to finish on their journey.  An Aer Lingus alliance with IAG would realise these benefits for Irish consumers.  To drive and survive, airlines must constantly seek out and secure new opportunities.  Stobart Air believes that the IAG offer is such an opportunity.  The partnership of Stobart Air with a larger airline has enabled it to grow and has delivered significant consumer and employment benefits to the economy.  I believe the same can be replicated on an even larger scale if Aer Lingus joins forces with IAG.  That is why Stobart Air is backing the IAG bid for Aer Lingus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Brogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1229,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brogan.  Both Mr. Kavanagh and Mr. Brogan have said in their presentations that a successful IAG bid to take over Aer Lingus would have a positive outcome.  Mr. Barrington referred to 200 new jobs based on new transatlantic traffic; last week Mr. Walsh suggested 500 new jobs.  Could Mr. Barrington comment on this figure?  The important issues are jobs, connectivity, and growth.  If the IAG bid to take over Aer Lingus is not successful, is there still a possibility of growth?  Are there any disadvantages to a successful bid by IAG to take over Aer Lingus?  Will the growth be limited to Dublin Airport?  What about growth in Shannon, Cork, and the regional airports?  Coming from the west of Ireland, I have a particular interest in Ireland West Airport Knock.  Mr. Kavanagh has been instrumental in organising a transatlantic flight to and from Knock, which will begin in summer 2015.  If the IAG bid is successful, is it more likely that this service will be expanded into seasonal charter flights?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#C00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1230,"content":"<p>I will start with the 200 new jobs.  I was specifically referring to the prospect of Aer Lingus operating services to two new destinations, one on both the east and west coast of the United States.  Those two new destinations would require one more aircraft each and that would mean approximately 100 new jobs per aircraft.  Over the next five years, between now and 2020, we could see the more than 500 direct jobs that Mr. Walsh referred to last week.  Aer Lingus could increase its current transatlantic fleet from 10 aircraft to close to 20 aircraft, and if those targets were achieved more than 500 jobs would be created in total.  I believe Mr. Walsh was referring to what IAG might add to the two new services proposed by Aer Lingus.  Would Mr. Kavanagh discuss the possibility of growth if the IAG bid to take over Aer Lingus is unsuccessful?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Barrington"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1231,"content":"<p>Aer Lingus believes that opportunities are growing to serve Europe and compete for traffic between Europe and North America.  Having had discussions with representatives of IAG and, indeed, listened to their contribution to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, it is apparent that IAG shares the same view as to the value of these opportunities; hence the proposal.  What is the opportunity?  Aer Lingus carried 1.3 million customers across the Atlantic last year and one in three of those customers was travelling between Europe and North America.  That additional business provided Aer Lingus with the ability to grow and sustain the frequency of existing services between Dublin or Shannon and North America.  Without that access to Europe and North American traffic, Aer Lingus would not be able to sustain the existing shape of the Aer Lingus transatlantic service.<\/p> <p>  That traffic also has a positive contribution to our short-haul network.  Simply put, if a passenger is travelling between Boston and Paris, Aer Lingus carries them to Dublin on the Atlantic aircraft.  It supports our connectivity to the UK and Europe and complements the natural demand between Ireland and the UK and Europe.  Aer Lingus sees this on a standalone basis as something that will allow it to grow into the future.  It will be challenging.  It is not without risk, given the scale of Aer Lingus and the shocks that are a feature of the aviation business.  However, it is a strategy that, as one can see from our financial results in recent years, has worked.  Aer Lingus believes that the geographic advantages that Ireland delivers in this regard are central to the proposition.  Rather than viewing Ireland's remote island status on the western periphery of Europe as a disadvantage, in this particular instance it is a key advantage.  It is an advantage from the customer's perspective because the time to traverse the Atlantic through Dublin is faster.  From an airline's perspective, the quicker the journey, the lower the cost.  The geography gives us natural economic advantages in serving the market.  The State has made the appropriate investments in terms of airport infrastructure.  The customs and border patrol facilities at Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport give Aer Lingus an added advantage.  <\/p> <p>   What is the additional opportunity with regard to IAG?  It is, in essence, scale.  Aer Lingus by itself will fight for its place in the market.  It has done so for close to 80 years and it will continue to do so.  What IAG brings to Aer Lingus is the ability to join forces; particularly in the Atlantic joint business, to have four airlines selling Aer Lingus seats as if they were their own allows Aer Lingus to compete.  It allows Aer Lingus to have more confidence in terms of the number of customers it can reach.  It allows Aer Lingus to have more confidence in terms of the costs to those customers because of the economies of scale.  Ultimately, it de-risks expansion for Aer Lingus.  The approach of four airlines selling jointly will accelerate opportunities that it would otherwise be challenging for Aer Lingus to exploit on its own.  This is a fast-track approach.  <\/p> <p>   The positives from an Aer Lingus perspective are not just to do with the Atlantic.  As I referenced earlier, those passengers have to be flown from the UK and Europe, hence the partnership with Stobart Air.  One hundred thousand customers use Stobart Air services.  More than 300,000 customers use Aer Lingus mainline transatlantic services from Dublin and Shannon.  Those services will be positively impacted not just by the incremental flow across the Atlantic but, further, by membership of the Oneworld alliance, as proposed by IAG, because in that instance there would be 15 global airlines selling seats to Shannon and Cork and Dublin.  So Aer Lingus sees the benefits in terms of the opportunity for accelerated growth.  In the absence of such a deal, the challenges will remain but there will be fewer opportunities and higher risks.  That scenario has direct implications for the confidence with which investment can be made.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Stephen Kavanagh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those are the circumstances under which we have no hesitation in recommending the proposal on the basis that it would be positive for Aer Lingus shareholders, for employees, for all stakeholders and ultimately for Ireland Inc. in terms of utilising the geographical advantages and retaining that economic opportunity within this economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1233,"content":"<p>What about the growth in Dublin <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>growth in the regions, including the regional airports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#D00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1234,"content":"<p>The growth will flow to all elements of the Aer Lingus network.

If British Airways is supplemented by the ability of all Oneworld members to sell seats on behalf of Aer Lingus between London and Shannon, there are no circumstances, from our analysis, on the basis of having more potential customers in a more cost-effective manner, under which the viability of the network is in any way compromised or less benefited than in the IAG proposal.  That is across the network.  It is about having an ability to reach more potential customers more cost-effectively.

There is opportunity in airports we service from Aberdeen to Edinburgh to Glasgow and right down through the UK.  We are taking passengers who select Aer Lingus, as opposed to the IAG platform, which would offer much greater exposure.

I will be as quick as possible, because there are quite a few questions.  To clarify the issue that was raised regarding 200 versus 500 jobs, my understanding was that when Mr. Walsh was asked what he intended to bring to Aer Lingus, he said the contribution would be in terms of sales and supporting the efforts of Aer Lingus Regional to support its strategy, which was to deploy or to put on the fleet one wide-bodied aircraft per year for the next five years.  That is at variance with what Mr. Barrington has said, but maybe he can clarify that.<\/p> <p>  I listened with interest to what Mr. Barrington had to say.  He twice reminded us that this was the right strategic decision from a commercial point of view for Aer Lingus, for its employees, for its customers and for Ireland.  The only thing he has left out from that is the shareholders.  I would have thought that, as chairperson of the company, his primary objective was to work in the interest of the shareholders.  I am not sure where he stands on that.  He might help us to understand.  There has been some media comment about the directors of the company and how they, together with some senior management, will share in a &euro;30 million pot, some kind of bonus disbursal, as a result of the sale.  Maybe he could talk to us about that.  I would have liked to see before us today some of the independent directors on his board and be able to interact with them.  I would also have liked to see the directors appointed by the State, who, while they have a fiduciary duty to the company, also have a mandate from the Government to look at the broader regional aspects to the company's overall strategic direction.  Maybe Mr. Barrington can comment to some extent on that.<\/p> <p>  If this deal goes through, will there be an independent Aer Lingus board?  Mr. Kavanagh talked about management, head office, etc.  Will there be a board?  What has been going on in Aer Lingus?  Has there been long-term strategic planning or have the directors been working towards this day?  Has Aer Lingus been courting IAG or somebody in IAG's league?  Has it always been, in recent years, just about getting to a point at which the directors dispose of the airline, get their exit strategy and get to share that &euro;30 million pot?  I see a level of confusion between what the witnesses are telling me and what Willie Walsh tells me is their long-term strategy. If Mr. Brogan's interaction with them has been so successful, why have we not heard of Aer Lingus developing its own growth strategy as a relatively small independent operator?  My understanding was that there was an alliance with another airline about being able to buy aircraft relatively competitively.  If there was a long-term strategy, could it not have been achieved through a strategic link-up with IAG, rather than a capitulation or a sell-out?  Could Aer Lingus not have attempted to paddle its own canoe, to develop a strategic alliance whereby all the benefits that have been mentioned would still be there and would flow to the benefit of the company, the employees, the shareholders, and more importantly, this island nation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#D00600","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1238,"content":"<p>I will deal with some of those questions and perhaps Mr. Kavanagh might deal with some others.

That is why I mentioned the two that we can accelerate, plus what he mentioned, so I think we can do a bit better than that.

We have competed between Europe and North America, hence the deliberate partnership and co-operation with our colleagues in Stobart Air and some of the arrangements we have made with partner airlines in North America to give us access to the US and Canadian markets and European hinterland.

We are not invalidating our current strategy.  The issue is the balance of opportunity, which will be increased, and risk, which will decrease.  That balance of opportunity and risk determines investment.  Both parties have a common view as to the level of the opportunity but our capacity to exploit that opportunity is reduced independently than it would be as part of IAG.  That is the just the reality of the position.  The committee should not take the view that we do not believe that we have a robust business that is capable of generating returns for shareholders and stakeholders.  That is not the stated position.  We are encouraged by the level of increased opportunity, which will generate incremental jobs.  That is an inevitability and they will be more sustainable as a result because they will be built on stronger foundations.  They will be high end, direct jobs ranging from pilots and cabin crew to engineers.  They will not just be incremental as there will be more promotion opportunities for colleagues are working in the enterprise.<\/p> <p>  Aer Lingus can realistically survive.  It has realistically survived thus far, although it is more challenged than ever because of the global nature of competition.  We serve the island and if we can continue to have that mindset, we will be increasingly vulnerable because that is a constrained market in terms of opportunity.  The opportunity for us is to compete and bring to the Europe-north America marketplace what we have been successfully doing for the Irish consumer and for those wishing to visit Ireland for the past 80 years.  That it the challenge.  The risk appetite is stopping us, and not just our personal risk appetite as we have to generate a return on other people's capital.  That return is more difficult to generate than the alternative within IAG but it does not preclude that investment.  It is then about the pace of that investment and, ultimately, the sustainability of that investment.<\/p> <p>  We are comfortable that we can get beyond 2%.  On a report in terms of competitive standings in Europe, one will go a long way before one will find 2% and, therefore, in many ways we are not relevant.  Once one becomes relevant, one becomes open to competition and to the challenges of what the large consolidated global carriers can do and that leaves us vulnerable.  It is a challenge we are up to.  We will continue to manage the costs in our business and to invest in the product but, undoubtedly, it is an additional challenge.  All this is simply a way of saying that the opportunity that the IAG proposal brings will be accelerated but also more sustainable growth.  The greatest protection any slot can have is sustainable profitability of the service provider that utilises it.  It is as simple as that.  We operate in the market.  The slots, as they are currently deployed, make a contribution.  Aer Lingus's primary role is to connect Ireland to the world.  Connecting Ireland to London is central to our product offering.  We are going nowhere on Cork, Shannon and Dublin to Heathrow Airport, but continued investment and competition is the greatest guarantee.  The capability of having One World partners and IAG partners selling those routes gives us added confidence that their sustainability can be only improved in that scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1264,"content":"<p>Last week Mr. Walsh referred to administrative job losses in the headquarters in Dublin.

Why then would we look at trying to sell off an airline that seems to be doing well and making progress, albeit at a slow pace?  A slow pace is good.

Gradual improvement at that rate is steady progress.<br\/><br\/>What is lacking here is vision.  If I were CEO of Aer Lingus, I would be saying that I want to grow the airline on its own, for the shareholders, the State and everyone, and that is what I would be pushing for.  Senior executives stand to make money on their shares if Aer Lingus is sold.  I see this as a conflict of interest in the context of making a judgment and being objective.  In objective terms, they would say they should push ahead and work at growing the airline on a steady basis and open up routes.  This is happening and more connectivity is being developed.

That opportunity and valuation was part of the analysis and consideration of the proposal from IAG and we believe it fairly reflects the valuation and future potential of the business.<\/p> <p>  On why we would sell off Aer Lingus, I do not see it as a sell-off.  We are a plc.  What we are recommending is an ability to accelerate the value creation.  That is where not just shareholders, but stakeholders, employees and Ireland maintains a benefit.  The world does not stop to allow Aer Lingus to grow.  We carried 11 million customers in 2014, more than any time in our history, yet we do not make the top 50 carriers worldwide.  That is the nature of the business we compete in.  Increasingly, the airline business will consolidate.  There are significant economies of scale and significant cost benefits from having major fleets and significant revenue benefits from having global reach and partnership.  This is something we simply cannot ignore, albeit that - not waving a white flag - we have a solid business based on good fundamentals.  What is up for consideration here is the incremental opportunity.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the comparison or contrast with Iberia, first, I believe IAG sees the value inherent in the Aer Lingus strategy in terms of the opportunity to grow Ireland as a natural hub for transatlantic traffic.  Aer Lingus is a profitable business that has gone through many restructurings.  When British Airways and Iberia combined, Iberia was a deeply troubled business that needed to be restructured.  It is not comparable in any way to what IAG would be investing in if it was to secure Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus is a growth vehicle for IAG.  It is a &euro;1.4 billion investment from British Airways and IAG.  This is not an investment that will be recouped by redirecting passengers through Heathrow.  It is an investment that will be recovered and grown by exploiting the opportunity that exists for Aer Lingus, Dublin, Shannon and Cork to have a larger share of the Europe to North America market.<\/p> <p>  The inevitability of some back office support functions being lost is indisputable.  This is one of the rationales and is why consolidation is such a feature of the industry.  However, the opportunity here is the amount of direct employment that will be delivered from the growth, particularly of transatlantic capable aircraft, but also because of the support activities and because of the services provided not only by the airport but the businesses based on it and the spin-off.  Simply, having more access to the island generates more inbound tourism.  This has a significant indirect positive impact on levels of employment.<\/p> <p>  We have taken the time to consider deeply the implications of this offer.  The board and the executive management team are very conscious of the implications and the interests of stakeholders.  We have no hesitation in recommending the offer because we intuitively believe it is positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1273,"content":"<p>I wish to make just one comment.

That has happened and we have now started to fly with Flybe and CityJet.  The IAG proposal would allow us to continue that expansion but to express it.  We will continue to grow.  Aer Lingus Regional will only grow so far but Stobart Air will continue to grow and will continue to do so in a managed way.  To answer the Deputy's question about how big we want the airline to be, we intend to carry through on the commitments made at the time of the investment.  The investment was all about a franchise flying platform.<\/p> <p>  The second question was whether we stand to gain from this transaction and the answer is that we do.

They suggest that smaller airlines must join forces with larger ones because consolidation is the way of the future.  I do not necessarily agree with that.

We cannot accuse the witnesses of not being forthright today.<\/p> <p>  All of us here will agree that there is a national sentiment around the brand name of Aer Lingus.  If one asks people about Aer Lingus, which used to be a State-owned company, most will say that they feel that Aer Lingus belongs to all of us.  The reality, of course, is that it does not and we must deal with life as it is.  The sentiment is there but sentiment will not provide one's breakfast.  There is still an attachment to Aer Lingus on the part of many people.  I say all of this in the context of the fact that as legislators we are receiving correspondence about this to the effect that Ireland is an island off an island and if Aer Lingus is sold, we will divorce ourselves from everything in terms of aviation and will lose everything.  As I said, that is based on sentiment but it is how people feel.<\/p> <p>  As a lifelong trade unionist, my big question is about outsourcing, which will have a very big influence on how people on this side of the House will make their decision.

However, I would like them to address the issues of direct employment and security of employment.  I am realistic enough to know that there are very few certainties in life but I would like the witnesses to connect the confidence they feel about the future with the fact that there must also be some confidence and security for those who already work in Aer Lingus.

Any owner of Aer Lingus that ignores the sentimental attachment of its customer base is putting the business at risk and I simply cannot believe that this investment proposition is based on that view.  IAG is buying a successful enterprise with a strong brand.  Swiss consumers still regularly use Swiss Air, which is owned by Lufthansa. Etihad owns Alitalia, while British Airways itself is owned by IAG.  This is a global business.  The corporate head office for British Airways is, notionally, in Madrid but that does not stop British consumers from viewing British Airways as the flag carrier.  That is where I would see Aer Lingus positioned within the IAG group proposal.<br\/><br\/>On outsourcing, I do not see it being on the agenda and that has been communicated from IAG.  In terms of direct employment of pilots and cabin crew, this will be incremental and will give more opportunities to those already employed.  Dublin will be a hub, similar to the rest of the hub operations in IAG.  It is the <i>modus operandi<\/i>of IAG to resource its hub operations because it is as efficient, when one has critical mass and scale, to do it oneself.  One gets more control over the quality of service and the guarantee of the mutuality of interests between those delivering the service and those resourcing it.  Again, at the Irish bases, the greatest protection is growth and the sustainability of the operation.

I congratulate Mr. Kavanagh on his appointment and I wish him the best of luck.  We have heard a lot of testimony over the past few weeks.  Some of it shows that Aer Lingus has been operating under good management and is a profitable and growing company.  IAG will benefit from the takeover of Aer Lingus.  This is a change in the trend.  Iberia was really struggling and would have been a target for a takeover, as I imagine the balance sheet was not very strong.  With a strong brand and much potential, it would have been a realistic target for a takeover.  Aer Lingus is in a different place and is still growing, albeit at a slower pace than if the IAG takeover occurs.<\/p> <p>  I link that to the testimony of Mr. Brogan.  The relationship that Stobart Air and Aer Lingus Regional has with Aer Lingus has been hugely beneficial to his company.  I draw a comparison between that situation and Iberia and IAG.  In the case of Aer Lingus, it is completely different as it is a growing company in a takeover.  It is not a company on its own and there are codeshares.  Perhaps the witnesses can give me an idea of what this means for Aer Lingus if IAG is not in the room.  What does the codeshare with Star Alliance and Sky Team bring to Aer Lingus in terms of a global reach for consumers?<\/p> <p>  Equally, we can talk about the economies of scale that may be beneficial in the case of a takeover by IAG of Aer Lingus.  Can we hear about the benefits of the interline agreements with Etihad Airways, JetBlue and United Airlines, particularly in terms of procurement?  How will this change and what is the relative benefit of IAG becoming involved?  The IAG investment is &euro;1.4 billion.  This is the amount of funding on the table.  The company will not get it back from the Irish consumer.  The money will get a return from European and north American consumers and there will be only a marginal return in this country, based on a relative increase in activity.  Perhaps the witnesses will clarify how this will benefit the Irish consumer or the State in terms of an increase and how to link this to Aer Lingus growing on a faster and larger scale and the 6 million people living on this island, north and south.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#J00900","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1291,"content":"<p>Mr. Kavanagh mentioned the benefit of four airlines jointly selling seats on the same aircraft using a partnership approach.

It is not that company's record in Scotland according to the Government there.<br\/><br\/>I need all of the documentation on the slots.  It seems that in respect of the High Court judgment in London last Thursday, Aer Lingus was stating one thing here and another in the United Kingdom.  To quote from the judgment:<blockquote>Many of the potential competitive effects of the transaction that we considered [that is whether Ryanair should be a partner] would manifest themselves in terms of the absence of an action that might otherwise have been taken by Aer Lingus (for example, Aer Lingus being prevented from combining with another airline [which is what we are talking about today] or from disposing of Heathrow slots in the context of optimizing its route network and timetable).<\/blockquote>Was that case made by Aer Lingus in the UK courts?

It has identified London Heathrow, Madrid and Dublin Airport as the three hubs that are central to IAG competing for a share.  The impact on Scotland, the history of British Airways and the competitive dynamic in that marketplace are not matters on which I can comment.  What I can say is Scotland is a significant source market for Aer Lingus in transiting passengers between Scotland and North America.  I see no reason that would change.  In fact, it would improve in terms of our opportunity to compete in that marketplace.  Not only would we have British Airways selling Dublin on a neutral basis from Scotland, we would also have American Airlines selling seats to Scotland via Dublin Airport.<\/p> <p>  The issue for IAG from our analysis is competing for more of a share in the Europe to North America marketplace.  It is not a case of simply adding Aer Lingus to the IAG group and leaving it at that.  This is about growing the business.  It is about passengers choosing part of the product offering by IAG and its Atlantic joint business partner, rather than choosing to travel on United Airlines from Edinburgh.  This is about IAG diagnosing that the value proposition from Aer Lingus is capable of being competitive, that there is a growth opportunity and that ultimately two plus two equals five.<\/p> <p>  On preventing the disposal of slots, I have said the greatest protection slots have is delivering a sustainable economic return.  In circumstances where that is not possible, it is, of course, at the discretion of the State to purchase slots or to introduce a PSO to ensure connectivity.

This is not to say Aer Lingus has immediate plans to dispose of slots.  As I said, the slots are core to the Aer Lingus customer proposition, given that Ireland-Heathrow is one of the busiest air routes on the globe.  It is also core to the British Airways network that Ireland retain its connectivity.  Shannon and Cork airports are key source routes for long-haul flow through Heathrow Airport.  The basic proposition is that the opportunity is to grow Dublin Airport as a hub.  This would benefit Aer Lingus and, ultimately, IAG because IAG would increase its share in the Europe to North America marketplace.

While they are strong, mutually beneficial relationships, there is not necessarily full alignment of mutual interests.  If United Airlines is selling a ticket between Chicago and Dublin, its first commercial instinct is to keep the customer in its own metal.  It will, therefore, attempt to direct the customer to Heathrow Airport and on to an Aer Lingus service from there to Dublin.  That is the natural conflict in the current code-share relationships.  The difference between such a relationship and the one suggested in IAG's proposal is that American Airlines would have an aligned and equivalent economic interest in selling a direct ticket from Chicago to Dublin.  While the current partner portfolio has worked very well for Aer Lingus and our partners, the depth of the relationships in terms of the co-ordination of schedules and customer proposition is constrained by regulations.  In the absence of an alignment of economic interests, there will always be competing demands between the two parties.

Etihad has an equity stake in Aer Lingus on the basis of which Aer Lingus has had access to some procurement benefits.  We work closely with our equity partner in Etihad to extract revenue benefits, for example, by having an Aer Lingus code on services to Australia and in procurement.  However, the benefits are limited because, given that Etihad owns 4% of Aer Lingus, it would not transfer the full economic benefit.

For Irish consumers, it would give more choice and, potentially, better value because, inevitably, flight prices will decrease over time.  The acceleration of growth will mean an acceleration of cost reductions and better value.  It is a virtuous circle and Dublin Airport's opportunity to compete.  Ireland's geography is our best advantage.  It is the shortest crossing, which is the most compelling advantage from a customer and cost perspective because one burns less fuel between Dublin and New York than between London and New York.  This natural advantage and the scale of Aer Lingus's operations at Dublin and Shannon airports in terms of our connectivity in Europe give us an ability to compete.  What we need is access to the marketplace.  In May we will not just be starting a Dublin to Washington route but also 60 routes that touch Washington, for example, Edinburgh-Dublin-Washington or Dublin-Washington-Boise, Idaho.

The witnesses might forgive me if some of the questions I intend to ask already have been asked.  On the presumption the witnesses have watched the joint committee's proceedings up to now in respect of the stakeholders that have appeared before members, I also presume they saw the presentation last week by Mr. Walsh, the chief executive officer of British Airways.  Specifically, last week he gave a commitment to Shannon and Cork in respect of the Heathrow slots but did not elaborate on transatlantic flights from the perspective of Shannon Airport.  In addition, he was somewhat reluctant to extend what is a five-year commitment beyond that.  I seek the witnesses' thoughts in this regard because from the point of view of the joint committee, the greater the commitment members can get, particularly for Shannon and Cork, the more that clarity will enter this debate.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate Mr. Kavanagh on his appointment.  How does he think the decision of Aer Lingus to come out in favour of the offer will be perceived in a region out of which Aer Lingus walked the last time there was talk of such a sale?  The bona fides of Aer Lingus in the mid-western region are not great because when the first tranche of shares was sold, Aer Lingus hightailed it out of Shannon Airport at the first opportunity.  When the 75% stake was sold, Aer Lingus left Shannon and left a sour taste in the region as a whole.  Does Mr. Kavanagh accept there is good reason for people, particularly in the mid-west, to be sceptical of what Aer Lingus now advocates based on previous experiences?  In addition, I note from the documentation received that the company's position has received board approval.  Mr. Kavanagh should elaborate on this board approval.  Was it unanimous?  Was there a vote at the board and were there dissenting voices or abstentions on the board?  The company has come clean, for want of a better phrase, on how it perceives the offer made by International Consolidated Airlines Group, IAG, to the Government.  Perhaps this is an opportunity for Aer Lingus to go the extra mile and throw out the whole lot as regards what were the deliberations within the board that resulted in the board giving its green light to the purchase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#O00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1351,"content":"<p>I will defer to the chairman with regard to the board because I am chief executive-designate and have not been necessarily present at all deliberations.  With regard to the Shannon to Heathrow route, let me put on record that the decision to remove service was a function of the level of losses, which were unsustainable.  Our position in Aer Lingus is that this unsustainability was reinforced through ill-judged incentives and subsidies that were given to a direct competitor at Shannon, whereby Aer Lingus was in the invidious position of paying full airport services and fees that were being transferred directly across the check-in counters to our direct competitor.  That did not work out well for Shannon Airport and we all have moved on in respect of the sustainability of the Shannon to Heathrow operation.  Today, that route makes a positive contribution to the Aer Lingus group.  We have, with the support of our colleagues in Shannon, restructured the business.  We are more efficient.  There also is far more transparency in the pricing and incentive regime at Shannon Airport.  While it is a little trite to state that times have changed, they have.  As I stated earlier, the greatest protection for the air service between Sharon and Heathrow is its profitability.  In addition, I believe that IAG has offered some guarantees as to the five-year commitment to maintain those services.  For a variety of reasons, I think that is a time limit which is a function of IAG's desire to maintain some commercial control over airport and vendor costs and so on.  It simply does not wish to transfer to an airport the security of being able to rely on this forever, thereby removing the commercial dynamic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1352,"content":"<p>On that basis, would it not make more sense to extend the guarantee to ten or 15 years because one then would have surety from the company's point of view as much as from that of the airport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#O00400","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1353,"content":"<p>Were the Deputy the airport operator, why would he give me a deal if I was saying I will be here for 15 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1354,"content":"<p>If I was the airport operator, why would I not ask for a deal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#O00600","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1355,"content":"<p>No, the airport operator, through its incentivisation and discounts of its charging regimes, can attract and sustain-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1356,"content":"<p>But is there not a win-win for both the airport and the airline if there is certainty regarding costs and everything into the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#O00800","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1357,"content":"<p>Not necessarily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1358,"content":"<p>Why?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#O01000","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424181600,"counter":1359,"content":"<p>Because going back every five years is far more advantageous in extracting value than is committing to a 15-year term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1360,"content":"<p>In terms of the region, is that not what this boils down to?

In a way, the presentations were much clearer than that made by Mr. Willie Walsh last week.  It is clear that both Aer Lingus and IAG intend to develop a hub in Ireland.  It is equally clear the hub will be based in Dublin Airport.  We have two State-owned airport groups, Shannon Airport and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA.  Is it possible to develop two hubs in a small country?  Mr. Walsh is of the view that it is not possible.  Mr. Kavanagh referred to Switzerland.  It is one of the few small countries with two, albeit relatively small, hubs in Geneva and Z&uuml;rich.  They are both connected with the state railway infrastructure.  There are many proposals to link Dublin Airport with the rail network, but I have not heard anybody mention Shannon Airport for ten years now.  Perhaps one cannot link one without the other because of state aid rules, but that is a different issue.  If Dublin Airport becomes a hub which, undoubtedly, would be good news for the airport, could Shannon Airport also become a hub?  Could it even survive as a transatlantic destination?

Mr. Barrington&rsquo;s shareholding pales in comparison to that of the current chief executive.  Mr. Christoph M&uuml;ller received 1.5 million shares.  Now that Mr. Kavanagh is about to become chief executive officer, will he receive a similar share offering?  Is this standard for chief executive officers?  I am asking this question because I would find it very difficult to make a clear-sighted decision if the difference between one or the other was &euro;765,000.

In reality, what are the possibilities of us having more transatlantic charter flights, even schedule flights?  How feasible is that?  Would Mr. Kavanagh consider it?  Has he considered it as part of what he has agreed regarding this charter flight?  I know the appetite exists.  At the meeting last week I mentioned that, when the previous airline operated a transatlantic flight there, the route did not fail - there were other issues with that airline which caused the overall company to run into difficulty.

Perhaps Mr. Kavanagh could set out the realities of that and give it consideration.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#Q00300","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1388,"content":"<p>There are a lot of questions from the four Deputies.

I do not believe the same level of opportunity exists there because Shannon is not connected to Europe in the way Dublin is, nor will it be.  It is simply a fact that the demand for travel to and from Dublin is exponentially greater than the demand for travel to and from Shannon.  A hub needs connectivity.  The ability to flow passengers through Dublin, and the natural demand through Dublin, is on a different scale.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe that, as it builds out, Dublin will necessarily compete with or cannibalise Shannon.  There is resilient demand in Shannon.  The challenge always has been to profitably serve that demand.  The Dublin to New York route at peak has seven services a day, while Shannon to New York maintains two services a day in competition.  That is demonstrative of the resilience of routes at Shannon where there is demand.  The issue is the opportunity for growth and I see access to Oneworld selling access to other parties.  Actively selling Aer Lingus capacity neutrally can be only beneficial, but I do not see significant growth opportunities in terms of additional routes and frequencies.   It consolidates the opportunity that exists currently.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the basis of the valuation, I believe both the company and its advisers reviewed all of the assets - that was one of the criteria for valuation - as well as the more traditional valuation metrics, future earnings, past earnings, capital employed, etc.  All of the same criteria were used that would be used by the Government advisers in confirming the attractiveness or otherwise of the &euro;2.55 a share valuation.

After we entered a commitment, it was to prove that this vehicle was capable of delivering a sustainable profit and, thus, a sustainable service.<\/p> <p>  I will make a correction.  We never committed to providing a year-round, 365-day service to Boston and New York.  We signed a commercial arrangement with the Shannon Airport Authority that clearly stated the Shannon-New York service would be a nine-month one, with no service in the traditionally heavy loss-making and seasonally weakest first quarter.  Nevertheless, the Shannon-Boston route would be serviced on a 12-month basis.  We have fully met our commitments to the airport and communication at the time.  Be it a miscommunication or otherwise, we never committed to providing a year-round, twice daily service; rather, we committed to maintaining a year-round service.<\/p> <p>  The price of flights in this context could be expected and the consumer has more opportunities and choices.  It is the value proposition that will convert the consumer.  If one loses price competitiveness in an intensely competitive marketplace, one will lose traffic.  For example, Shannon Airport's customers have choices with United Airlines and Delta Airlines.  There is demand for services from the airport.  We should have confidence that there is a natural market between Shannon Airport and North America.  If British Airways or any other enterprise attempts to direct that traffic, competition will fill the vacuum.  That is what we see on a daily basis.  Across the world there are few monopolies in air transportation.  It is becoming transparent and in airlines' interests to maximise revenue, but there is always choice for consumers.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of Dublin Airport and pricing, I will use the San Francisco example.  If a consumer can find a cheaper route via Heathrow Airport, please let him or her make that choice.  We are operating a Dublin-San Francisco route.  Just as there are cheaper ways, in some instances, of getting to San Francisco from Dublin than with Aer Lingus, there are also cheaper ways of getting from Paris to San Francisco, some of which involve Aer Lingus, than using Air France's direct service.

If Aer Lingus is growing at Dublin Airport and has no intention of growing at Shannon Airport, is it not inevitable that Shannon Airport will lose out to Dublin Airport?<br\/><br\/>My second question was specific to the two new transatlantic routes being proposed to the east and west coasts.

In the case of a charter, a number of travel agents or committed parties commit to taking blocks of seats - a far less risky proposition than an airline independently attempting to sell 177 seats itself.  It is a market test and we will learn some things.  The scale from which we have benefited as a result of growth in the past number of years, including the addition of the Boeing 757 to our fleet to complement the wide-body A330s, gives us a greater capacity to trial and compete for business of this kind.  Let us see how it goes.  It was peak summer, it involved competing for very scarce aircraft resources and it won.  We are cautiously optimistic that it can be repeated.  It is a seasonal opportunity, though, and not even close to being a daily one, but it could deliver a service to Knock airport that did not previously exist.

If BA were to begin selling Knock as a destination, that bring us back to the basic point of this proposition, namely, that more people consider Knock as a destination.  Gatwick Airport is British Airways second most important hub.  It does not serve Dublin, Knock, or Belfast from Gatwick.  What Aer Lingus gains is that most powerful player in the UK market with significant loyalty based on a frequent flyer programme, to which Aer Lingus currently does not have access, and a vested interest in selling seats between London and Knock, which does not currently exist.

In the event this particular transaction does not complete, Aer Lingus has its own growth programme but the composition of employment in Aer Lingus will continue to change.  There are some processes within Aer Lingus that over time no longer had value for the customer, or the process has been replaced by automation or various things.  What I can say is that, ultimately, as Aer Lingus grows the level of employment in Aer Lingus will grow but the composition of that employment is dynamic.  A growing Aer Lingus in terms of fleet will ultimately require the workforce to accrue.  We are a relatively lean airline.  We have been through many restructurings in the past 20 years, in stark contrast to many carriers that continue to exist in Europe.  That is how we have managed to withstand fierce competition from a very successful local incumbent.  There will be job losses but there will be job losses in areas that do not add value to the enterprise.  Forgive me for being blunt, but if customers do not value the service, the service does not get produced.  Ultimately, however, there will be more employment opportunities created within the business in other areas.  That is what growth ultimately delivers.  Our proposition is that the growth and the opportunity that can be delivered is much greater under an IAG proposal than on a stand-alone basis but, as I said earlier, that does not invalidate our current business.  It is simply an acceleration of an ability to take full advantage of that opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/EUJ2015021700002#T02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424181600,"counter":1500,"content":"<p>I was listening to Mr. Kavanagh on the Knock episode and I do not think he is over enthusiastic about growing a big service in Knock.

We left this Bill on Second Stage in the D&aacute;il in July 2014.  This was to ensure that we allowed for the member states to consider the legislation under the technical standards process.  This process is now complete and so the Bill can continue its journey through the House.<\/p> <p>  In 2013 I announced the intention to draft legislation to introduce this measure.  The Government approved and fully supported this approach.  At that time Ireland was the first and only country in Europe committed to introducing this measure.  Since that time I am very pleased to say that a number of countries are following Australia and Ireland's example in this regard.  New Zealand is developing legislation.  The UK Government announced its intention in January to proceed with regulations.  France, Norway and Finland have all indicated their intention to consider introducing standardised packaging in the future.<\/p> <p>  Ireland has always been a leader in tobacco control measures.  We can be proud of the path we have forged in the area of tobacco legislation.  We can be proud of the influence we have on other countries to follow us in this regard.  It is important, however, to realise that the battle against these harmful tobacco products is not yet complete and will not be complete until we can significantly reduce the numbers of young people starting to smoke.  Some 12% of children aged between ten and 17 years are reported as current smokers.  While the number of young people smoking has dropped considerably over the years, 12% is an unacceptable figure.<\/p> <p>  Members will have heard the arguments put by the tobacco industry: standardised packaging does not work, it will increase illicit trade, and Ireland should focus on educating young people about the harms of cigarettes.  We know from research that branded tobacco packaging is a critically important part of tobacco promotion.  We know that health warnings are more effective on plain backgrounds.  We know that standardised packs are less attractive and less appealing to consumers, particularly children.  This is a significant evidence base and it is showing us that standardised packaging works.  Evidence from Australia shows it is working.  Evidence from Australia has completely undermined the tobacco industry arguments.  Misrepresentation of evidence by the tobacco industry is a well-recognised tactic.  Another is the threat of legal challenges.  While a legal challenge by the tobacco industry cannot be ruled out - I say that very much with tongue in cheek - I am very confident that the research available to us demonstrates that standardised packaging will have a positive impact on health and that it is a proportionate and justified measure.  The threat of legal challenges should not be an obstacle to progressing public health policies.  We must press on with our mission to make Ireland tobacco-free by 2025.<\/p> <p>  As regards educating our young people about the harms of tobacco, we are already doing this.  Standardised packaging is one of a number of measures which combined will stop our young people smoking.  It is the combination of past, present and future tobacco control measures that will reduce tobacco consumption.  However, standardised packaging is very important as it is the next step in tackling tobacco advertising and promotion specifically.<\/p> <p>  Before we move to deal with the amendments proposed, I wish to indicate that I will be bringing some technical drafting amendments to the Bill on Report Stage.  I thank Members for their participation on Committee Stage.  I look forward to hearing Deputy Billy Kelleher speak on his amendments and the contributions of other members of the committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#A00300","speaker":"952"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1520,"content":"<p>Does any Member wish to make an opening statement?<\/p><p>I would like to make a brief comment.

Some of the initial figures indicate that we are making slow but steady incremental progress and anything that can enhance that is welcome.  Lest there be any doubt, I spoke in the D&aacute;il on the matter on numerous occasions and I put on record the efforts of the Minister when he was Minister for Health, in the context of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union.  The Minister used the platform very effectively in trying to encourage the EU to take a lead in public health.

That is an indication of the urgency with which we view the matter that we should try to bring forward plain packaging and standardisation as quickly as possible to ensure we send out a very strong message to people that we are serious about confronting the nefarious, insidious tobacco industry and that we set a lead and an example.  There might be good reason &ndash; the Minister can elaborate on that &ndash; but I would support the introduction of a blunt deadline in terms of the enactment of the legislation on 20 July 2015.  That would give the industry adequate time to respond.<br\/><br\/>I do not refer to retailers who sell tobacco products in shops in this country, but the international tobacco industry is nefarious and threatening.  It has tried, for example, to usurp the democratically people of Australia and its legislative process.  While the industry has the right to protect its copyright through the courts, our duty must be to the people, in particular young people who might be contemplating experimenting with tobacco, and trying to discourage people from taking it up and to encourage people to give it up.  That is the reason I have tabled the amendment.

This is one of a number of measures, some already implemented and other hopefully to follow, that will ultimately lead to a significant reduction in the number of people who smoke and further dissuade people from taking up smoking at an early age.<\/p> <p>  The little box I hold in my hand has been circulated as an example of what plain packaged cigarettes will look like.  It is important for people to recognise and realise that when we talk about plain packaging that it is going to be a white box.  It is not a white box, it is a very stark and unattractive product by any standard.  Any examination of it will confirm that.  What I have in my hand would not be an attractive device in terms of marketing the contents, quite the contrary.  For that reason alone it is a further aid to the process we all support, namely, a significant reduction in current smoker numbers and an even greater if at all possible reduction in the number of young people who take up the habit, so sadly, at a very early age, and with all the difficulties of giving up the habit.  I am open to the spirit of what Deputy Kelleher has said and I await the Minister&rsquo;s response on the practicalities of the proposition.<\/p><p>At the outset, I thank both speakers for their support.  I understand that Deputy Kelleher&rsquo;s proposals are meant in the best possible way and I fully accept the bona fides of his support.  Few people would be more enthusiastic than I to expedite the impact of the legislation but given the letter on the Chairman&rsquo;s desk and the letters that are in circulation, everybody involved in the area is not one bit surprised about the tactics of the tobacco industry.  I take the advice of the Attorney General on these matters.  The amendment suggested by Deputy Kelleher proposes to shorten the transition period allowed for in the Bill.  The transition provisions as outlined in the Bill allow retailers and manufacturers time to comply with the new measures.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=HE1&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Current packets may be manufactured until May 2016 and there will then be a one-year period in which to sell outstanding stocks.  Non-compliant retail packaging may not be manufactured from May 2016 and may not be sold after May 2017.<\/p><p> The introduction of standardised packaging in Ireland is a proportionate public health measure.  It is very important when introducing such measures that steps are taken to give the industry advance notice of the details of the measures.  Any reduction in the transitional period may undermine the State's arguments regarding the proportionality of this Bill.  The transitional times outlined in the Bill are in line with those set out in the EU 2014 tobacco products directive.  Provisions in that directive are essential elements to the success of standardised packaging.  The new tobacco directive provides for larger graphic warnings that are to be displayed on the front and back of packs.  The European Commission has developed a new library of images which cannot be introduced prior to 20 May 2016.  With this in mind, it is deemed reasonable to allow for all the changes required under the standardised packaging legislation and the new tobacco products directive to be introduced within the same timeframes.<\/p><p> As members know, the UK Government recently announced its decision to introduce regulations for standardised packaging.  Similar to Ireland, these regulations will come into force at the same time as the tobacco products directive, in May 2016.  The UK's regulations will also allow the same transitional time as the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Bill, which is until 2017.<\/p><p> I understand the Deputy, like me, would like the legislation commenced sooner rather than later, as I have said.  However, in the interests of introducing proportionate measures, there is an obligation on the State to allow reasonable time for the industry, first, to prepare for the new measure and, second, to allow for the sale of old stock.  On this basis, I regret I am unable to accept these amendments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#B00700","speaker":"969","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1531,"content":"<p>I accept the Minister's statement that, on the advice of the Attorney General, we must be seen to be acting proportionately and that the industry must have time to respond.

Companies want to be able to stand out from the crowd on the shelf when selling a product.  There is an issue with regard to the shape and size of a tobacco product or the packaging.  We know there has been a move towards different sizes and types of boxes; for example, there is a lipstick-style box and so-called nano packaging.  These are primarily targeted at young females in society.  Companies obviously would make a calculated decision in the research context that these slim or extended packs are attractive and encourage young women and girls to start smoking.  We want to make the regulation as watertight as possible and I know the Minister has already thought of this.  I would be failing in my duty if I did not raise this in the context of existing concerns.  These packs could diminish what the legislation is trying to achieve, which is to make cigarettes bland and unattractive so as not to stand out from the crowd.  It is about ensuring that people are aware of the harm they will cause if consumed.  The deficiency in the legislation which could allow for those lipstick-type and nano packages on the shelves could lead to this being a retrograde step.  The tobacco companies have plenty of finance for research and I am sure they will move to this area very quickly.  One can see, even if one is not out too late, cigarettes from such packages being consumed primarily by younger female smokers.

We are talking about individual cigarettes as opposed to the packet.  We suggest that while manufacturers can put an alpha-numeric code on a cigarette nothing else should be allowed on it.  When plain packaging and standardised packaging is introduced, is there anything to stop tobacco companies from putting anything other than an alpha-numeric code on individual cigarettes?  I am concerned that manufacturers could present cigarettes in such a way that they would be enticing and that they would stand out from other cigarettes.  Has any thought been given to the matter of individual cigarettes?  While we will have a standardised package and graphic details showing the damage smoking can cause, once a pack is open and a cigarette is extracted is it not possible that manufacturers could put advertising on individual cigarettes?

The concern is that a young person may start out by vaping, thinking it is harmless.  It may be harmless in the context of not damaging his or her health initially but he or she may become addicted to nicotine.

I am loth to get into this because it is not part of the Bill.  Having said that, I am very concerned about e-cigarettes and their availability to people under 18 years.  I am very concerned that they would be used to sell a lifestyle and to normalise the habit of smoking, which is something we are trying to de-normalise to protect our children.  We made a tactical strategic decision some time back not to put the two Bills together because the evidence around e-cigarettes was not as certain as the evidence that tobacco is detrimental to the people who consume it.  Facts are beginning to emerge and the information from America is that there have been more than 200 admissions of young people to hospital because of overdosing on nicotine and messing around with cartridges.  One of the entries in the Young Scientist Exhibition, and I apologise to the young lady from Derry whose name I cannot recall, was a project on tobacco substitutes that found that the product was labelled as having a certain number of milligrams per ml but on analysis some of them had up to 60 times as much as was advertised on the packet.  There are inherent dangers and I am very keen to have this area regulated.  I do not believe that e-cigarettes should be available outside of a pharmacy or under the direction of a pharmacist as an aid to cease smoking.  They should not be sold outside of that.  That is a matter for the Oireachtas and for the Minister for Health and me to discuss further, particularly the issue of them being classified as illegal.  I am absolutely clear that they should not be legally available to children and people under 18.<\/p> <p>  I do not mean to be trite, but on the issue of whether it is possible under the regulations of 2002 Act, I do not propose to change the Bill in respect of cigars or pipe tobacco.  In response to Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who spoke extensively on pipe tobacco, I make the following points.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Deputy James Reilly:<\/span--><!--a href=\"http:\/\/www.oireachtas.ie\/members-hist\/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2180\"><img src=\"..\/images\/info.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Information on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--a href=\"..\/zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=HE1&amp;amp;memberid=2180&amp;amp;pid=DrJamesReilly&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=17\"><img src=\"..\/images\/zoom.gif\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Zoom on Deputy James Reilly\"\/><\/a--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Members will remember that pipes were the first to be banned in cinemas and on aeroplanes because of the extensive smoke emanating from them.  If we cast our minds back to the role that the current Leader of the Opposition had in achieving the smoking ban in public places, the core principle was to protect workers from the harmful carcinogenic effect of environmental smoke and tobacco products.  Pipe tobacco is very much to the fore in that area and it would make no sense to me for it not to be included in this directive.  Some people may argue they do not inhale the smoke but the incidence of mouth, lip and throat cancers related to pipe smoking is well known.  One may argue that young people are not taking up that type of smoking and would not be likely to do so, but I would quibble with that.  If the vast billions of euro in the tobacco industry were focused on advertising this as a lifestyle choice, there could be unimaginable instruments for the consumption of pipe tobacco, and we would be amazed how quickly it might take off.  I have no intention of excluding that element.<\/p><p> Who in this room could possibly believe that one of the most advanced societies in Europe currently has a tobacco product that involves a person cutting one's gum and shoving tobacco under the lip to absorb it?  That country is Sweden.  Sales of snus, as it is referred to, continue to be substantial.  It is excluded from Europe's tobacco directive, as a compromise had to be made.  Do not underestimate the ability of the tobacco industry to attract people to its product through new and innovative methods.  As I have indicated here and in many other places, if there is a choice between jobs or lives, the choice will always be for lives.  I hope I have addressed the issues in a way that does not cause the committee to think we are not on the same page.  We all want to protect children from taking up this habit and we want to help those who become addicted to get away from this killer habit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#E00600","speaker":"952","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1577,"content":"<p>I assure the Minister that my questioning had nothing to do with encouraging the return of pipe tobacco smoking in any variety of settings where smoking is currently illegal.

We really welcome the opportunity to set out our views on this very important issue.<\/p> <p>  I will start by stating our position very clearly.  My own and the Aer Lingus board's strongly held view is that a combination of Aer Lingus with IAG has a compelling strategic rationale and will deliver significant benefits to Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus's employees, Aer Lingus's customers and Ireland.  The board has concluded, based on advice from our financial advisers, that the price of &euro;2.55 per share should be recommended to shareholders.  <\/p> <p>  In recent weeks, we have listened carefully to the public debate regarding IAG's proposal.  During this period we have had further detailed discussions with representatives of IAG and the Aer Lingus board now has a greater understanding of IAG's intentions for the future of Aer Lingus and the proposed commitments IAG is prepared to make in regard to Aer Lingus to the Irish Government.  <\/p> <p>  These discussions have further confirmed that it is clearly in IAG's interest to continue to grow Aer Lingus within the IAG group. Aer Lingus being part of IAG represents a hugely positive opportunity for Aer Lingus and Ireland. This deal is about accelerated growth.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Stephen Kavanagh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This deal is about accelerated growth.  It provides real prospects for growth in Aer Lingus, the economy, global connectivity, international trade, tourism and employment.  I am surprised it can be represented in any other way.  It is on the basis of these understandings that I and the Aer Lingus board give our strong support to the proposed transaction.  The Aer Lingus team met last week with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the interdepartmental group established by the Minister.  We set out the board's view on the benefits of the proposed deal.  I will summarise these meetings regarding the benefits of IAG's proposal and key commercial drivers.  The proposal is viewed by the board as compelling and a significantly positive opportunity for Aer Lingus, its employees, its customers and Ireland.  Aer Lingus as part of IAG will enhance Ireland's position as a natural hub linking Europe and North America.  Ireland's location as the westernmost point in Europe makes it a natural gateway to connect the combined populations of Europe and North America.  Aer Lingus believes IAG's proposal can enable Ireland to become a central hub for European traffic across the Atlantic, resulting in better utilisation of the infrastructure investment in Irish airports. <\/p><p> The market between Europe and North America is about 75 million people per annum.  Increasing our share of this traffic, which is currently at 2%, to even 4 or 5% would mean bringing an additional 1 to 2 million passengers per year through Ireland, which would have huge positive benefits for Aer Lingus and its employees and for Irish airports and their employees and a myriad of ancillary support services.  With Aer Lingus as part of the IAG group, there would potential for the planned growth in transatlantic traffic to be significantly accelerated, with new US destinations added to its network.  There is an immediate prospect of accelerating our plans to open two new destinations in North America, one on the east coast and one on the west coast.  <\/p><p> Aer Lingus as part of IAG will deliver employment growth.  Initial transatlantic traffic and destination growth will create significant numbers of new jobs in Ireland. The new routes would require the acquisition of two more long-range aircraft and would provide at least two hundred direct and highly skilled jobs in Aer Lingus.  A multiple of this number would be employed in support services in the general economy and in the tourism sector.  Being part of IAG will enhance Aer Lingus's European growth.  Aer Lingus short-haul services, including the Dublin, Cork and Shannon to London Heathrow routes, will directly benefit from the sales and marketing activity conducted on its behalf by British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and the Oneworld partner sales forces.  This will strengthen the positions of the Cork and Shannon to Heathrow routes and provide additional visitor traffic to the southern and mid-west regions and the rest of the country.  Irish tourism will also benefit from greater exposure to the frequent flyer programme of Oneworld members, particularly British Airways and American Airlines.   <\/p><p> Expected benefits to Aer Lingus's Atlantic and European network, if Aer Lingus were part of IAG, include better connectivity to and from Ireland.  Being part of IAG will also allow greater access to a global cargo network.  Aer Lingus's cargo business will benefit from the global network reach and sales channels of IAG cargo business.  The cargo network enhancement is expected to deliver significant benefits and additional options to Irish businesses, particularly the pharmaceutical sector.  <\/p><p> Aer Lingus as part of IAG will be a separate operating business and the Aer Lingus brand will continue and flourish.  Aer Lingus has confirmed IAG's intentions to preserve Aer Lingus as a separately operating business within the group, with its own brand, management, head office and operations.  Willie Walsh confirmed this strongly and publicly to this committee last week.<\/p><p> It is the strong view of the Aer Lingus board that the prospect of Aer Lingus being part of IAG has compelling, strategic and commercial logic for Aer Lingus.  It would have significantly positive benefits for Aer Lingus and for Ireland, and the board is strongly supportive of the Government's two-airline policy.  Following a combination with IAG, Aer Lingus will have more attractive growth options that will significantly benefit Aer Lingus as a company, its employees, its customers, the tourism sector, Irish business and industry and the airports where Aer Lingus operates.<\/p><p> We are fully aware of concerns expressed by political parties.  Aer Lingus is willing to meet individual parties in order to clarify our position further.  We believe this is a very good opportunity for Aer Lingus and Ireland.  I hope we can give it the collective support it needs and deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Barrington","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1602,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kavanagh.

I will start by introducing Stobart Air, formerly Aer Arann.  Stobart Air is a franchise flying specialist flying for three airlines: Aer Lingus, Flybe and CityJet.  We employ 430 people, an increase of 100 in the past four years.  Our airline is all about high frequency, regional connectivity and feeding passengers into onward air journeys.  The Aer Lingus-Stobart Air partnership, which we operate under the Aer Lingus Regional banner, is proof of what can be achieved when a small airline partners with a larger one.  The partnership started in 2010 and now operates 25 routes to and from 18 airports across Ireland, the UK and France.  Aer Lingus Regional has increased its annual passenger numbers from 855,000 to 1.3 million in 2014, a 53% increase in just over four years.  In the coming weeks we will fly our five millionth passenger.  Aer Lingus Regional now contributes 12% of Aer Lingus overall passengers.  The partnership is testament to the commercial relationship between our airlines.  We have extended our contract to 2022.  It is also testament to how far we have come from the brink of bankruptcy just over four years ago. We have broadened our route network, invested &euro;150 million in new aircraft, increased our passenger numbers and added to our workforce.  The returns from our partnership are evident when you consider how Aer Lingus Regional feeds passengers to the Aer Lingus transatlantic route.  The combination of Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Regional and the US immigration pre-clearance in Ireland is a massive advantage that no other country enjoys.  Last year approximately 100,000 of our passengers arrived at Dublin, completed US pre-clearance and boarded an Aer Lingus transatlantic service to the US, or they arrived from one of Aer Lingus's North American services and boarded our aircraft to Dublin to connect onward.  The advantages this offers consumers are significant.  People can save up to two hours on a journey.  Passengers also avoid the hassle of more queues on arrival at US airports.  Nearly 100,000 transatlantic connections in 2014 is an 80% increase in just four years.  It is a core part of our business. It delivers the passengers Aer Lingus needs to expand its North American network.  Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus Regional will continue to increase transatlantic business.  It is our belief that if IAG takes over Aer Lingus this growth could be achieved faster and on a larger scale.  From a UK perspective, how can we get UK-originating passengers to choose Dublin instead of London, Paris or Amsterdam when travelling to the US?  Last year, 4.3 million people travelled to London Heathrow from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds Bradford, Manchester and Newcastle.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Sean Brogan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These are all cities that Aer Lingus currently serves.

In 2014, Aer Lingus Regional carried 9,000 Newcastle passengers to or from the US through Dublin.  A further 300,000 passengers from Newcastle used Heathrow, not Dublin, as their connecting point.  These are passengers that Aer Lingus should win.  As part of IAG, Aer Lingus can win them.  Being part of a global airline family would fast-track the realisation of this opportunity.  This would help our airline to expand, meaning more aircraft and more jobs.  Aer Lingus would benefit from the passenger increase, as would Irish airports.  The overall economy would also benefit, particularly from more inbound US tourists.<\/p><p>  Consumers want choice and convenience, particularly when it comes to air traffic.  Consumers like the convenience of one website visit, one click to book, one check-in, straight through from start to finish on their journey.  An Aer Lingus alliance with IAG would realise these benefits for Irish consumers.  To drive and survive, airlines must constantly seek out and secure new opportunities.  Stobart Air believes that the IAG offer is such an opportunity.  The partnership of Stobart Air with a larger airline has enabled it to grow and has delivered significant consumer and employment benefits to the economy.  I believe the same can be replicated on an even larger scale if Aer Lingus joins forces with IAG.  That is why Stobart Air is backing the IAG bid for Aer Lingus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Brogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1605,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brogan.  Both Mr. Kavanagh and Mr. Brogan have said in their presentations that a successful IAG bid to take over Aer Lingus would have a positive outcome.  Mr. Barrington referred to 200 new jobs based on new transatlantic traffic; last week Mr. Walsh suggested 500 new jobs.  Could Mr. Barrington comment on this figure?  The important issues are jobs, connectivity, and growth.  If the IAG bid to take over Aer Lingus is not successful, is there still a possibility of growth?  Are there any disadvantages to a successful bid by IAG to take over Aer Lingus?  Will the growth be limited to Dublin Airport?  What about growth in Shannon, Cork, and the regional airports?  Coming from the west of Ireland, I have a particular interest in Ireland West Airport Knock.  Mr. Kavanagh has been instrumental in organising a transatlantic flight to and from Knock, which will begin in summer 2015.

I was specifically referring to the prospect of Aer Lingus operating services to two new destinations, one on both the east and west coast of the United States.  Those two new destinations would require one more aircraft each and that would mean approximately 100 new jobs per aircraft.  Over the next five years, between now and 2020, we could see the more than 500 direct jobs that Mr. Walsh referred to last week.  Aer Lingus could increase its current transatlantic fleet from 10 aircraft to close to 20 aircraft, and if those targets were achieved more than 500 jobs would be created in total.  I believe Mr. Walsh was referring to what IAG might add to the two new services proposed by Aer Lingus.

Having had discussions with representatives of IAG and, indeed, listened to their contribution to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, it is apparent that IAG shares the same view as to the value of these opportunities; hence the proposal.  What is the opportunity?  Aer Lingus carried 1.3 million customers across the Atlantic last year and one in three of those customers was travelling between Europe and North America.  That additional business provided Aer Lingus with the ability to grow and sustain the frequency of existing services between Dublin or Shannon and North America.  Without that access to Europe and North American traffic, Aer Lingus would not be able to sustain the existing shape of the Aer Lingus transatlantic service.<\/p> <p>  That traffic also has a positive contribution to our short-haul network.  Simply put, if a passenger is travelling between Boston and Paris, Aer Lingus carries them to Dublin on the Atlantic aircraft.  It supports our connectivity to the UK and Europe and complements the natural demand between Ireland and the UK and Europe.  Aer Lingus sees this on a standalone basis as something that will allow it to grow into the future.  It will be challenging.  It is not without risk, given the scale of Aer Lingus and the shocks that are a feature of the aviation business.  However, it is a strategy that, as one can see from our financial results in recent years, has worked.  Aer Lingus believes that the geographic advantages that Ireland delivers in this regard are central to the proposition.  Rather than viewing Ireland's remote island status on the western periphery of Europe as a disadvantage, in this particular instance it is a key advantage.  It is an advantage from the customer's perspective because the time to traverse the Atlantic through Dublin is faster.  From an airline's perspective, the quicker the journey, the lower the cost.  The geography gives us natural economic advantages in serving the market.  The State has made the appropriate investments in terms of airport infrastructure.  The customs and border patrol facilities at Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport give Aer Lingus an added advantage.  <\/p> <p>   What is the additional opportunity with regard to IAG?  It is, in essence, scale.  Aer Lingus by itself will fight for its place in the market.  It has done so for close to 80 years and it will continue to do so.  What IAG brings to Aer Lingus is the ability to join forces; particularly in the Atlantic joint business, to have four airlines selling Aer Lingus seats as if they were their own allows Aer Lingus to compete.  It allows Aer Lingus to have more confidence in terms of the number of customers it can reach.  It allows Aer Lingus to have more confidence in terms of the costs to those customers because of the economies of scale.  Ultimately, it de-risks expansion for Aer Lingus.  The approach of four airlines selling jointly will accelerate opportunities that it would otherwise be challenging for Aer Lingus to exploit on its own.  This is a fast-track approach.  <\/p> <p>   The positives from an Aer Lingus perspective are not just to do with the Atlantic.  As I referenced earlier, those passengers have to be flown from the UK and Europe, hence the partnership with Stobart Air.  One hundred thousand customers use Stobart Air services.  More than 300,000 customers use Aer Lingus mainline transatlantic services from Dublin and Shannon.  Those services will be positively impacted not just by the incremental flow across the Atlantic but, further, by membership of the Oneworld alliance, as proposed by IAG, because in that instance there would be 15 global airlines selling seats to Shannon and Cork and Dublin.  So Aer Lingus sees the benefits in terms of the opportunity for accelerated growth.  In the absence of such a deal, the challenges will remain but there will be fewer opportunities and higher risks.  That scenario has direct implications for the confidence with which investment can be made.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Stephen Kavanagh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those are the circumstances under which we have no hesitation in recommending the proposal on the basis that it would be positive for Aer Lingus shareholders, for employees, for all stakeholders and ultimately for Ireland Inc. in terms of utilising the geographical advantages and retaining that economic opportunity within this economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1609,"content":"<p>What about the growth in Dublin <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>growth in the regions, including the regional airports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#D00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424190600,"counter":1610,"content":"<p>The growth will flow to all elements of the Aer Lingus network.

If British Airways is supplemented by the ability of all Oneworld members to sell seats on behalf of Aer Lingus between London and Shannon, there are no circumstances, from our analysis, on the basis of having more potential customers in a more cost-effective manner, under which the viability of the network is in any way compromised or less benefited than in the IAG proposal.

There is opportunity in airports we service from Aberdeen to Edinburgh to Glasgow and right down through the UK.  We are taking passengers who select Aer Lingus, as opposed to the IAG platform, which would offer much greater exposure.

I will be as quick as possible, because there are quite a few questions.  To clarify the issue that was raised regarding 200 versus 500 jobs, my understanding was that when Mr. Walsh was asked what he intended to bring to Aer Lingus, he said the contribution would be in terms of sales and supporting the efforts of Aer Lingus Regional to support its strategy, which was to deploy or to put on the fleet one wide-bodied aircraft per year for the next five years.  That is at variance with what Mr. Barrington has said, but maybe he can clarify that.<\/p> <p>  I listened with interest to what Mr. Barrington had to say.  He twice reminded us that this was the right strategic decision from a commercial point of view for Aer Lingus, for its employees, for its customers and for Ireland.  The only thing he has left out from that is the shareholders.  I would have thought that, as chairperson of the company, his primary objective was to work in the interest of the shareholders.  I am not sure where he stands on that.  He might help us to understand.  There has been some media comment about the directors of the company and how they, together with some senior management, will share in a &euro;30 million pot, some kind of bonus disbursal, as a result of the sale.  Maybe he could talk to us about that.  I would have liked to see before us today some of the independent directors on his board and be able to interact with them.  I would also have liked to see the directors appointed by the State, who, while they have a fiduciary duty to the company, also have a mandate from the Government to look at the broader regional aspects to the company's overall strategic direction.  Maybe Mr. Barrington can comment to some extent on that.<\/p> <p>  If this deal goes through, will there be an independent Aer Lingus board?  Mr. Kavanagh talked about management, head office, etc.  Will there be a board?  What has been going on in Aer Lingus?  Has there been long-term strategic planning or have the directors been working towards this day?  Has Aer Lingus been courting IAG or somebody in IAG's league?  Has it always been, in recent years, just about getting to a point at which the directors dispose of the airline, get their exit strategy and get to share that &euro;30 million pot?  I see a level of confusion between what the witnesses are telling me and what Willie Walsh tells me is their long-term strategy. If Mr. Brogan's interaction with them has been so successful, why have we not heard of Aer Lingus developing its own growth strategy as a relatively small independent operator?  My understanding was that there was an alliance with another airline about being able to buy aircraft relatively competitively.  If there was a long-term strategy, could it not have been achieved through a strategic link-up with IAG, rather than a capitulation or a sell-out?  Could Aer Lingus not have attempted to paddle its own canoe, to develop a strategic alliance whereby all the benefits that have been mentioned would still be there and would flow to the benefit of the company, the employees, the shareholders, and more importantly, this island nation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#D00600","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424190600,"counter":1614,"content":"<p>I will deal with some of those questions and perhaps Mr. Kavanagh might deal with some others.

We are not invalidating our current strategy.  The issue is the balance of opportunity, which will be increased, and risk, which will decrease.  That balance of opportunity and risk determines investment.  Both parties have a common view as to the level of the opportunity but our capacity to exploit that opportunity is reduced independently than it would be as part of IAG.  That is the just the reality of the position.  The committee should not take the view that we do not believe that we have a robust business that is capable of generating returns for shareholders and stakeholders.  That is not the stated position.  We are encouraged by the level of increased opportunity, which will generate incremental jobs.  That is an inevitability and they will be more sustainable as a result because they will be built on stronger foundations.  They will be high end, direct jobs ranging from pilots and cabin crew to engineers.  They will not just be incremental as there will be more promotion opportunities for colleagues are working in the enterprise.<\/p> <p>  Aer Lingus can realistically survive.  It has realistically survived thus far, although it is more challenged than ever because of the global nature of competition.  We serve the island and if we can continue to have that mindset, we will be increasingly vulnerable because that is a constrained market in terms of opportunity.  The opportunity for us is to compete and bring to the Europe-north America marketplace what we have been successfully doing for the Irish consumer and for those wishing to visit Ireland for the past 80 years.  That it the challenge.  The risk appetite is stopping us, and not just our personal risk appetite as we have to generate a return on other people's capital.  That return is more difficult to generate than the alternative within IAG but it does not preclude that investment.  It is then about the pace of that investment and, ultimately, the sustainability of that investment.<\/p> <p>  We are comfortable that we can get beyond 2%.  On a report in terms of competitive standings in Europe, one will go a long way before one will find 2% and, therefore, in many ways we are not relevant.  Once one becomes relevant, one becomes open to competition and to the challenges of what the large consolidated global carriers can do and that leaves us vulnerable.  It is a challenge we are up to.  We will continue to manage the costs in our business and to invest in the product but, undoubtedly, it is an additional challenge.  All this is simply a way of saying that the opportunity that the IAG proposal brings will be accelerated but also more sustainable growth.  The greatest protection any slot can have is sustainable profitability of the service provider that utilises it.  It is as simple as that.  We operate in the market.  The slots, as they are currently deployed, make a contribution.  Aer Lingus's primary role is to connect Ireland to the world.  Connecting Ireland to London is central to our product offering.  We are going nowhere on Cork, Shannon and Dublin to Heathrow Airport, but continued investment and competition is the greatest guarantee.  The capability of having One World partners and IAG partners selling those routes gives us added confidence that their sustainability can be only improved in that scenario.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#F00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1640,"content":"<p>Last week Mr. Walsh referred to administrative job losses in the headquarters in Dublin.

We have partners who will actively sell Shannon.  Rather than having to make those decisions knowing that we will compromise, the objective is to have more demand than we have seats.  Ultimately, this is every airline planner's objective and this is what the proposed transaction brings to Aer Lingus.

We have heard various opinions from the different groups that have attended this committee, but the overall opinion of people on the street is that Aer Lingus is doing well, passenger numbers are increasing, it is a modern airline and the hotel side and tourism are thriving and steadily and improving.  Why then would we look at trying to sell off an airline that seems to be doing well and making progress, albeit at a slow pace?  A slow pace is good.  Representatives from Stobart have said their business has grown 40% or 50%.  What more would one want?  Gradual improvement at that rate is steady progress.<br\/><br\/>What is lacking here is vision.  If I were CEO of Aer Lingus, I would be saying that I want to grow the airline on its own, for the shareholders, the State and everyone, and that is what I would be pushing for.  Senior executives stand to make money on their shares if Aer Lingus is sold.  I see this as a conflict of interest in the context of making a judgment and being objective.  In objective terms, they would say they should push ahead and work at growing the airline on a steady basis and open up routes.  This is happening and more connectivity is being developed.  I believe this is the way Aer Lingus should be going.<br\/><br\/>In regard to Stobart, what does it stand to gain financially in terms of shares?  Earlier we heard Aer Lingus is unsure how much senior executives will get.  I find that difficult to believe.  I am sure the board has a clear picture of how much each individual and each executive will get.  I would love to know how much Stobart stands to get.  Are pensions of both Aer Lingus and Stobart members involved in any deal?  Are Aer Lingus pensions invested in this?  What good is a five-year guarantee when we have a steady business that is making progress?<br\/><br\/>I found it interesting that Mr. Walsh mentioned the guarantees.  In an article in <i>The Guardian<\/i>last year or the previous year, he mentioned the main issue was long flights and that the slots in Heathrow were very important in this regard.  The 23 Aer Lingus slots are extremely important in the context of expanding business.  Is Aer Lingus aware that when the deal was made with the Spanish airline Iberia in 2011, more than 4,500 people were made redundant and even now more of that airline's staff are being laid off?  Can we accept the word of an organisation that is laying off people as we speak and that says it will create jobs?  We are told there is a possibility of 1,200 jobs being lost immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#G00200","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424190600,"counter":1648,"content":"<p>To repeat, Aer Lingus is successful by many measures.  This is testament to the efforts of many people over a long period.  What is under consideration here is an accelerated opportunity, an opportunity that may never be achievable on a stand alone basis.  That opportunity and valuation was part of the analysis and consideration of the proposal from IAG and we believe it fairly reflects the valuation and future potential of the business.<\/p> <p>  On why we would sell off Aer Lingus, I do not see it as a sell-off.  We are a plc.  What we are recommending is an ability to accelerate the value creation.  That is where not just shareholders, but stakeholders, employees and Ireland maintains a benefit.  The world does not stop to allow Aer Lingus to grow.  We carried 11 million customers in 2014, more than any time in our history, yet we do not make the top 50 carriers worldwide.  That is the nature of the business we compete in.  Increasingly, the airline business will consolidate.  There are significant economies of scale and significant cost benefits from having major fleets and significant revenue benefits from having global reach and partnership.  This is something we simply cannot ignore, albeit that - not waving a white flag - we have a solid business based on good fundamentals.  What is up for consideration here is the incremental opportunity.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the comparison or contrast with Iberia, first, I believe IAG sees the value inherent in the Aer Lingus strategy in terms of the opportunity to grow Ireland as a natural hub for transatlantic traffic.  Aer Lingus is a profitable business that has gone through many restructurings.  When British Airways and Iberia combined, Iberia was a deeply troubled business that needed to be restructured.  It is not comparable in any way to what IAG would be investing in if it was to secure Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus is a growth vehicle for IAG.  It is a &euro;1.4 billion investment from British Airways and IAG.  This is not an investment that will be recouped by redirecting passengers through Heathrow.  It is an investment that will be recovered and grown by exploiting the opportunity that exists for Aer Lingus, Dublin, Shannon and Cork to have a larger share of the Europe to North America market.<\/p> <p>  The inevitability of some back office support functions being lost is indisputable.  This is one of the rationales and is why consolidation is such a feature of the industry.  However, the opportunity here is the amount of direct employment that will be delivered from the growth, particularly of transatlantic capable aircraft, but also because of the support activities and because of the services provided not only by the airport but the businesses based on it and the spin-off.  Simply, having more access to the island generates more inbound tourism.  This has a significant indirect positive impact on levels of employment.<\/p> <p>  We have taken the time to consider deeply the implications of this offer.  The board and the executive management team are very conscious of the implications and the interests of stakeholders.  We have no hesitation in recommending the offer because we intuitively believe it is positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424190600,"counter":1649,"content":"<p>I wish to make just one comment.

That has happened and we have now started to fly with Flybe and CityJet.  The IAG proposal would allow us to continue that expansion but to express it.  We will continue to grow.  Aer Lingus Regional will only grow so far but Stobart Air will continue to grow and will continue to do so in a managed way.

Etihad owns Alitalia, while British Airways itself is owned by IAG.  This is a global business.

I congratulate Mr. Kavanagh on his appointment and I wish him the best of luck.  We have heard a lot of testimony over the past few weeks.  Some of it shows that Aer Lingus has been operating under good management and is a profitable and growing company.  IAG will benefit from the takeover of Aer Lingus.  This is a change in the trend.  Iberia was really struggling and would have been a target for a takeover, as I imagine the balance sheet was not very strong.  With a strong brand and much potential, it would have been a realistic target for a takeover.  Aer Lingus is in a different place and is still growing, albeit at a slower pace than if the IAG takeover occurs.<\/p> <p>  I link that to the testimony of Mr. Brogan.  The relationship that Stobart Air and Aer Lingus Regional has with Aer Lingus has been hugely beneficial to his company.  I draw a comparison between that situation and Iberia and IAG.  In the case of Aer Lingus, it is completely different as it is a growing company in a takeover.  It is not a company on its own and there are codeshares.  Perhaps the witnesses can give me an idea of what this means for Aer Lingus if IAG is not in the room.  What does the codeshare with Star Alliance and Sky Team bring to Aer Lingus in terms of a global reach for consumers?<\/p> <p>  Equally, we can talk about the economies of scale that may be beneficial in the case of a takeover by IAG of Aer Lingus.  Can we hear about the benefits of the interline agreements with Etihad Airways, JetBlue and United Airlines, particularly in terms of procurement?  How will this change and what is the relative benefit of IAG becoming involved?  The IAG investment is &euro;1.4 billion.  This is the amount of funding on the table.  The company will not get it back from the Irish consumer.  The money will get a return from European and north American consumers and there will be only a marginal return in this country, based on a relative increase in activity.  Perhaps the witnesses will clarify how this will benefit the Irish consumer or the State in terms of an increase and how to link this to Aer Lingus growing on a faster and larger scale and the 6 million people living on this island, north and south.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#J00900","speaker":"995"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1667,"content":"<p>Mr. Kavanagh mentioned the benefit of four airlines jointly selling seats on the same aircraft using a partnership approach.

If IAG takes over Aer Lingus and begins to sell seats for British Airways on the same aircraft to New York, customers should be informed.

With a public listed company of its size, that is always going to be a fact of commercial life because there are rational reasons consolidation will continue to be a feature of the industry.  We have mutually beneficial relationships with a number of partners.

British Airways is the company that did this and Aer Lingus is inviting it in as its partner in Ireland.  It is not that company's record in Scotland according to the Government there.<br\/><br\/>I need all of the documentation on the slots.  It seems that in respect of the High Court judgment in London last Thursday, Aer Lingus was stating one thing here and another in the United Kingdom.  To quote from the judgment:<blockquote>Many of the potential competitive effects of the transaction that we considered [that is whether Ryanair should be a partner] would manifest themselves in terms of the absence of an action that might otherwise have been taken by Aer Lingus (for example, Aer Lingus being prevented from combining with another airline [which is what we are talking about today] or from disposing of Heathrow slots in the context of optimizing its route network and timetable).<\/blockquote>Was that case made by Aer Lingus in the UK courts?  How, otherwise, did their Lordships include it in the judgment?  Were we trying to dispose of the slots when we were fighting the Ryanair case in the English courts while promising here on the very same day to retain the Heathrow Airport slots?

It has identified London Heathrow, Madrid and Dublin Airport as the three hubs that are central to IAG competing for a share.  The impact on Scotland, the history of British Airways and the competitive dynamic in that marketplace are not matters on which I can comment.  What I can say is Scotland is a significant source market for Aer Lingus in transiting passengers between Scotland and North America.  I see no reason that would change.  In fact, it would improve in terms of our opportunity to compete in that marketplace.  Not only would we have British Airways selling Dublin on a neutral basis from Scotland, we would also have American Airlines selling seats to Scotland via Dublin Airport.<\/p> <p>  The issue for IAG from our analysis is competing for more of a share in the Europe to North America marketplace.  It is not a case of simply adding Aer Lingus to the IAG group and leaving it at that.  This is about growing the business.  It is about passengers choosing part of the product offering by IAG and its Atlantic joint business partner, rather than choosing to travel on United Airlines from Edinburgh.  This is about IAG diagnosing that the value proposition from Aer Lingus is capable of being competitive, that there is a growth opportunity and that ultimately two plus two equals five.<\/p> <p>  On preventing the disposal of slots, I have said the greatest protection slots have is delivering a sustainable economic return.  In circumstances where that is not possible, it is, of course, at the discretion of the State to purchase slots or to introduce a PSO to ensure connectivity.  Aer Lingus is a commercial enterprise.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Stephen Kavanagh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->As a commercial enterprise, one of the issues with the Ryanair shareholding was that some of the commercial decisions would have been conflicted and restricted.  This is not to say Aer Lingus has immediate plans to dispose of slots.  As I said, the slots are core to the Aer Lingus customer proposition, given that Ireland-Heathrow is one of the busiest air routes on the globe.  It is also core to the British Airways network that Ireland retain its connectivity.  Shannon and Cork airports are key source routes for long-haul flow through Heathrow Airport.  The basic proposition is that the opportunity is to grow Dublin Airport as a hub.  This would benefit Aer Lingus and, ultimately, IAG because IAG would increase its share in the Europe to North America marketplace.

While they are strong, mutually beneficial relationships, there is not necessarily full alignment of mutual interests.  If United Airlines is selling a ticket between Chicago and Dublin, its first commercial instinct is to keep the customer in its own metal.  It will, therefore, attempt to direct the customer to Heathrow Airport and on to an Aer Lingus service from there to Dublin.  That is the natural conflict in the current code-share relationships.  The difference between such a relationship and the one suggested in IAG's proposal is that American Airlines would have an aligned and equivalent economic interest in selling a direct ticket from Chicago to Dublin.  While the current partner portfolio has worked very well for Aer Lingus and our partners, the depth of the relationships in terms of the co-ordination of schedules and customer proposition is constrained by regulations.  In the absence of an alignment of economic interests, there will always be competing demands between the two parties.  While Aer Lingus has strong, sustainable partnerships, we had diagnosed that deeper co-operation would be part of the next phase of our strategic road map, but before we had acted on it, we received IAG's proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#M00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1714,"content":"<p>I also asked about the alliance Aer Lingus had with Etihad and other airlines on issues such as procurement.

Etihad has an equity stake in Aer Lingus on the basis of which Aer Lingus has had access to some procurement benefits.  We work closely with our equity partner in Etihad to extract revenue benefits, for example, by having an Aer Lingus code on services to Australia and in procurement.  However, the benefits are limited because, given that Etihad owns 4% of Aer Lingus, it would not transfer the full economic benefit.  The combination of Aer Lingus as part of purchasing and procurement within Etihad gives Etihad more scale.  Although Aer Lingus extracts value from that scale, it is nowhere close to the value that would be delivered by IAG's proposition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1716,"content":"<p>As there is a vote in the D&aacute;il, we will have to suspend in a few minutes.

While it might sound trite, if one looks up on a spring morning at the contrails in the sky, they are passenger airlines flying from Europe to North America.  They are dropping customers in Heathrow Airport, Paris and Amsterdam.  Our proposition is that they should drop more customers in Dublin.  For Irish consumers, it would give more choice and, potentially, better value because, inevitably, flight prices will decrease over time.  The acceleration of growth will mean an acceleration of cost reductions and better value.  It is a virtuous circle and Dublin Airport's opportunity to compete.  Ireland's geography is our best advantage.  It is the shortest crossing, which is the most compelling advantage from a customer and cost perspective because one burns less fuel between Dublin and New York than between London and New York.  This natural advantage and the scale of Aer Lingus's operations at Dublin and Shannon airports in terms of our connectivity in Europe give us an ability to compete.  What we need is access to the marketplace.  In May we will not just be starting a Dublin to Washington route but also 60 routes that touch Washington, for example, Edinburgh-Dublin-Washington or Dublin-Washington-Boise, Idaho.  That is the power of a network and growth and capacity at a hub.  The quicker one has critical mass the more sustainable one is.

The witnesses might forgive me if some of the questions I intend to ask already have been asked.  On the presumption the witnesses have watched the joint committee's proceedings up to now in respect of the stakeholders that have appeared before members, I also presume they saw the presentation last week by Mr. Walsh, the chief executive officer of British Airways.  Specifically, last week he gave a commitment to Shannon and Cork in respect of the Heathrow slots but did not elaborate on transatlantic flights from the perspective of Shannon Airport.  In addition, he was somewhat reluctant to extend what is a five-year commitment beyond that.  I seek the witnesses' thoughts in this regard because from the point of view of the joint committee, the greater the commitment members can get, particularly for Shannon and Cork, the more that clarity will enter this debate.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate Mr. Kavanagh on his appointment.  How does he think the decision of Aer Lingus to come out in favour of the offer will be perceived in a region out of which Aer Lingus walked the last time there was talk of such a sale?  The bona fides of Aer Lingus in the mid-western region are not great because when the first tranche of shares was sold, Aer Lingus hightailed it out of Shannon Airport at the first opportunity.  When the 75% stake was sold, Aer Lingus left Shannon and left a sour taste in the region as a whole.  Does Mr. Kavanagh accept there is good reason for people, particularly in the mid-west, to be sceptical of what Aer Lingus now advocates based on previous experiences?  In addition, I note from the documentation received that the company's position has received board approval.  Mr. Kavanagh should elaborate on this board approval.  Was it unanimous?  Was there a vote at the board and were there dissenting voices or abstentions on the board?  The company has come clean, for want of a better phrase, on how it perceives the offer made by International Consolidated Airlines Group, IAG, to the Government.  Perhaps this is an opportunity for Aer Lingus to go the extra mile and throw out the whole lot as regards what were the deliberations within the board that resulted in the board giving its green light to the purchase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#O00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424190600,"counter":1727,"content":"<p>I will defer to the chairman with regard to the board because I am chief executive-designate and have not been necessarily present at all deliberations.  With regard to the Shannon to Heathrow route, let me put on record that the decision to remove service was a function of the level of losses, which were unsustainable.  Our position in Aer Lingus is that this unsustainability was reinforced through ill-judged incentives and subsidies that were given to a direct competitor at Shannon, whereby Aer Lingus was in the invidious position of paying full airport services and fees that were being transferred directly across the check-in counters to our direct competitor.  That did not work out well for Shannon Airport and we all have moved on in respect of the sustainability of the Shannon to Heathrow operation.  Today, that route makes a positive contribution to the Aer Lingus group.  We have, with the support of our colleagues in Shannon, restructured the business.  We are more efficient.  There also is far more transparency in the pricing and incentive regime at Shannon Airport.  While it is a little trite to state that times have changed, they have.  As I stated earlier, the greatest protection for the air service between Sharon and Heathrow is its profitability.  In addition, I believe that IAG has offered some guarantees as to the five-year commitment to maintain those services.  For a variety of reasons, I think that is a time limit which is a function of IAG's desire to maintain some commercial control over airport and vendor costs and so on.  It simply does not wish to transfer to an airport the security of being able to rely on this forever, thereby removing the commercial dynamic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1728,"content":"<p>On that basis, would it not make more sense to extend the guarantee to ten or 15 years because one then would have surety from the company's point of view as much as from that of the airport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#O00400","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424190600,"counter":1729,"content":"<p>Were the Deputy the airport operator, why would he give me a deal if I was saying I will be here for 15 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1730,"content":"<p>If I was the airport operator, why would I not ask for a deal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#O00600","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424190600,"counter":1731,"content":"<p>No, the airport operator, through its incentivisation and discounts of its charging regimes, can attract and sustain-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1732,"content":"<p>But is there not a win-win for both the airport and the airline if there is certainty regarding costs and everything into the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#O00800","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424190600,"counter":1733,"content":"<p>Not necessarily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1734,"content":"<p>Why?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#O01000","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424190600,"counter":1735,"content":"<p>Because going back every five years is far more advantageous in extracting value than is committing to a 15-year term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1736,"content":"<p>In terms of the region, is that not what this boils down to?

In a way, the presentations were much clearer than that made by Mr. Willie Walsh last week.  It is clear that both Aer Lingus and IAG intend to develop a hub in Ireland.  It is equally clear the hub will be based in Dublin Airport.  We have two State-owned airport groups, Shannon Airport and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA.  Is it possible to develop two hubs in a small country?  Mr. Walsh is of the view that it is not possible.  Mr. Kavanagh referred to Switzerland.  It is one of the few small countries with two, albeit relatively small, hubs in Geneva and Z&uuml;rich.  They are both connected with the state railway infrastructure.  There are many proposals to link Dublin Airport with the rail network, but I have not heard anybody mention Shannon Airport for ten years now.  Perhaps one cannot link one without the other because of state aid rules, but that is a different issue.  If Dublin Airport becomes a hub which, undoubtedly, would be good news for the airport, could Shannon Airport also become a hub?  Could it even survive as a transatlantic destination?  Would economies of scale inevitably pull all transatlantic flights from Ireland into Dublin Airport?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barrington referred to new Aer Lingus US destinations, one on the east coast and one on the west coast.  Will they fly into Dublin Airport or Shannon Airport?<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to be churlish, but Mr. Barrington has 300,000 shares in Aer Lingus.  If the IAG deal goes through, they will be worth &euro;765,000 to him.  There is nothing wrong with this, as that is how the corporate world works.  However, it is a lot of money.  Mr. Barrington&rsquo;s shareholding pales in comparison to that of the current chief executive.  Mr. Christoph M&uuml;ller received 1.5 million shares.  Now that Mr. Kavanagh is about to become chief executive officer, will he receive a similar share offering?  Is this standard for chief executive officers?  I am asking this question because I would find it very difficult to make a clear-sighted decision if the difference between one or the other was &euro;765,000.  I appreciate that the gentlemen concerned have much more business experience than I have, but these are real human emotions and motivations.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#P01900","speaker":"977"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1759,"content":"<p>We are looking after the taxpayers&rsquo; interests, namely, the 25.1% shareholding in the airline, as well as national and regional strategic interests.

When he was booking flights in May, he searched that service, as well as British Airways direct flights to and from Heathrow Airport, backtracking to Shannon Airport.

We all speak for our own regions and I am from County Mayo.  We are all delighted with the first charter flight from New York to Knock.  I know Aer Lingus played an important role in that coming about and Mr. Kavanagh in particular was instrumental.  In reality, what are the possibilities of us having more transatlantic charter flights, even schedule flights?  How feasible is that?  Would Mr. Kavanagh consider it?  Has he considered it as part of what he has agreed regarding this charter flight?  I know the appetite exists.  At the meeting last week I mentioned that, when the previous airline operated a transatlantic flight there, the route did not fail - there were other issues with that airline which caused the overall company to run into difficulty.  There is a massive appetite for this route and I know so many people who used it and would look forward to using it again.  <\/p> <p>  We are talking about the entire west and north-west area.  We have very poor connectivity in terms of roads.  If one were to draw a line from Galway up to Louth, there are no motorways, so this is a regional airport of significance.  I would like Aer Lingus to expand on that.

I do not believe the same level of opportunity exists there because Shannon is not connected to Europe in the way Dublin is, nor will it be.  It is simply a fact that the demand for travel to and from Dublin is exponentially greater than the demand for travel to and from Shannon.  A hub needs connectivity.  The ability to flow passengers through Dublin, and the natural demand through Dublin, is on a different scale.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe that, as it builds out, Dublin will necessarily compete with or cannibalise Shannon.  There is resilient demand in Shannon.  The challenge always has been to profitably serve that demand.  The Dublin to New York route at peak has seven services a day, while Shannon to New York maintains two services a day in competition.  That is demonstrative of the resilience of routes at Shannon where there is demand.  The issue is the opportunity for growth and I see access to Oneworld selling access to other parties.  Actively selling Aer Lingus capacity neutrally can be only beneficial, but I do not see significant growth opportunities in terms of additional routes and frequencies.   It consolidates the opportunity that exists currently.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the basis of the valuation, I believe both the company and its advisers reviewed all of the assets - that was one of the criteria for valuation - as well as the more traditional valuation metrics, future earnings, past earnings, capital employed, etc.  All of the same criteria were used that would be used by the Government advisers in confirming the attractiveness or otherwise of the &euro;2.55 a share valuation.

After we entered a commitment, it was to prove that this vehicle was capable of delivering a sustainable profit and, thus, a sustainable service.<\/p> <p>  I will make a correction.  We never committed to providing a year-round, 365-day service to Boston and New York.  We signed a commercial arrangement with the Shannon Airport Authority that clearly stated the Shannon-New York service would be a nine-month one, with no service in the traditionally heavy loss-making and seasonally weakest first quarter.  Nevertheless, the Shannon-Boston route would be serviced on a 12-month basis.  We have fully met our commitments to the airport and communication at the time.  Be it a miscommunication or otherwise, we never committed to providing a year-round, twice daily service; rather, we committed to maintaining a year-round service.<\/p> <p>  The price of flights in this context could be expected and the consumer has more opportunities and choices.  It is the value proposition that will convert the consumer.  If one loses price competitiveness in an intensely competitive marketplace, one will lose traffic.  For example, Shannon Airport's customers have choices with United Airlines and Delta Airlines.  There is demand for services from the airport.  We should have confidence that there is a natural market between Shannon Airport and North America.  If British Airways or any other enterprise attempts to direct that traffic, competition will fill the vacuum.  That is what we see on a daily basis.  Across the world there are few monopolies in air transportation.  It is becoming transparent and in airlines' interests to maximise revenue, but there is always choice for consumers.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of Dublin Airport and pricing, I will use the San Francisco example.  If a consumer can find a cheaper route via Heathrow Airport, please let him or her make that choice.  We are operating a Dublin-San Francisco route.  Just as there are cheaper ways, in some instances, of getting to San Francisco from Dublin than with Aer Lingus, there are also cheaper ways of getting from Paris to San Francisco, some of which involve Aer Lingus, than using Air France's direct service.  That is the nature of competition.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#R01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1796,"content":"<p>I am talking about competition between Aer Lingus and IAG.

We enjoy working with the team at Knock airport and we were very interested in the opportunity to test the market for a service from New York.  The basic proposition is that we are in business to grow the business.  If demand between the US or Canada and Knock can be demonstrated we are open to servicing it.  I think, however, that any such demand would be on a fairly low scale and would be primarily seasonal, as was the case with the previous operator.<\/p> <p>  Our preference for a charter in this instance would be for somebody else to share some of the revenue risk.  In the case of a charter, a number of travel agents or committed parties commit to taking blocks of seats - a far less risky proposition than an airline independently attempting to sell 177 seats itself.  It is a market test and we will learn some things.  The scale from which we have benefited as a result of growth in the past number of years, including the addition of the Boeing 757 to our fleet to complement the wide-body A330s, gives us a greater capacity to trial and compete for business of this kind.  Let us see how it goes.  It was peak summer, it involved competing for very scarce aircraft resources and it won.  We are cautiously optimistic that it can be repeated.  It is a seasonal opportunity, though, and not even close to being a daily one, but it could deliver a service to Knock airport that did not previously exist.  We are here to grow the level of opportunity for Aer Lingus and, by default, for all the regions of Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#S03500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1852,"content":"<p>Could Mr. Kavanagh envisage a once-a-week service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#S03600","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424190600,"counter":1853,"content":"<p>If all the interested parties were to commit to a charter and produce the revenue required to sustain a year-round daily operation, I would gladly operate it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HE12015021700002#S03700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424190600,"counter":1854,"content":"<p>Can Mr. Kavanagh describe who he considers would be the interested parties in the area?

If BA were to begin selling Knock as a destination, that bring us back to the basic point of this proposition, namely, that more people consider Knock as a destination.  Gatwick Airport is British Airways second most important hub.  It does not serve Dublin, Knock, or Belfast from Gatwick.  What Aer Lingus gains is that most powerful player in the UK market with significant loyalty based on a frequent flyer programme, to which Aer Lingus currently does not have access, and a vested interest in selling seats between London and Knock, which does not currently exist.

In the event this particular transaction does not complete, Aer Lingus has its own growth programme but the composition of employment in Aer Lingus will continue to change.  There are some processes within Aer Lingus that over time no longer had value for the customer, or the process has been replaced by automation or various things.  What I can say is that, ultimately, as Aer Lingus grows the level of employment in Aer Lingus will grow but the composition of that employment is dynamic.  A growing Aer Lingus in terms of fleet will ultimately require the workforce to accrue.  We are a relatively lean airline.  We have been through many restructurings in the past 20 years, in stark contrast to many carriers that continue to exist in Europe.  That is how we have managed to withstand fierce competition from a very successful local incumbent.  There will be job losses but there will be job losses in areas that do not add value to the enterprise.  Forgive me for being blunt, but if customers do not value the service, the service does not get produced.  Ultimately, however, there will be more employment opportunities created within the business in other areas.  That is what growth ultimately delivers.  Our proposition is that the growth and the opportunity that can be delivered is much greater under an IAG proposal than on a stand-alone basis but, as I said earlier, that does not invalidate our current business.

We really welcome the opportunity to set out our views on this very important issue.<\/p> <p>  I will start by stating our position very clearly.  My own and the Aer Lingus board's strongly held view is that a combination of Aer Lingus with IAG has a compelling strategic rationale and will deliver significant benefits to Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus's employees, Aer Lingus's customers and Ireland.  The board has concluded, based on advice from our financial advisers, that the price of &euro;2.55 per share should be recommended to shareholders.  <\/p> <p>  In recent weeks, we have listened carefully to the public debate regarding IAG's proposal.  During this period we have had further detailed discussions with representatives of IAG and the Aer Lingus board now has a greater understanding of IAG's intentions for the future of Aer Lingus and the proposed commitments IAG is prepared to make in regard to Aer Lingus to the Irish Government.  <\/p> <p>  These discussions have further confirmed that it is clearly in IAG's interest to continue to grow Aer Lingus within the IAG group. Aer Lingus being part of IAG represents a hugely positive opportunity for Aer Lingus and Ireland. This deal is about accelerated growth.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Stephen Kavanagh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->This deal is about accelerated growth.  It provides real prospects for growth in Aer Lingus, the economy, global connectivity, international trade, tourism and employment.  I am surprised it can be represented in any other way.  It is on the basis of these understandings that I and the Aer Lingus board give our strong support to the proposed transaction.  The Aer Lingus team met last week with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and the interdepartmental group established by the Minister.  We set out the board's view on the benefits of the proposed deal.  I will summarise these meetings regarding the benefits of IAG's proposal and key commercial drivers.  The proposal is viewed by the board as compelling and a significantly positive opportunity for Aer Lingus, its employees, its customers and Ireland.  Aer Lingus as part of IAG will enhance Ireland's position as a natural hub linking Europe and North America.  Ireland's location as the westernmost point in Europe makes it a natural gateway to connect the combined populations of Europe and North America.  Aer Lingus believes IAG's proposal can enable Ireland to become a central hub for European traffic across the Atlantic, resulting in better utilisation of the infrastructure investment in Irish airports. <\/p><p> The market between Europe and North America is about 75 million people per annum.  Increasing our share of this traffic, which is currently at 2%, to even 4 or 5% would mean bringing an additional 1 to 2 million passengers per year through Ireland, which would have huge positive benefits for Aer Lingus and its employees and for Irish airports and their employees and a myriad of ancillary support services.  With Aer Lingus as part of the IAG group, there would potential for the planned growth in transatlantic traffic to be significantly accelerated, with new US destinations added to its network.  There is an immediate prospect of accelerating our plans to open two new destinations in North America, one on the east coast and one on the west coast.  <\/p><p> Aer Lingus as part of IAG will deliver employment growth.  Initial transatlantic traffic and destination growth will create significant numbers of new jobs in Ireland. The new routes would require the acquisition of two more long-range aircraft and would provide at least two hundred direct and highly skilled jobs in Aer Lingus.  A multiple of this number would be employed in support services in the general economy and in the tourism sector.  Being part of IAG will enhance Aer Lingus's European growth.  Aer Lingus short-haul services, including the Dublin, Cork and Shannon to London Heathrow routes, will directly benefit from the sales and marketing activity conducted on its behalf by British Airways, Iberia, Vueling and the Oneworld partner sales forces.  This will strengthen the positions of the Cork and Shannon to Heathrow routes and provide additional visitor traffic to the southern and mid-west regions and the rest of the country.  Irish tourism will also benefit from greater exposure to the frequent flyer programme of Oneworld members, particularly British Airways and American Airlines.   <\/p><p> Expected benefits to Aer Lingus's Atlantic and European network, if Aer Lingus were part of IAG, include better connectivity to and from Ireland.  Being part of IAG will also allow greater access to a global cargo network.  Aer Lingus's cargo business will benefit from the global network reach and sales channels of IAG cargo business.  The cargo network enhancement is expected to deliver significant benefits and additional options to Irish businesses, particularly the pharmaceutical sector.  <\/p><p> Aer Lingus as part of IAG will be a separate operating business and the Aer Lingus brand will continue and flourish.  Aer Lingus has confirmed IAG's intentions to preserve Aer Lingus as a separately operating business within the group, with its own brand, management, head office and operations.  Willie Walsh confirmed this strongly and publicly to this committee last week.<\/p><p> It is the strong view of the Aer Lingus board that the prospect of Aer Lingus being part of IAG has compelling, strategic and commercial logic for Aer Lingus.  It would have significantly positive benefits for Aer Lingus and for Ireland, and the board is strongly supportive of the Government's two-airline policy.  Following a combination with IAG, Aer Lingus will have more attractive growth options that will significantly benefit Aer Lingus as a company, its employees, its customers, the tourism sector, Irish business and industry and the airports where Aer Lingus operates.<\/p><p> We are fully aware of concerns expressed by political parties.  Aer Lingus is willing to meet individual parties in order to clarify our position further.  We believe this is a very good opportunity for Aer Lingus and Ireland.  I hope we can give it the collective support it needs and deserves.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#A00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Barrington","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424192400,"counter":1897,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kavanagh.

I will start by introducing Stobart Air, formerly Aer Arann.  Stobart Air is a franchise flying specialist flying for three airlines: Aer Lingus, Flybe and CityJet.  We employ 430 people, an increase of 100 in the past four years.  Our airline is all about high frequency, regional connectivity and feeding passengers into onward air journeys.  The Aer Lingus-Stobart Air partnership, which we operate under the Aer Lingus Regional banner, is proof of what can be achieved when a small airline partners with a larger one.  The partnership started in 2010 and now operates 25 routes to and from 18 airports across Ireland, the UK and France.  Aer Lingus Regional has increased its annual passenger numbers from 855,000 to 1.3 million in 2014, a 53% increase in just over four years.  In the coming weeks we will fly our five millionth passenger.  Aer Lingus Regional now contributes 12% of Aer Lingus overall passengers.  The partnership is testament to the commercial relationship between our airlines.  We have extended our contract to 2022.  It is also testament to how far we have come from the brink of bankruptcy just over four years ago. We have broadened our route network, invested &euro;150 million in new aircraft, increased our passenger numbers and added to our workforce.  The returns from our partnership are evident when you consider how Aer Lingus Regional feeds passengers to the Aer Lingus transatlantic route.  The combination of Aer Lingus, Aer Lingus Regional and the US immigration pre-clearance in Ireland is a massive advantage that no other country enjoys.  Last year approximately 100,000 of our passengers arrived at Dublin, completed US pre-clearance and boarded an Aer Lingus transatlantic service to the US, or they arrived from one of Aer Lingus's North American services and boarded our aircraft to Dublin to connect onward.  The advantages this offers consumers are significant.  People can save up to two hours on a journey.  Passengers also avoid the hassle of more queues on arrival at US airports.  Nearly 100,000 transatlantic connections in 2014 is an 80% increase in just four years.  It is a core part of our business. It delivers the passengers Aer Lingus needs to expand its North American network.  Aer Lingus and Aer Lingus Regional will continue to increase transatlantic business.  It is our belief that if IAG takes over Aer Lingus this growth could be achieved faster and on a larger scale.  From a UK perspective, how can we get UK-originating passengers to choose Dublin instead of London, Paris or Amsterdam when travelling to the US?  Last year, 4.3 million people travelled to London Heathrow from Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds Bradford, Manchester and Newcastle.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Sean Brogan:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->These are all cities that Aer Lingus currently serves.  Of these, at least 1.2 million passengers connected at Heathrow to other, mainly US, destinations.  I will discuss Newcastle specifically.  In 2014, Aer Lingus Regional carried 9,000 Newcastle passengers to or from the US through Dublin.  A further 300,000 passengers from Newcastle used Heathrow, not Dublin, as their connecting point.  These are passengers that Aer Lingus should win.  As part of IAG, Aer Lingus can win them.  Being part of a global airline family would fast-track the realisation of this opportunity.  This would help our airline to expand, meaning more aircraft and more jobs.  Aer Lingus would benefit from the passenger increase, as would Irish airports.  The overall economy would also benefit, particularly from more inbound US tourists.<\/p><p>  Consumers want choice and convenience, particularly when it comes to air traffic.  Consumers like the convenience of one website visit, one click to book, one check-in, straight through from start to finish on their journey.  An Aer Lingus alliance with IAG would realise these benefits for Irish consumers.  To drive and survive, airlines must constantly seek out and secure new opportunities.  Stobart Air believes that the IAG offer is such an opportunity.  The partnership of Stobart Air with a larger airline has enabled it to grow and has delivered significant consumer and employment benefits to the economy.  I believe the same can be replicated on an even larger scale if Aer Lingus joins forces with IAG.  That is why Stobart Air is backing the IAG bid for Aer Lingus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#B00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Sean Brogan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424192400,"counter":1900,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Brogan.  Both Mr. Kavanagh and Mr. Brogan have said in their presentations that a successful IAG bid to take over Aer Lingus would have a positive outcome.  Mr. Barrington referred to 200 new jobs based on new transatlantic traffic; last week Mr. Walsh suggested 500 new jobs.  Could Mr. Barrington comment on this figure?  The important issues are jobs, connectivity, and growth.  If the IAG bid to take over Aer Lingus is not successful, is there still a possibility of growth?  Are there any disadvantages to a successful bid by IAG to take over Aer Lingus?  Will the growth be limited to Dublin Airport?  What about growth in Shannon, Cork, and the regional airports?  Coming from the west of Ireland, I have a particular interest in Ireland West Airport Knock.  Mr. Kavanagh has been instrumental in organising a transatlantic flight to and from Knock, which will begin in summer 2015.  If the IAG bid is successful, is it more likely that this service will be expanded into seasonal charter flights?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#C00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424192400,"counter":1901,"content":"<p>I will start with the 200 new jobs.  I was specifically referring to the prospect of Aer Lingus operating services to two new destinations, one on both the east and west coast of the United States.  Those two new destinations would require one more aircraft each and that would mean approximately 100 new jobs per aircraft.  Over the next five years, between now and 2020, we could see the more than 500 direct jobs that Mr. Walsh referred to last week.  Aer Lingus could increase its current transatlantic fleet from 10 aircraft to close to 20 aircraft, and if those targets were achieved more than 500 jobs would be created in total.  I believe Mr. Walsh was referring to what IAG might add to the two new services proposed by Aer Lingus.  Would Mr. Kavanagh discuss the possibility of growth if the IAG bid to take over Aer Lingus is unsuccessful?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#C00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Colm Barrington"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424192400,"counter":1902,"content":"<p>Aer Lingus believes that opportunities are growing to serve Europe and compete for traffic between Europe and North America.  Having had discussions with representatives of IAG and, indeed, listened to their contribution to the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications, it is apparent that IAG shares the same view as to the value of these opportunities; hence the proposal.  What is the opportunity?  Aer Lingus carried 1.3 million customers across the Atlantic last year and one in three of those customers was travelling between Europe and North America.  That additional business provided Aer Lingus with the ability to grow and sustain the frequency of existing services between Dublin or Shannon and North America.  Without that access to Europe and North American traffic, Aer Lingus would not be able to sustain the existing shape of the Aer Lingus transatlantic service.<\/p> <p>  That traffic also has a positive contribution to our short-haul network.  Simply put, if a passenger is travelling between Boston and Paris, Aer Lingus carries them to Dublin on the Atlantic aircraft.  It supports our connectivity to the UK and Europe and complements the natural demand between Ireland and the UK and Europe.  Aer Lingus sees this on a standalone basis as something that will allow it to grow into the future.  It will be challenging.  It is not without risk, given the scale of Aer Lingus and the shocks that are a feature of the aviation business.  However, it is a strategy that, as one can see from our financial results in recent years, has worked.  Aer Lingus believes that the geographic advantages that Ireland delivers in this regard are central to the proposition.  Rather than viewing Ireland's remote island status on the western periphery of Europe as a disadvantage, in this particular instance it is a key advantage.  It is an advantage from the customer's perspective because the time to traverse the Atlantic through Dublin is faster.  From an airline's perspective, the quicker the journey, the lower the cost.  The geography gives us natural economic advantages in serving the market.  The State has made the appropriate investments in terms of airport infrastructure.  The customs and border patrol facilities at Shannon Airport and Dublin Airport give Aer Lingus an added advantage.  <\/p> <p>   What is the additional opportunity with regard to IAG?  It is, in essence, scale.  Aer Lingus by itself will fight for its place in the market.  It has done so for close to 80 years and it will continue to do so.  What IAG brings to Aer Lingus is the ability to join forces; particularly in the Atlantic joint business, to have four airlines selling Aer Lingus seats as if they were their own allows Aer Lingus to compete.  It allows Aer Lingus to have more confidence in terms of the number of customers it can reach.  It allows Aer Lingus to have more confidence in terms of the costs to those customers because of the economies of scale.  Ultimately, it de-risks expansion for Aer Lingus.  The approach of four airlines selling jointly will accelerate opportunities that it would otherwise be challenging for Aer Lingus to exploit on its own.  This is a fast-track approach.  <\/p> <p>   The positives from an Aer Lingus perspective are not just to do with the Atlantic.  As I referenced earlier, those passengers have to be flown from the UK and Europe, hence the partnership with Stobart Air.  One hundred thousand customers use Stobart Air services.  More than 300,000 customers use Aer Lingus mainline transatlantic services from Dublin and Shannon.  Those services will be positively impacted not just by the incremental flow across the Atlantic but, further, by membership of the Oneworld alliance, as proposed by IAG, because in that instance there would be 15 global airlines selling seats to Shannon and Cork and Dublin.  So Aer Lingus sees the benefits in terms of the opportunity for accelerated growth.  In the absence of such a deal, the challenges will remain but there will be fewer opportunities and higher risks.  That scenario has direct implications for the confidence with which investment can be made.<!--\/p--><!--p><span class=\"speaker_continuing_label\">(Speaker Continuing)<\/span><\/p--><!--p--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#91;<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">Mr. Stephen Kavanagh:<\/span--><!--span class=\"speakercontinuing\">&amp;#93;<\/span-->Those are the circumstances under which we have no hesitation in recommending the proposal on the basis that it would be positive for Aer Lingus shareholders, for employees, for all stakeholders and ultimately for Ireland Inc. in terms of utilising the geographical advantages and retaining that economic opportunity within this economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#C00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424192400,"counter":1904,"content":"<p>What about the growth in Dublin <i>vis-&agrave;-vis<\/i>growth in the regions, including the regional airports?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#D00200","speaker":"1073"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424192400,"counter":1905,"content":"<p>The growth will flow to all elements of the Aer Lingus network.

If British Airways is supplemented by the ability of all Oneworld members to sell seats on behalf of Aer Lingus between London and Shannon, there are no circumstances, from our analysis, on the basis of having more potential customers in a more cost-effective manner, under which the viability of the network is in any way compromised or less benefited than in the IAG proposal.

He twice reminded us that this was the right strategic decision from a commercial point of view for Aer Lingus, for its employees, for its customers and for Ireland.  The only thing he has left out from that is the shareholders.  I would have thought that, as chairperson of the company, his primary objective was to work in the interest of the shareholders.  I am not sure where he stands on that.  He might help us to understand.  There has been some media comment about the directors of the company and how they, together with some senior management, will share in a &euro;30 million pot, some kind of bonus disbursal, as a result of the sale.  Maybe he could talk to us about that.  I would have liked to see before us today some of the independent directors on his board and be able to interact with them.  I would also have liked to see the directors appointed by the State, who, while they have a fiduciary duty to the company, also have a mandate from the Government to look at the broader regional aspects to the company's overall strategic direction.  Maybe Mr. Barrington can comment to some extent on that.<\/p> <p>  If this deal goes through, will there be an independent Aer Lingus board?  Mr. Kavanagh talked about management, head office, etc.  Will there be a board?  What has been going on in Aer Lingus?  Has there been long-term strategic planning or have the directors been working towards this day?  Has Aer Lingus been courting IAG or somebody in IAG's league?  Has it always been, in recent years, just about getting to a point at which the directors dispose of the airline, get their exit strategy and get to share that &euro;30 million pot?  I see a level of confusion between what the witnesses are telling me and what Willie Walsh tells me is their long-term strategy. If Mr. Brogan's interaction with them has been so successful, why have we not heard of Aer Lingus developing its own growth strategy as a relatively small independent operator?  My understanding was that there was an alliance with another airline about being able to buy aircraft relatively competitively.  If there was a long-term strategy, could it not have been achieved through a strategic link-up with IAG, rather than a capitulation or a sell-out?  Could Aer Lingus not have attempted to paddle its own canoe, to develop a strategic alliance whereby all the benefits that have been mentioned would still be there and would flow to the benefit of the company, the employees, the shareholders, and more importantly, this island nation?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#D00600","speaker":"976"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424192400,"counter":1909,"content":"<p>I will deal with some of those questions and perhaps Mr. Kavanagh might deal with some others.

We have competed between Europe and North America, hence the deliberate partnership and co-operation with our colleagues in Stobart Air and some of the arrangements we have made with partner airlines in North America to give us access to the US and Canadian markets and European hinterland.

I assume this was done to secure a public service liability funded route from Donegal.

We are not invalidating our current strategy.  The issue is the balance of opportunity, which will be increased, and risk, which will decrease.  That balance of opportunity and risk determines investment.  Both parties have a common view as to the level of the opportunity but our capacity to exploit that opportunity is reduced independently than it would be as part of IAG.  That is the just the reality of the position.  The committee should not take the view that we do not believe that we have a robust business that is capable of generating returns for shareholders and stakeholders.  That is not the stated position.  We are encouraged by the level of increased opportunity, which will generate incremental jobs.  That is an inevitability and they will be more sustainable as a result because they will be built on stronger foundations.  They will be high end, direct jobs ranging from pilots and cabin crew to engineers.  They will not just be incremental as there will be more promotion opportunities for colleagues are working in the enterprise.<\/p> <p>  Aer Lingus can realistically survive.  It has realistically survived thus far, although it is more challenged than ever because of the global nature of competition.  We serve the island and if we can continue to have that mindset, we will be increasingly vulnerable because that is a constrained market in terms of opportunity.  The opportunity for us is to compete and bring to the Europe-north America marketplace what we have been successfully doing for the Irish consumer and for those wishing to visit Ireland for the past 80 years.  That it the challenge.  The risk appetite is stopping us, and not just our personal risk appetite as we have to generate a return on other people's capital.  That return is more difficult to generate than the alternative within IAG but it does not preclude that investment.  It is then about the pace of that investment and, ultimately, the sustainability of that investment.<\/p> <p>  We are comfortable that we can get beyond 2%.  On a report in terms of competitive standings in Europe, one will go a long way before one will find 2% and, therefore, in many ways we are not relevant.  Once one becomes relevant, one becomes open to competition and to the challenges of what the large consolidated global carriers can do and that leaves us vulnerable.  It is a challenge we are up to.  We will continue to manage the costs in our business and to invest in the product but, undoubtedly, it is an additional challenge.  All this is simply a way of saying that the opportunity that the IAG proposal brings will be accelerated but also more sustainable growth.  The greatest protection any slot can have is sustainable profitability of the service provider that utilises it.  It is as simple as that.  We operate in the market.  The slots, as they are currently deployed, make a contribution.  Aer Lingus's primary role is to connect Ireland to the world.  Connecting Ireland to London is central to our product offering.  We are going nowhere on Cork, Shannon and Dublin to Heathrow Airport, but continued investment and competition is the greatest guarantee.

Literally, it brings more customers for existing services, which sustains existing services, but also provides an ability to grow at a far more accelerated rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#F00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1424192400,"counter":1942,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and congratulate Mr. Kavanagh on his appointment.  We have heard various opinions from the different groups that have attended this committee, but the overall opinion of people on the street is that Aer Lingus is doing well, passenger numbers are increasing, it is a modern airline and the hotel side and tourism are thriving and steadily and improving.  Why then would we look at trying to sell off an airline that seems to be doing well and making progress, albeit at a slow pace?  A slow pace is good.  Representatives from Stobart have said their business has grown 40% or 50%.  What more would one want?  Gradual improvement at that rate is steady progress.<br\/><br\/>What is lacking here is vision.  If I were CEO of Aer Lingus, I would be saying that I want to grow the airline on its own, for the shareholders, the State and everyone, and that is what I would be pushing for.  Senior executives stand to make money on their shares if Aer Lingus is sold.  I see this as a conflict of interest in the context of making a judgment and being objective.  In objective terms, they would say they should push ahead and work at growing the airline on a steady basis and open up routes.  This is happening and more connectivity is being developed.  I believe this is the way Aer Lingus should be going.<br\/><br\/>In regard to Stobart, what does it stand to gain financially in terms of shares?  Earlier we heard Aer Lingus is unsure how much senior executives will get.  I find that difficult to believe.  I am sure the board has a clear picture of how much each individual and each executive will get.  I would love to know how much Stobart stands to get.  Are pensions of both Aer Lingus and Stobart members involved in any deal?  Are Aer Lingus pensions invested in this?  What good is a five-year guarantee when we have a steady business that is making progress?<br\/><br\/>I found it interesting that Mr. Walsh mentioned the guarantees.  In an article in <i>The Guardian<\/i>last year or the previous year, he mentioned the main issue was long flights and that the slots in Heathrow were very important in this regard.  The 23 Aer Lingus slots are extremely important in the context of expanding business.  Is Aer Lingus aware that when the deal was made with the Spanish airline Iberia in 2011, more than 4,500 people were made redundant and even now more of that airline's staff are being laid off?  Can we accept the word of an organisation that is laying off people as we speak and that says it will create jobs?  We are told there is a possibility of 1,200 jobs being lost immediately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#G00200","speaker":"1022"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424192400,"counter":1943,"content":"<p>To repeat, Aer Lingus is successful by many measures.  This is testament to the efforts of many people over a long period.  What is under consideration here is an accelerated opportunity, an opportunity that may never be achievable on a stand alone basis.  That opportunity and valuation was part of the analysis and consideration of the proposal from IAG and we believe it fairly reflects the valuation and future potential of the business.<\/p> <p>  On why we would sell off Aer Lingus, I do not see it as a sell-off.  We are a plc.  What we are recommending is an ability to accelerate the value creation.  That is where not just shareholders, but stakeholders, employees and Ireland maintains a benefit.  The world does not stop to allow Aer Lingus to grow.  We carried 11 million customers in 2014, more than any time in our history, yet we do not make the top 50 carriers worldwide.  That is the nature of the business we compete in.  Increasingly, the airline business will consolidate.  There are significant economies of scale and significant cost benefits from having major fleets and significant revenue benefits from having global reach and partnership.  This is something we simply cannot ignore, albeit that - not waving a white flag - we have a solid business based on good fundamentals.  What is up for consideration here is the incremental opportunity.<\/p> <p>  In regard to the comparison or contrast with Iberia, first, I believe IAG sees the value inherent in the Aer Lingus strategy in terms of the opportunity to grow Ireland as a natural hub for transatlantic traffic.  Aer Lingus is a profitable business that has gone through many restructurings.  When British Airways and Iberia combined, Iberia was a deeply troubled business that needed to be restructured.  It is not comparable in any way to what IAG would be investing in if it was to secure Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus is a growth vehicle for IAG.  It is a &euro;1.4 billion investment from British Airways and IAG.  This is not an investment that will be recouped by redirecting passengers through Heathrow.  It is an investment that will be recovered and grown by exploiting the opportunity that exists for Aer Lingus, Dublin, Shannon and Cork to have a larger share of the Europe to North America market.<\/p> <p>  The inevitability of some back office support functions being lost is indisputable.  This is one of the rationales and is why consolidation is such a feature of the industry.  However, the opportunity here is the amount of direct employment that will be delivered from the growth, particularly of transatlantic capable aircraft, but also because of the support activities and because of the services provided not only by the airport but the businesses based on it and the spin-off.  Simply, having more access to the island generates more inbound tourism.  This has a significant indirect positive impact on levels of employment.<\/p> <p>  We have taken the time to consider deeply the implications of this offer.  The board and the executive management team are very conscious of the implications and the interests of stakeholders.  We have no hesitation in recommending the offer because we intuitively believe it is positive.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#G00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424192400,"counter":1944,"content":"<p>I wish to make just one comment.

Two years ago a significant investment was made in Stobart Air by its shareholders.  At that time, I made it clear that this was about growing the franchise flying platform and that we would see that platform extend outside Aer Lingus to other airlines.  That has happened and we have now started to fly with Flybe and CityJet.  The IAG proposal would allow us to continue that expansion but to express it.  We will continue to grow.  Aer Lingus Regional will only grow so far but Stobart Air will continue to grow and will continue to do so in a managed way.  To answer the Deputy's question about how big we want the airline to be, we intend to carry through on the commitments made at the time of the investment.  The investment was all about a franchise flying platform.<\/p> <p>  The second question was whether we stand to gain from this transaction and the answer is that we do.  We stand to gain passengers and it is all about passengers.  Passengers drive growth, passengers drive fleet and fleet drives jobs.

Some people are of the opinion that an airline must make massive leaps forward to be successful.  They suggest that smaller airlines must join forces with larger ones because consolidation is the way of the future.  I do not necessarily agree with that.  I believe that we should be taking steady steps, which we have done over the years.  The airline has steadily grown to 11 million passengers.

We cannot accuse the witnesses of not being forthright today.<\/p> <p>  All of us here will agree that there is a national sentiment around the brand name of Aer Lingus.  If one asks people about Aer Lingus, which used to be a State-owned company, most will say that they feel that Aer Lingus belongs to all of us.  The reality, of course, is that it does not and we must deal with life as it is.  The sentiment is there but sentiment will not provide one's breakfast.  There is still an attachment to Aer Lingus on the part of many people.  I say all of this in the context of the fact that as legislators we are receiving correspondence about this to the effect that Ireland is an island off an island and if Aer Lingus is sold, we will divorce ourselves from everything in terms of aviation and will lose everything.  As I said, that is based on sentiment but it is how people feel.<\/p> <p>  As a lifelong trade unionist, my big question is about outsourcing, which will have a very big influence on how people on this side of the House will make their decision.

However, I would like them to address the issues of direct employment and security of employment.  I am realistic enough to know that there are very few certainties in life but I would like the witnesses to connect the confidence they feel about the future with the fact that there must also be some confidence and security for those who already work in Aer Lingus.

Any owner of Aer Lingus that ignores the sentimental attachment of its customer base is putting the business at risk and I simply cannot believe that this investment proposition is based on that view.  IAG is buying a successful enterprise with a strong brand.  Swiss consumers still regularly use Swiss Air, which is owned by Lufthansa. Etihad owns Alitalia, while British Airways itself is owned by IAG.  This is a global business.  The corporate head office for British Airways is, notionally, in Madrid but that does not stop British consumers from viewing British Airways as the flag carrier.  That is where I would see Aer Lingus positioned within the IAG group proposal.<br\/><br\/>On outsourcing, I do not see it being on the agenda and that has been communicated from IAG.  In terms of direct employment of pilots and cabin crew, this will be incremental and will give more opportunities to those already employed.  Dublin will be a hub, similar to the rest of the hub operations in IAG.  It is the <i>modus operandi<\/i>of IAG to resource its hub operations because it is as efficient, when one has critical mass and scale, to do it oneself.  One gets more control over the quality of service and the guarantee of the mutuality of interests between those delivering the service and those resourcing it.  Again, at the Irish bases, the greatest protection is growth and the sustainability of the operation.

I congratulate Mr. Kavanagh on his appointment and I wish him the best of luck.  We have heard a lot of testimony over the past few weeks.  Some of it shows that Aer Lingus has been operating under good management and is a profitable and growing company.  IAG will benefit from the takeover of Aer Lingus.  This is a change in the trend.  Iberia was really struggling and would have been a target for a takeover, as I imagine the balance sheet was not very strong.  With a strong brand and much potential, it would have been a realistic target for a takeover.  Aer Lingus is in a different place and is still growing, albeit at a slower pace than if the IAG takeover occurs.<\/p> <p>  I link that to the testimony of Mr. Brogan.  The relationship that Stobart Air and Aer Lingus Regional has with Aer Lingus has been hugely beneficial to his company.  I draw a comparison between that situation and Iberia and IAG.

The company will not get it back from the Irish consumer.  The money will get a return from European and north American consumers and there will be only a marginal return in this country, based on a relative increase in activity.

It is not that company's record in Scotland according to the Government there.<br\/><br\/>I need all of the documentation on the slots.  It seems that in respect of the High Court judgment in London last Thursday, Aer Lingus was stating one thing here and another in the United Kingdom.  To quote from the judgment:<blockquote>Many of the potential competitive effects of the transaction that we considered [that is whether Ryanair should be a partner] would manifest themselves in terms of the absence of an action that might otherwise have been taken by Aer Lingus (for example, Aer Lingus being prevented from combining with another airline [which is what we are talking about today] or from disposing of Heathrow slots in the context of optimizing its route network and timetable).<\/blockquote>Was that case made by Aer Lingus in the UK courts?

It has identified London Heathrow, Madrid and Dublin Airport as the three hubs that are central to IAG competing for a share.  The impact on Scotland, the history of British Airways and the competitive dynamic in that marketplace are not matters on which I can comment.  What I can say is Scotland is a significant source market for Aer Lingus in transiting passengers between Scotland and North America.  I see no reason that would change.  In fact, it would improve in terms of our opportunity to compete in that marketplace.  Not only would we have British Airways selling Dublin on a neutral basis from Scotland, we would also have American Airlines selling seats to Scotland via Dublin Airport.<\/p> <p>  The issue for IAG from our analysis is competing for more of a share in the Europe to North America marketplace.  It is not a case of simply adding Aer Lingus to the IAG group and leaving it at that.  This is about growing the business.  It is about passengers choosing part of the product offering by IAG and its Atlantic joint business partner, rather than choosing to travel on United Airlines from Edinburgh.  This is about IAG diagnosing that the value proposition from Aer Lingus is capable of being competitive, that there is a growth opportunity and that ultimately two plus two equals five.<\/p> <p>  On preventing the disposal of slots, I have said the greatest protection slots have is delivering a sustainable economic return.  In circumstances where that is not possible, it is, of course, at the discretion of the State to purchase slots or to introduce a PSO to ensure connectivity.

This is not to say Aer Lingus has immediate plans to dispose of slots.  As I said, the slots are core to the Aer Lingus customer proposition, given that Ireland-Heathrow is one of the busiest air routes on the globe.  It is also core to the British Airways network that Ireland retain its connectivity.  Shannon and Cork airports are key source routes for long-haul flow through Heathrow Airport.  The basic proposition is that the opportunity is to grow Dublin Airport as a hub.  This would benefit Aer Lingus and, ultimately, IAG because IAG would increase its share in the Europe to North America marketplace.

While they are strong, mutually beneficial relationships, there is not necessarily full alignment of mutual interests.  If United Airlines is selling a ticket between Chicago and Dublin, its first commercial instinct is to keep the customer in its own metal.  It will, therefore, attempt to direct the customer to Heathrow Airport and on to an Aer Lingus service from there to Dublin.  That is the natural conflict in the current code-share relationships.  The difference between such a relationship and the one suggested in IAG's proposal is that American Airlines would have an aligned and equivalent economic interest in selling a direct ticket from Chicago to Dublin.  While the current partner portfolio has worked very well for Aer Lingus and our partners, the depth of the relationships in terms of the co-ordination of schedules and customer proposition is constrained by regulations.  In the absence of an alignment of economic interests, there will always be competing demands between the two parties.

Etihad has an equity stake in Aer Lingus on the basis of which Aer Lingus has had access to some procurement benefits.  We work closely with our equity partner in Etihad to extract revenue benefits, for example, by having an Aer Lingus code on services to Australia and in procurement.

While it might sound trite, if one looks up on a spring morning at the contrails in the sky, they are passenger airlines flying from Europe to North America.  They are dropping customers in Heathrow Airport, Paris and Amsterdam.  Our proposition is that they should drop more customers in Dublin.  For Irish consumers, it would give more choice and, potentially, better value because, inevitably, flight prices will decrease over time.  The acceleration of growth will mean an acceleration of cost reductions and better value.  It is a virtuous circle and Dublin Airport's opportunity to compete.  Ireland's geography is our best advantage.  It is the shortest crossing, which is the most compelling advantage from a customer and cost perspective because one burns less fuel between Dublin and New York than between London and New York.  This natural advantage and the scale of Aer Lingus's operations at Dublin and Shannon airports in terms of our connectivity in Europe give us an ability to compete.  What we need is access to the marketplace.  In May we will not just be starting a Dublin to Washington route but also 60 routes that touch Washington, for example, Edinburgh-Dublin-Washington or Dublin-Washington-Boise, Idaho.  That is the power of a network and growth and capacity at a hub.  The quicker one has critical mass the more sustainable one is.

The witnesses might forgive me if some of the questions I intend to ask already have been asked.  On the presumption the witnesses have watched the joint committee's proceedings up to now in respect of the stakeholders that have appeared before members, I also presume they saw the presentation last week by Mr. Walsh, the chief executive officer of British Airways.  Specifically, last week he gave a commitment to Shannon and Cork in respect of the Heathrow slots but did not elaborate on transatlantic flights from the perspective of Shannon Airport.  In addition, he was somewhat reluctant to extend what is a five-year commitment beyond that.  I seek the witnesses' thoughts in this regard because from the point of view of the joint committee, the greater the commitment members can get, particularly for Shannon and Cork, the more that clarity will enter this debate.<\/p> <p>  I congratulate Mr. Kavanagh on his appointment.  How does he think the decision of Aer Lingus to come out in favour of the offer will be perceived in a region out of which Aer Lingus walked the last time there was talk of such a sale?  The bona fides of Aer Lingus in the mid-western region are not great because when the first tranche of shares was sold, Aer Lingus hightailed it out of Shannon Airport at the first opportunity.  When the 75% stake was sold, Aer Lingus left Shannon and left a sour taste in the region as a whole.  Does Mr. Kavanagh accept there is good reason for people, particularly in the mid-west, to be sceptical of what Aer Lingus now advocates based on previous experiences?  In addition, I note from the documentation received that the company's position has received board approval.  Mr. Kavanagh should elaborate on this board approval.  Was it unanimous?  Was there a vote at the board and were there dissenting voices or abstentions on the board?  The company has come clean, for want of a better phrase, on how it perceives the offer made by International Consolidated Airlines Group, IAG, to the Government.  Perhaps this is an opportunity for Aer Lingus to go the extra mile and throw out the whole lot as regards what were the deliberations within the board that resulted in the board giving its green light to the purchase.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#O00200","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424192400,"counter":2022,"content":"<p>I will defer to the chairman with regard to the board because I am chief executive-designate and have not been necessarily present at all deliberations.  With regard to the Shannon to Heathrow route, let me put on record that the decision to remove service was a function of the level of losses, which were unsustainable.  Our position in Aer Lingus is that this unsustainability was reinforced through ill-judged incentives and subsidies that were given to a direct competitor at Shannon, whereby Aer Lingus was in the invidious position of paying full airport services and fees that were being transferred directly across the check-in counters to our direct competitor.  That did not work out well for Shannon Airport and we all have moved on in respect of the sustainability of the Shannon to Heathrow operation.  Today, that route makes a positive contribution to the Aer Lingus group.  We have, with the support of our colleagues in Shannon, restructured the business.  We are more efficient.  There also is far more transparency in the pricing and incentive regime at Shannon Airport.  While it is a little trite to state that times have changed, they have.  As I stated earlier, the greatest protection for the air service between Sharon and Heathrow is its profitability.  In addition, I believe that IAG has offered some guarantees as to the five-year commitment to maintain those services.  For a variety of reasons, I think that is a time limit which is a function of IAG's desire to maintain some commercial control over airport and vendor costs and so on.  It simply does not wish to transfer to an airport the security of being able to rely on this forever, thereby removing the commercial dynamic.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424192400,"counter":2023,"content":"<p>On that basis, would it not make more sense to extend the guarantee to ten or 15 years because one then would have surety from the company's point of view as much as from that of the airport?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#O00400","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424192400,"counter":2024,"content":"<p>Were the Deputy the airport operator, why would he give me a deal if I was saying I will be here for 15 years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#O00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424192400,"counter":2025,"content":"<p>If I was the airport operator, why would I not ask for a deal?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#O00600","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424192400,"counter":2026,"content":"<p>No, the airport operator, through its incentivisation and discounts of its charging regimes, can attract and sustain-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#O00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424192400,"counter":2027,"content":"<p>But is there not a win-win for both the airport and the airline if there is certainty regarding costs and everything into the future?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#O00800","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424192400,"counter":2028,"content":"<p>Not necessarily.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#O00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424192400,"counter":2029,"content":"<p>Why?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#O01000","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1424192400,"counter":2030,"content":"<p>Because going back every five years is far more advantageous in extracting value than is committing to a 15-year term.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#O01100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424192400,"counter":2031,"content":"<p>In terms of the region, is that not what this boils down to?

In a way, the presentations were much clearer than that made by Mr. Willie Walsh last week.  It is clear that both Aer Lingus and IAG intend to develop a hub in Ireland.  It is equally clear the hub will be based in Dublin Airport.  We have two State-owned airport groups, Shannon Airport and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA.  Is it possible to develop two hubs in a small country?  Mr. Walsh is of the view that it is not possible.  Mr. Kavanagh referred to Switzerland.  It is one of the few small countries with two, albeit relatively small, hubs in Geneva and Z&uuml;rich.  They are both connected with the state railway infrastructure.  There are many proposals to link Dublin Airport with the rail network, but I have not heard anybody mention Shannon Airport for ten years now.  Perhaps one cannot link one without the other because of state aid rules, but that is a different issue.  If Dublin Airport becomes a hub which, undoubtedly, would be good news for the airport, could Shannon Airport also become a hub?  Could it even survive as a transatlantic destination?  Would economies of scale inevitably pull all transatlantic flights from Ireland into Dublin Airport?<\/p> <p>  Mr. Barrington referred to new Aer Lingus US destinations, one on the east coast and one on the west coast.

Mr. Barrington&rsquo;s shareholding pales in comparison to that of the current chief executive.  Mr. Christoph M&uuml;ller received 1.5 million shares.  Now that Mr. Kavanagh is about to become chief executive officer, will he receive a similar share offering?  Is this standard for chief executive officers?  I am asking this question because I would find it very difficult to make a clear-sighted decision if the difference between one or the other was &euro;765,000.

It has no coverage here, it was just a small video.  I apologise.<\/p> <p>  I also apologise that I missed the first part of this meeting, I was at another meeting.  I welcome everybody here.  We all speak for our own regions and I am from County Mayo.  We are all delighted with the first charter flight from New York to Knock.  I know Aer Lingus played an important role in that coming about and Mr. Kavanagh in particular was instrumental.  In reality, what are the possibilities of us having more transatlantic charter flights, even schedule flights?  How feasible is that?  Would Mr. Kavanagh consider it?  Has he considered it as part of what he has agreed regarding this charter flight?  I know the appetite exists.  At the meeting last week I mentioned that, when the previous airline operated a transatlantic flight there, the route did not fail - there were other issues with that airline which caused the overall company to run into difficulty.  There is a massive appetite for this route and I know so many people who used it and would look forward to using it again.  <\/p> <p>  We are talking about the entire west and north-west area.  We have very poor connectivity in terms of roads.  If one were to draw a line from Galway up to Louth, there are no motorways, so this is a regional airport of significance.  I would like Aer Lingus to expand on that.  I know Deputy McNamara talked about the dangers of hubs and what that means for transatlantic traffic from Shannon, but I would like to think there could be further flights out of Knock.  Perhaps Mr. Kavanagh could set out the realities of that and give it consideration.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#Q00300","speaker":"1070"},{"type":"speech","time":1424192400,"counter":2059,"content":"<p>There are a lot of questions from the four Deputies.

I do not believe the same level of opportunity exists there because Shannon is not connected to Europe in the way Dublin is, nor will it be.  It is simply a fact that the demand for travel to and from Dublin is exponentially greater than the demand for travel to and from Shannon.  A hub needs connectivity.  The ability to flow passengers through Dublin, and the natural demand through Dublin, is on a different scale.<\/p> <p>  I do not believe that, as it builds out, Dublin will necessarily compete with or cannibalise Shannon.  There is resilient demand in Shannon.  The challenge always has been to profitably serve that demand.  The Dublin to New York route at peak has seven services a day, while Shannon to New York maintains two services a day in competition.  That is demonstrative of the resilience of routes at Shannon where there is demand.  The issue is the opportunity for growth and I see access to Oneworld selling access to other parties.  Actively selling Aer Lingus capacity neutrally can be only beneficial, but I do not see significant growth opportunities in terms of additional routes and frequencies.   It consolidates the opportunity that exists currently.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the basis of the valuation, I believe both the company and its advisers reviewed all of the assets - that was one of the criteria for valuation - as well as the more traditional valuation metrics, future earnings, past earnings, capital employed, etc.  All of the same criteria were used that would be used by the Government advisers in confirming the attractiveness or otherwise of the &euro;2.55 a share valuation.

After we entered a commitment, it was to prove that this vehicle was capable of delivering a sustainable profit and, thus, a sustainable service.<\/p> <p>  I will make a correction.  We never committed to providing a year-round, 365-day service to Boston and New York.  We signed a commercial arrangement with the Shannon Airport Authority that clearly stated the Shannon-New York service would be a nine-month one, with no service in the traditionally heavy loss-making and seasonally weakest first quarter.  Nevertheless, the Shannon-Boston route would be serviced on a 12-month basis.  We have fully met our commitments to the airport and communication at the time.  Be it a miscommunication or otherwise, we never committed to providing a year-round, twice daily service; rather, we committed to maintaining a year-round service.<\/p> <p>  The price of flights in this context could be expected and the consumer has more opportunities and choices.  It is the value proposition that will convert the consumer.  If one loses price competitiveness in an intensely competitive marketplace, one will lose traffic.  For example, Shannon Airport's customers have choices with United Airlines and Delta Airlines.  There is demand for services from the airport.  We should have confidence that there is a natural market between Shannon Airport and North America.  If British Airways or any other enterprise attempts to direct that traffic, competition will fill the vacuum.  That is what we see on a daily basis.  Across the world there are few monopolies in air transportation.  It is becoming transparent and in airlines' interests to maximise revenue, but there is always choice for consumers.<\/p> <p>  Turning to the issue of Dublin Airport and pricing, I will use the San Francisco example.  If a consumer can find a cheaper route via Heathrow Airport, please let him or her make that choice.  We are operating a Dublin-San Francisco route.  Just as there are cheaper ways, in some instances, of getting to San Francisco from Dublin than with Aer Lingus, there are also cheaper ways of getting from Paris to San Francisco, some of which involve Aer Lingus, than using Air France's direct service.

It is a market test and we will learn some things.  The scale from which we have benefited as a result of growth in the past number of years, including the addition of the Boeing 757 to our fleet to complement the wide-body A330s, gives us a greater capacity to trial and compete for business of this kind.  Let us see how it goes.  It was peak summer, it involved competing for very scarce aircraft resources and it won.  We are cautiously optimistic that it can be repeated.  It is a seasonal opportunity, though, and not even close to being a daily one, but it could deliver a service to Knock airport that did not previously exist.

It operates at a particular time of the day which is not too resource intensive on the aircraft but it fits the demands of the marketplace, but British Airways does not sell it.  Aer Lingus is singularly the airline that is selling the seats at both ends of the marketplace.  It encapsulates the opportunity.  If BA were to begin selling Knock as a destination, that bring us back to the basic point of this proposition, namely, that more people consider Knock as a destination.  Gatwick Airport is British Airways second most important hub.  It does not serve Dublin, Knock, or Belfast from Gatwick.  What Aer Lingus gains is that most powerful player in the UK market with significant loyalty based on a frequent flyer programme, to which Aer Lingus currently does not have access, and a vested interest in selling seats between London and Knock, which does not currently exist.  That can only be positive for the sustainability of the air route between Knock and London.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#T01800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424192400,"counter":2166,"content":"<p>That is the answer I wanted.

In the event this particular transaction does not complete, Aer Lingus has its own growth programme but the composition of employment in Aer Lingus will continue to change.  There are some processes within Aer Lingus that over time no longer had value for the customer, or the process has been replaced by automation or various things.  What I can say is that, ultimately, as Aer Lingus grows the level of employment in Aer Lingus will grow but the composition of that employment is dynamic.  A growing Aer Lingus in terms of fleet will ultimately require the workforce to accrue.  We are a relatively lean airline.  We have been through many restructurings in the past 20 years, in stark contrast to many carriers that continue to exist in Europe.  That is how we have managed to withstand fierce competition from a very successful local incumbent.  There will be job losses but there will be job losses in areas that do not add value to the enterprise.  Forgive me for being blunt, but if customers do not value the service, the service does not get produced.  Ultimately, however, there will be more employment opportunities created within the business in other areas.  That is what growth ultimately delivers.  Our proposition is that the growth and the opportunity that can be delivered is much greater under an IAG proposal than on a stand-alone basis but, as I said earlier, that does not invalidate our current business.  It is simply an acceleration of an ability to take full advantage of that opportunity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/TRJ2015021700002#T02300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Stephen Kavanagh"},{"type":"speech","time":1424192400,"counter":2171,"content":"<p>I was listening to Mr. Kavanagh on the Knock episode and I do not think he is over enthusiastic about growing a big service in Knock.
