The T&aacute;naiste was in complete denial about the situation in Dublin.  It has been brought to our attention by all stakeholders.

It is an absolute priority that we get that environment right.  It is widely acknowledged, and I think the Deputy would acknowledge, that these challenges have their origin in a range of social phenomena, including drug dependency and homelessness - challenges which are long-standing and go well beyond the capacity of criminal justice agencies to address on their own.  Dealing with these matters requires a very co-ordinated approach from State agencies involved in social, housing, health and drug treatment services, as well as partnership with business, community and voluntary groups.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na already partners many of these groups in a range of local consultative and representative structures in Dublin and elsewhere.  I will bring a recent initiative to the Deputy's attention.  This is a new high-level group involving Dublin City Council, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and the HSE, the aim of which is to oversee strategic and coherent responses in the city centre area.  This is absolutely essential.  I will meet the group, as well as Dublin city businesses, with a view to identifying how the ongoing efforts to enhance public safety and the overall environment in the city centre can be further supported and strengthened.<\/p><p>  Since June 2013 the Garda has had a city centre policing plan, which it is working to.  There are high-visibility Garda patrols in key commercial and public thoroughfares.  The question of where these patrols take place is an operational matter, and the Garda monitors this on an ongoing basis.  Obviously, there are focused resources in specific areas, a few of which I will mention in the brief time remaining.  Operation Pier concentrates on the south quays and Temple Bar.<\/p><p>There are two other operations, one of which is Operation Spire.  According to provisional statistics for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na analysis service for the first nine months of the year, the total number of drug searches is up by 5% in the north central area around Store Street and by 24% in the south central Pearse Street division.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800003#A00500","speaker":"1009","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416319500,"counter":12,"content":"<p>Outside of members of the public with whom we deal every day of the week, other stakeholders such as hoteliers, publicans, retailers and restaurateurs are very concerned about this matter.

Similarly on the southside, Donnybrook, Irishtown, Kevin Street, Kilmainham and Pearse Street statinos have also experienced reductions.  Is the Minister satisfied with the current crime figures, particularly in Dublin city centre, and if not, does she have plans to deal with crime in the city centre outside of the operations to which she referred?  Given the aforementioned decreases in garda numbers across stations on the north side and south side of Dublin, what does she envisage as the optimum number of members of the force?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800004#B00200","speaker":"1057"},{"type":"speech","time":1416319500,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I could respond to the Deputy in a number of ways.  When one examines exactly what is happening in policing in the Dublin area, one will see that the number of public order offences is down by 7% in the south central, Pearse Street, area and 19% in the Store Street area.  I see these figures as reflecting a broad positive trend.  We do not want to alarm people unnecessarily, but we want to make the appropriate policing and operational decisions in respect of the points the Deputy raised.  I have discussed these issues with the acting Garda Commissioner and I am confident these decisions are being taken on an ongoing basis.<\/p><p>  Given the investment the Government has made, I would describe budget 2015 as a breakthrough budget for the justice sector because it provides for the first year-on-year budget increase since 2008.  It is important to acknowledge that we have put money into policing.  We have 300 new recruits, the first since 2008.  In the period 2012 to 2014 we have allocated &euro;414 million more than the Deputy's party in its national recovery plan.  These resources will make a difference in giving the acting Garda Commissioner the opportunity to deploy more garda&iacute;, as appropriate.

My party has also proposed to establish a dedicated public order unit which could deal with anti-social behaviour in Dublin city centre.  During the years we have seen the benefits of dedicated Garda units, for example, the armed response unit, in getting to grips with gangland crime in my native city of Limerick, and the dedicated drugs units.  Stakeholders in our capital city see merit in having a dedicated public order unit for Dublin city centre and the metropolitan region.

I have been fortunate enough since my appointment to meet a wide range of people who have issues with the operation of the criminal justice system.  Many of them feel the system has not served them as well as it should have, or have suggestions as to how it can be improved.  They include victims of sexual assault, people who have lost loved ones on the roads, others who have lost loved ones in brutal circumstances, and some who regard themselves as having been treated unfairly by agencies of the State.<\/p><p>  In considering any request for a meeting, I must take into account any mechanisms, statutory or otherwise, which are in place for dealing with individual cases and avoid taking any action which might interfere with those processes in any way.  In the case, for example, of persons with complaints against An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I am obliged to take into account whether the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is examining the matter.  In addition, as the Deputy will be aware, I have introduced an independent review mechanism.  In summary, my decisions in regard to meetings are determined by my best assessment of where the public interest lies.<\/p><p>  While I have met people with a wide range of views, I have given particular priority to the needs of victims of crime.  In recent days, for instance, the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, and I met key stakeholders in Dublin Castle for a consultation on a new strategy for dealing with domestic violence, where we met with representatives of Victims' Rights Alliance and I launched a report for Rape Crisis Network Ireland.  This is against the background of the priority I am giving to the implementation in Ireland in 2015 of the EU directive on victims' rights, which will help to introduce an important balance into our criminal justice system.<\/p><p> The Deputy, speaking in this House, recently drew a contrast between the decision of the Taoiseach to meet with Ma&iacute;ria Cahill and what he portrays as a reluctance on my part or on the part of anybody else in government to meet with other individuals seeking justice.  That is a very disingenuous claim.  While issues surrounding the prosecution of Ms Cahill's case are being examined in the North, the central issue which has given rise to great public concern is not how her case was handled by the agencies in Northern Ireland but how it was handled by the Provisional IRA and Sinn F&eacute;in.  While there are mechanisms in place to ensure the agencies of this State and those in Northern Ireland are accountable, no one appears to be accountable for the way Ms Cahill was treated by the Provisional movement.\u00a0 The Deputy is being disingenuous in drawing a comparison between my meetings with victims of crime and the Taoiseach's meeting with Ms Cahill.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800005#C00400","answer":true,"speaker":"1009"},{"type":"speech","time":1416319800,"counter":20,"content":"<p>As I have pointed out to the Minister before, a significant number of people contacted me following her intervention in the Ma&iacute;ria Cahill case.

This figure had reduced from a level of approximately 122,000 at the start of the year.  I am further advised that an inspector in each Garda district in the Dublin metropolitan region and in each division outside the region is tasked with managing the execution of warrants and other issues relating to them.  In addition, specific members of the force are tasked with their execution and there is ongoing liaison with the Prison Service and the Courts Service, as well as with other State agencies on these matters.<\/p><p>  Genuine difficulties can arise where it does not prove possible to enforce a warrant and it is important that systems are in place to ensure that warrants are enforced as quickly as possible.  In this regard, I have been assured that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na gives priority to the execution of warrants in respect of serious crime and will continue to do so.  I am conscious that difficulties in the execution of warrants have been a matter of concern over many years.  It is also true that this is a longstanding difficulty for many police forces around the world.  I welcome the analysis provided by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate on warrants in the recent crime investigation report.<\/p><p>  The inspectorate report, as the Deputy has seen, acknowledges the difficulties often faced by garda&iacute; in pursuing the execution of warrants but it also points to significant deficiencies in the current systems in this area and makes a number of short, medium and longer term recommendations in the report.  Some of the difficulties are very much tied to the technology, which must be addressed.  I am working with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to secure the necessary and early investment in upgrading Garda technology.  It is extremely important.<\/p><p>  Highlighted in the report is the number of warrants generated as a result of non-payment of fines and in circumstances where imprisonment was over time the only option available to the court.  Under the Fines (Payment and Recovery) Act 2014, alternatives to imprisonment are now provided for, and the aim is to reduce significantly the number of persons committed for non-payment.

In July 2012, there were 124,000 bench warrants outstanding and as of the first quarter of this year, the figure is approximately 113,000.  That is unjustifiable and indicative of a major dysfunction.  The people impacted the most are victims of crime, and we must be most concerned about them.

The report acknowledges the dedication and commitment of members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and notes that many of the issues raised have been identified in other police forces.  The report makes many recommendations and one of the key ones relates to the establishment of an expert group.  However, there are also recommendations relating to the establishment of around 16 other groups and I must carefully examine them to find the best way forward to manage the implementation process.  Clearly, there will also be a role for a police authority and I intend to establish the group mentioned by the Deputy very shortly.<\/p><p>I need to consider the membership of the group.  Certain recommendations were made and I will examine a range of other questions in establishing the group which I will establish shortly.<br\/><br\/>Other areas where we are taking action which reflects some of the work done in the Garda Inspectorate's report include the independent policing authority and strengthening the powers of GSOC.

I understand this is the first time a Government has had a Cabinet sub-committee on justice.  It is important to have this mechanism to oversee the changes that we are implementing.  It is a useful one to have.

I met the director and some of his staff to discuss what is stated in the report.  I asked them for their best thinking on how we should move forward.  They suggested, particularly in respect of the reclassification issue whereby the figure is 8% in Ireland and 4% elsewhere, that they would examine all 1 million entries on the PULSE system.  Obviously, they are keen to ensure there has been no contamination of the statistics and that they are accurate.  They are doing this independently and will report by the end of the year or the beginning of the new year.  I have not announced it before, but the CSO is going to carry out a victimisation survey in Ireland also.

Broadly, they welcome it.  They have made the interesting observation that there was nothing in it that they could not have told us about resources.  I am referring specifically to the issue of rosters.  There has been significant criticism of the rostering system, the matter of Garda vehicles and the fact that many trained garda&iacute; are tied down in doing administrative work.  All of this arises from the cutbacks made in recent years.  One of the most annoying things for me and, more importantly, front-line members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was the terminology used of smart policing and modernisation that we kept getting from the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, and the former Minister, Deputy Alan Shatter.  It was nonsense.  The bottom line was that they were dressing up the cutbacks and their impact as being something else.  The report shows the urgent need for real modernisation and to deal with the impact of the cutbacks.  There will be a challenge for the Government in deploying resources, although I recognise that the Minister went some of the way in the recent budget.

The scheme is limited to these 12 institutions and there is no intention to expand it to include further institutions.  Significant progress has been made in implementation of the scheme.  Decisions have been made on 86% of the 774 applications received and 482 applicants have received lump sum payments, at a cost of &euro;17.5 million.  Many individual cases have been dealt with.  Some 95 cases were refused, as the people concerned had not been in a relevant institution.

After approximately a year and a half, the nuns built an extension called the building An Grian&aacute;n, but all of the girls who were in this so-called training centre worked in the laundry.  There is a difference in the case of An Grian&aacute;n which people accept was, in effect, a laundry.  In a previous response to me, the Minister said the scheme was limited specifically to those women who had been both resident and worked in the 12 institutions listed.  However, two other training centres are included, namely, the centre in Wexford and the one in Summerhill.  Therefore, there are difficulties for this group of women.

It is a very detailed report with more than 500 recommendations.  It is suggested in the report that these recommendations are short, medium and long-term.  Clearly, we need mechanisms to implement that report, and there are a variety of ways in which that report will be implemented.  They include, in the first instance, establishing the type of expert group that the Garda Inspectorate said should drive this process, so I intend to establish this expert group very shortly.<\/p><p>  Another recommendation that was made related to the statistics that are currently gathered and dealt with in PULSE.  There were some concerns about reclassification.  I have asked the CSO to carry out a review.  It has suggested carrying out a review of the entirety of entries on PULSE - around 1 million - so that it can look not just at a sample, as the Garda Inspectorate did, but at 1 million entries, analyse them and see how much of the reclassification in the report is matched when one examines the overall entries.  This will be very important to ensure confidence in the system.<\/p><p>  The Cabinet justice sub-committee will also monitor the reforms that are under way, including those recommended in the Garda Inspectorate report.  Obviously, the report will play an important role in the ongoing reform we have announced, which includes the establishment of the independent policing authority, strengthening the powers of GSOC and the current recruitment of the Garda Commissioner.  <\/p><p>  A range of actions need to be undertaken.

The article laid bare an appalling and shameful scandal concerning the number of homeless children in present-day Ireland, particularly in Dublin.  Tonight, 700 children will be sleeping in hostels, hotel rooms or other forms of emergency accommodation.  These children are not in their own bedrooms and are not in what they could call their homes or communities.  There is only one reason for it: their parents cannot pay the rent.  This is a country-wide problem.  There are around 118 children in this situation outside Dublin, but it has been particularly acute in Dublin over the past 18 months.  In May <br\/><br\/>2013, there were about 58 adults with children in emergency accommodation - bed and breakfast accommodation, hotel rooms and so on.  Fast forward to November 2013, and that figure had doubled to 128 adults with children in emergency accommodation.  By May 2014 the figure had risen to 184, and in October 2014, we were looking at 421 adults and around 700 children in emergency accommodation.<\/p><p>That is shameful by any standards, particularly if we are meant to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  The fundamental issue in an emergency and crisis response sense is that the rent allowance caps introduced by the T&aacute;naiste have exacerbated the situation beyond belief.  Essentially, someone in receipt of rent allowance can pay only a certain amount of rent because of the cap.  It has proved catastrophic for the families concerned.  These are low income families and the majority of them have not experienced homelessness previously.  The anxiety, stress and trauma it causes to parents and their children are enormous.  A five year old child was quoted as saying, \"I can't draw my house -  I don't remember what it looks like....At weekends I don't have friends come to play.\"<\/p><p>Does the Taoiseach accept this is a crisis and that it demands an emergency response?

Last year Focus Ireland saw eight families going homeless every month.  This year the figure is 50 per month.  That is Focus Ireland alone.  The Taoiseach referred to the pilot scheme which it initiated.  This cannot be solved on a case-by-case basis; it requires a system-wide response.  The most effective emergency response is to raise the rent caps.  People are currently restricted in what they can pay if they are in receipt of rent allowance.  Basically, it is completely out of kilter with what the market is demanding in rents, with the result that thousands of low income families across the country cannot access private rented accommodation.  Will the Taoiseach face up to that, accept that the change was catastrophic and recognise that something needs to happen?  The rent allowance caps have to be raised immediately and rent control has to be considered if that is an issue.  A change to the rent allowance caps would make an immediate difference.  The 700 children who are sleeping in hotel rooms or bed and breakfasts tonight cannot wait until 2020 to have this problem solved.

Cuts to rent supplement, child benefit, back to school and footwear allowance and respite care grants are just a few of the measures which have ensured that did not happen.

The fact is that the protests taking place in recent months have overwhelmingly been peaceful.  This protest is not led by any political party or any groupings of politicians.

It is worrying that in quarter 2, 1,752 private principal dwelling houses were in arrears for over 720 days, or two years.  Does the Taoiseach agree that this is troubling?  Behind this, there is a lot of suffering and pressure with which public representatives are familiar in visiting constituents and laying out their books.  Their incomes simply will not allow them to make the necessary payments that the banks are demanding.  They are living in constant fear of having their homes repossessed.  In this light, should the Taoiseach not have taken my advice and that of others to have a write-down of unsustainable mortgages to affordable levels, just as the banks received a write-down on the backs of the people?  By comparison, does he not feel ashamed that previous Governments in the 1970s which were right-wing year after year built 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 and in one year over 8,000 local authority homes?  Is the record of the Government and its predecessor not dismal in comparison?  That construction level is now needed to meet the terrible suffering as a result of the housing crisis.

The Government then had to act to provide a range of opportunities both for lenders and borrowers in order that they could sit down to work out solutions to the problem of mortgage arrears.  The central principle was that the loss of a home should be the very last resort.  For instance, the Government put together the Personal Insolvency Act 2012 which introduced three new forms of non-judicial debt settlement arrangement.  It also reduced the automatic discharge period for bankruptcy from 12 years to three.  It is complicated legislation.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland has been established to regulate these new debt settlement arrangements.  It opened to accept applications in September 2013.  As of September 2014, there were 141 personal insolvency practitioners.  They develop either debt settlement arrangements or personal insolvency arrangements, two of the new debt solutions.  There are also 94 individuals who are capable of acting as approved intermediaries and can develop a debt relief notice.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland has indicated that there are hundreds of cases in the pipeline which are at varying stages of verification before they can be forwarded to the court for a decision.  The court may issue a protective certificate which offers debtors legal protection for a period of 70 days, during which time an arrangement between the creditors and the insolvent debtor can be put together.  To date, 172 debt relief notices, 59 debt settlement arrangements and 80 personal insolvency arrangements have been approved.  There is, as yet, no definitive evidence of banks vetoing proposals.  There is some evidence that banks are attempting to reach agreements with their clients short of entering into a formal insolvency process.  Banks are becoming more focused in their attempts to reduce their mortgage arrears books.  The existence of the Insolvency Service of Ireland is helping as a catalyst in this process.  <\/p><p>  Since March 2013, the Central Bank has set quarterly targets for six banks to make offers of sustainable solutions to customers in arrears for in excess of 90 days.  They are Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, permanent tsb, Ulster Bank, ACC Bank and KBC Bank.  The targets for 2014 were set as 70% in quarter 1, 75% in quarter 2, 80% in quarter 3 and 85% in quarter 4.  There is considerable progress being made in meeting these targets.  Banks have reported that they are satisfied with all of targets up to quarter 1 in 2014.  An independent audit has confirmed the banks' progress up to quarter 4 in 2013.<\/p><p>  Following the introduction of a mortgage-to-rent scheme which facilitates families in staying in their homes by the transfer of ownership to a local authority or an approved housing body, to date, 2,465 cases have been put forward by lenders, of which some 1,437 have been progressed, while 41 cases have been fully completed.  The Department has acknowledged that the number of cases remains quite low and a review of the scheme is being undertaken.  This has resulted in quite a number of changes to the process with the housing agency taking a much more managerial role in the scheme.  It is expected that the changes will result in more cases being processed and concluded in the not too distant future.<\/p><p>  Another development involved a mortgage arrears information and advisory service which included a website, a helpline and an advice service.  There have been 238,000 visits to the website since June 2012.  Some 11,500 telephone calls have been received by the helpline.  Data provided by the Central Bank for lenders from quarter 4 in 2012 to quarter 1 in 2014 indicate that there were some 27,500 long-term forbearance offers, with just under 560 invoices being received by lenders.  A review of the independent financial advice service has been completed.  These reforms are being progressed, including the introduction of advice at an earlier stage, in order that borrowers in negotiations with their banks will know what is available.  In addition, a special rate of mortgage interest relief for first-time buyers was introduced and available from 2004 to 2008.  These are some instances in which conclusions have been reached. <\/p><p>  As Deputy Joe Higgins is well aware, it is ultimately a case of lenders sitting down with borrowers to work out a solution that, in the circumstances, is best for those with a mortgage in order that a conclusion suitable to their needs and appropriate to their circumstances can be reached.  It is not fully satisfactory by any means, but it is moving very much in the right direction.  At the end of the day, the principal requirement concerns the safety of the family home.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800021#T00200","speaker":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1416327300,"counter":236,"content":"<p>As I understand it, the Cabinet sub-committee is trying to find solutions to the problems of mortgage arrears and the lack of credit.  There is not a Teachta D&aacute;la who has not had to deal with hard-pressed families who are beside themselves because they cannot afford to repay their mortgages.  While some progress has been made, there has been very little in dealing with the issue of long-term mortgage arrears.  Meanwhile, business people in the small and medium enterprise sector, in which about 70% of people are employed, cannot obtain the required finance.  This is particularly the case for businesses which could potentially progress at this time.  How does the Government deal with this matter?<\/p><p>  In July the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform produced a good report, for which, I understand, there was cross-party support.  It called for worthwhile policy changes, including, for example, the rejection of the Cental Bank's general acceptance of legal solutions as sustainable and a request for the Minister to intervene, in line with his stated views, and ensure legal letters were not regarded as satisfactory solutions.<\/p><p>  Another recommendation made in the report was that each bank involved in the mortgage arrears resolution target process be mandated to provide all relevant customers with all available solutions as specified in the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  It is such a simple matter.<\/p><p><i>4 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The committee called for the promised legislation on the code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, to be progressed with the utmost urgency by the Department of Finance to provide both legislative protection to homeowners and address the legal uncertainty that exists at present.

The Government appears to show no interest in implementing them.  I am trying to figure out the role of the Cabinet sub-committee, if any, in dealing with reports like this from the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p><p> With regard to credit availability, the Credit Review Office published a report recently that said there had been some progress but noted, &quot;there continues to be a challenge in obtaining finance for those SMEs which have been distressed but are now recovering, and are viable or potentially viable &ndash; particularly those with property debt overhangs&quot;.  The report speaks of market failure on the supply side.  In other words, we do not have a functional credit system.

Will the Government consider applying for a banking licence for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and give us some sense of where the Cabinet sub-committee does its work?  Does the sub-committee communicate with the banks?  Has the Taoiseach asked the banks whether they will take on board the recommendations of the  Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform or from the Credit Review Office?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800021#T00300","speaker":"1066","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416327900,"counter":238,"content":"<p>Deputy Adams mentioned small and medium-size enterprises and the facilities available to them.  With regard to mortgages, at the end of August 2014, which is the end of quarter 3, there were 691,434 mortgages or mortgage accounts.  The total number of accounts not in arrears at the end of quarter 3 2014 was 595,319.  That means the total number of mortgage accounts in arrears from one day past due date is 96,115.  The total number of mortgage accounts in arrears of greater than 90 days is 67,854.  The total number of mortgage accounts in arrears of 90 days or less is 28,261.  With regard to mortgages in arrears of more than 90 days past due date, there were 19,811 restructures, with 14,900 permanent restructures and 4,840 temporary restructures and there were 48,443 in arrears greater than 90 days but not restructured.<\/p><p>  The SME situation has been critical for some time.  The unstructured banks that applied when the Government was elected was something that had to be dealt with, and their restructuring involved setting up two pillar banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, and the Central Bank setting targets for them.  Deputy Adams raises an important point about access to credit for SMEs, which are the back bone of the country and for which so many job opportunities rely.  The Deputy is aware that the Government has put in place an Action Plan for Jobs which is followed through and monitored by the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation under the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.  A range of measures were introduced, including the credit guarantee scheme, which will shortly be widened in scope after an external review.  It was not working in the way it should have been working.<\/p><p>  Microfinance Ireland was established to provide unsecured business loans of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;25,000 for commercially viable propositions that had been declined bank credit, or in other words, to give them an opportunity to get in there.  The Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, will make &euro;7 billion of resources available to support SME funding and for investment on a commercial basis to support economic activity and employment in the country.  The local enterprise offices, which were set up as a one-stop shop in local authority areas, mean that anyone seeking information on support, starting, and growing a business in Ireland have the facilities available to them.  The enhancement of the Credit Review Office under Mr. Trethowan, which provides a very simple and effective review process for small and medium-size enterprises, including sole traders and farm enterprises, applies where requests for credit are refused or existing credit facilities are withdrawn or reduced.  This includes increasing the limit for loan applications that can be reviewed from &euro;500,000 to &euro;3 million.  The House is aware of the value of the Credit Review Office, which was overturned refusals by banks in over 50% of cases.  It is important information for SMEs to be aware of.  If they are turned down by banks, the Credit Review Office can analyse the application and has overturned a great number of decisions.<\/p><p>  There was also the development of the online tool for supporting SMEs to establish the State supports for which they may be eligible.  It is available on one site so that any retailer or SME owner can have the access to credit checked quickly and efficiently.  It is popular with SMEs.  The Government increased the VAT cash threshold from &euro;1.25 million to &euro;2 million in last year's budget.<\/p><p>  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland is an important development.  I met Chancellor Merkel last year at the meeting held in Paris to deal with youth employment and unemployment.  I stressed the importance of a country like Germany assisting Ireland in credit opportunities for small and medium-size enterprises.  The result was that the structure of the KfW triple-A rated State bank in Germany was made available to us, with significant sums of money invested.  Together with the Silicon Valley Bank, the European Investment Bank and our resources in the NTMA, we were able put on the table &euro;800 million in secured funding.  The legislation establishing the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland allows &euro;5 billion to be made available to SMEs over the next five years.  I expect to leverage capacity from the &euro;800 million will make credit readily available to SMEs at longer terms and with greater flexibility than under the current structures of the banks.<\/p><p>  In budget 2015, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, announced that Permanent TSB, which will shortly recommence actively lending to the SME sector, has agreed to participate in the Credit Review Office process.  Ulster Bank is also actively considering making a similar commitment.  These are important developments providing extra security, clarity and certainty to SMEs.<\/p><p>  The Government has also made changes to the employment and investment incentive scheme, including by increasing the amount of finance that can be raised by a company to &euro;5 million annually, subject to a lifetime maximum of &euro;15 million.<\/p><p>The range of enterprises now qualifying is widened and the seed capital scheme will be launched in the coming months by the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  The Departments of Finance and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will roll out an integrated export finance strategy in 2015, with financing products and different platforms being developed by the strategic investment bank and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.  These are important issues.<\/p><p> Deputy Adams is well aware of many cases in the past number of years in which investment abroad by small and medium enterprises, SMEs, has not worked out.  Many of those property issues have dragged down working SMEs that have been commercially viable.  There has been quite a deal of engagement with the banks in respect of those cases where a business is commercially viable but is being dragged down by purchases of property.<\/p><p> These are some of the issues on which the Government has focused directly with small and medium enterprises.  It is a matter of listening to those voices and addressing the issues they feel are important for improving their business propositions in order that they can take on more employees, expand their remit and provide services to bigger firms in a better way.  It is about enabling them to export and providing an opportunity for more people to be employed, which is an essential part - and a consequence - of having extra availability of credit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800022#U00200","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416328500,"counter":240,"content":"<p>Bh&iacute; s&eacute; sin an-suimi&uacute;l, ach n&iacute;or thug an Taoiseach freagra dom faoi an strategic banking corporation.

For the past three and a half years, the Government's approach has been to leave the issue to the banks.  The impact of the personal insolvency legislation has been negligible; the Taoiseach mentioned 172 cases.  Despite all the elaborate debate and the creation of a large white elephant, there has been no real impact on those with mortgage arrears.  There has been mention of a figure of 90,000 to 100,000 people who have been significantly in arrears for quite some time.<\/p><p>  Many people have examined significant corporations and big businesses that are getting significant discounts on loans.  For the average family in mortgage arrears, where a parent may have lost his or her job, there is no sense that anybody has dealt with them in a comprehensive or systemic way.  That is a glaring reality of where we find ourselves.  To a large extent, the Government took a hands-off approach to the crisis, especially with regard to the worst-hit families or those which are two years in arrears.  The number of people who are more than two years in arrears is continuing to increase.  Those people have not had any relief or seen significant structural changes to their debt which would allow them to contribute to the economy into the future and have a sense of certainty about their overall debt position within a reasonable timeframe.  There is a combined value of approximately &euro;8 billion of debt for families, which is of enormous social and economic significance.  The Cabinet sub-committee, if we are to judge it by the frequency of its meetings, has not responded to the severity or depth of the crisis, particularly with regard to families in mortgage arrears.<\/p><p>  There has been no attempt to free up the business side of the equation for small and medium-sized enterprises, and some SME owners have significant property debts that have brought down their business operations.  Clear solutions have not emerged in that regard.  I have dealt with quite a number of families with mortgage arrears and this is a large shadow in these people's lives.  These families are depending very much on the goodwill of a particular bank or person in the bank and the hope that a bank will not engage too heavily.  Different advice may come their way on how to respond.  It has been three and a half years since the process started and it is time to get hands-on with those people who are in severe trouble.

Since August last year, the Department of Finance has published regular reports on what is happening here, engaged with the banks and processed that information.  The figures produced in November this month, drawn from the six main banks, account for approximately 90% of the mortgage market.  That information indicates that progress continues to be made.  The data shows that up to September 2014, the total number of mortgage accounts in arrears - all arrears one day past the due date - is below the 100,000 mark for the first time since August 2013.  The figures relating to the period up to the end of September 2014 underline the progress that has been made for private dwelling homeowners since the figures started being collected.  The figures for principal dwelling houses demonstrate that the number of mortgage accounts in arrears of over 90 days and not in a restructuring arrangement has decreased from 62,210 in August 2013 to 48,043 at the end of September of this year.  This means that engagement between consumers and lenders has led to an increase in permanent mortgage restructuring processes of over 32,400 since the start of the year.  These are the people referred to by the Deputy; they have been under pressure and have had to live for the banks while existing for their families.  In this year alone, 32,400 have reached an acceptable permanent restructuring arrangement.  In 2014, there has been a drop of almost 12,000 in the number of mortgage accounts in arrears of more than 90 days, which is a relief for those people.  The number of split mortgages continues to increase, with over 17,000 in place at the end of August.  That results from discussions and engagement between borrowers and lenders.<\/p><p>  Central Bank mortgage arrears statistics for the second quarter of 2014 reinforce the picture of solid improvement.  For example, the number of mortgage accounts for principal dwelling houses in arrears fell for the fourth consecutive quarter, with the number of principal dwelling house mortgage accounts in arrears of more than 90 days continuing to fall during the second quarter.  This represented a third consecutive decline in the number of principal dwelling house accounts in arrears over 90 days.  Some 101,973 principal dwelling house mortgage accounts were classified as restructured at the end of June.<\/p><p>This reflects a quarter-on-quarter increase of 10.3%.  Of these restructured accounts, some 81.2% were deemed to meet the terms of current restructured arrangements.  It is important to note that restructured accounts can still be classified as in arrears for a trial period until the arrangement is proven to be working.  The figures might be better than those given here because there is a trial period to see whether borrowers can measure up to the restructured arrangements.  This is not a situation in which everyone is out of arrears with permanent restructuring arrangements, but things are heading in the right direction.  We must build on the existing platforms.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800023#V00700","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"minorheading","content":"JobBridge Scheme","time":1416329100,"counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800024#W00150"},{"type":"question","time":1416329100,"counter":248,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[35204\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800024#W00200","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"if his Department have recruited new staff recently; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1416329100,"counter":249,"qnumday":5,"qnumall":"[35667\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800024#W00300","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the position regarding JobBridge interns in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1416329100,"counter":250,"qnumday":6,"qnumall":"[37634\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800024#W00400","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of staff vacancies in his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"992","askee":"1072"},{"type":"question","time":1416329100,"counter":251,"qnumday":7,"qnumall":"[43816\/14]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800024#W00500","dept":"Department of An Taoiseach","minister":"Taoiseach","question":"the number of JobBridge participants who have worked in his Department.","asker":"954","askee":"1072"},{"type":"speech","time":1416329100,"counter":252,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>  My Department recently recruited two administrative officers, three temporary clerical officers and a service attendant.

There are also currently two JobBridge interns in my Department on nine-month internships.<\/p><p>  Since 2012 my Department has hosted eight internships under the JobBridge national internship scheme.  The internships have all been in policy divisions within the Department of the Taoiseach.  The work experience given to our JobBridge interns includes research, communications, policy analysis, summarising of data, report drafting and networking.  JobBridge interns are given training in desk research and information gathering.  They also work with internal document management systems, perform data entry and apply themselves to financial management, general administration and other office duties.  Interns are given practical experience of how central Government works and learn about policy-making structures and initiatives across Government Departments.  Broadly, JobBridge interns get hands-on experience in various aspects of the work of my Department and leave with an enhanced understanding of Government policy.  In line with the JobBridge scheme requirements, each intern is assigned a mentor during his or her full internship in my Department.  At the end of their internships and, again, in line with JobBridge scheme requirements, interns are given a reference and a host organisation evaluation form for their own use.

There must have been glee among the civil servants when the tally was done and it was found that the number of whole-time equivalent staff stood at 179.98, given that the ceiling is set at 181.  The real issue here is the JobBridge scheme.  Across the economy there is a sense that the JobBridge scheme has been abused, though I do not suggest that this applies to the Taoiseach's Department.  It is felt that real jobs have been taken by JobBridge interns who, in turn, will not have a chance to get the job at the end of a nine- or 12-month stint.  Some schools have applied for special needs assistants through the JobBridge scheme.<\/p><p>  Does the Taoiseach accept that where vacancies arise they should be filled as real jobs?  This applies across the board but particularly in the public service.  JobBridge should not be abused to fill vacancies.  Have the pathways to work of the eight JobBridge interns hosted by the Department been evaluated?  I do not doubt that it can be a fruitful and beneficial experience to work as an intern at the Department of the Taoiseach, but I would also like to think it could lead to employment prospects in both the public and private sectors.

A total of 330 interns, including 24 who are currently active, have been hosted in Government Departments.  Jobseekers who apply for internships in the public sector do so knowing there is a moratorium on recruitment.

They cannot get employment because of the barrier, in place up to recently in any case, in the public sector, including in the Taoiseach's Department.<\/p><p> In reality the Taoiseach is flattering people to deceive.

It is important to note that this scheme is monitored rigorously by the Department of Social Protection.  That is why the cleaner, caretaker and the teaching assistant posts were removed from the JobBridge list.  They should not have been there in the first place.<\/p><p>  I believe in the national JobBridge internship scheme.  It came about as a result of recommendations from the private and public sectors arising from the situation whereby young qualified people were unable to get jobs because they did not have any experience and they could not get any experience if the did not have a job.  JobBridge is what it says: it is a bridge to a job for a more permanent and better range of employment.  The scheme also gives unemployed people a chance to match and increase their skills so that they can learn through practical experience and on-the-job coaching and mentoring.<\/p><p>  The figures released by the T&aacute;naiste recently show that since the introduction of the scheme in 2011, a total of 33,068 internship placements have commenced to date, that there are 6,238 jobseekers currently on placements and that a further 2,659 posts are advertised currently on the JobBridge website.  A total of 330 interns, including the 24 now active, have been employed by Departments.

That means we are now at the start of a phase of giving back to the most vulnerable and pressurised by returning money to their pockets and giving them choices about where they want to spend it.  It is not all about the very wealthy or the major corporations.  I came back from America on Saturday morning and the people who work for the airline tell me that Aer Lingus flights are all full on the way out and back to New York, Boston and San Francisco.  The tourism industry in New York tells me that the numbers of bookings by Irish people are very much up from what they were.  There has been a return to substantial purchases of new cars in July, August and September.  These are not by very wealthy people but by ordinary people who have managed to see with greater clarity what lies ahead.  What lies ahead is a 1% income tax reduction next year and the year after and, depending on the choice of the people at an election, the year after that.<\/p><p> The major corporations will be subject to a changed regime, with a transition period extending to 2020, through the ending of the double Irish.  The Government made a decision on this matter in the recent budget and the stateless concept was ended last year.  Ireland continues to play its part, with the OECD, in having the base erosion and profit shifting concept as an international response to a global phenomenon. <\/p><p> At 6 a.m. last Friday, BMS, a major global pharmaceutical company, notified the New York Stock Exchange of its decision to invest &euro;1 billion in Deputy Higgins's constituency.  The investment will result in the employment of 1,000 construction workers for three years and, thereafter, of between 400 and 500 top-class specialist research engineers dealing with products dealing with cancers that will emerge on the basis of BMS data.  The company will supply the world from the location in question.  This investment sends a major signal following the ending of the double Irish because BMS has expressed its confidence that this country measures up.  It is appropriate that we should say this to the IDA and its personnel.  I met representatives of BMS in September and the work that has been done in the meantime will directly benefit the economy of Deputy Higgins's constituency.  I hope that, in one way or another, many of the people who have had a difficult time will be able to avail of the greater economic spread that will arise from the BMS decision to make a &euro;1 billion investment in the constituency represented by Deputies Higgins and Coppinger, the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Health.  These jobs are very welcome.<\/p><p> I am not happy that rural areas have not felt the economic benefits they should have felt.  I hope they will do so.  This is the reason the Government proposed, in its Common Agricultural Policy programme last year, to allocate approximately &euro;2.5 billion for rural development between 2014 and 2020.  The programme has been submitted to the European Commission and I expect it to be approved.  It will provide significant opportunities for Leader and community and voluntary groups, with the local authorities, to create jobs in communities throughout the country. <\/p><p> In reducing the level of VAT in the hospitality sector and abolishing travel tax the Government made a clear decision which sustained the hospitality industry and created 35,000 new jobs.  Real opportunities are available. <\/p><p> Next Monday, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will set out a programme for the development of broadband throughout the country by the private and State sectors.  This is a fundamental priority for the Government because companies require broadband capacity to do business effectively.  These developments and the announcements made on major motorway connections, for example, the opening of the Newlands Cross junction today and the Gort to Tuam motorway project, as well as other road projects in Wexford and elsewhere, are investments and improvements that will result in construction works and job opportunities and benefit the economies of many counties.  We still have a long way to go, however. <\/p><p> To answer Deputy Higgins's question, people tell me they have put up with a great deal and while they know the country is in a stronger position than it was, many of them have yet to feel the benefit of this in their homes and personal lives.  This is what we want to achieve and the Government's strategy will be to continue to give back what we can to hard-pressed communities and provide opportunities for employment and job creation such as those we discussed. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800026#Y01000","speaker":"1072","continuing":true},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Estimates for Public Services 2014: Message from Select Sub-Committee","time":1416330900,"counter":275,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800027#Z00200"},{"type":"speech","time":1416330900,"counter":276,"content":"<p>The Select Sub-Committee on Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has completed its consideration of the following Supplementary Estimate for Public Services for the year ending 31 December 2014 - Vote 33.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800027#Z00300","speaker":"1112"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Order of Business","time":1416330900,"counter":277,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800027#Z00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1416330900,"counter":278,"content":"<p>It is proposed to take Finance Bill 2014 &ndash;

There should also be space for people to debate the water issue, as well as other issues, this week.

It is highly cynical of the Government, and contemptuous of ordinary people and elected representatives.  For several months we have had fear, insecurity and uncertainty, particularly among vulnerable members of our community such as those who are on pensions and living alone, about the new tax the Government proposes.  The situation has been stoked up and made worse by all the speculation in the media, which is planted and fed by Government Ministers.

welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Paudie Coffey, and wish him well on his appointment.  I hope he will convey our concerns about Sligo County Council to the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly.  The council is facing a challenging period, with a substantial capital debt and a growing current spend arising from the gap between annual expenditure and income.  The council's published financial statements show the scale of the problem, as do a range of reports analysing the problem.  In addition, we have had commentary from various sources, some of which has not been helpful in finding a solution.<\/p><p>  My colleague, Deputy Michael Colreavy, and I are taking the opportunity to call on the Government to assist Sligo County Council, given that its difficulties emanate in large part from developments which took place in 2008 and thereabouts.  During the boom Sligo was designated a gateway city based on a projected population of 60,000.  Growth on that level never materialised, but much of the capital investment in which the council engaged was based on this unrealistic growth projection.  The council management team and councillors have been working to address the issue and had a meeting with the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, last week.  The executive, working with the councillors and chairman, is obliged to come up with a clear management plan, based on a ten year timeframe, to deal with the debt.<\/p><p>  Significant savings have been achieved in several areas through policies on redeployment, voluntary transfer and voluntary retirement, while a significant allocation to the capital account has relieved some of the pressure on the current spending debt.  However, there are serious consequences in deferring the problem to a later date.  Reductions in the local government general purpose grant allocation and in planning fees and reduced rate collection revenues have amounted to a significant challenge for the council.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800033#FF02900","speaker":"1081"},{"type":"speech","time":1416334200,"counter":413,"content":"<p>As long ago as last July, Sligo county councillors sought a meeting with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, about the council's precarious budget position.  It is in this precarious position partly because it followed the then Government's policy of investing in water and wastewater infrastructure.  Arising from that investment, the council's costs doubled from &euro;5 million in 2008 to &euro;10 million in 2013.  In the same period, the local government fund, the council's main source of income, was halved in the wake of the mismanagement of the national finances.<\/p><p>  Given that the council was implementing Government policy, had departmental approval at every stage for the infrastructural projects it undertook, endured a dramatic fall in its main funding source and subsequently transferred infrastructure to Irish Water without compensation for its major investment in these assets, it should be given assistance, support and advice.  Despite the difficulties it faces, savings have been made.  I understand, for example, that a workforce action plan has been put forward which provides for the transfer of front-line maintenance staff, including housing staff, arising from the dissolution of Sligo Borough Council.  It seems, however, that there may well be outsourcing of work currently being done by maintenance staff which will ultimately see a higher cost for an inferior service.<\/p><p>  The Minister has refused to meet the councillors or me.  I understand, however, that last week he did meet at least one Deputy and, possibly, a Senator from the Government parties.  The outcome of that meeting seems to be that Sligo County Council has two weeks to get its books in order or it will be replaced by a commissioner.  It is scandalous.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800033#FF03000","speaker":"1083"},{"type":"speech","time":1416334200,"counter":414,"content":"<p>I am taking this Topical Issue on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly.  I thank the Deputies for providing me with an opportunity to clarify the position on the financial difficulties of Sligo County Council.  The continued deterioration of the council's financial position is of serious concern to the Minister, notwithstanding the achievement of savings in recent years, as outlined by the Deputies.  On Thursday, 13 November, the Minister met the chief executive of Sligo County Council and his senior management team to discuss these very issues.  It was a constructive and useful engagement.<\/p><p>  The council has been incurring revenue deficits for several years such that the cumulative deficit now stands at &euro;19.67 million.  Long-term debt is in excess of &euro;120 million.  It is a matter for each local authority to determine its own spending priorities in the context of the annual budgetary process, having regard to Government policy and both locally identified needs and available resources.  The elected members of a local authority have direct responsibility in law for all reserved functions of the authority, which include adopting the annual budget and authorising borrowing.<\/p><p><i>6 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p> Elected members are democratically accountable for all expenditure by the local authority.  The Minister wishes to be clear that the financial difficulties of Sligo County Council have not been caused by the financial model used to fund local authorities.  While it is true that general purpose grant funding to Sligo County Council has decreased from a high of &euro;22.22 million in 2008 to &euro;15.58 million in 2013 - not halved, as Deputy Colreavy stated - this reduction of 29% has been less than the national average of 35%.  Local authorities are independent bodies, with members being responsible for budgetary and borrowing policies, and Sligo County Council has had the same requirements regarding implementing Government policy placed on it as all other local authorities.<\/p><p> Other factors such as poor income collection have significantly contributed to Sligo County Council's financial difficulties.  The commercial rates collection level for the county and borough in 2012 was 62% compared to a national average of 75% and the council's collection level declined even further to 59% in 2013.  Sligo County Council has an uncollected rates debt of &euro;6.8 million.  Its water collection levels have averaged 48% over the period from 2008 to 2012, resulting in an estimated loss of income of over &euro;1 million per year.  Collection levels for housing loans are also poor, at 47%, with arrears of &euro;1 million.  Housing rent income collection is 80%, which is below the level achieved by comparator local authorities.<\/p><p> While it is a matter for individual local authorities, including Sligo County Council, to manage their day-to-day finances in a prudent and sustainable manner, the Department is in regular consultation with the council regarding its financial position.  The Minister has set aside an allocation of &euro;1 million in additional funding for 2014 for Sligo County Council to assist it to take the steps necessary to move to a more sustainable financial position.  The payment of this is fully conditional on a realistic and achievable financial plan, which charts a path to long-term financial sustainability, being agreed between the Department and the council.  Financial stability must take precedence in all of Sligo County Council's planning in the coming years.  It is essential that the 2015 budget addresses the gravity of the financial situation in Sligo County Council, building on the savings achieved to date.<\/p><p> The Minister and the Department are committed to continuing to support the council in its efforts to restore financial stability.  However, as the Minister pointed out at his meeting with Sligo County Council, the next steps need to be taken by the council, through a firm commitment, reflected both in its budget for 2015 and through the agreement of a long-term financial plan with the Department.  By ensuring Sligo County Council is supported in making these difficult decisions that will, in the longer term, place it on a more realistic and sustainable path to growth and renewal, the Minister is certain Sligo can put its difficulties behind it and focus on consolidating its position as a leading economic centre for the north west in the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800033#FF03100","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416334800,"counter":416,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister regarding the management plan.

The Minister has met the county manager and the chairperson of the county council regarding the potential to create a plan and the urgency of putting the plan in place.  The Minister has set aside &euro;1 million for 2014 on condition that a plan of action will be formulated.  I have spoken to the manager and the chairperson, and they are working on a plan for the county's future finances, which will be on the Minister&rsquo;s desk in the next week.  I am delighted to note that the Minister will work with the council in an amicable way to deal with the financial challenges which, clearly, have been inherited from 2008.  The most important aspect of this is that the financial indebtedness of the council has been there for a number of years.  The council cannot take any cuts to services in the county.  We are very anxious to ensure no cuts take place and that we work out a long-term, ten-year solution to deal with the accrued debt on the council&rsquo;s books.

I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, will relay my concerns to his colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton.  The Lough Swilly bus company provided a service from Buncrana to Derry city, including all the stops along the way.  The service was very important to the elderly and disabled people who use the route.  Given that the Lough Swilly bus company has gone into receivership, a new company, McGonagle bus service of Buncrana, has taken over the route.  Under the rules around the free travel scheme, however, it has not been able to avail of financial assistance that would enable it to provide a free bus service to the elderly and disabled.  It is unfair.  In recent days I have learned that Ms Marian Harkin, MEP, has pursued the issue at European level and the European Commission has ruled that the Government cannot do what it is doing.<\/p><p>If the Minister of State has not received a response from his departmental officials, I ask him to have the matter checked out.  My understanding is that the European Commission has ruled against Ireland, saying that it cannot deny entry to the scheme.  That would include McGonagle's bus services, so hopefully that will resolve the issue.  <\/p><p> I am disappointed, however, because elderly and disabled people along the route have been put to considerable economic hardship by having to pay for a service that is free for every other elderly or disabled person across this State.  It is not a case of freezing a service, because the Minister of State has taken the service away without reinstating it.  If the service was frozen, he would have ensured that the new company, which is on exactly the same route that was always historically provided, would be provided with the financial assistance to cater for elderly and disabled passengers.<\/p><p> I and other public representatives have repeatedly raised this matter.  The Minister of State may say that a review is under way and that we must await the outcome of that review before allowing new participants onto the scheme.  In this case, however, a service has been withdrawn from that community rather than being frozen.  Citizens who should have a right to a free bus service in order to interact socially with family and friends - something that every other senior citizen across the State has - are being denied their rights.  Disabled people, as well as families with relatives in respite care, and those with loved ones studying in Derry or availing of services in other locations along the route are being denied that right.  That is how serious this matter is.  It is not a frivolous or trivial matter.<\/p><p> I am interested in this confirmation from Marian Harkin, MEP, who raised the issue concerning a company in County Cavan called Leydon's Coaches.  She challenged the issue under EU competition law and apparently the European Commission has overturned it.  I appreciate that the Minister of State may not have had a briefing on that, as he had no advance warning.  Nonetheless, will be please look into the issue and ensure that it is resolved?  Even if that information about the European Commission's ruling is not 100% accurate - and I am relying on Marian Harkin's guidance in this - the issue has to be resolved.  I therefore ask the Minister of State to reinstate the service.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800034#GG00600","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416335400,"counter":422,"content":"<p>I thank the Deputy for raising this topical issue.  Although I do not have the information on the European decision that he has outlined, I would like to put this matter in context.  The free travel scheme is currently available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over, to carers and to customers under 66 who are in receipt of certain disability-type payments.  The scheme permits customers to travel free on most CIE public transport services, LUAS and a range of services offered by approximately 80 private operators in various parts of the country.  Customers of the scheme over 66 who are married, cohabiting or in a civil partnership receive a pass that allows their partners to travel with them for free.  Certain customers can get a companion pass which allows any person over the age of 16 to accompany them for free.<\/p><p>  Free travel is also available on cross-Border journeys to and from Northern Ireland.  The all-Ireland free travel scheme allows a free travel pass holder, aged 66 and older, to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services within Northern Ireland using a Senior SmartPass card.  Similarly, Northern Ireland Senior SmartPass card holders are entitled to travel for free in the Republic using their existing cards.<\/p><p>  In 2001 there were 608,000 customers in receipt of the scheme, while today there are more than 800,000.  This represents an increase of more than 30%.  In 2001, the scheme cost approximately &euro;46 million per year.  In 2014, it will cost &euro;77 million, which is an increase of 65%.<\/p><p>  As the Deputy will be aware, funding for the free travel scheme was capped by the previous Government in the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014.  To implement this cap on funding during a time in which passenger numbers have been increasing each year, the Department has had to impose a freeze on the amounts paid to companies and a complete restriction on the admittance of new companies or routes to the scheme.  This has included new companies taking over routes from other companies.<\/p><p>  The Government made clear in its Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 that it is committed to full retention of the free travel scheme.  The Government appreciates the importance of the scheme to customers, particularly pensioners, and is very much aware of the implications for travel pass holders in those areas where services have been withdrawn.  Officials in the Department have been asked to examine ways in which companies could be admitted to the free travel scheme - initially where they are taking over routes for which free travel funding was previously available, including in Donegal - with a view to free travel services recommencing as soon as possible.  I understand that free travel has been available on the particular route mentioned by the Deputy since 17 November 2014.  I hope that will resolve the issue.<\/p><p>  I will try to obtain the information sought by the Deputy concerning the European ruling.  I have not had a briefing on it, but as soon as I get that information I will send it on to the Deputy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800035#HH00200","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1416335400,"counter":423,"content":"<p>This topical issue was originally to have been taken last Thursday.

There might be a lesson in that for the Government.<\/p><p>  What level of co-operation exists between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport concerning transport routes in County Donegal that were operating in recent years but are no longer in operation?

Two months on, we are no further in people's understanding of a solution to the issue.  Since we raised the point with the Minister of State, the problem has expanded.  Deputies Denis Naughten and Michael Fitzmaurice spoke to me when they heard this issue was coming up in a Topical Issue debate.  I also had a call from Councillor Eugene Murphy in Roscommon.  He is chairing a group on the issue.  This extends from Mayo to Roscommon, taking in parts of Westmeath and, according to Deputy Brendan Smith, parts of Cavan.<\/p><p>  Last June and July, people bought petrol in good faith from legitimate retailers.  Serious problems arose with their cars and, in many cases, their engines have been destroyed and the cars rendered unusable.  These are people who do not have money to buy new cars and do not have money to make the necessary repairs.  These people have spent their lives abiding by the law.  Many of the retailers are reputable.  Those with comprehensive insurance have been dealt with by their insurance companies.  However, those people lost their no-claims bonuses, which had been built up over decades in many cases.  Those with third-party insurance had no cover and have been left out of pocket.  There is no compensation for them.<\/p><p>  We understand there are at least 160 complaints with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Mayo division, a figure that may have increased.  The number of complaints made to the Revenue Commissioners is substantially less.  An official of the Revenue Commissioners made a commitment at a public meeting to engage in public clinics in County Mayo to allow for investigations.  Deputy Naughten has joined us, and I presume the same is true in County Roscommon. <\/p><p>  The point made at the previous meeting was that the major problem is trying to find the source.  Delays in the State Laboratory are adding to the problem, because of the lack of resources.  Staff at the laboratory are also dealing with other issues.  If a car is off the road, if a person cannot go to work or must pay for a taxi to get to work, if they face a bill of thousands of euro to repair their car or if their car has been rendered useless, this is their biggest problem.  If I had green diesel in my car when I was picked up by Customs and Excise officials, they would have initiated a prosecution against me and they would be able to find the source straight away.  Where Customs and Excise has traceability from the retailer back to the wholesaler, and when all the cases referred to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na include the names of specific retailers, how have the Customs and Excise officials and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not been able to use traceability to find out who caused this?  No one is being held responsible, while hundreds of people have been desperately inconvenienced.  What is happening in respect of State Laboratory two months after the Minister of State first engaged with the matter?  Is there any prosecution pending?<\/p><p>  With regard to third-party insurance, people have paid a lot of tax over the years when buying petrol.  Is there a compensation fund that can be set up out of the amount of tax paid?  Can the model of the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland be used to fund people who are out of pocket through no fault of their own?  It is not as if they deliberately destroyed their cars.  This occurred through suppliers they had used for many years.  People are incredibly frustrated and angry and feel let down by the various organs of the State in Mayo, in Deputy Denis Naughten's constituency of Roscommon, and in Westmeath, Cavan and elsewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800036#JJ00100","speaker":"1071"},{"type":"speech","time":1416336000,"counter":434,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Dara Calleary for raising this matter.  He had already acknowledged the presence of Deputy Denis Naughten in the Chamber.  Deputy Naughten raised the issue previously, most recently when we were discussing legislation.<\/p><p>  I echo the sentiment of Deputy Dara Calleary about the sheer frustration felt by people who, through no fault of their own, have seen serious damage done to their cars and their cars written off.  This has a devastating impact on families' lives as they go about their daily business.<\/p><p>  All forms of fuel fraud impose risks to consumers' vehicles, legitimate businesses and the Exchequer.  Accordingly, both the Revenue Commissioners and the State laboratories are directing their resources to tackle the issue.  Revenue has, over the recent past, received reports from a variety of locations around the country of problems relating to petrol quality, and suggestions that these problems are attributable to petrol stretching.  Revenue investigates all complaints of this kind and fuel samples are taken from filling stations and referred to the State Laboratory for analysis where the investigating officers have reason to suspect excise fraud.  The State laboratory makes use of an array of tests to determine whether an adulteration of the petrol has occurred. <\/p><p>  A total of 79 samples of petrol from filling stations in the Border, midlands and western region have been referred for analysis to the State Laboratory following checks conducted from June 2014 to date.  Conclusive results have been received in one case which confirm contamination through the presence of kerosene, and a file is being prepared for prosecution in this case.  A second positive contamination result is currently under investigation.  I expect progress to continue.  To date, no evidence of fraudulently contaminated petrol has been found in the remaining samples.  In addition to analysing samples referred to it, the State Laboratory is providing technical and scientific support for the ongoing investigations.<\/p><p>  The analysis of potentially stretched petrol is a complex one which, to date, has involved a significant level of time-consuming, non-routine testing, and it requires further investigation.  It is appropriate that such a level of time is attached to such an important matter.  The volume of samples sent for analysis has necessitated a reallocation of resources within the State laboratories.<\/p><p>  As with many other Civil Service offices and Departments, both the Revenue Commissioners and the State Laboratory are subject to the employment control framework, and I do not need to tell Members about its impact on staffing levels over the past five years.  However, the laboratory has prioritised the testing of all samples submitted in connection with the petrol stretching issue, and all staff who have the necessary experience and expertise in this area are currently being deployed to work on these samples.  I welcome that prioritisation.<\/p><p>  Petrol stretching is an offence under section 102(1A) of the Finance Act 1999 and carries a penalty on summary conviction of &euro;5,000 or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both.  If it is an indictable conviction, the fine is up to a maximum of &euro;126,970 and the prison term is up to a maximum of five years, or both.<\/p><p>  If Revenue's investigations and the analysis of fuel samples by the State laboratory indicate the presence of illegal stretching agents in petrol, Revenue will take action and pursue prosecutions against offenders where possible.  As part of Revenue's normal operating procedures, fuel delivery tankers are challenged when encountered by enforcement officers throughout the Border, midlands and western region.

I appreciate the point about the reallocation of resources.  To a certain extent, the difficulty is that the horse has bolted.  This happened in May and June.  The Minister of State says that fuel delivery tankers are challenged when encountered.  How many times has this happened?  Is there a plan in place or is it just when enforcement officers come across a tanker while driving around?  How many encounters have we had throughout the summer?<\/p><p>  Specific retailers have been named to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs and Excise.

It is not as if they went out and caused an accident.  People with fully comprehensive insurance will pay the price through a much increased premium next year for having had to make a claim through no fault of their own.  I cannot bring home the level of frustration and anger felt by people who feel the system has completely let them down.  They are involved in this through no fault of their own, which I emphasise.<\/p><p>All they did was buy a tank of fuel, as we all do every day.  They went to the same retailer as always, as we do every day as well.  These people are being put through the mill.  As an example, a 78-year-old lady used her car for shopping, socialising and going to mass but her daughter had to move home from England to facilitate these activities using a rented car because they are not in a position to make the necessary repairs to the car.  That is typical of hundreds of people put in this position.  I ask the Minister of State to give this absolute priority.  The pressure should come from him and from the Minister for Justice and Equality so that somebody can be held to account and those who are suffering can be compensated.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800036#JJ00500","speaker":"1071","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416336600,"counter":439,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Calleary for raising the matter, the seriousness of which is not lost on me or any Member.

I will also ask for details to be provided about traceability and that the issue of compensation be explored.<\/p><p>  As indicated at the outset, the State Laboratory has prioritised the testing of all samples submitted in connection with the petrol stretching problem.

I understand some insurers are paying out for these claims and it is important to note that anybody with an unresolved insurance complaint can refer the matter to the financial services ombudsman for investigation and adjudication.

I welcome the Aire St&aacute;it; it has been a long time since we had one in the Department of Social Protection.  I congratulate him on his appointment.<\/p><p>  I hope the Minister of State will seriously consider an issue I will bring to his attention, as I have spoken about it with a number of Ministers in the House but to date those comments have fallen on deaf ears.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection has decided to shelve any plans to means test child benefit.  I have no difficulty with that.  My fear is that because the issue has now been shelved, the reform of child benefit will be also taken off the table.  That would be a missed opportunity that could benefit society as a whole.<\/p><p>  Starting at the beginning of September, the Department of Social Protection has again recommenced its policy of issuing 600,000 letters to parents across the country, asking them to confirm that their children are in school.  This is replicating a process already in place through the National Educational Welfare Board, adding significant unnecessary administration.  There is a bizarre process whereby the Department of Social Protection, in issuing these 600,000 letters, is using enough paper to cover Croke Park 2.5 times in duplicating a system already in place.  A principal is legally obliged to report a child who has missed 20 days in school if there is not a legitimate reason for the absence.  Under the rules of child benefit, parents cannot legally draw down the payment unless the child is attending a school.  Nevertheless, the two systems are unconnected.  The control section of the Department of Social Protection issues these letters but it is replicating an existing system, which is leading to unnecessary bureaucracy.  This is curbing the achievement of additional savings that could be made in the Department.  Each year, the control section of the Department of Social Protection saves approximately &euro;75 million to &euro;85 million on child benefit alone.  That is based on a nominal calculation but significant amounts could be saved by dovetailing the two systems.<\/p><p>  There could be a major benefit not just in administrative savings and those related to overpayments and fraud but in long-term savings by identifying children in vulnerable households and ensuring they attend school.  We all know the social and economic impact of keeping children in school and giving them the opportunity to access education.  The current National Educational Welfare Board annual report describes a young girl called Jenny who is six years old.  In December, the school principal contacted the National Educational Welfare Board, indicating she had been absent from school for 65 days.  An officer from the board contacted the family, called to the house, wrote to them and issued legal threats.  Eventually, the family ended up in court; the mother was fined &euro;200 and the father was fined &euro;300, and since they went to court, Jenny has attended school.  Was that a good use of the limited social work resources available to the National Educational Welfare Board, the State's legal resources or the court's time?  There were also associated costs.  Most importantly, Jenny lost 12 months in school before the issue was resolved.  Surely it would make far more sense if the threat of losing child benefit hung over the family if the daughter did not attend school.<\/p><p>  We need to rethink how we are doing things in this country.  We cannot have Departments in different silos and not being linked.  We must start to get basic things right in this country by using the limited resources we have available to the State in a wiser way to benefit children like Jenny and every other Jenny in the country.  I urge the Minister to seriously examine the issue and link the Departments of Education and Skills, Social Protection and Children and Youth Affairs, as well as the National Educational Welfare Board.<\/p><p>  I will also raise the issue of the State non-contributory pension.  There has been considerable discussion in the House in the past couple of weeks during the passage of the Finance Bill regarding the eligibility of retiring farmers to tax relief for a 15-year lease based on handing over the land to an active farmer.  The debate has been about the definition of an &quot;active farmer&quot;.  That may be an issue in Deputy Kelleher's part of the country.<\/p><p>In my part of the country it is not a massive issue as we do not have many retiring farmers who lease out land and have a significant tax liability.  A bigger problem is how farm leases are dealt with in the social welfare system, and I ask the Minister of State to examine this.<\/p><p> A father may not wish to sign over a farm holding to his adult child because he wants the security it gives, and there are numerous examples showing why it is wise to hold on to title in such circumstances.  If he instead hands land to his child with a nominal long-term lease the Department of Social Protection will estimate the actual value of the lease and deduct that amount from the father's non-contributory old-age pension.  The Department's view is that the father in this example is denying himself a source of income - he will be penalised financially for entering a lease with his son or daughter who is actively farming the land.  The Department is forcing old people to forego the modicum of security such an arrangement gives and instead sign over the land as failure to do so is penalised.<\/p><p> Another example might involve an old bachelor farmer who is struggling to make a living and does not have anyone to take over the land.  This farmer might lease his land to a progressive farmer in the area - the latter might wish to expand his holding, develop the land and ensure it is used efficiently.  Every penny the bachelor farmer receives from this a lease will be deducted from his non-contributory pension but if he got a job he could earn &euro;200 per week without it impacting on his non-contributory old-age pension.  Every penny he earns through the lease, which is economically beneficial to the State in the long-term, will see the farmer penalised commensurately.<\/p><p> If we are committed to the objective of making changes that will release farm land to active young farmers I urge the Minister of State to examine how the social welfare system treats farmers in the circumstances I outlined.  The system is delaying the release of land because it penalises farmers who hand over land to active young farmers who want to maximise its use.  Difficulties and historical issues in the west of Ireland mean there are many farmers like those I mentioned and many fragmented holdings.  The only way to make fragmented holdings viable financially is to allow them be subject to long-term leases.  Far more use could be made of this land but the problem lies in the Department of Social Protection, not the Revenue Commissioners.<\/p><p> As we speak, 800 people are in hospital beds having been designated as delayed discharges.  These people are fit to be discharged but there is nowhere for them to go.  Around 600 of these people await a long-term nursing home bed but around 200 are waiting to go back into the community.  Of the latter group, some need a family member to take them home but this cannot be done without additional home help so access to the carer's benefit is required.  I know a person who applied for carer's benefit in October and received a letter from the Department saying medical approval had been granted but payment would not proceed until February 2015.  At the moment in Longford the Department is processing applications received in July.  Carer's benefit is black and white: one is either eligible based on stamps or one is not.  There are not enough members of staff so applications are delayed at the moment by 12 to 14 weeks and this denies people the resources they need to support someone, usually an old or disabled person, in his or her home.<\/p><p> Carer's benefit is money well spent, as it saves the State a significant amount, but there is a bureaucratic delay at the moment.  The application of which I spoke is black and white and has been medically approved so there is no reason payment should not follow within a couple of weeks.  Staff in the carer's benefit section in Longford do a great job but there are too few people to process all the applications.  The situation is equally bad when it comes to carer's allowance - people are awaiting this payment to allow them to take people home from hospitals.  We have not provided the requisite level of staffing to process applications but we are prepared to pay &euro;700,000 a day to keep 800 people in hospital beds.  It seems we are not prepared to allocate a couple more members of staff to process applications.  It makes financial sense and it means older people can stay in their own homes, where they want to be.  I urge the Minister of State to consider this issue as it is causing serious financial hardship for families around the country.  His Department is not allocating staff and I urge him to do so as it will save the Department of Health a great deal.  Staff members working in Longford are doing a tremendous job under huge pressure and are getting it in the ear from people awaiting payment.  It is a question of silos: the Department of Social Protection is not willing to process applications because it means a cost to that Department, but there could be significant savings for the Department of Health.  I urge this Government to adopt joined-up thinking at long last.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800037#KK00600","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416337200,"counter":446,"content":"<p>I welcome the Minister of State.  Social protection is a broad canvas and it involves the provision of social supports for people who have been badly mauled through loss of jobs, reduced incomes, reductions in carer's allowance, fewer teacher supports and so on across the system.  It is difficult to know where to begin when analysing the large-scale framework of what must be done.  When the Government's revenues collapsed in 2008 it was left with the task of finding other revenues to make up for the precipitous fall.  At the same time the Government had to achieve efficiencies and cost savings in State expenditure.<\/p><p>  Government revenue can come from only two sources.  I have heard arguments for widening the tax base through property taxes, water charges and so on but such revenue must come from two sources.  The word &quot;source&quot; is French and means a well from which water is drawn.  The two sources I refer to are taxes on income and expenditure, both personal and corporate.  VAT and excise duty are examples of taxes on expenditure.<\/p><p>  A labyrinthine bureaucracy of property taxes and water charges involving complex systems of collection and documentation misses the point because such taxes must be paid from personal and corporate incomes.  The collapse of the economy in 2008 meant personal incomes took a huge hit - they all fell and some disappeared due to job loss.  Indigenous businesses, including small farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises, also saw their incomes hit.  However, many multinational companies based in Ireland saw increases in revenues and profits after 2008.  This was due to higher sales, transfer pricing, the placement of expenses in other areas and so on.  They reported higher profits.<\/p><p>I could not understand why the Government with the largest ever majority in the history of the State did not tap on the door of the corporates and explain that the country was on its knees and that it needed to replace the revenues to maintain expenditure and, at the same time, get efficiencies and savings from those expenditures.  In other words, the Government should have explained that the State needed revenues but the people were flattened and had nothing left.  The Government should have asked them for a 2.5% reported profits corporation national recovery levy, for example.  Guess what?  They would have paid it, and they would pay it still.  In fact, they are opening the discussions on paying it now.  The statelessness of these companies is under broad discussion and there is an agreement and an acceptance that they will actually start paying taxes to the countries over which they hover and earn their revenues.  We missed an easy opportunity in that regard.<\/p><p> This is about fairness.  I am approaching the idea of what is fair in our society.  Why are there 700 homeless children in Ireland tonight, as we heard on Leaders' Questions?  It is plain wrong.  We need to get a little fairness back into the picture.  We need to think about the areas of distress, including mortgages.  Fully 100,000 mortgage clients are still in distress, but many of them have not been declared in distress because the banks are playing silly billies as regards the type of accounting they do.  I know this because I am helping people out in this area.  The banks have not yet shown these people as having distressed loans.  In these cases the loan principal should be written down.  I know this from experience.<\/p><p> Some of the occupational pension schemes have been visited with major unfairness.  At the moment, the Irish Aviation Superannuation Scheme is in a state of total unfairness but it is ready for sign-off, and that is wrong.  Deferred pensioners who have worked for 35 or 40 years, perhaps, and who accommodated their former employers by leaving early in order that there would be less of a bill for salaries and wages, find themselves termed &quot;deferred members&quot; of the pension scheme.  The are facing cuts of 60% and perhaps up to 80% of what they had a reasonable expectation of under the defined benefit scheme.  That is wrong.  It is simply not right.  If the mothers of the advisers to these schemes saw what was going on they would tell their sons or daughters doing such professional work that it was all wrong and that it was essentially unfair and inequitable.  After 35 or 40 years' service, pensioners have a reasonable expectation not to be financially blown out of the water to the advantage of other members who are still employees of the firms in question, such as Aer Lingus, or existing pensioners who may have managed to become pensioners in recent times by a fluke of the calendar, while the others are waiting a little to become termed &quot;pensioners&quot;.<\/p><p> We need to stop wading through and creating massive amounts of paper on taxes, the local property tax and water charges.  A massive bureaucracy is being created, when the matter is really rather simple.  People and corporates with good incomes can pay taxes.  We can do the sums on how much money is needed for capital investment, for example, for water structure reconditioning and reinvestment for the next ten years.<\/p><p> The great shame is - I am embarrassed when I discuss it abroad - that our Government, with the largest ever majority, failed to tear up the promissory bonds amounting to &euro;25 billion of absolutely odious manufactured bonds.  This enabled the euro system to create a firewall during the panic of 2010 and 2011, but it has been left on the backs and shoulders of the current generation, the next generation and the next generation in turn.  Up to 1.5 million people are hurting, and 500,000 of them are abroad, having emigrated.  There are 100,000 in mortgage distress.  Approximately 350,000 or 400,000 human souls will be distressed for the remainder of their working lives because the banks are not doing what they should be doing and because they did not get capitalised from their creditors.  We need to examine the big overall frameworks and achieve fairness and equity in a narrative sense.  The idea of tinkering with all the labyrinthine and complex mountains of paper is all wrong and there is no need for it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800038#LL00200","speaker":"1183","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416337800,"counter":448,"content":"<p>We will not be opposing this Bill.  I put my thoughts together last week in advance of speaking on the Social Welfare Bill.  That was before what happened here on Thursday with the sit-in or lock-in and what transpired over the weekend in terms of the protests as well.  Some of what I wanted to discuss was already in my mind.<\/p><p>  I have no wish to sound alarmist, but I believe that at this stage our society is at little fractured at the edges.  This is something we cannot dismiss in this House.  Social protection and social solidarity are words, but they mean things in respect of how we view society and how we want to structure society.  Let us consider where we are after the difficulties of the past seven years and the hardship that people have been through.  As parliamentarians we have much to learn, whether on the Government or Opposition side.  We need to realise that a certain amount of healing is required in the broader community.  Some communities have been badly affected by the downturn in the economy and the consequential policies pursued to address the underlying budgetary and fiscal problems, as well as the problems related to the banking collapse.<\/p><p>  For all that, I believe this is no time to applaud ourselves for bringing forward social protection measures on an annual basis.  They are inheritably important and should be done as a matter of course and form.  We can argue around the fringes about the areas we should prioritise when we have to make difficult decisions, but the principles of social protection, supporting social solidarity and supporting those who most need the support of the State are principles that any decent society would apply as a matter of course.<\/p><p>  When I say society is fractured, I mean it is fractured for many reasons.  The downturn in the economy had an impact on people's hopes and aspirations during the good times as well as on their visions of themselves and where they were going to take their children in the years ahead.  When all of that was taken from them, some found themselves requiring the State to step in and support them in some way or another.<\/p><p>  Another group of people have been effectively condemned to social protection for all their lives.  This is an intergenerational thing and something that must be addressed quickly, because in some parts of our city - not only this city but other cities as well - it is endemic in certain communities, where it is seen to be the norm to be on social welfare and leave school early.  In these communities it would be unusual for a person to get to third level education.  That is a failure on our part collectively in this Chamber and on the part of Governments which have sat across the floor for many years.  It is time to recognise that it is not only about giving people an extra few bob in social welfare simply to keep them quiet.  Something fundamental has to be done to ensure that we can inspire people, that we can give them hope and confidence and that we can lead them to believe they can better themselves.  Social mobility - the yearning to better one's self, or for one's children to better themselves - is inherently important in human behaviour.  However, this yearning to advance one's self is almost cut adrift in some communities now.  There is almost no hope in some communities, and this something we must address quickly.<\/p><p>  I know the Minister for Social Protection and I have no wish to make overtly political points.  We do that across the Chamber from time to time - that is part of our role in opposition.  With the best will in the world, the measures of &euro;5 per month in child benefit payments, the back-to-work family dividend and so on are all welcome and much needed, but something more fundamental is required.  We need a shift in policy to shift the thinking of many people such that they can have hope and see education as a pathway to something else.<\/p> <p><i>7 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Deputy Denis Naughten referred earlier to a young girl named Jenny who was absent from schools for weeks on end according to the report of the National Education and Welfare Board.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800039#MM00200","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416338400,"counter":450,"content":"<p>She was absent for 65 days.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800040#NN00200","speaker":"1033"},{"type":"speech","time":1416338400,"counter":451,"content":"<p>When I walk some parts of the country, I wonder why children I see around the streets are not in school.  They are almost abandoned during the day.  Are we doing enough collectively as a society to assist parents who are in crisis, families who are under huge pressure and children who are almost feral in some cases?  When we look at society, we see it becoming harsher.  A them-and-us attitude is beginning to establish itself.  I always thought growing up that we were here collectively.  We looked out for each other, supported each other and willed each other on, but a lot of that seems to be going in many communities.  It is clearly something that is anathema to any republic.  Cherishing all the children equally is fine in sentiment but more needs to be done to ensure it has a meaningful impact on people's lives on the ground.<\/p><p>  The Government will point out its successes and we will point out its failures.  That is the nature of the adversarial assembly we work in.  No generation of politicians can adjudicate impartially on its policies and their success.  It is those who live through the policies, in other words the next generation, who can impartially and fairly adjudicate success, failure or otherwise.  We will obviously play the short-term adversarial politics in here, but that is our difficulty.  We have no long-term strategies in place to ensure there will be a reward for those in the next generation.  We look at who votes and who will reward a political party for the policies it pursues.  That makes for a very short-sighted outlook in terms of what parties want to pursue in government.  That is not a criticism of this Government, but an observation based on my 20 years in this place.  It is very much focused on the electoral cycle.  Many vulnerable people and communities are forgotten about in the meantime.  Because they do not vote, they are not engaged.  They are disenfranchised and disillusioned and we throw them the odd sop every now and again to appease our consciences and make us feel better.  That does not really have a meaningful impact on their lives.<\/p><p>  I make those points because we are discussing a Social Welfare Bill.  Social welfare is primarily a way of ensuring that people get support when they need it.  There must be something more, however, than just giving them the few bob and hoping they will not cause any problems.  There must be something extra in it.  Rights, responsibilities, opportunities, hope and inspiration are all critical components of that.  However, the heart has been ripped out of communities and there is a fractured society out there.  That is something we will live to regret.  I thought &quot;Strumpet City&quot;, where we had slums and deprivation and people saw no hope and no outcome in life, was in the past but we are fast reverting back to a situation in which whole communities feel absolutely alienated from every day discourse.  They do not see this place as relevant to their lives.  More often than not, they see it as an imposition and as a far-flung establishment.  This is not the establishment, it is meant to be the parliamentary assembly for everybody out there.  It should be a mirror image of our communities and we should have all sorts of people here reflecting what is happening in the community out there.  However, when large groups of people see this place at a distance beyond belief from their lives we have major problems.  Appeasing for the sake of it is not good enough.  There must be direct action.<\/p><p>  We are almost ghettoising people.  I have had this issue with the local authority in Cork city for many years.  We always lived with each other, helped each other and supported each other.  It was something that was inherently ingrained in Irish society.  Now, however, we put people in various areas according to their incomes and backgrounds.  That is wrong.  Local authorities have a critically important role to play in this regard.  People need to see potential social mobility and that a young kid who comes from a difficult background can go to school, take the opportunities and, with the encouragement of parents and the community, move to third level and achieve something.  However, I can show the Minister of State areas in which that would be a pipe dream.  People simply do not see it as an obvious route to improving themselves because it is not done by anybody else in the community.  We have schemes in place to assist people to go back to education and pathways to further education, but we must accept first and foremost what are the underlying problems.  I do not know what the solution is but the problem is there in front of us and we seem too busy or disinterested to address it.<\/p><p>  Various political parties claim to represent varying groupings.  The simplistic view is that one is either on the left or the right.  I am pro-business.  Rewarding enterprise and encouraging initiative is critically important, but I also consider that 700 homeless people is anathema to the republic.  In that, we have failed.  We talk about big business and have press conferences and releases about its importance.  Some people think that is great while others see it as the enemy of the person who does not have a job.  I see them as compatible.  The simplistic idea that one is either left wing or right wing and either has a social conscience or is for big business is something I am still trying get my head around.  The bottom line is that our society must be nurtured back to life to ensure that every person can live to the maximum of their abilities, exploit their potential and seize opportunities.  The Minister of State knows the communities in question.  There are many of them out there and they are yearning for something to be done to ensure they can achieve something themselves.<\/p><p>  The idea is that the Social Welfare Bill is debated here every year and we say people were not given enough and the Government says it would like to give more.  If I was over there, the shoe would be on the other foot and I would be listening to the same thing from somebody on this side in respect of funding and supports.  Overall, however, this place is not relevant to many citizens.  If they are aware of it, they see it as a place we come to to make fine speeches and the perception is that we are all drawing big salaries.  That is something we must fix very quickly.  It is not because of what happened here last Thursday or what happened in Jobstown on Saturday with the T&aacute;naiste.  I thought about all of this in advance of those particular incidents, but they highlight something and are worth taking note of.<\/p><p>  Homelessness is now reaching crisis proportions.  I remember many years ago during the so-called Celtic tiger that we were condemned because 40 people were homeless in our capital city of a night.  We had all the resources available to us and nobody should have been homeless.  We now have 700 people of all ages and backgrounds searching for accommodation in the city.  They are people who up until recently had homes and worked every hour God sent to put roofs over their heads.  They now find themselves in that position.  I do not care what legislative obstacles are in place, it undermines the confidence of people in the State's capacity to look after its most vulnerable citizens that we cannot provide them with the basics of elementary shelter.<\/p><p> This brings me back to the issue of priorities and my point about left- and right-wing policies and being pro-business or promoting social solidarity.  There is no getting away from the fact that the Government made choices.  Governments must prioritise and make choices, even in the most difficult times.  The most recent budget sent out a signal that this Government was pursuing regressive policies and undermining social cohesiveness.  The balance has been tipped.  One hundred and fifty thousand people do not take to the streets on a wet Saturday for the craic.  Many of those who marched against water charges recently did so because they have been put to the pin of their collar.  They do not expect the Government to produce a magic wand.  What they want is for politicians to at least appreciate and empathise with the financial difficulties and burdens they face daily.  People are realistic and are aware of the challenges the Government faces and the difficult decisions it must take but they want it to at least listen to the message they are sending about the impact of Government policies, some of which I supported.  We must listen to citizens because they are hurting after seven years of austerity.  No one expects a miracle but people want the Government and parliamentarians on all sides to accept that enough is enough and they cannot give any more.  The Government's priorities and its policies on taxation have focused too much on the haves and ignored the have-nots. <\/p><p> As I stated, we should always try to reward initiative and encourage enterprise.  For this reason, it is impossible to justify the manner in which Governments have treated one group in the past six or seven years.  I refer to the self-employed, who generated their own income, paid their taxes, did not rely on the State and, in some cases, employed others.  When the economy fell off the cliff they were thrown to the wolves.  Every Deputy has raised cases involving self-employed people who visited their local community welfare offices to beg for a few bob for Christmas.  The poor treatment of the self-employed sends out a signal that risk-takers may reap the rewards when things go well but will be ignored and treated as pariahs and nuisances when things do not go well.  This issue must be addressed, because if we want to encourage people to lift themselves up, we must assure them that some type of safety harness will be provided if they fail and that they will not be allowed to fall to the bottom. <\/p><p> With the next general election due to be held within 18 months, the Oireachtas is on an election footing and political parties are positioning themselves in anticipation.  In recent years the basic principles of parliamentary democracy have been undermined, with the result that people no longer believe a word uttered by any politician.  While everyone understands the need for political dexterity and the reasons for the odd political pirouette or U-turn, there is something inherently wrong when people no longer believe anything uttered by a politician.  The core principles of democracy are undermined when debates are essentially games of one-upmanship.  Parties should stand by their election manifestos.  If they are accepted by the electorate, that is fine, and if they are rejected, that should be the end of the matter.  We can no longer tolerate the idea that a party can pull a second set of principles from its pocket if the electorate does not like the first set.  The single overriding factor is that people believe all politicians are the same.  We used to hear that the two main parties were identical, but people now believe we are all the same, which is an inherently dangerous position.  We have much to do to ensure that people feel part of society and are enfranchised, empowered and inspired.  They need to believe there are opportunities for social mobility and to better one's self.  The State must focus its resources on achieving these objectives, rather than becoming fixated on short-term policies and the results of focus groups.  A strategic approach to constructing society in the years ahead is lacking.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800040#NN00300","speaker":"983","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416339000,"counter":453,"content":"<p>I thank the Technical Group for allowing me to use some of its speaking time.<\/p><p>  I propose to make a couple of observations and suggestions.  The qualifying age for participation in community employment schemes should be reduced to below 25 years to include unskilled younger people.  Rather than simply ticking boxes, the Department of Social Protection should match candidates to vacancies.  I am aware of cases in which candidates with no spoken English were sent for interview accompanied by interpreters who could not speak English.  Additional Government support should be provided to counties such as Kerry, where unemployment is high and no new jobs are being provided.  Greater flexibility must be shown in the area of training and upskilling, and a greater variety of courses and training should be offered, as not everybody wants to do a computer course.  In addition, more opportunities should be provided to learners to extend the period of a community employment scheme if such an extension would be of genuine benefit to them.  The rates paid to participants on community employment schemes should be increased to make them more attractive.  For example, an increase of &euro;20 or &euro;40 per week would make a significant difference to participants.  Community employment schemes should be judged on the basis of a number of factors, not only progression, because it is difficult to achieve targets when no new jobs are available.  More places should also be made available.<\/p><p>  I remind the Minister that the rural social scheme is not an activation measure but an income support for farmers and fishermen.  Parts of rural Ireland would be depopulated of small farmers were it not for the income provided by the scheme.  Farming is an isolated occupation, and the interaction of scheme participants with their workmates and members of the local community has immeasurable benefits in terms of mental well-being.  I ask the Minister to increase the number of places available on this exceptionally worthwhile and valuable scheme and thank all those who run the schemes.<\/p><p>  Last week, I tabled a number of parliamentary questions on community employment schemes.  Having met recently with a number of supervisors in different parts of the country, including County Kerry, I believe the Department is trying to wind down the community employment scheme.  Will the Minister assure the House that the measures being introduced are not intended to wind down the schemes?  As I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, will appreciate, community employment schemes have delivered valuable and worthwhile work in many communities over the years.  I hope they will be expanded in the years ahead.  The questions I tabled last week highlighted the reasons for my belief that community employment is being wound down.  One can certainly make the case that this is the Government's objective. <\/p><p>  One cannot discuss this Bill without highlighting what the Government is proposing to do with the Department's money.  We have learned that people who pay water charges will receive a refund of &euro;100.  Where is the common sense in that proposal?  Why ask people to pay money and subsequently fill out forms to obtain a refund of &euro;100?  This is a nonsensical, crazy and ill thought-out proposal, and any Minister who argues that it is prudent or sensible is living in la-la land or away with the fairies.<\/p><p> I compliment Deputy Kelleher for his excellent contribution in which he highlighted the importance of small employers.  Many senior Government Ministers have one thing in common, namely, the fact they have never created a job in their lives and do not know what it is like to be a small employer.  They do not know what it is like to survive, create jobs for and pay people every week and try to keep a business going.  The Government is lacking in people who have common sense with regard to the difficulties employers have.  Since it took office it has put more red tape in the way of small operators, which are the backbone of the country and create employment in communities.<\/p><p> I have to mention what the Government has done to community welfare officers.  Small villages and towns always had a local community welfare office, staffed by personnel who would discuss the issues, difficulties, payments, rights and entitlements of people living in the community.  Such offices have been closed and the services centralised because the Government is one of the most anti-rural Governments since the foundation of the State.  It is keeping in line with what it has done from the very start, namely, attacking rural communities.  Why would it say that policy was sensible?  I recently obtained a list of the offices which have been closed in County Kerry.  Their closure has been a tremendous loss to every village.  The issue has to be highlighted.<\/p><p> The Labour Party, in particular, has exported our best and brightest over the past number of years, and has done so unashamedly.  I do not know how the Labour Party can say what it is doing is right and is being done on behalf of the people.  It has sold its souls to be in government, and what it has done is disgraceful.  I heard a Government Minister say that young people made a personal decision to leave the country and did not have to go.  That shows how out of touch Ministers are in this Government.  My phone was inundated with calls when the Minister concerned made that statement.  People would have loved to have stayed in the country, but could not because there was no work here for them.  They were exported.  The Government has sat idly by and let that continue.<\/p><p> Nobody could condone the protests which turned nasty and personal.  I would never condone that type of behaviour.  The opposite to that is a gathering of 4,000 people at which I and Deputy Ferris spoke in Tralee some weeks ago.  They marched through Tralee in a highly organised and respectful manner.  There was no hassle and no problems whatsoever.  The Garda would tell one there was no litter thrown on the ground.  That is what protest is about, namely, people coming out, voicing their opinion and having their say.  The event was run excellently, safely and properly.  When a very small element of people who have a different agenda become involved, unfortunately they give what I call genuine protestors a bad name.  I do not like the manner in which the Government is trying to paint everybody with the same brush, because that is not the case.<\/p><p> If one keeps picking at a dog and tries to pull his tail, eventually he will turn around and bite one back.  People are biting back at the Government, and are telling it it made a mess of Irish Water.  It knows it has.  It should think about what it has done.  It has spent millions of euro installing meters and has done 100 U-turns over the past number of weeks.  The bigger the protests have become, the more U-turns in which the Government has engaged.  It has installed meters, but has now told people it will not turn them on and will not use them at all.  It complained about e-voting machines, but this is a much bigger debacle.  It is the e-voting machines issue multiplied by hundreds, and probably thousands.  The meters have been installed, but the Government is terrified to turn them on because Fine Gael and the Labour Party know they will not be heard of for a long time if they do so.  Any rowing back will be seen for what it is, namely, a cynical move to protect their political skins.<\/p><p> Sometimes national newspapers can get things wrong.  I remember during the campaign by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, to be leader of the Labour Party she trusted a certain national newspaper which supported her campaign in a very special way and did everything it could to ensure her election.  It even christened her &quot;Wonderwoman&quot;.  I wonder whether the same newspaper would try to sell itself on the same slogan underneath a picture of the T&aacute;naiste now.  I do not think it would wash because people now realise that not only has Wonderwoman let the country down, but so too have the Taoiseach and the former Minister Phil Hogan.  He has bolted himself away in Europe and left us with the mess he made.<\/p><p> Night after night we tried to raise this issue and show that what was proposed was wrong.  The backbenchers are still in a coma, but are trying to awake from their slumbers because of the results of the local elections.  It might be too little, too late.  There has been mistake after mistake.  Tomorrow and Thursday are about the Government trying to save themselves and explain what is wrong.  It could have said it would not create Irish Water, a layer of bureaucracy and jobs and bonuses for the boys, and would not spend hundreds of millions of euro on metering water.  It could have instead asked every household to make a modest contribution that would be sent straight to local authorities which would then fix underground pipes.  It was as simple as that, but the former Minister, Phil Hogan, could not get it.<\/p><p> Hundreds of millions of euro have been spent, but not one pipe has been repaired.  There are thousands of meters under the ground which may never begin running.  Who will do it?  If the Government will not turn on the water meters, will the next do so?  It is an expensive folly for which the taxpayer will have to pay.  The Government still cannot admit it got it wrong and Irish Water should be disbanded.  It is not fit for purpose and should not be in place.  There are people in jobs which should never have been created in the first place because it was a mess from the very start.<\/p><p> Our local authorities had water sections and experienced personnel who knew what needed to be done.  All they needed were the finances to do it, and if a modest charge had been imposed on people they would not have minded paying.  We could then have started catching the 40% of water we are losing every day and would not have to be as worried about water conservation as we are now.  One has to be worried about water conservation when one is losing 40% of it every day, but all we needed to do was to fix the pipes.  None of the backbenchers who were silent and in a coma would comment on that.  All they did was stay there, with their eyes closed, and vote with the Government.  Now many of them are telling us they are sorry, they should not have voted for Irish Water and supported the guillotine, and should have realised what they were doing was wrong.  Why are they waking up and taking a U-turn?  It is because of the results of the local and European elections last May, and the dread of the next general election.  Where were they all along?  They were in a coma.<\/p><p> The Government has been drip feeding information to the media.  The larger the protests became, the more U-turns it found it had to make.  What has happened over the past number of weeks is a disgrace.<\/p><p>I thank the thousands of peaceful protesters who made the Government wake up a little and who tried to wake backbenchers out of the coma they have been in for the past three and a half years.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800041#OO00200","speaker":"1049","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416340200,"counter":456,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"An Bille um an gCeathr&uacute; Leas&uacute; is Tr&iacute;ocha ar an mBunreacht (Uimh. 3) 2014: An Dara C&eacute;im [Comhalta&iacute; Pr&iacute;obh&aacute;ideacha] - Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 3) Bill 2014: Second Stage [Private Members]","time":1416340200,"counter":458,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800043#QQ00400"},{"type":"speech","time":1416340200,"counter":459,"content":"<p>Tairgim: &quot;Go l&eacute;ifear an Bille an Dara hUair anois.&quot;<br\/><br\/>I move: &quot;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&quot;<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800043#QQ00500","speaker":"1102"},{"type":"speech","time":1416340200,"counter":460,"content":"<p>I understand Deputy Stanley is sharing his time with Deputies Adams, &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, McLellan, Colreavy and Mac Lochlainn.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800043#QQ00600","speaker":"1040"},{"type":"speech","time":1416340200,"counter":461,"content":"<p>In moving the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 3) Bill 2014, we seek to ensure that water services will not be privatised.  I raised this issue during the debate last year when the legislation to establish Irish Water was rammed through the House, particularly the fear of future privatisation down the line.  We were told at the time that there was a clause in the Bill - there is - which meant Irish Water could not be privatised unless there was a change in the law and a new Bill was brought before the D&aacute;il.  A new Government could do that, as could the current Government in a year or ten years' time.<br\/><br\/>Given that one of the Government parties promised during the general election campaign that it would not allow the introduction of water charges, neither I nor the public are filled with confidence by any such guarantee in regard to the threat of privatisation.  The Labour Party ran Tesco-style advertisements during the campaign, attacking its current partners in government on their proposal to introduce water charges.  That was a factor in the good showing by the Labour Party in the election, just as its support for austerity and its U-turn on water charges are responsible for its poor electoral showing since 2011.<br\/><br\/>We propose to amend Article 40 and insert a new section, which reads:<blockquote>The State recognises the right of all persons to sufficient, safe and accessible water and as guardian of the common good shall defend and vindicate this right and ensure that water services and infrastructure remain in public ownership.<\/blockquote>In doing this, we choose to amend Article 40 rather than Article 10, which was another option, as we think the recognition of access to water as a right is more fundamental than any economic argument.  This is central to the global debate on water, which has only in recent decades become a target for corporate vultures and adventurers seeking to control basic services which have traditionally been recognised as public services, even by conservative governments.  The Bill we are putting forward will give back ownership and control of the basic infrastructure and services to the public.  A key point also is that this Bill is a guarantee that our water can never come under the control of vulture capitalists unless the Irish people decide to change that.<br\/><br\/>The move towards privatisation of water services is a recent development in countries throughout the world.  Privatisation of water services has taken place in many countries as part of the promotion of the neoliberal economic agenda over the past 15 years and, sometimes, under pressure from agencies such as the IMF and ECB, which have used the leverage of so-called financial aid programmes to force client states such as Ireland to introduce wide-ranging privatisation of public services.  In most cases, the privatisation agenda was initiated by creating new companies which were more fit for the purpose of being sold off.  A good example of this was the Thames Valley water authority in Britain, which was later sold off.<br\/><br\/>The move towards preparing for a sale of State assets was clearly underwritten in the memorandum of understanding signed by the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Party government as part of the bailout of the banks and bondholders, which the current Government has adhered to.  However, so far the Government has been limited in the scale of privatisation it has been able to carry out.  It had targeted Coillte, for example, but due primarily to the fact that the public was made aware of what was being planned for 7% of State land, that plan was reversed.  While the privatisation of water is not an immediate item on the agenda, there is every likelihood that the Government, if it engineers a miracle and manages to cling to power in the next election, or any future conservative government made up of some variation of Fine Gael, the Labour Party or Fianna F&aacute;il, could proceed in that direction.<br\/><br\/>It is no coincidence that one of the likely interested parties, Mr. Denis O&rsquo;Brien, who has already established a growing foothold in the media, has already secured a substantial contract for the installation of water meters for his company Siteserv, now Sierra, which he acquired specifically in order to secure these contracts.  If privatisation is planned, obviously any company that has been installing meters on such a wide scale would be in prime position to take over the water company itself.  While this is not an immediate prospect, not least because of the escalating costs of establishing Irish Water, no private company is going to want to buy any State company that carries a substantial debt burden.  Therefore, nothing will happen in this regard until taxpayers have paid the cost of establishing Irish Water and are paying for domestic water, generating a cashflow.  This is the plan, but it has not worked out too well to date.  When the infrastructure is upgraded - costing billions of euro in public moneys - and when the beast has been fattened at the expense of householders and taxpayers, Irish Water can then be sold off, just as happened with Telecom &Eacute;ireann in the 1980s.  Irish taxpayers and householders fattened that company.  We had a very poor service up to the early 1980s, but the service was modernised at public expense and then sold off.  We are aware of the succession of companies that have owned it since.<br\/><br\/>While I do not believe the Government is planning any privatisation of Irish Water in the near future, the only fair way to prevent this from happening is for a guarantee to be written into the Constitution, as our legislation proposes.  Our proposal has won wide-ranging support across the political and civic spectrum, with even some Labour Party Members expressing their support for it.  Just two weeks ago, the Labour Party Members of the Seanad voted for a Fianna F&aacute;il motion to support our position.  Was that a cynical stunt - just a ploy and political play-acting - or is the Labour Party serious about this?  It will have the opportunity in the next two days to show us which it was.  <br\/><br\/>I urge the Labour Party Members to put their money where their mouth is and support this Bill so that it can move to Committee Stage, where the practicalities of organising a referendum can be dealt with quickly before the next general election so that we can remove the threat of any future privatisation of the water service hanging over us.  We will have the opportunity to have this referendum next year, because the Government is planning a number of referendums.  It would be easy to have this referendum on the same day.<br\/><br\/>It is worth noting that across Europe the tide seems to have turned against privatisation.  The Government here privatised a large part of Bord G&aacute;is, and of course the water service is attached to that company.  However, across Europe, the trend in favour of privatisation has run aground in the face of public opposition. While this would appear to contradict the neoliberal claim that the private sector is a more efficient and cost-effective supplier of goods, including public goods and utilities, it confirms the historical experience of states across the world where water services have been established and retained as a public service - that the very reason for this is that the private sector was either uninterested or unable to provide a universal and efficient service.  This lesson seems to have been re-learned in many European countries, where almost 200 privatisations have been reversed over the past 20 years, with control reverting, as in the case of Paris, for example, to the local authority.  Therefore, it would be the height of stupidity on the part of any Irish government to reject the lessons of failed privatisation in other countries and to leave open that possibility here.  The only way to prevent that is to enshrine public ownership of the resources and services of Ireland through a constitutional amendment.<\/p><p> Other Sinn F&eacute;in speakers will cover in detail all aspects of the current debacle surrounding Irish Water, particularly from the past week.  Before I close, however, I want to make one or two points that need to be made.  The first is that all the promises that were made about Irish Water replacing the old system with a more cost-effective and efficient body have been shown to be ludicrous.  The whole thing was put together at enormous and growing cost to the taxpayer, including more than &euro;80 million spent so far on consultants.  What the consultants have been doing is a bit of a mystery and we have seen the cock-up around getting the most basic things right, including the billing of apartments and of tenants, who pays for leaks and so on.  That is not something dreamed up by Sinn F&eacute;in or propaganda from this side of the House.  Several backbenchers from the Fine Gael and Labour side have complained about this in recent weeks, and many have spoken about the failed system and incompetent record of Irish Water to date.<\/p><p> The second issue is the question of why people have become so annoyed with the water charges.  Why, after all of the austerity of the past six years and the escalating taxes and cuts in wages, have people become so annoyed with this?  The Government obviously regarded this as a minor charge and thought that, as people had swallowed all of the bitter pills so far, this would be another easy pill to swallow.  However, while the Government has attempted in the past year to talk up a recovery and boast about growth and new jobs, many people in our communities have not seen this.  In addition, people view this as a charge that can be beaten through peaceful popular mobilisation.<\/p><p> To have had the water debacle alongside this so-called recovery has had the opposite effect on people.  A huge number continue to struggle, including those who have taken up work in recent months.  I am aware of several people who took up work in recent months but who are no better off, unfortunately, than they were when they were jobless a year ago, which is sad to say.  It is an issue that needs to be addressed.  Those people are struggling to keep their heads above water, if the House will pardon the pun, struggling to pay bills and bringing home small wages of &euro;250 to &euro;300 a week.  The Government needs to recognise this.  It will come in here tomorrow with some concessions, hoping that whatever it announces will provide it with more breathing space.  However, there is a growing feeling that the game is up and that the Government needs to go back to the drawing board.<\/p><p> The two key messages with which I want to leave the Government are these.  First, the infrastructure has to be kept in public ownership.  We must give the people that right and give control of this service back to the people.  Second, we need to scrap the domestic charges, and scrap them for good.  I urge Deputies on all sides of the House to use the opportunity to correct this mistake.  The Government has gone down the wrong road.  It should stop before it goes any further, support this Bill and put this back into the hands of the people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800043#QQ00700","speaker":"1102","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416340800,"counter":463,"content":"<p>I want to commend Teachta Stanley for bringing forward this very important and timely Bill.  Citizens are sick to the teeth of the Government&rsquo;s agenda of relentless austerity and endless list of taxes and charges aimed at those on low and middle incomes.  This water tax is the final straw for many families.  People who would never have thought of protesting have joined tens of thousands of others and taken to the streets against the Government.  Rather than listen, however, the Government has dismissed their concerns.<br\/><br\/>Part of the anger and rejection of the Government proposals around water tax, which was initially a Fianna F&aacute;il idea, comes from the instinctive understanding among Irish people that water is the most basic of resources.  Many rural dwellers, who have to sink their own wells and pay for that, or who are part of group schemes, have paid for water for a very long time.  They understand, as do urban dwellers, that water is a very basic need and that we use it to cook, to wash and to drink.<br\/><br\/>In the history of this State, successive Governments have abjectly failed to properly manage or exploit natural resources for the benefit of Irish citizens.  They have either been under-utilised or sold off to private and foreign interests, the most notorious recent example of this being the disgraceful squandering of our natural gas rights.<br\/><br\/>There is a deep and widespread view, which I share, that the metering of domestic water, the imposition of water charges and the establishment of Uisce &Eacute;ireann is all about setting up the State&rsquo;s water services for privatisation.  The belief is that the ultimate aim is to eventually privatise water supply.  This process has already unfolded with Eircom and, more recently, the establishment of Bord G&aacute;is, which was simply the precursor to selling off that important public asset.  In Sinn F&eacute;in's view, and in the view of an increasing number of thinking people, it makes no sense to throw away decades of State investment through this type of sell-off.  Any move to privatise water would, one assumes, ensure even higher water charges for consumers than those the Government is already contemplating.  In the North, Sinn F&eacute;in has prevented the introduction of water charges and the privatisation of the water services, and we did that in the face of a British Tory party diktat.<br\/><br\/>This constitutional amendment Bill allows for a referendum to retain control of water services in public ownership.  Why should the Government be afraid of that?  Why not give the citizens - the people - their say?  The Bill seeks to enshrine access to clean water in the Constitution and to protect this for future generations.  The European Commission has already received the European citizens initiative on the right to water, which contained 2 million signatures urging the EU to implement the human right to water and sanitation.  More than 90% of citizens in both Italy and Greece voted in referendums to ensure that water privatisation systems would not be implemented.  The Netherlands passed a law in 2004 banning private sector provision of water supply.<br\/><br\/>I listened to the Taoiseach but he has not given a satisfactory explanation of the Government's reluctance to hold a referendum on water ownership.  As Teachta Stanley said, Labour Deputies are on record as supporting this principle and Labour Senators voted for this in the Seanad.  If, as the Government says, there are no plans for the privatisation of Irish Water, then why does it not fully support this Bill?  The Taoiseach, interestingly, in response to a question from me earlier today, said he would reject the Bill and that the Government is against it, and he said it had implications for private property rights.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Harris, is aware of the words of P&aacute;draic Mac Piarais in <i>The Sovereign People<\/i>, when he wrote, &ldquo;...no private right to property is good as against the public right of the nation&rdquo;.  Surely, there is no more appropriate application of that sentiment than to the right of citizens to guaranteed access to something as basic as water.  This Sinn F&eacute;in Bill is about making the import of Pearse&rsquo;s words a reality.  I urge all Deputies to support it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800044#RR00200","speaker":"1066"},{"type":"speech","time":1416340800,"counter":464,"content":"<p>We propose a straightforward amendment to the Constitution that would require a decision of the people by referendum.  It would read, \"The State recognises the right of all persons to sufficient, safe and accessible water and as guardian of the common good shall defend and vindicate this right and ensure that water services and infrastructure remain in public ownership.\"  Some would say that such an amendment should not be necessary.  Unfortunately, the fiasco that has been Uisce &Eacute;ireann, and the pro-privatisation outlook of the Government, means we can be sure of nothing.<\/p><p>  Clean, safe drinking water is a fundamental right.  We in Sinn F&eacute;in believe all public water supplies should be paid for by fair and progressive general taxation.  It is vital that our water services remain in public ownership.  We have been accused of not being able to lay out how we would provide water without these charges but we need only look at our track record.  Sinn F&eacute;in has blocked the introduction of domestic water charges in the North.  Uisce &Eacute;ireann's now sweetened water tax - or water tax light - represents a foot in the door, a way to ensure that people sign up.  Once it has that foot across the threshold, it will not be long before it steps boldly inside their houses.<\/p><p> As we have seen before, these charges will also go up and up.  The fact that the Government has made some concessions shows that they can be reversed.  We now need to go further and ensure that the charges are abolished altogether.  We call for a referendum to be held on the issue of the ownership of our public water services.  Such a referendum would provide the necessary concrete reassurance to citizens that our water services will be protected and maintained in public ownership.<\/p><p> Labhair an Taoiseach cheana ar uisce faoi thalamh.

Fortunately, we did not come down with the last shower.  We recognise that water has to be purified, stored and delivered to the public.  It would have been more prudent of this Government and former Governments to invest in the infrastructure to ensure that water that has been treated at great expense does not simply leak away.  We cannot trust the pro-privatisation agenda of Fine Gael or its newfound friends in Labour in respect of an important resource.  We know that Fianna F&aacute;il also supported introducing water charges.  It originally agreed with the troika to introduce them.<\/p><p> There has been also an attempt to de-legitimise and vilify those who have protested against the water charges.  The peaceful protesters are to be commended.  Sinn F&eacute;in has stood shoulder-to-shoulder with trade unionists and other progressives in the Right2Water campaign.  We are proud that this campaign has been able to mobilise some 150,000 people on to the streets.  The establishment parties have decided to ignore the fact that the vast majority of the protestors have been peaceful.   Most people see Government commentary of recent days as an ill-disguised attempt to frighten people away from exercising their right to protest.  Let us make no mistake.  We are calling for the largest possible mobilisation on 10 December to demonstrate the people's continued widespread opposition to water charges.  We want it to be a dignified and peaceful mobilisation - one that will deliver a clear message to this Government.  <\/p><p> Before concluding my contribution, I want to pose an unanswered question to the Minister of State and his colleagues in Government.  What about the very many people who have to use increased amounts of water directly related to medical conditions they or family members suffer from?  As Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s spokesperson on health, I am disappointed that there is, as yet, no clarification on the issue of subsidised or exempt bills for those with certain medical conditions.  Is it true that this list will not issue until 2017, as has been reported?  The increased burden of bathing and washing of clothes can be very onerous in itself not to mention adding the stress of very expensive water charges.<\/p><p> I ask the Minister of State again to look favourably on our proposed amendment to the Constitution contained in the Bill presented by Deputy Stanley - An Bille um an gCeathr&uacute; Leas&uacute; is Tr&iacute;ocha ar an mBunreacht (Uimh. 3), 2014.  The Irish people cannot accept the water tax because we are already paying for our water supply.  The Irish people cannot accept the water tax because it will go in part to fund an unaccountable and clearly extravagant organisation.  The Irish people cannot accept the water tax as it is anything but what the Government describes it as.  It is yet another austerity tax necessitated by Fianna F&aacute;il and brought into being by Fine Gael and Labour.  I call on every Teachta D&aacute;la regardless of their party or political outlook to do the right thing and support this legislation which guarantees the Irish people a say in the future of water services in our country.

Sinn F&eacute;in has a proven track record of opposition to water charges after the abolishment of such in Northern Ireland and the consistent campaigning against their introduction in this State.  It is time for this Government to start listening to the chorus of voices speaking and chanting together against Irish Water and water charges.  It is time for a referendum.  We are not fooled.  We believe strongly that the setting up of Irish Water is a step towards the privatisation of our water services.  This cannot be allowed to happen.  Water is a human right, not a commodity to be sold off for competitive enterprise.  If the Government is claiming that no such privatisation will take place, it will have no qualms about holding a referendum in order to enshrine it under public ownership in our Constitution.<\/p><p>  The people of this State have been pushed too far and have suffered as a result of Ireland's reckless banking system.  They have given far more than they can afford.<\/p><p>Water charges are but another burden adding to the litany of charges imposed upon hard-pressed citizens who face each week with financial uncertainty and insecurity.<\/p><p>The Government seems to conveniently ignore the fact that not only is charging for water immoral but at a time when the economy has stalled, jobs have been lost, workers' rights have been eroded and families are struggling to keep a roof over their heads, it is simply not affordable.<\/p><p>  In rural Ireland, thousands of people use group water schemes to provide clean and drinkable water for themselves and their community.  Some own private wells that are built and maintained by private individuals.  They are responsible for the installation, upkeep and maintenance at a cost.  Water has already been paid for through centralised tax increases but because the last Fianna F&aacute;il and Green Party Government gave a blank cheque to our failing banks, this money has been diverted to patch over the cracks of a severely broken financial system.  Not only that but after promises of not &quot;one red cent&quot; going back into banks after the 2011 general election, Fine Gael and Labour have carried on with the Fianna F&aacute;il agenda.  They have reneged on many promises to the people of Ireland.  Those in rural areas forced to seek their own drinkable water have already been paying twice for many years.  This is outrageous.  Water should be a public service that provides for all of the public.<\/p><p>Where does rural Ireland fit into Irish Water's plans?  The taxpayer has been subventing Irish Water through the diversion of public funds to set up the corporate entity.  This money could have been used to fix leaks and to provide drinkable water to rural and urban dwellers.  We should have left this with local authorities.  There was no need for call centres, no need for a supra-management structure and no need for the corporate monster that is Irish Water because reformed local authorities were capable of providing the services.  Sinn F&eacute;in will, if in Government, dismantle Irish Water and replace it with a more efficient and democratically accountable public service body with strong input from local authorities.  We believe that we have the solution to the disastrous mess created by this current Government.<\/p><p>  From its conception, Irish Water has been marred by controversy.  It comes as no surprise that now there is widespread opposition to Irish Water.  The people have taken to the streets in their hundreds and thousands.  Has the Government chosen to ignore them for fear of facing up to the fact that it is in its dying days?  Does this Government conveniently forget that it sits in this Chamber, across this floor, representing the very people who are marching against its policies?  Fine Gael and Labour have tried to tactically divide Irish society by pitting the private sector against the public sector, the employed against the unemployed and the well-off against the working poor.  This issue, however, has visibly united people in opposition to the Government's attempt to introduce water charges.  It must listen.  Democracy is in action.  Giving the people of this State a vote on retaining water is vital and that time is now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800045#SS00200","speaker":"981"},{"type":"speech","time":1416341400,"counter":467,"content":"<p>Water is not a commodity.  It is essential for every living thing on this planet.  Without it, there would be no life on this earth.  Access to water has been fundamental to how our societies have been organised since prehistoric times.  The growth of our cities, indeed that of this very city, was centred on access to water.<\/p><p><i>8 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>The privatisation of water would be a betrayal of the Irish people.  Not only is water necessary to every person in this country, it is a fundamental right.  The notion that the water in this State, to which everybody should have free access, could be sold off is a sure sign of a State in disorder.  The privatisation of water would go against the global trend of remunicipalisation, whereby countries and localities have transferred water out of private control and back into the hands of citizens through their governments.  The path this Government is taking is more akin to countries in the developing world which rely heavily on international loans for finance and are obligated to privatise water supplies to stay on-side with their lenders.<\/p><p> We should not forget that Irish Governments have a history of privatising State assets and utility companies.  I remind the House of Eircom and, more recently, the Gas Regulation Bill 2013, which resulted in the sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy, a semi-State business established in 1975.  The Government claims that the sale of the company was part of the deal with the troika but it is also part of a wider liberalisation and privatisation agenda that continues to sweep Europe.  Energy companies often fall victim to privatisation, with consequences for the consumer and the State.  The sale of Bord G&aacute;is Energy to a multinational consortium had an important impact on the economy due to the fact that profits were transferred out of the company.  When the energy supplier is domestically owned, some of the profits are transferred back to the consumer in the form of dividends.  Conversely, when the energy supply is owned by a foreign multinational, those profits are usually moved out of the country.<\/p><p> The privatisation of electricity networks has a direct correlation with increasing energy costs for consumers.  An example of this can be seen in the recent attempts in Germany to take the electricity grid serving Berlin back into public ownership.  The grid network was fully privatised in 2009 and was sold to a multinational company, with the result that electricity bills for consumers in the state of Berlin increased by 21%.  In Britain, an oligopoly of the six biggest private energy companies, which are known as the big six, dominate the market.  This has resulted in tacit co-ordination between the companies to ensure the savings they make are not passed onto the consumer.  The intensity of competition between the big six decreased and price announcements were subsequently aligned so that energy prices far outweighed the cost to the supplier.  In Britain, where the energy market is fully privatised, energy retail profits increased from &euro;223 million in 2009 to &euro;1.1 billion in 2012, with no clear evidence of suppliers becoming more efficient in reducing their own costs.  Moreover, average dual fuel, that is, electricity and gas prices, increased by 24% between 2009 and 2013, nearly double the inflation rate of 13.8%.  It is not without worry that I note Irish Water is under the auspices of Ervia, which was formerly known as Bord G&aacute;is.  What is to say that the current Government or some future Government will not take a fancy to privatising Irish Water in the same way as it privatised Bord G&aacute;is?  Energy would be a means of raining cash.  What if the Government's EU or IMF paymasters insist on this?  The Government says &quot;trust us, this will never happen&quot; but when Sinn F&eacute;in proposed that the Water Services Bill incorporate a section that would ensure public ownership of water, it refused to accept the proposal because it has every intention of leaving water services open to privatisation.  I may be dismissed as being cynical or politically motivated in making that suggestion.  The problem for the Government, however, is that the public also believes it to be true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800045#SS00300","speaker":"1083","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416342000,"counter":469,"content":"<p>One of the remarkable outcomes of the economic crisis which was inflicted on the Irish people, as well as on the people of several countries in Europe, has been that those who caused the crisis by adhering to the bible of deregulation, privatisation and liberalisation, and who followed the diatribes of Reagan and Thatcher, won even though they failed our people because their huge gambles in Las Vegas banks were paid back by citizens across Europe.  Assets which belonged to the people of Europe were privatised or made ripe for privatisation.<\/p><p>  That is the environment in which the Irish people are expected to trust Fine Gael, which shares the world view of political parties that have implemented these right wing policies and associates with these parties within the European People's Party.  We are expected to accept Fine Gael's assurances that it will be grand because it is in the legislation.  The reason people seek to enshrine matters of immense importance in the Constitution is because only the people can undo such provisions.  The best way to reassure the Irish people that there is no plan to privatise their water is to agree to a referendum on this amendment.  I have no doubt it would be overwhelmingly passed and public ownership of water would thereby be protected.  Given that the Government is in such a crisis, I do not understand why it is not availing of the opportunity provided by this Bill to reassure people.  This leads me to have doubts about the Government's intention.  In its approach to Europe wide policies, Fine Gael is closely aligned in ideology, word and deed to its colleagues across the EU.<\/p><p>  There has been resistance across the world to the privatisation of water, most heroically in Bolivia, where it was literally a matter of life and death.  The attempt to privatise water led to a popular uprising.  Uprisings are taking place across the countries in Europe that have been betrayed by their own political leaders and the right wing ideology of greed and inequality.  In Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland there is a noticeable swing to genuine parties of the left which believe in equality.  These parties have shown solidarity internationally.  Sinn F&eacute;in is proud to work in partnership with political parties, particularly in Spain and Greece, which share a common platform and to present to people in Ireland and, because we have a bigger picture view, in Europe and across the world, the fight back and popular resistance against that which has failed them.<\/p><p>  How can this famous 1% have so much control over our lives?  Why do we fear to ask the very wealthy - I am not speaking about the middle classes or the upper middle classes - to pay their fair share?  We do not begrudge them the big house, the big car or the big lifestyle.  All we ask is that they pay their fair share, that they do not have tax avoidance schemes, travel to exotic places or move their companies here, there and all around.  Whenever Sinn F&eacute;in proposes commonsense economic policies which ask the very wealthy to pay their fair share to take the pressure off the squeezed middle and the vulnerable, we hear the bleeding hearts defending them.<\/p><p>It is for these reasons that people do not trust the Government when its members tell them not to worry, this is all covered in the legislation and everything will be grand.  Legislation can be changed overnight, but the Constitution cannot be changed unless the people sign off on that change by way of a referendum.  If the Minister of State and his Fine Gael Party colleagues are sincere in their assurance that privatisation of water supply is not their plan - albeit it is the shared objective of their right-wing colleagues in Europe - then they should back this Bill and thereby answer the people's demand for a referendum on the matter.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800046#TT00200","speaker":"998","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416342600,"counter":471,"content":"<p>The Government is opposed to the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' Bill before the House this evening.  I never cease to be amazed by that party's capacity repeatedly to table ill-judged and badly-timed motions and Bills.  Its members' collective amnesia is quite astounding.  Have those sitting opposite not been listening to the recent statements from the Taoiseach, T&aacute;naiste, Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, and other Ministers and Deputies regarding the imminent announcement on water charges?  Are they concerned that if they wait until tomorrow, their thunder will be stolen?  Is this another attempt, in line with their deputy leader's stunt in this House last Thursday, to deflect attention from the real issues facing their party?<br\/><br\/>Having said all that, I thank the Sinn F&eacute;in Party for the opportunity it has provided me to detail the significant reform programme under way in the water sector.  While an extra 24 hours would have allowed us to debate the water charges package the Minister will bring to Government tomorrow morning for its approval, it is no harm to place on the record the actions this Government has taken to ensure security of supply and improve the quality of drinking water for future generations in this country.<br\/><br\/>Before doing so, however, I will first address the disgraceful events that transpired over the weekend and last night.  I absolutely condemn this deplorable behaviour.  I acknowledge that people have concerns and some feel driven to protest.  It is perfectly acceptable to protest in an effective and peaceful manner.  However, persons involved in recent events have sought to undermine and disrespect the democratic process and the opportunity to have an open discussion and debate on all the issues involved.  Their actions amount to targeted intimidation of public representatives and those working with them.  As such, they are absolutely unacceptable.  The office in Nenagh of the Minister, Deputy Kelly, was contacted yesterday and a bomb threat was made.  That is totally unacceptable in any mature democracy.  I expect every public representative, from all parties and none, to condemn strongly any such threats.  On Saturday, what should have been a happy and celebratory event at Jobstown turned into a terrifying ordeal for all those involved.  Were the rights of those graduates and their families even considered?  It was a very special day for them but it turned into a horrible scene for all involved.  I have seen no remorse or apology from Deputy Paul Murphy in regard to what happened on Saturday.  In fact, in an interview today he suggested that it would have amounted to peaceful action to keep the T&aacute;naiste trapped in a car for more than 12 hours.<br\/><br\/>There is no place in a democracy for what happened in Jobstown at the weekend or in Sligo yesterday evening.  The majority of people living in those places are decent law-abiding citizens and would agree with me on that.  In recent weeks we have seen attacks and veiled threats against public representatives, editors of national newspapers and members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  These targets represent some of the fundamental pillars of our democracy.  As democratically elected Members of Parliament, we must ensure those pillars are protected and their members allowed to operate without fear or intimidation.  I say to each Member of this House who acts from a sense of decency and goodwill that we can have no <i>&agrave;<\/i><b><i><\/i><\/b><i>la carte<\/i>democrats in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  We have had a glimpse of anarchy on our streets and it was not a welcome sight.  There is a place for peaceful protest in a democracy but, ultimately, it is for the people to judge us at the ballot box and decide whom they wish to elect.<br\/><br\/>I will shortly address the specifics of the Sinn F&eacute;in proposal.  Before doing so, I draw Members' attention to one of the many untold aspects of the Irish Water story, namely, that group of people who have been affected in an extreme way by this controversy.  Regardless of one's position on water charges, it is important to highlight their story, which has been drowned out by the wider noise around this issue.  I am referring to the workers contracted with Irish Water to install meters, people who are just trying to earn a living.  I call on all Members of this House to condemn the unacceptable behaviour these workers have had to endure.<br\/><br\/>I accept that the majority of protests are carried out in a peaceful manner and most people would be horrified by the prospect of some of what has occurred.  However, before coming to the House this evening, I asked people at Irish Water to tell me the types of incidents that have occurred.  What I was told makes for a harrowing and horrifying tale.  For example, meter installers have been followed home and, in one case, this led to an assault that involved a worker being bitten.  In fact, in the region of 50 assaults have been reported, with workers being punched, kicked and headbutted.  Hot water has been thrown on some installers.  Tyres have been slashed on a number of work vehicles, including at the homes of team members.  Some protesters have driven their cars at metering staff and at barriers behind which staff are working or while they have been operating heavy machinery.  Workers have been spat at, had objects hurled at them from glass to stones, and been hit with hammers and shovels.  There has been verbal abuse and threats of violence.  There has been a heavy and persistent level of online intimidation and encouragement of cyberbullying and physical abuse towards team members.  Social media have been used to find the names and addresses of workers.  We have instances where workers have been intimidated by the use of false firearms.  In one case, installers were held in a van for more than 12 hours without access to food, water or toilet facilities.<br\/><br\/>What form of protest is that?  To deny someone the right to food and water for 12 hours is not a protest; it is a form of thuggery.  I accept that people are angry and frustrated, but there is no justification whatsoever for this type of behaviour in a democratic society.  I ask colleagues to join me in condemning this behaviour in the strongest terms.  More than 1,300 people are employed on the water metering programme and the social inclusion commitment means that some 400 of these are people who were previously on the live register.<br\/><br\/>Let me remind Deputies of the purpose and benefits of installing meters.  They help households to monitor their consumption, give vital consumption data for planning purposes and, most important, help us to identify leaks.  In recent months, Members of the Opposition, including the authors of this motion, have declared repeatedly in this House that they would fix the leaks first before metering.  What they have never explained, however, is how they would find these leaks without water meters.  Given that a huge number of leaks are invisible and approximately 11% of all households are finding leaks, how would Sinn F&eacute;in propose to identify such leaks without meters?  Are Members opposite really saying they would spend money running cameras through the country's pipework in an effort to identify leaks?  That is not realistic.  There are 20 households in Ireland leaking over 1 million of litres a day into their driveway.  That is enough per household to serve the town of Gorey with water for a day.  Sinn F&eacute;in Members, however, say they know where all the leaks are and will fix them without meters.  Let me be absolutely clear - it is impossible to find, identify and fix such leaks without meters.<br\/><br\/>Moreover, that is not the only aspect of its water policy that Sinn F&eacute;in has backwards.  The party's Deputies believe in paying their bills until they lose a by-election.  Deputy Gerry Adams was enjoying the moral high ground, saying he would pay his water bill, before conveniently changing tack following the Dublin South-West by-election.  This was an effort to outflank the fragmented far left of the Irish political spectrum.  As we all know, Deputy Adams has no problem changing his tune to get himself out of trouble.<br\/><br\/>I will now set out the background to the water charges package the Minister  plans to announce tomorrow.  It is a package that will deliver the certainty the public has been seeking regarding the affordability of water charges.  I look forward to debating our proposals during the course of the week.  I acknowledge that mistakes have been made as we have attempted to roll out the reforms at a pace unprecedented anywhere in the world.  The scale of the endeavour to set up a new water utility is enormous.  While the memorandum of understanding agreed with the troika was the context for the speed in passing water services legislation last December, it is now accepted that the guillotining of the Bill did not best serve any of our purposes.  Put simply, the timelines for the full establishment and operation of Irish Water were too ambitious and the charging structure has proved to be too complex.  This has led to confusion, uncertainty and dissatisfaction among the public.<br\/><br\/>The Government has listened to people's concerns and they will be addressed in the water charges package to be announced tomorrow.  This will bring the necessary certainty by introducing a charging system that is clear and affordable.  Householders will know exactly how much they will be required to pay.<\/p><p>There will be adequate supports for all and payment options will be flexible.<\/p><p> The Government has a clear vision for the reform of water services in this country.  The central planks of the water reform programme, namely, a new national water utility, a sustainable funding model and independent economic regulation, have been considerably advanced.  The objectives of the programme are to protect public health, increase economic competitiveness and conserve our environment.  Ireland needs a clean, reliable drinking water supply and coastal waters, rivers and lakes that are free of pollution.<\/p><p> As water resources become more critical, due to economic recovery, population growth and climate change, increased infrastructural investment and improved service delivery are needed.  Future challenges also make the need for a more cost-effective, efficient, national-oriented system imperative.  Our population is growing, and is forecast to continue growing in the coming decades.  Our economy is recovering, bringing with it added water demand for industry and agriculture.  Clean water is expensive both to produce and manage.  There is a complex process involved in turning raw water into clean drinking water and treating waste water so that it can be reintroduced back into our environment.  The traditional water services system was deficient, inadequate and in need of fundamental change.  Ireland's previous funding model was unsustainable.  Despite the good work of the local authorities, decades of underinvestment in water services has resulted in many significant issues in the system.  The ever rising standards in water and wastewater quality have required a radical transition from relatively low-technology, labour-intensive plants to much more complex technologies requiring increasingly advanced operational control.<\/p><p> The answer lies in more aggregated service delivery giving economies of scale, the required specialisation, standardisation and cost efficiencies in procurement and capital delivery.  All citizens deserve the same quality water service, and we need particularly to address the situation of people who are on boil water notices.  The only way deficiencies could be rectified, the infrastructure deficit removed, quality problems addressed and inefficiencies tackled was by creating a single, national utility and a new funding model.  The single utility model, with local and regional structures, will deliver these changes.  This is one of the most ambitious reform programmes undertaken in the history of State and will deliver significant benefits for customers in the medium to long term.<\/p><p> Historical underinvestment means we have a water services system which is failing both customers and taxpayers, and this is no longer tenable.  The level of investment required to bring our systems up to date runs to billions of euro.  The Government has agreed on a funding model that will allow subvention of Irish Water to help the public offset some of the direct cost of funding water services, while designing the model in a way that allows Irish Water to operate commercially.  The new funding model, which includes domestic water charges, allows us to address these legacy issues and provide new infrastructure for the future.  As a commercial utility, Irish Water can borrow from the markets in a similar way to the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is.  In broad terms, if Government support is not more than 50% of Irish Water's operational revenue, it will be considered under EUROSTAT rules to be a commercial undertaking.  This will mean debt raised by Irish Water to fund capital will not count as Government debt and will be more favourable in terms of our general Government deficit than funding through direct Exchequer funding.<\/p><p> The Commission for Energy Regulation has permitted Irish Water to spend up to &euro;1.77 billion on its capital programme over the period ahead if funding can be accessed.  We could not afford this level of investment through the traditional model without significant budget impacts in terms of taxation or cuts to other areas of spending.  As in other OECD countries, domestic water charges form an important part of the funding model for water services.  For this reason, we need to move to a system where funding comes directly from those who use it, thus creating a real emphasis on sustainable use of this precious, expensive resource.  Already through the domestic metering programme, we are seeing an emphasis on identifying customer-side leakage, which accounts for some 5% of the national leakage rate of up to 49%.  This is an emphasis on reducing leakage never seen before in Ireland, and will be accompanied by a customer focus on conservation and sustainable usage in the long term that should bring consumption down by an estimated 10% to 15%.<\/p><p> The Government's reforming vision has meant challenges for all involved, but there are also significant benefits from the reforms.  With the new funding model for the sector, we will see the increased infrastructural investment needed to improve water quality in areas where it does not meet the desired standards.  Other priority objectives will also be achievable as a result of the new funding model.  These include reducing the unacceptably high levels of leakage, ensuring our wastewater treatment plants meet the required effluent standards and increasing water supply capacity to meet future demands to support population and economic growth.  It is only with increased capital investment, which will have to double in the coming years from this year's level of &euro;310 million, and new approaches to service delivery and planning that we can achieve these objectives.  I have already mentioned the critical need to ensure security of supply.  This is particularly important for sectors that rely on large supplies of water such as the food and drinks industry, the IT sector and the pharmaceutical sector, among others.  Securing our water supplies is also critical for the protection of our environment and to safeguard public health.<\/p><p> An independent assessment published in 2012 reviewed the strengths and weaknesses of the delivery of water services through 34 local authorities, and concluded that there was a fragmentation of leadership and co-ordination, difficulty in attaining economies of scale, difficulty in delivering projects of national importance and an aging and poor quality network.  The report concluded that the best way of ensuring increasing efficiency and effectiveness of operations and capital investment and accessing new finances for the water sector was to establish Irish Water as a public utility.  The establishment of Irish Water is a critical long-term project for this country and of absolute economic necessity.  It will become among the largest utilities in the history of the State and is absolutely necessary for a safe and secure supply of water into the future.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the subject of the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill.  While I have acknowledged that mistakes were made, the establishment of Irish Water was not one of them.  The water system needs a national utility to manage it, finance its upgrade and deliver a water system that is fit for purpose.  The transformation programme under way is significant and involves both funding and organisational changes.  Each of these would be significant undertakings in their own right.  The public has the right to honest debate.  There is no evidence to support the propaganda of a privatisation agenda.  Devoid of any substantive arguments, Opposition politicians have resorted to propagating this myth.  As evidenced from a recent debate in the Seanad on Irish Water, it is clear that all parties in both Houses support public ownership of water infrastructure.  Everyone should acknowledge this and put the public at ease.<\/p><p> This Bill proposed by Sinn F&eacute;in is flawed in a number of ways.  First, the proposed amendment of the Constitution would create a constitutional right to water without taking any account of costs or implications for private property rights and without any specific requirement for people to pay for water.  This runs counter to the United Nations policy which seeks to guarantee people the right to &quot;affordable&quot; water.  These issues need to be properly considered and thought through.  We do not want to find ourselves in a situation where we have damaged the rights of owners of private property.<\/p><p> Second, the latter part of the amendment would create a constitutional requirement that water services and infrastructure remain in public ownership.  Existing legislation already provides a statutory prohibition on the disposal of Irish Water and its water services infrastructure.  I would not consider it an appropriate approach to amend the Constitution to provide for a prohibition on the privatisation of a utility company.  I agree in principle that everyone, wherever located, should have access to clean drinking water and sanitation facilities.  However, enshrining individual rights in the Constitution is extremely complex and would require detailed legal analysis before it could be supported.  The costs to the State and individual citizens of providing for such a right would need to be examined.  The effect on property rights of individual citizens and the effect on privately owned group water schemes would also need consideration.  There are more than 500 private group water schemes in the State and more than 1,500 small private supplies and private wells that service almost 12% of the population.  These matters would all have to be carefully analysed before any proposal could be considered.  I would also like to point out to Deputies that the last time we were bounced into a rushed constitutional change, we ended up with the Eighth amendment of the Constitution in the 1980s, and nobody wants to go back there.<\/p><p> The Water Services Act 2013 provides for the establishment of Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, conforming to the conditions contained in the Act and registered under the Companies Acts.<\/p><p> Section 5 of the Act provides that one share in Irish Water shall be issued to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, now Ervia, with the remaining shares allocated equally between the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  As Ervia is a fully State-owned company, Irish Water is accordingly in full State ownership.<\/p><p> Subsection 5(6) of the Act, as amended by section 46 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013, prohibits each of the three shareholders from disposing of their shareholding in Irish Water and thus places a statutory prohibition on the privatisation of Irish Water.<\/p><p> There is a further statutory provision which safeguards water services infrastructure in public ownership.  Section 31(12) of the Water Services Act 2007 prevents Irish Water from entering into any agreement or arrangement with another person which involves, or may involve, the transfer of assets and infrastructure from Irish Water to that person.<\/p><p> Irish Water was established as a public utility under the Water Services Act 2013 to ensure that public water services would be provided in an efficient and sustainable manner.  There was no intention to establish this company in order to make the privatisation of public water services an option in the future.  The legislation is clear on the Government's intention to keep Irish Water in public ownership and accountable to the Oireachtas.<\/p><p> The commitment to public ownership of water services was enshrined in 2007 legislation and then reaffirmed in the legislation passed before the end of 2013.  Yet the myths about privatisation continue.  All parties in both Houses support public ownership of water infrastructure.  Once again, I would like to state categorically that Irish Water is, and will remain, in full State ownership.<\/p><p> Furthermore at EU policy level, the European Commission stated in January 2013 that imposing privatisations on public authorities in member states would be contrary to the principles of the EU treaty and case law.  Moreover, the Government's water sector reform programme has advanced in the context of an agreed memorandum of understanding with the troika.  <\/p><p> Public ownership of water services is the will of the Irish people.  As part of a Government package of water measures to be finalised this week, the Minister, Deputy Kelly, will propose to bring forward measures - through primary legislation rather than a constitutional amendment - which would bolster the existing legislative prohibition on privatisation.<\/p><p> It is critical that Irish Water performs as the Oireachtas and the public expect.  The Government recognises that a number of concerns have arisen in the context of getting Irish Water fully up and running.  There is a way to go before we have the world-class water system the public deserves, but we have already achieved much progress during this ambitious programme for reform.<\/p><p> For example, by Christmas of this year, boil water notices will be removed for the first time in 12 years in parts of Roscommon as a result of the creation of Irish Water.  Next year, there will be an increase of &euro;100 million  in investment in water services infrastructure in the State.<\/p><p> The utility has already adopted a new approach towards asset management and capital projects planning.  Evidence of this is the targeted &euro;170 million saving through the proposed Ringsend waste water treatment plant upgrade as an alternative to plant extension.  That is the cost of Irish Water's establishment saved in one strategic decision.  Let me repeat that in one project Irish Water will save the entirety of its start-up costs.<\/p><p> I acknowledge that there have been failures in communication, in communicating key objectives and the benefits of the utility model to our people.  Irish Water has acknowledged this also and has specifically apologised to customers and elected Members for these failings.  I am ensuring that steps are being taken to remedy this.<\/p><p> Following legislation passed in 2013, the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, assumed responsibility for the independent economic regulation of public water services.  The commission's work to date has demonstrated the importance and impact of independent, economic regulation.  In the area of setting performance standards for the utility, the CER has already announced that it will conduct a partial, overall performance assessment of Irish Water to incentivise the utility to improve its performance in areas like service delivery.  Irish Water will be required to publish the performance results.  This will incentivise the company to improve its performance around a set of key metrics - for example, customer service scores, drinking water standards and environmental compliance.  An overall performance assessment will commence from the beginning of the first full revenue review period in 2017.<\/p><p> The CER has also shown its independence in its examination of Irish Water's establishment and operational costs, as well as its capital plans.  As outlined earlier, it rejected 5% of proposed establishment costs, 13.5% of operational costs and has set an overall reduction in costs of 8.2%.  Operational costs will have to come down by 7% per annum and the same level of efficiency will be required in relation to non-committed capital costs.  These cost reductions are aimed at ensuring that Irish Water's customers only pay charges to cover reasonable costs on the system.<\/p><p> Public engagement is a key component of economic regulation and, to date, the CER has held several public consultations on the issues of an economic regulatory framework, domestic and non-domestic tariff structures, a customer handbook, and a proposed water charges plan.  A number of important public consultations lie ahead, not least on the proposed first fix policy, which will see customers' first leaks being fixed free of charge and consultation on all aspects of non-domestic charges.<\/p><p> The establishment of the CER as the independent economic regulator for Irish Water is a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to ensure that the interests of customers are well represented.  The CER has a statutory role in protecting the interests of customers of Irish Water.  Ensuring measures are in place to safeguard and protect these interests is, and will remain, a high priority.  The implementation of the comprehensive water services legislation enacted in 2013 will be kept under ongoing and active review to ensure that the CER has the necessary powers to protect the interests of customers.<\/p><p> Similar to the approach it has taken in the electricity and gas industries, the CER has required Irish Water to submit a customer handbook outlining the minimum requirements of customer service standards they will provide to their customers.  The customer handbook comprises Irish Water's customer charter, codes of practice, and the terms and conditions of supply.  These include standards in relation to the performance by Irish Water of its functions; the provision of information to customers of Irish Water for the purposes of enabling customers to communicate with Irish Water; methods of payment of water charges; and any other matters that the commission considers necessary and appropriate to secure<\/p><p> Furthermore, the CER and Irish Water have also agreed to enter into a voluntary dispute resolution agreement which will set out agreed working arrangements and processes to deal with customer disputes.  In addition, the CER will engage with both Irish Water and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to develop complementary complaints processes to ensure customers are directed in an efficient manner to the appropriate organisation with their complaint or query.<\/p><p> Independent regulation is the key element of this model, as it ensures that Irish Water's costs are scrutinised and that challenging efficiency targets are set.  The Commission for Energy Regulation, taking account of international benchmarks and the experience of start\u00adups of other utilities, has set a challenging target of a 7% reduction per annum in Irish Water's overall operational costs.<\/p><p> The citizens of Ireland deserve a high quality, reliable water supply.  The European Union has set quality standards to which we are obliged to adhere.  The European Communities (Drinking Water) Regulations 2014 detail the chemical and microbiological parameters that must be met by suppliers of drinking water, including Irish Water.<\/p><p> The EPA is the supervisory authority with responsibility for monitoring Irish Water's compliance with the regulations.  The procedures to be followed where there is non-compliance with parameter values are clearly laid out in the regulations.<\/p><p> In parallel with the Government's work on water charges, Irish Water is working to improve its engagement with customers and public representatives.  Already it has adjusted resources in its customer call centre so that the public receives quicker response times when calling to register or seek information.  This reallocation of resources has already resulted in a more positive initial engagement and average customer response times have dropped to below 20 seconds.<\/p><p> Irish Water is also strengthening its engagement with elected representatives.  It has opened dedicated telephone lines for Oireachtas Members and councillors, and provides a fortnightly newsletter and weekly clinics for Oireachtas Members.  This is an important outlet for Members to receive information on behalf of constituents about issues such as capital improvements, drinking water quality or customer interactions with the utility.<\/p><p> The establishment of a unified Ervia\/lrish Water Board presents an opportunity to reinvigorate the organisation so that it becomes significantly more customer-focused in its operations and communications.  The Ervia Group and Irish Water are actively reviewing their communication strategy to better reflect the needs of all stakeholders, including elected Members.<\/p><p> The Government's vision is for a country in which every household and business connected to the public water system has a high quality, reliable water supply.  To achieve this we must invest heavily in our infrastructure, reduce leakage levels and address deficiencies in our waste water treatment systems.  The Irish economy of today needs certainty of supply for its recovery, but the economy of tomorrow can be even stronger if we position Ireland as a water-secure economy for water-intensive industries, an advantage that will become more important as other countries struggle with their supplies.<\/p><p>There is global desperation about water and we must work hard to avoid experiencing this danger.  Through the reform vision we are implementing, new thinking and partnerships between those with ideas and expertise, we can make Ireland a shining example of sustainable water management, bringing with it greater environmental and economic security.<\/p><p> I have outlined to the House the details of the Government's actions within the short period it has been at the helm and its focus on the development of a sustainable water supply system into the future.  The Government will continue to keep all matters relating to water sector reform firmly at the top of the agenda.  The ineptitude of previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments in the management of our water infrastructure and supply placed many communities and businesses in unenviable positions.  The Government will not be found wanting in dealing with their plight.  For the reasons detailed, without hesitation I oppose the Bill before the House.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800047#UU00200","speaker":"1092","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416344400,"counter":475,"content":"<p>I was listening to the Minister of State express his outrage about what had happened at the weekend.  I agree that it was outrageous, but sometimes it is important for the Government to look at the mote in its eye.  When members of the Government were in opposition, I remember the total character assassination, day in and day out, of the Government at the time.  They impugned our motives to the point that they inflamed passions.  They might remember the incident when paint was thrown over Mary Harney, then a Minister.  At the time they did not seem to be too concerned about the results of the lies they were telling about this incident.  Do Deputies opposite think I acted in anyway other than in what I thought was the interest of the people?  Do they think I acted for bankers, builders or any other vested interest?  If I did, they are doing the same because they are following the same policies.  The vast majority of Members work honestly and to the best of their ability.  We might believe in different things and take a different approach, but, unless I had good grounds for saying so, I never impugned the integrity of someone in this House who had devoted his or her life to public service.  It is important to realise that what we must do in Ireland is debate the issues.  The way members of the Government tackled matters when in opposition did not allow for debate or any teasing out of the different options we faced because of the collapse of the world banking system.<br\/><br\/>Members of the Government should get a copy of the National Recovery Plan 2011-2014, also known as the four year plan.  They should stop using the troika, the four year plan and Fianna F&aacute;il as the excuse for everything.  It is worth reading what was included in the four year plan about the local property tax: <blockquote>The Plan commits to a funding platform for local Government on a phased basis.  An interim Site Value Tax will be introduced in 2012, applicable to all land other than agricultural land and land subject to commercial rates.  The interim measure will involve a fixed local service contribution of about &euro;100 per annum (&euro;2 per week) which will raise &euro;180 million from households.  The final Site Value Tax will be introduced in 2013 when valuations have been completed.<br \/><br \/>It is estimated that Site Value Tax will apply to 1.8 million households and zoned lands that would equate to an estimated further 700,000 houses.  At an average of just over &euro;200 per dwelling (or site) this would raises the &euro;530 million full year amount targeted for the Plan period.<br \/><br \/>For full implementation of the tax, commercial rates will be moved to a site value basis also.<\/blockquote>All that was going to be raised from dwelling houses was an average of &euro;200 per house, not the figures we are getting in Dublin, Galway and other urban areas, where the average local property tax amount will be much higher than the site value tax.  It is amazing that the Government was able to drop the site value tax for the much more expensive local property tax which is more sensitive to rising house prices.  It does not state the troika had any problem with these changes.  It is amazing that it does not have any difficulty with the total failure to deliver reforms in some of the closed professions, particularly the legal profession.  Deputy Alan Shatter was interested in reform of the legal profession, but vested interests in the Law Library were going to make sure that did not take place.  The Government has chosen not to do a lot of things included in the plan, many of which would be good reforms that would be timely and are badly needed.  It is time it stood on its own feet and stated it believes in water charges and will continue with the programme.<br\/><br\/>The second thing we hear is that there was no investment in water infrastructure during the period of the previous Government.  In my constituency I can name scheme after scheme and area after area that benefited.  The figures speak for themselves, with over &euro;3 billion invested in wastewater services and &euro;2 billion in the provision of a water supply.  There is hardly an area in the country that has not seen an improved water supply.  One of the programmes the previous Government was completing, to which the current Government put an end, involved bringing water to those who did not have access to a public supply through a group scheme or the public supply provided by a local authority.  People living in marginal areas are not very important to the Government.<br\/><br\/>Another issue escapes attention because the detail can be embarrassing.  We are not just talking about water charges; the Government is also charging for wastewater and the provision of wastewater services is much more expensive than the provision of water services.  Much of the wastewater does not come from private households but from the public street or wherever water accumulates, particularly in urban areas.  It must be disposed of, which adds hugely to the cost of the so-called water service.  It is obvious, when we look at the figures for the 500,000 houses that do not have access to a public wastewater service under the Government's regime, that a two-person household was to be charged &euro;149, while a single person household was to be charged &euro;88.  This was something that was never contemplated.  I remember debating the septic tank Bill as we called it, or the Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2011, and the Minister was categoric that people would not be charged for water out of a household because I asked that question on Committee Stage.  He was categoric, but something has changed since.<br\/><br\/>The Minister of State says there is no question of selling the water service.  I am glad to hear it.  Do I believe it?  The answer is not really.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800050#XX00200","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1416344400,"counter":476,"content":"<p>It is a little like Eircom.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800050#XX00300","speaker":"1058"},{"type":"speech","time":1416344400,"counter":477,"content":"<p>That was a mistake.<\/p><p>The difference between us and the current Government is that we learned from our mistakes.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800050#XX00400","speaker":"1044","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1416345000,"counter":479,"content":"<p>The Deputy's party did it.

The Government was going to sell it off.<\/p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in was right to have this debate tonight.  The debate on water proposals should have taken place over the past week.  There is no point in the Government's coming to the House tomorrow, putting a proposal and stating that we can debate it all we like but not as much as a full stop will be changed.  That is a stupid way of doing business.  The debate should happen first and, after everybody has been listened to, proposals should be put forward in a way that is open to flexibility and change if good arguments are put forward.  The Government has decided to listen to nobody, as those opposite have indicated their belief that tonight's debate is a waste of time.<\/p><p>  I can put a challenge to the Minister of State.  There is an easy way to put the water issue beyond doubt.  For example, the Government could pass legislation stipulating that it would take an 80% majority of the House to pass a proposal to privatise any part of water services now in public ownership.  It is easily done, but let us see if the Government will do it.  To be honest, the Government is telling us that because something is in law the company cannot be privatised, but on any day a majority of Deputies can be told to dance and will do so.  That means there is still no protection for the people.  Do I trust the Government?  No, I do not.  It spoke about privatising Coillte or the forest crop but we managed to put it off that as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800051#YY03900","speaker":"1044"},{"type":"speech","time":1416345000,"counter":517,"content":"<p>The Deputy is taking credit for that?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800051#YY04000","speaker":"1092"},{"type":"speech","time":1416345000,"counter":518,"content":"<p>It will be interesting to see what the next idea on privatisation will be.

We should agree tonight to support the thrust of the Sinn F&eacute;in Bill, as Second Stage is about the principle of the Bill.

Tomorrow the Government will do a patching-up job, and that will not satisfy the Irish people.  At this stage, the level of distrust is so high on this issue that it is time for the Government to rethink it on a fundamental level so as to recognise that time moves on.

I fully support the Bill, and the Government should not oppose it.  We should go further and amend Article 10 rather than Article 40 of the Constitution so as to enshrine the right of the Irish people to retain ownership of all our natural resources, including minerals or water.<\/p><p>  The Government has stated that it is listening to what the people want, and it is making much of the package to be announced tomorrow.  It believes it will help the issue go away.  The news for the Minister of State and his colleagues is that it will not go away and whatever the Government does tomorrow will not satisfy the Irish people.  If the government was serious about trying to allay the fears of Irish people, it would accept the Bill and have a referendum on the protection of water services for citizens.  It is a small step in helping the Irish people come to terms with the Government's goals.  It is not interested in that course of action as, ultimately, it wants to privatise the water service.  There is no doubt about it.<\/p><p>  The Taoiseach and the Minister of State today made much of the fact that section 46 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 ensures that privatisation cannot happen.  It would be the simplest thing in the world for a future Minister for the environment to table a very short amending Bill to change that section of the 2013 and use a majority in the House to ensure it went through.  That will happen, although it will not happen now or in the next year.  It will happen before 2025, when the service level agreements with local authorities start to run out.  The Government has assigned ComReg to deal with billings and it was established with the sole aim of liberalising the electricity market in the country.  It did so and opened it for privatisation.  When ComReg looks to renew service level agreements, it will demand that the sector be opened to competition and the local authorities will have to compete with the likes of Veolia, Severn Trent Water and Celtic Anglian Water for the right to provide water services.  That is the type of legislation that will be unleashed on the Irish people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800051#YY04500","speaker":"1001"},{"type":"speech","time":1416345000,"counter":523,"content":"<p>The views of Professor Kathleen Lynch, head of the UCD school of social justice, are appropriate in this discussion.  She has argued that water is a public good that cannot and should not be commodified, commercialised or privatised, and it is the duty of the State to protect people's right to safe, secure, accessible and affordable water.  She has argued that what is a public good cannot and must not be turned into a profit-making opportunity for multinational corporations.  In that context, I welcome the proposal for a referendum.<\/p><p>  This proposal first saw life as a smoke screen to divert attention from the central issue of the day, the abolition of hated water charges, which is what the public wants.  The calls came from the likes of Eamon Ryan, the leader of the Green Party, who was responsible, along with Fianna F&aacute;il, for putting water charges on the agenda, as well as Labour Party backbenchers who were chasing any fig leaf behind which they could hide their broken promises.  Their 2011 manifesto opposed water charges and they had a spoof advertisement lambasting Fine Gael for proposing such a charge.<\/p><p><i>9 o&amp;rsquo;clock<\/i><\/p> <p>Calls also came from Labour Senators involved in internecine party strife on convenient issues.  The SIPTU leader, Jack O'Connor, is a Government supporter who is completely out of touch with the union's members and he and assorted others are in favour of these hated water charges.<br\/><br\/>A huge number of the risen people have taken to the streets and they should not be regarded as fools.  They will not be taken in by a smokescreen or cynical tricks on referendums and allowances.  They will not be sold a pup again, as they were by the Labour Party in 2011.  The public will not accept a referendum as a <i>quid pro quo<\/i>for accepting water charges for families, whatever the rate charged and whatever the period of charge restrictions.  The people know that if water charges are put in place they will rise to the full cost of recovery under EU law.  They also know that the abolition of water charges must go hand in hand with a referendum.  Only people power can secure such an abolition of charges and the most important task for the risen people is to turn out in huge numbers for the national demonstration on 10 December in Dublin.  They must support their local protests too and I call on people in Tipperary to do so next Saturday in Nenagh and on Saturday, 29 November in Clonmel.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2014111800051#YY04600","speaker":"960","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416345600,"counter":525,"content":"<p>Debate adjourned.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1416345600,"counter":526,"content":"<p>The D&aacute;il adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 9.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 November 2014.<\/p>","notice":"TIME STRING DETECTED"}]
