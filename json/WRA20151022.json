This compares very well with other European countries and is clear evidence of a substantial improvement in the oral health of children in Ireland.  Future service provision will be informed by the National Oral Health Policy, which the Department of Health is currently developing.  This three-year project commenced in 2014 and is being led by the Chief Dental Officer.  The project includes a needs assessment, a review of resources and involves consultation with stakeholders, including dental professionals and the public.<\/p>  <p>  Dental services for children up to 16 years of age and persons of all ages with special needs are provided by the Public Dental Service of the HSE through its dental clinics.  HSE dental clinics provide a screening and fissure sealant programme for children at key stages of development, aged 6 to 8 and 11 to 13.  The service includes referral for further treatment, including orthodontic treatment, where necessary.  Emergency care for children up to 16 years of age and treatment for special needs patients is also provided.  Resources have been released in 2015 and into 2016 to improve dental services in areas where there have been difficulties.  The HSE is also commencing a pilot scheme for 0-3 year-old children to assess what advice should be given to parents regarding best care of their teeth.<\/p>  <p>  With regard to orthodontic services, the HSE has established a pilot scheme in Dublin North East which will involve the use of orthodontic therapists in the treatment of a number of eligible children.  Consideration will be given to expanding this scheme to other HSE areas in the future.  In addition, a national procurement process is currently underway to provide treatment for certain categories of misalignment by a panel of independent practitioners under contract to the HSE over the next three years, with consideration of an extension to four years.  This initiative will especially focus on those waiting for four years or longer.  It is expected that this initiative will commence later this year and will have a positive impact on waiting times.<\/p>  <p>  It is the policy of the HSE that general anaesthesia should, if possible, be avoided in the practice of dentistry.  Since 2012 the HSE has been upskilling dental teams in conscious sedation as an alternative.  These developments, together with regular validation of waiting lists, will result in more appropriate and timely access for patients who require these specialised services.  General anaesthetic services will continue to be provided on determination of clinical need.  The HSE has undertaken to commence a national audit on dental general anaesthetic waiting lists for children and for those requiring special care.   <\/p>  <p>  The Dental Treatment Service Scheme (DTSS) provides access to dental treatment for medical card holders over the age of 16.  All medical card holders are entitled to specific dental treatments e.g., an annual dental examination, two fillings in each calendar year, extractions as necessary.  Additional treatments are available to persons with specific medical conditions, such as diabetes, including persons in receipt of care or services for a disability and persons on a register of disability.  In 2010 the HSE introduced measures to cap expenditure on the Scheme at the 2008 expenditure level of &euro;63m.  Since then the budget for the DTSS has been increasing and is &euro;76m this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200053#WRB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Registration of Nurses","counter":66,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200053#WRB01600"},{"type":"question","counter":67,"qnumday":31,"qnumall":"[36565\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200053#WRB01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if his Department will take action to expedite the processing of nurse registration applications; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1096","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":68,"content":"<p>I am pleased to report that progress has been made in relation to the registration delays in the NMBI.

Successful candidates will be recommended for registration to NMBI by RCSI. <\/p>  <p>  On 8 October 2015, a new overseas call centre service was launched by NMBI in response to the significant increase in applications for registration from overseas nurses and midwives.  NHI and other key stakeholders were informed of the new overseas call centre service on 7 October.  The website has been updated to inform the wider audience.  On 16 October 2015, 684 calls were received by this call centre.<\/p>  <p>  With a recovering economy, the Health Service Executive is now in a position to offer full time jobs to nurses and midwives.  There are many initiatives currently underway to improve nursing staff levels throughout the country.  These include offering full time permanent contracts to the 2015 degree programme graduates.  In addition, the conversion of agency usage to permanent staffing in line with agreed processes is a key objective of the National Service Plan 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In July, the HSE launched an International Staff Nurse Recruitment Campaign which focused on the UK to attract Staff Nurses to jobs in Ireland.  In this campaign, there was a particular emphasis on targeting Irish Nurses who have left Ireland in recent years and want to return home.  The HSE is currently in the process of expanding this recruitment initiative outside the UK and Europe in order to fill service vacancies.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200053#WRB02700","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Provision","counter":78,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200053#WRB02800"},{"type":"question","counter":79,"qnumday":35,"qnumall":"[36573\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200053#WRB02900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if there will be an increase in the number of home help hours in County Louth in 2016; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"945","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":80,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

Additionally, the HSE operates the Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS) under the provisions of (EC) Regulation No 883\/2004 on the coordination of social security systems.  The TAS and the CBD are distinct schemes.  The rules that apply under the Directive and the Regulation are not interchangeable.  However, the HSE automatically informs patients of their rights under the Regulation if they have applied under the Directive and vise versa.  <\/p><p>The CBD operates as per the public referral pathways in Ireland and, in line with this, a referral by a GP to a consultant abroad is permissible under the CBD.  In general, the CBD allows a public patient to access care in another EU\/EEA country in either a public or private setting.  The healthcare must be healthcare which is available and funded in the public healthcare system in Ireland.  Applications under the CBD are not subject to independent medical assessment or with a necessity to demonstrate undue delay. Prior approval is not always required.<\/p><p>The measures employed by the HSE ensure Irish patients who seek to have healthcare abroad under the terms of the CBD are assisted with access to the information they need to make an informed choice, and following any episode of healthcare abroad in line with the CBD, they are promptly reimbursed for the cost of the healthcare upon return to Ireland.  I am satisfied that the HSE's CBD application procedures are proportionate and that the prior authorisation process provides patients seeking hospital care which requires overnight accommodation with an assurance on the level of reimbursement they will receive.<\/p><p>All applications to the TAS are subject to prior authorisation and independent medical assessment.  In general, the TAS allows for a public patient in Ireland to be referred, to the public health system of another EU\/EEA country or Switzerland, for a treatment which is not available in Ireland.  Referral for an assessment with a view to a treatment under the TAS may only be made by a treating Irish based consultant, who is in best position to know as to the availability, or otherwise, of the necessary treatment in Ireland.  Any application to the TAS for treatment which is available in Ireland but for which the applicant is claiming undue delay is subject to the referring consultant demonstrating how the individual case meets TAS guidelines on the provisions of the European Court of Justice rulings. <\/p><p>The HSE Treatment Abroad Scheme issues Form E112 (IE) for specific episodes of care which an approved patient receives in a public hospital in the EU, EEA or Switzerland. The payment mechanism for these episodes of care are directly between public health systems by way of EU\/EEA Model Form E125.  These forms\/invoices are received in arrears, often up to 2 years in arrears.  Therefore the figures detailed in the following table are the current costs as known and are liable to change as invoices for previous years are received and paid, and should be read in that context. <table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Approved Applications<\/th><th>Cost<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>640<\/td><td>&euro;7,866,682.10<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>586<\/td><td>&euro;8,286,289.47<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Year to 30 September 2015<\/td><td>486<\/td><td>&euro;7,419,807.00<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Information on the number of refunds issued, under the Cross Border Healthcare Directive, in respect of clinical assessments carried out overseas following Irish GP referral is not gathered in that format.

He has taken this decision in order to ensure that all relevant parts of the health services, including acute, social and primary care, are optimising resources in order to deal with the particular challenges associated with the winter months. <\/p>  <p>  Based on the Task Force's Action Plan, additional funding of &euro;74m was provided in April of this year.  This funding has supported significant progress to date on reducing delayed discharges and lowering the waiting time for Fair Deal funding, as well as providing additional transitional care beds and home care packages to provide viable supports for those no longer needing acute hospital care.  This additional funding came on top of measures already taken in Budget 2015, when the Government provided &euro;25m to support services that provide alternatives to and relieve pressure on acute hospitals.  In relation to bed capacity, further additional funding of &euro;18m was provided in July for a winter initiative to include the provision of approximately 300 additional hospital beds.

In this context, the total number of children and adolescents waiting to be seen continues to fall month on month, with a decrease from 2,542 in July to 2,240 in August.  The numbers waiting less than 3 months have fallen from 1,045 to 781.  There has also been good progress on those waiting over 12 months, which has fallen from 300 in July to 241 (a reduction of 59, this also represents a reduction of 218 on the April figure).  There has been a small decrease in the numbers waiting over 3 months from 1,497 in July to 1,459 in August, while bearing in mind that there has been a continued increase overall in demand for CAMHS services over this year.<\/p>  <p>  The position I have outlined above relates to the national approach on CAMHS.  In relation to measures which the HSE has put in place in Wexford, as this is a service issue this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  If you have not received a reply within 15 working days, please contact my Private Office and they will follow up the matter with them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200054#WRC01800","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health Services Provision","counter":121,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200054#WRC01900"},{"type":"question","counter":122,"qnumday":49,"qnumall":"[36364\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200054#WRC02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the up-to-date position regarding the establishment of an island of Ireland-based deep brain stimulation service from suitability assessment through to and including the insertion procedure and subsequent aftercare; if access to this service at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast will be open to suitable sufferers of Parkinson's disease and dystonia from across all 32 counties; if active consideration is being given to the establishment of other procedures that are not currently available on this island because of the failure to measure viability on the potential throughput of the all-island population; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"969","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":123,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter, I have asked the HSE to respond to you directly.

The number of applications received to 13 October this year is up 139% on the same period in 2014.  I would like to advise the Deputy that, to 13 October, the number of people registered in 2015 was 1,495 and when this is compared to the same period in 2014, the number of people registered is 967 - this represents an increase of 55%.   <\/p>  <p>  The latest figures from the NMBI indicate that they have 1,980 open applications, of which:<\/p>  <p>  - 1,348 have documentation outstanding (61%); <\/p>  <p>  - 81 have been approved and a fee is awaited by the NMBI; and <\/p>  <p>  - 168 further cases are waiting review.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has approved the filling of 16 posts and temporary measures have been put in place to ensure all applications received are dealt with in a timely manner.  NMBI informed the Department on the 24 September that there are currently no backlogs in processing the post.  <\/p>  <p>  Seven adaptation programmes have been held for the nursing home sector since 2014 in order to allow overseas nurses to register in Ireland.  One adaption programme has commenced and a further programme is scheduled later in the year.  I understand that five adaption programmes will be held in 2016.  At 23 September 2015, some 405 places have been made available so far on these courses. <\/p>  <p>  The NMBI has approved on a pilot basis, a new aptitude test with RCSI as an alternative method to assess candidates for registration.  Nurses are currently being advised of the availability of this test and all who have a letter for adaptation are being contacted to advise them of this development.  This test will be provided in November 2015 when a minimum cohort of 25 nurses is secured.  Successful candidates will be recommended for registration to NMBI by RCSI. <\/p>  <p>  On 8 October 2015, a new overseas call centre service was launched by NMBI in response to the significant increase in applications for registration from overseas nurses and midwives.

There are many initiatives currently underway to improve nursing staff levels throughout the country.  These include offering full time permanent contracts to the 2015 degree programme graduates.  In addition, the conversion of agency usage to permanent staffing in line with agreed processes is a key objective of the National Service Plan 2015.<\/p>  <p>  In July, the HSE launched an International Staff Nurse Recruitment Campaign which focused on the UK to attract Staff Nurses to jobs in Ireland.  In this campaign, there was a particular emphasis on targeting Irish Nurses who have left Ireland in recent years and want to return home.

The full year figures for 2014 show that the numbers have almost doubled since 2008.<table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>2007<\/th><th>2008<\/th><th>2009<\/th><th>2010<\/th><th>2011<\/th><th>2012<\/th><th>2013<\/th><th>2014<\/th><th>2015 &ndash; Q1+Q2<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Number of Completed Applications Received<\/td><td>1,137<\/td><td>2,535<\/td><td>2,525<\/td><td>3,100<\/td><td>3,349<\/td><td>3,505<\/td><td>4,261<\/td><td>4,908<\/td><td>3,001<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>During the 18 month period from 1<sup>st<\/sup>January 2014 to 30<sup>th<\/sup>June 2015, 4,473 children deemed to have a disability under the Disability Act, received completed Assessment Reports from the HSE.  A total of 76% of these children (3,395) were assessed as requiring speech and language therapy services.<\/p><p>Each individual that presents to the HSE's Speech and Language Therapy Service has an initial assessment to determine their individual need for therapy.  The therapist in conjunction with the parent(s) or carer will determine the severity of the individual's difficulties and prioritise for therapy accordingly.  The level of intervention is in line with clinical policy, age and severity of the diagnosis.  The waiting period for intervention is dependent on the nature and severity of the disorder following assessment. <\/p><p>The HSE aims to ensure that the resources available are used to best effect, in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children and adults in line with their prioritised needs.  Along with the significant investment in the area of speech and language therapists employed in recent years, a range of new approaches has been developed and used in many Speech and Language Therapy services across the country.  These include providing structures, training and support to parents\/carers so that they can work to help improve the individual's speech and language.  In addition, therapy is delivered in group settings where appropriate. <\/p><p>Therapy services for adults and children are generally delivered through Primary Care Teams or community therapy services; through specialist disability providers or Early Intervention and Children's Teams for 0-18 years, which are continually being developed under <i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18yrs) Programme<\/i>.  Additional funding of &euro;20m was allocated in 2013 to strengthen Primary Care services and to support the recruitment of prioritised front-line posts.  As part of this initiative, the HSE commenced recruitment last year of over 260 additional posts for Primary Care Teams, which included 52 Speech and Language Therapists.  All of these Speech and Language Therapy posts have been filled.  This will help to significantly address waiting times for such services.<\/p><p>The HSE has commenced the reconfiguration of children's disability services into geographically-based early-intervention and school-aged teams as part of the <i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme. <\/i>The objective of the <i>Programme<\/i>is to provide one clear referral pathway for all children (0-18s), irrespective of their disability, where they live or the school they attend.  The transition to this service delivery model is governed by a consultation and engagement process with all stakeholders, including service users and their families, and is being implemented on a phased basis, with full implementation of the model scheduled for the end of 2015.<\/p><p>In 2014, the roll out of the<i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People (0-18s) Programme<\/i>entailed targeted investment of &euro;4m and the provision of 80 additional therapy staff (including 31 Speech and Language Therapists), to increase services for children with all disabilities.<\/p><p>A further &euro;6m allocation was announced in 2015 for the reconfiguration of children's disability services, which will enable us to drive implementation of the <i>Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People Programme<\/i>through 120 new staff appointments to reconfigured multi-disciplinary, geographic-based teams, and through using innovative approaches, involving public, voluntary and private providers, to achieve targeted reduction of waiting lists. <\/p><p>Improving access to therapy services for children in primary care and in disability services is a particular priority for the Government.  Within this context, funding is being provided: in 2016 to expand the provision of Speech and Language Therapy in primary care and to support the reorganisation and expansion of Speech and Language and other therapies under the <i>Progressing Disability Services Programme for Children and Young People<\/i>.  <\/p><p>These measures will have a positive impact on the provision of clinical services for all children requiring access to health related supports.<\/p><p>Currently, total waiting lists across all services for each discipline, e.g. Disability, Older Persons, Primary Care, Mental Health, are gathered monthly by the HSE but not in a format where waiting list figures can be extrapolated for children's disability services specifically.  The HSE Social Care, Disability services has commenced the undertaking of a baseline analysis of individual discipline waiting lists for children's disability therapy services across the country and current practices in relation to how waiting lists are managed.  The objective is to ensure that the Division of Social Care\/HSE has full oversight of the budget\/expenditure on 0-18 disability services, has confidence in its waiting list data, and has access to relevant and reliable data to properly account for resources and on which to base its management decisions in relation to allocation and use of resources taking account of demand and equity of access.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200054#WRC06300","answer":true,"speaker":"982"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Home Help Service Expenditure","counter":166,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200054#WRC06400"},{"type":"question","counter":167,"qnumday":64,"qnumall":"[35555\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200054#WRC06500","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the cost per hour of employing home helps directly by the Health Service Executive; and the cost per hour of home helps provided by private companies","asker":"1102","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":168,"content":"<p>As this is a service matter it has been referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply.

It was estimated that 350 women would apply to the Scheme, but in fact 578 applications have been accepted by the Scheme and as at 9 October 2015, 306 offers have been made.<\/p>  <p>  The Scheme has brought to an end years of uncertainty and costs for women who have undergone surgical symphysiotomy, whose only option prior to its establishment was to take legal action through the courts, with no certainty about the outcome of that action.  The Scheme was designed to be simple, straightforward and non-adversarial and aims to minimise the stress for all women concerned.  The Scheme was designed following meetings with all three support groups, two of which have welcomed its establishment. <\/p>  <p>  In the interest of accountability, the Scheme requires each Applicant to prove that she had a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in order to be considered for the assessment of an award of &euro;50,000.  It is for the Assessor to determine\u00a0whether an Applicant has identified and established any significant disability by objective evidence if the Applicant is seeking a higher award of &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Judge Clark has noted in her most recent progress report, that failure by the applicants' legal representatives to provide a Notice of Discontinuance to the Scheme in a timely manner (in relation to the applicants' previous court proceedings) means that long delays in some cases have occurred between the acceptance of an offer by the woman and the actual payment of the award.  In one recent case, the delay is approaching 7 months.  As this is unfair to Applicants, Judge Clark has indicated that as soon as a Notice of Discontinuance of proceedings in being is served on the Scheme, the payment to the Applicant will be recommended even when agreement on fees due to an assisting Solicitor has not been finalised.   \u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government has given careful and detailed consideration to this complex and sensitive matter.  It believes that the provision of the Scheme, together with the ongoing provision of medical services by the HSE, including medical cards, represents a comprehensive and fair response to this issue, which should help bring resolution for the women, many of whom are elderly, and their families.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200055#WRD03600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Support Services Provision","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200055#WRD03700"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":77,"qnumall":"[36658\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200055#WRD03800","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the support the Health Service Executive has provided to move persons with disabilities out of congregated settings in 2015; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1101","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>The HSE's report &ldquo;<i>Time to Move on from Congregated Settings &ndash; A Strategy for Community Inclusion&rdquo;,<\/i>(2011) proposes a new model of support in the community by moving people from institutional settings to the community, over a seven year time frame.

In addition, potential savings of &euro;125m will be available to reinvest in maintaining and improving health services.

It is essential that we continue to focus on cost containment, productivity and efficiencies as there continues to be major cost pressures on the health service including an increased and ageing population, an increase in chronic conditions, and new and expensive medicines and treatments.<\/p>  <p>  The need for ongoing strengthened accountability and good governance within the HSE remains of critical importance in 2016.  The HSE has an Accountability Framework which makes explicit the responsibilities of all managers to deliver on the performance targets set out in each year's Service Plan.  Where areas of underperformance are identified, the matter is escalated according to an Escalation and Intervention process.  The HSE&rsquo;s 2016 National Service Plan will detail how the Executive intends to develop and build on the Accountability Framework in 2016 to further enhance and strengthen accountability arrangements next year.<\/p>  <p>  New EU fiscal rules limit the amount of Government expenditure in any year.

Annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland (RCPI) and the HSE to individuals at risk of severe influenza disease (those aged 65 and older, those with specified chronic medical conditions requiring regular follow up, pregnancy, morbid obesity), to certain occupational groups (those working with poultry, wild fowl and pigs, health care workers (HCWs) and those likely to transmit influenza to those at high risk of influenza complications).  <\/p>  <p>  Influenza vaccination, which provides protection against at least three strains of influenza each season, remains the most effective measure to prevent illness and death from influenza as up to 40,000 people die prematurely in the EU during an average influenza season.  Protecting those who are at risk of severe outcomes of influenza remains the priority of vaccination programmes, particularly the elderly and those vulnerable due to pre-existing illnesses or risk factors.  Seasonal flu vaccination forms part of the Adult Immunisation Programme. <\/p>  <p>  There are three types of influenza virus - A, B and C.  Influenza A and B cause most influenza cases.  Each winter a different type of influenza virus causes can be the predominant strain affecting the majority of people and the vaccine changes to suit the strain of circulating virus in line with World Health Organisation recommendations.  This year's strains include:<\/p>  <p>  - an A\/California\/7\/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus;<\/p>  <p>  - an A\/Switzerland\/9715293\/2013 (H3N2)-like virus;<\/p>  <p>  - an B\/Phuket\/3073\/2013-like virus.<\/p>  <p>  Last year's flu vaccine was not as effective because the strain of flu that was circulating had changed and was not exactly the same as one of the three strains in the vaccine.  However, the vaccine still reduced severe illness and hospitalisation for those in the at risk groups.  This year's flu vaccine is expected to be 40-90% effective.<\/p>  <p>  The vaccine is available free of charge from GPs for all people in at risk groups, and from pharmacists for people in at risk groups aged 18 and over.  An administration charge may apply to people who do not hold medical cards or GP visit cards.<\/p>  <p>  Achieving a high uptake of influenza vaccination among health care workers (HCWs) is recognised as a vital infection control intervention and occupational health issue, to reduce the risk of influenza transmission between patients and HCWs with the potential for severe disease in patients and staff.  For the 2015 - 2016 influenza season all HCWs should obtain influenza vaccination (unless contraindicated) to protect themselves, their patients, work colleagues and vulnerable family members from influenza.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200056#WRE02100","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Accident and Emergency Departments","counter":252,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200056#WRE02200"},{"type":"question","counter":253,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[36660\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200056#WRE02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he will provide an update on measures to improve the situation in emergency departments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"983","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":254,"content":"<p>ED overcrowding is a key priority issue for the Government.

The company also provides services part-funded under other programmes.  The range of services provided include a social car scheme and transport to access clinic and hospital appointments as well as rural, elderly, disability and wheelchair services to isolated areas of the county.

It is a matter entirely for the contracting agency to ensure that issues of cross-subsidisation are considered in the award of tenders and contracts.  <\/p>  <p>  Overall, it is important to point out that the company operates independently of the Department in the organisation and delivery of its activities.

The Central Bank had briefed industry representatives\u00a0in August\u00a0that it was proposing significant increases in those\u00a0levies in 2015.  The proposed increases were\u00a0driven by a proliferation of legislative regulation and corresponding regulatory activity; a need to meet a shortfall from 2014's levies;\u00a0and an increase in staff pension costs arising from Financial Reporting Standard 17 (which was coupled with\u00a0prevailing low yields on the bond market).<\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank's original proposals have since been revised to partially mitigate those increases as per a statement of 30th September 2015 published on the Central Bank's website.  The revised proposals significantly reduced the increase in pension costs charged to the regulated sector in 2015\u00a0which is instead spread over coming years thereby easing the burden on\u00a0financial services sector firms this year.<\/p>  <p>  It is important to note that a robust regulatory environment benefits the financial services industry by promoting stability, a level playing field and facilitating prudent development and innovation.  A well regulated financial services sector also benefits\u00a0consumers, industry, and the economy at large.  In order to ensure a well regulated financial services sector the\u00a0Central Bank must be sufficiently resourced, particularly in terms of\u00a0staff who are key to an effective regulatory regime.\u00a0Pensions are a standard component in financial regulation costs\u00a0given their link to staff costs.<\/p>  <p>  Under Section 32D of the Central Bank Act 1942, the Central Bank is required to seek my approval for the Regulations prescribing industry levies.

Killorglin, as emphasised in a previous parliamentary question, is a shining example of a strong rural town with a vibrant economy primarily due to a handful of great companies at its core, namely Fexco, Astellas and Temmler.  After five months of extensive stakeholder consultation and engagement, the South West Action Plan for Jobs was launched on Friday 3rd July 2015.  The aim of this Action Plan for Jobs for the South West is to develop the full potential of the region for enterprise and job creation, building upon its assets and areas of competitive advantage.  This translates to having a further 10 to 15 per cent at work in the region by 2020 and to ensure the unemployment rate is within 1% of the State average.  Achieving this goal in the South West will contribute to the overall ambition of creating sustainable full employment in Ireland from 2018 onwards. <\/p><p>Efforts are underway to increase the economic prosperity of rural towns in both Cork and Kerry.  The agri-food sector is particularly strong in the South West as highlighted by the South West Action Plan and the Plan aspires to boost agri-clustering initiatives throughout the region.  A noteworthy example is the Listowel Food Hub Committee which is being supported by Dr. Edmond Harty of Dairymaster.  The idea for the hub arose out of a task force that was set up by Minister for the Diaspora Jimmy Deenihan to boost employment in north Kerry and the hope is that it will become a significant source of employment and the centre of a vibrant, local food industry.<\/p><p>The Action Plan for Jobs for the South West Region seeks to take advantage of particular areas of strength and opportunity for the Region.  The region comprises of:<\/p><p>- a diversified enterprise mix and hosts a range of indigenous and foreign subsidiaries operating on international markets including agri-food and drink, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, precision engineering and in ICT products, services and solutions;<\/p><p>- world renowned heritage, cultural and tourism assets and resources and strong brands of Kerry and Cork as destinations in international markets;<\/p><p>- emerging strengths and potential in areas such as energy, healthcare and smart infrastructure;<\/p><p>- increasing rates of entrepreneurship and startups across the spectrum of sectors;<\/p><p>- productivity levels which are above the State average;<\/p><p>- a unique mix of education and research assets including UCC (in the top 2% of universities worldwide), Tralee and Cork Institutes of Technology and Teagasc at Moorepark, each involved in world class research;<\/p><p>- strong international physical connectivity, with European air services from the State airport at Cork and at Kerry airport, together with nine sea ports; and<\/p><p>- digital connectivity through a new international broadband connectivity being deployed directly from the region to North America.<\/p><p>Following the successful national Action Plan for Jobs model and in order to ensure that the Plan is delivered, a comprehensive implementation structure is currently being finalised.  Deadlines and lead organisations are assigned in the case of each action, an Implementation Committee has being put in place, and Progress Reports and implementation levels will be published every six months.

The reconfiguration of structures concluded that the administrative support in my Department&rsquo;s local office network could be provided from one or two centralised &lsquo;back office&rsquo; locations which would give rise to significant savings.  Throughout this reform process, my Department actively sought redeployment opportunities for administrative staff in location and in the vast majority of redeployment cases we succeeded in making arrangements to maintain staff in situ.  In the case of our Tralee staff, the only redeployment opportunity available arose in the Payroll Shared Services Centre in Killarney and staff were redeployed in line with the terms of the Public Service Agreements.  My Department currently has no vacancies in administrative roles in our Tralee office. <\/p>  <p>  Government Departments and Public Service Organisations in the Tralee area have been advised of the terms of the Labour Relations Commission Understanding; it is a matter for those Departments and Organisations to determine if and when any vacancies should be filled. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is currently evaluating options for the concerned staff who may wish to exit the Civil Service as provided for in the Labour Relations Commission Understanding and intends to revert to the Labour Relations Commission shortly with recommendations.  As the concerned staff are no longer employed in my Department, consultation will have to take place with their current Departments on any possible options. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200060#WRJ04100","answer":true,"speaker":"991"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Equine Passports","counter":437,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200061#WRK00150"},{"type":"question","counter":438,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[36823\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200061#WRK00200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) in County Mayo has not received animal passports back from the Minister's Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1073","askee":"991"},{"type":"speech","counter":439,"content":"<p>An application under the Areas of Natural Constraints Scheme was received from the person named on 26 April 2015.

This judgement in the UK Courts found that the policy of disclosure of <i>all<\/i>criminal convictions under the UK&rsquo;s equivalent legislation was contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention of Human rights. The UK Courts found that there must be some assessment of the relevance and proportionality of offences, in particular old, minor offences.  A review of the provisions of the Vetting Act has been completed and amendments to the Vetting Act and consequential amendments to the Spent Convictions Bill have been drafted. I intend to bring the amendments to the Bill before the Oireachtas in the next month or so, with a view to then commencing the Act as soon as possible. Pending the amendment of the Bill, an Administrative Filter for Garda Vetting Disclosures has been introduced, which provides that certain minor offences that are over 7 years old are no longer disclosed.<b><font color=\"#000080\"> <\/font><\/b>This Administrative Filter already gives effect to the main provisions likely to be contained in the amended Act.<\/p><p>A copy of this Administrative Filter is attached. <\/p><p><b>Garda Vetting Procedures<\/b><\/p><p><b>Administrative Filter<\/b><\/p><p>In anticipation of the amendment and commencement of the National Vetting Bureau Act 2012, an administrative filter in respect of Garda Vetting Unit Disclosures will operate in accordance with the following procedural guidelines. <\/p><p><b>A.

This funding, which is in addition to the direct support provided to all parents in the form of Child Benefit, provided support to more than 100,000 children each year.   <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2016, I announced an &euro;85 million package of additional investment for the childcare sector which will provide for a range of significant enhancements to the childcare support programmes. These include an expansion of the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and increased provision under the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme that supports low income and disadvantaged families.   <\/p>  <p>  The question of tax allowances for parents was considered prior to the introduction of the childcare support programmes.  A number of issues emerged at that time which did not favour the introduction of a childcare tax credit.  For example, the introduction of a tax credit would not help to support quality improvements within the early years sector and would not help those families on low pay who may not have any tax liability. There was also concern at that time that the application of tax credits could lead to increased prices and therefore have limited impact in terms of savings to parents. <\/p>  <p>  Experience in other countries has shown that demand side supports such as subsidies and tax relief can result in increasing cost for parents. This was the case in both Australia and the Netherlands, where childcare costs continued to rise despite the introduction of tax reliefs and\/or subsidies.  The policy trend in most European countries is to provide support through supply side measures such as have been implemented in Ireland over the last number of years. <\/p>  <p>  The Inter-Departmental Group, which I established earlier this year to consider options for future investment in childcare, did examine both supply and demand side measures. The report of the Group, which included an evaluation of the value of the introduction of tax relief measures, outlined concerns that the value of the tax credit would be capitalised into the cost of childcare and that little or no benefit would accrue to the parent.  The Group concluded that investment in supply side measures was strategically optimal in achieving the combined objectives of affordability, accessibility and quality. <\/p>  <p>  The additional investment in the childcare sector which I announced will have a significant impact on the affordability of childcare services with the extended provision under the free pre-school year programme reducing on average parent's annual childcare costs by a further &euro;1,500 approximately.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200066#WRQ01600","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Early Childhood Care Education","counter":628,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200066#WRQ01700"},{"type":"question","counter":629,"qnumday":244,"qnumall":"[37128\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200066#WRQ01800","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the projected cost of the early childhood care and education programme in 2016; and in 2017, following the proposed changes to the programme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"952"},{"type":"question","counter":630,"qnumday":245,"qnumall":"[37129\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200066#WRQ01900","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"the cost of increasing the number of weeks covered by the early childhood care and education programme from 38 weeks to 40 weeks; and to 42 weeks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"993","askee":"952"},{"type":"speech","counter":631,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 244 and 245 together.<\/p>  <p>  The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme currently provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children before commencing primary school.

In terms of the North of Ireland, it is a very different market from the Republic&rsquo;s in that it shares the large UK market for pharmaceuticals. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently three adrenaline auto-injectors authorised and marketed in Ireland. Brands include Anapen&reg;, Epipen&reg; and Jext&reg;. I am aware that at various times one or more of these products has been in short supply. <\/p>  <p>  The Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has been working with the suppliers to try to restore continuity of supply. The HPRA employs a number of procedures which help to reduce the occurrence, impact and length of medicines shortages.  One such mechanism, used in the case of adrenaline auto-injectors, is to facilitate Batch Specific Requests (BSRs). BSRs enable the company to temporarily supply, essentially identical, medicines from other countries to the Irish market to alleviate shortages. BSRs are typically processed within 24 hours of submission by a company to the HPRA. I understand that the HPRA is working with the companies concerned to facilitate the provision of further stock in the coming weeks.<\/p>  <p>  Adrenaline auto-injectors are complex systems due to both the characteristics of the adrenaline active substance, which is chemically unstable, and of the delivery device, which is designed to be as patient friendly as possible. The manufacture of these products is also complex. For these reasons supply shortages can occur from time to time.<\/p>  <p>  The availability is also impacted by the shelf-life of these 3 auto-injector products (which ranges from 18 to 24 months). This is short compared to some other medicinal products.<\/p>  <p>  I can confirm that the HPRA has recently granted a Marketing Authorisation (MA) for a fourth adrenaline auto-injector, Emerade&reg;. This has a 3 year shelf life. It is expected that supplies of Emerade&reg; will arrive onto the Irish market in the coming days. This will help to alleviate the supply problems that patients have been experiencing recently.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200067#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"question","counter":662,"qnumday":256,"qnumall":"[36883\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200067#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if he is aware that a medication manufacturer (details supplied) is currently providing EpiPens free of charge to schools in the United States of America; and if a similar arrangement might be sought for Irish schools","asker":"1066","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":663,"content":"<p>I understand that the initiative the Deputy refers to involving the supply by a medication manufacturer of adrenaline auto-injectors to schools in the United States of America is part of a marketing strategy by that company. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to the Statutory Instrument which I signed on 15 October 2015, making a number of rescue medicines available for use in emergency situations by lay persons, the arrangements that it permits are voluntary.

The Policy is designed to ensure an open, consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong in the provision of healthcare.  It is important that patients and their families are kept informed and that feedback is forthcoming on investigations.  It is also vital that the steps that need to be taken to prevent a recurrence of adverse events are established.  The HSE has now begun implementing the Policy across all health and social care services.  <\/p>  <p>  I intend to bring legislative proposals to Government very shortly which will facilitate open disclosure of adverse events to patients.  The purpose of such legislation is to provide certain legal protections for healthcare providers for open disclosure undertaken in good faith and in compliance with national standards. This will provide further support to healthcare providers in their communications with patients and family members if an adverse event occurs.  This will help to foster a culture of openness and transparency, which encourages reporting.  The Ethical Code of Practice set out by the Medical Council also makes clear the responsibilities of doctors in relation to open disclosure. <\/p>  <p>  A new National Incident Management System (NIMS) was introduced by the State Claims Agency (SCA) in 2014 and since June 2015 all incidents in the healthcare sector are now being reported directly on to NIMS.  It facilitates more detailed and consistent reporting of incidents.  The SCA and the HSE are continuing to work towards more comprehensive and consistent reporting.  The NIMS is the national recording management system to be utilised by all facilities covered by the Clinical Indemnity Scheme to capture adverse events that occur throughout the public healthcare system.  As part of this reporting process data is collected on whether the incident was the subject of open disclosure.  It will, therefore, be possible to monitor compliance with the HSE's Open Disclosure policy by using the NIMS database and non-compliance issues can be addressed by the HSE.  <\/p>  <p>  From a patient safety perspective the key focus of open disclosure is on learning so that systems and processes can be improved in order to reduce potential future harms to patients.  If a person is not satisfied that a health professional or administrator has fulfilled their obligations regarding open disclosure then that person has recourse to the HSE's complaints procedures.  It is also open to a person to raise a complaint with the appropriate professional regulatory body or with the Ombudsman.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200067#WRR01600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Vaccination Programme","counter":672,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200067#WRR01650"},{"type":"question","counter":673,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[36902\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200067#WRR01700","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"given the seriousness of some of the adverse reactions to Gardasil, reported to his Department and to the Health Product Regulatory Authority, and given that these adverse reactions are chronic and enduring, the systems he will put in place to monitor and support those experiencing such adverse reactions on an ongoing basis.

The vaccine is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in 1st year of secondary school.  This is in accordance with the recommendation received from the NIAC which indicated that the HPV vaccine should be offered on an annual basis to all girls aged 12. The advice, based on public health considerations and supported by the cost-effectiveness analysis, is that HPV vaccines confer maximum benefit both individually and on a population basis if administered prior to HPV exposure. The vaccine protects against two high risk types of HPV (16 &amp;amp; 18) that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. Vaccinated women and girls will still be at risk from other high risk types of HPV that can cause cervical cancer and will therefore need to continue to have regular cervical smear tests.<\/p><p>In Ireland, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) is the regulatory authority for medicines in Ireland.  There are 2 licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland (Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>).  Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>is the vaccine used by the HSE in the School Immunisation Programme.  Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>is a medicinal product which has been authorised for use across the European Union since September 2006 following a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) at the European Medicines Agency (EMA).<\/p><p>While no medicine (including vaccines) is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised both nationally and at EU level.  This is done by both monitoring of individual adverse reaction reports received by competent authorities across Europe (including the HPRA) and Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) submitted by the Marketing Authorisation Holder (i.e. license holder) for the vaccine on a regular basis.<\/p><p>As part of its monitoring of the safety of medicines, the HPRA operates an adverse reaction reporting system, where healthcare professionals and patients are encouraged to report adverse reactions they consider may be associated with their treatment, through the range of options in place for reporting (). All reports received are evaluated and considered in the context of the safety profile of the product concerned, with reports followed up as necessary for further information, that may assist in the assessment of the case.<\/p><p>As of the 9 October 2015, the Health Products Regulatory Authority (HPRA) has received 921 reports of suspected adverse reactions\/events notified in association with the use of HPV vaccines (Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>918 and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>3). The vast majority of reports received by the HPRA regarding both Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix vaccines to date have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccines, as described in the product information.<\/p><p>The EMA has commenced a review of the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine &quot;<i>to further clarify aspects of their safety profile<\/i>,&quot; although the agency points out that this review &quot;<i>does not question that the benefits of HPV vaccines outweigh their risks&quot;<\/i>.<\/p><p>The HPRA is participating in the Pharmacovigilance and Risk Assessment Committee's (PRAC) review of HPV vaccines to clarify aspects of their safety profile.  As for all licensed medicines, the safety of these vaccines is monitored by the PRAC (an EU level drug safety committee) where the HPRA is actively represented and contributes.<\/p><p>The current review will look at available data with a focus on rare reports of two conditions: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS, a chronic pain condition affecting the limbs) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS, a condition where the heart rate increases abnormally after sitting or standing up, causing symptoms such as dizziness and fainting, as well as headache, chest pain and weakness).  Reports of these conditions in young women who have received a HPV vaccine have been previously considered during routine safety monitoring by the PRAC but a causal link between them and the vaccines was not established.  Both conditions can occur in non-vaccinated individuals and it is considered important to further review if the number of cases reported with HPV vaccine is greater than would be expected. The outcome of the PRAC review is anticipated before the end of this year.<\/p><p>In addition the EMA is currently evaluating data from a on the safety of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines, Gardasil<sup>&reg;<\/sup>and Cervarix<sup>&reg;<\/sup>.

The main objectives of this framework will be the recruitment and retention of the right mix of staff, provision of career and professional development and the creation of supportive and healthy workplaces.  A Cross-Sectoral Working Group is in the process of being established and will begin its work early next year.

Phase I of its work has focused on the development of a Framework for safe nurse staffing and skill mix in general and specialist adult medical and surgical care settings in acute hospitals.  The primary focus of the Framework is patient safety, by ensuring safe nurse staffing and skill mix levels.

In accordance with the Act, the assessment for a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants.  Where deemed appropriate in particular circumstances, the HSE may exercise discretion and grant a medical card even though an applicant exceeds the income guidelines but where they who face difficult financial circumstances, such as extra costs arising from an illness.<\/p>  <p>  It is clear that there are people with medical needs and it is important that they should be able to access necessary assistance in a straight forward manner.  Greater discretion is being exercised by the HSE because the number of discretionary medical cards in circulation has increased from about 52,000 in mid-2014 to over 94,000 at the beginning of October  this year.  This followed the measures announced by Minister Varadkar and I last year, when the \"Keane\" Report of the Expert Panel on Medical Need for Medical Card Eligibility was published.  The Deputy may be aware that a key recommendation of that report was that a person&rsquo;s means should remain the main qualifier for a medical card.<\/p>  <p>  Every effort is made by the HSE, within the framework of the legislation, to support applicants in applying for a medical card and, in particular, to take full account of the difficult circumstances in the case of applicants who may be in excess of the income guidelines.

Community rating is a fundamental cornerstone of the Irish health insurance system. Under community rating, the level of risk that a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid. This means that people who are old or sick do not have to pay more for the same insurance plan than the young and healthy.<\/p>  <p>  Community rating requires a constant influx of younger people taking out health insurance to help keep premium prices down for everybody. Lifetime community rating, which came into operation on 1 May 2015, modifies community rating so that the premium that\u00a0individuals pay for health insurance increases with the age at which they enter the\u00a0health insurance market.  Late entry loadings now apply for people aged 35 and over when taking out health insurance for the first time. Lifetime community rating encourages people to take out health insurance at a younger age, thereby helping to spread the costs of older and less healthy people across all insured persons. Without this measure, there would be a continued deterioration in the age profile of the insured population. The number of people now holding private health insurance is 2.118 million, or 46% of the Irish population (end June 2015). This is an increase of over 93,000 since the start of this year and the number has now risen for four quarters in a row. This increase is extremely welcome, as it helps to control premium inflation and to keep health insurance affordable for all who wish to avail of it.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, a robust Risk Equalisation Scheme is also in place to support community rating by equalising risk across the market. All insurers receive payments from the Risk Equalisation Fund in respect of their older and less healthy customers, and this is funded by stamp duties levied on all policies written.  This support to community rating ensures persons continue to pay the same net amount for a given health insurance product, keeping health insurance affordable for older and less healthy members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200070#WRU02600","answer":true,"speaker":"948"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Prescription Charges","counter":791,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200071#WRV00150"},{"type":"question","counter":792,"qnumday":304,"qnumall":"[37140\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200071#WRV00200","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the extent to which prescription costs have fallen or have stabilised; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"957","askee":"948"},{"type":"speech","counter":793,"content":"<p>Between 2009 and 2014, the HSE's expenditure on reimbursed medicines remained stable at under &euro;2 billion. <\/p>  <p>  Aggregate spending on the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme, the Drugs Payment Scheme (DPS) and the Long Term Illness (LTI) Scheme has reduced since 2009, despite an increase in numbers eligible for the schemes and the introduction of more expensive new medicines.

These talks resumed in round table format on 21 September and are continuing in a constructive atmosphere.  I believe that there remains a willingness on all sides to solve the issues around the implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and dealing with the legacy and impact of paramilitarism.<\/p>  <p>  In an effort to facilitate inclusive talks, the Secretary of State announced a British Government assessment of the current profile of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland.  That assessment, published earlier this week, makes for sobering reading.  While acknowledging that these paramilitary organisations no longer represent a terrorist threat, it nonetheless presents a complex and challenging profile of unacceptable residual activities by various groups in Northern Ireland which are damaging to communities and which must be addressed.  It underscores the critical importance of the political Talks process currently underway in Northern Ireland and I hope that a shared determination to address the legacy of paramilitarism will result in increased momentum in the negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  Of equal importance in the talks is the need to fully implement the Stormont House Agreement.  This agreement, concluded in December 2014, offers a blueprint for overcoming current difficulties in the Executive, especially around financing, welfare reform and dealing with the legacy of the past.  While financing and welfare reform is primarily an issue for the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, I have continually encouraged the parties to resolve their difference for the sake of Northern Ireland&rsquo;s economic stability and the sustainability of public services.<\/p>  <p>  It is also crucial that the work started by the Stormont House Agreement on establishing institutions to deal with the legacy of the past is completed so that justice and truth can bring what healing is possible to victims and survivors of the troubles and their families.

We work constantly in support of its full implementation and look to the parties in the Executive to do the same, especially in those areas where responsibility is fully devolved.<\/p>  <p>  In the immediate term, it is essential that all of the five main parties in Northern Ireland, with the support of the two Governments, urgently advance the full implementation of the Stormont House Agreement and address the impact and legacy of continuing paramilitary activity.  I remain hopeful that, with committed collective engagement, we can make real progress on both of these critical issues.

This monitoring is undertaken by a combination of specialist staff, Embassy-based internal auditors, independent experts, and the Evaluation and Audit Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  That Unit&rsquo;s work is regularly reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of my Department.  In addition, the Comptroller and Auditor General provides independent assurance that Official Development Assistance is being provided in accordance with the law, is managed to good effect, and is properly accounted for.

I am delighted that Ireland became the first country in the world to introduce same sex marriage through a national referendum in May 2015 and I urge other States to follow suit and to promote the rights for LGBTI citizens.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland has been active in progressing the rights of LGBTI persons at the UN Human Rights Council (HRC).  Ireland identified the advancement of rights for LGBTI persons as a priority for the term of our HRC membership from 2013 to 2015.  During these three years we have consistently highlighted discrimination against LGBTI persons and worked with other countries to ensure that this issue is now firmly embedded in the work of the HRC.

Ireland has made recommendations in respect of 20 countries specifically on questions relating to sexual orientation and gender identity. <\/p>  <p>  During the Irish Presidency of the EU in 2013, Ireland facilitated and made substantial input into the EU Guidelines on LGBTI issues which were adopted at the meeting of Foreign Affairs Ministers (Foreign Affairs Council) on 24 June 2013.

The SDGs are universally applicable and will guide the actions of all countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and hunger and achieve sustainable development over the next fifteen years.<\/p>  <p>  The Summit was a proud moment for Ireland given the role we were asked to play in facilitating the intergovernmental negotiations that achieved agreement among all 193 Member States.  This agreement, &lsquo;Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development&rsquo;, is aimed at transforming the global approach to development. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland had already played a key role in framing the parameters of the new agenda at both EU and UN levels.  This included brokering EU Council Conclusions during the 2013 Irish EU Presidency and securing agreement at the UN on a road map for the post-2015 negotiations at a Special Event on the Millennium Development Goals in September 2013.<\/p>  <p>  The universal nature of the SDGs will require all countries to take action.  In common with our EU partners, we will now focus on developing the most appropriate institutional framework to deliver the new development agenda domestically and internationally.<\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;One World, One Future&rdquo;, our policy for international development, sets out priorities which are very much in line with the new sustainable development agenda.  It  clearly articulates the Government&rsquo;s commitment to the UN target of providing 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) for Official Development Assistance (ODA).  In his address to the UN Summit, the Taoiseach reiterated our commitment to making progress towards the 0.7% target.  <\/p>  <p>  Our track record in support of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme speaks for itself.  Over the past four years, we have protected and stabilised budget allocations, at a time of extraordinary economic difficulty. We stated consistently that we would make progress towards the 0.7% target once economic conditions allow.  As our economic recovery gains momentum and becomes more widely established, we can now begin delivering on that commitment.  <\/p>  <p>  The Budget for 2016, announced on 14 October, involves the first substantial increase in the aid budget in seven years.  For next year, we have provided a total of over &euro;640 million in ODA, an increase of &euro;40 million, or almost 7% on the 2015 level.  We estimate that this will entail a small increase in our ODA\/GNP percentage, from a projected 0.35% in 2015 to a projected 0.36% in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The major challenge for the year ahead will be to ensure Ireland continues to play a leading role in the comprehensive response to the unprecedented levels of humanitarian crisis, especially in Europe&rsquo;s broader neighbourhood, while ensuring that our aid programme remains effective in addressing the root causes of poverty and hunger in the poorest countries as we work towards the objective of ending extreme poverty and hunger by 2030.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200072#WRW01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1055"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Education and Skills","counter":847,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200072#WRW01100"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Bullying in Schools","counter":846,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200072#WRW01050"},{"type":"question","counter":847,"qnumday":326,"qnumall":"[36855\/15]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2015102200072#WRW01100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will address a matter (details supplied) regarding bullying in primary schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1017","askee":"1061"},{"type":"speech","counter":848,"content":"<p>Responsibility for tackling bullying in schools falls to the level of the individual school.<\/p><p>  New Anti-Bullying Procedures for Primary and Post-Primary Schools were published in September 2013.
