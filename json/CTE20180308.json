I would like to highlight two issues with which I am not happy.  First, when we were discussing issues relating to the Garda College, a document was sent to the then Garda Commissioner by the head of legal affairs, Mr. Ken Ruane, in July 2017.  I understand it was a letter rather than a legal document but, nevertheless, the then Garda Commissioner claimed legal privilege.  When the current acting Commissioner, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in came before the committee, I asked him whether he would release the document because the commissioner is no longer in place and one cannot claim privilege when one is no longer the Garda Commissioner.  I asked for that document to be released.  It is now four or five months later and we have received a two-line reply stating that the committee was previously advised in respect of the claim of legal privilege regarding the legal advice provided to the former Commissioner.  The position remains unchanged.  That is a joke.  Frankly, it is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable as a reply.  It does not look as if the request was considered.  It looks as if they were ticking a box to say that they came back to us - only because they were chased.  On the substantive matter, the acting Commissioner has not explained why he will not release a document which was given to the previous Commissioner, who claimed privilege in the role as commissioner but who is no longer in place.  How can Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, as acting Commissioner, claim privilege in respect of a document that was sent to the previous Commissioner, who is no longer in place?  Even if he has some argument as to how he can do this, he needs to explain it to the committee.  This two-line letter is an insult to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It speaks volumes about what the acting Garda Commissioner thinks of the committee.  We need to respond, asking that the Garda authorities write back within a week and give a full explanation as regards that document.  We should also indicate that the document be released.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will call Deputies Cullinane and Catherine Murphy in that order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a second issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Does it relate to this batch of correspondence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B00550","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I have three issues and I propose to deal with them all, rather than coming in separately on each.  I understand the point Deputy Kelly is making on the legal advice given to the then Commissioner.  Can the Committee of Public Accounts get legal advice on whether privilege still exists when the then Commissioner is no longer in office?  I presume that the legal adviser to the acting Garda Commissioner is the same person as previously, namely, Mr. Ruane.  I question whether the latter is still bound by confidentiality.  To be fair to everybody involved, we need certainty regarding what is the actual position.<\/p> <p>  My second point is that we did a great deal of work on this issue.  In fact, we published our own report on the matters relating to the Garda College in Templemore.  If one reverts to the internal audit report, the headline issue - leaving aside the salacious stuff and the madness when had the heads of different departments, who almost collapsed before us - there was recommendations made by the head of internal audit and changes were to be made.

I refer to the fact that efforts are being made by other politicians to undermine the work of the committee.  We see it both inside and outside the D&aacute;il Chamber.  It happened in respect of this issue as well.  There was correspondence from some Government Deputies criticising members of the Committee of Public Accounts for defending the work of the committee.  We must defend the integrity of the committee and not allow people to make what are political charges.  They are entitled to do so but those charges should not go unchallenged.  We have an absolute right and entitlement to raise issues, especially those we raised in the context of Templemore.  The issues in question arose on foot of an internal audit report; we did not invent them.  The internal auditor said that he could not give any assurances whatsoever that the controls in place at the Garda College in Templemore are what they should be.  He said he was frustrated in his work.  We saw what happened.

It will arise in other scenarios.  It is general advice regarding privilege but I suspect that the Garda authorities and the acting Commissioner have a right to tell us what we do not want to hear.  It would be useful to receive guidance.  However, I would hazard a guess that such guidance would indicate that the Garda has a right to claim privilege.<\/p> <p>  When we are tracking the issues that are outstanding, we should ensure - before we come back to do the work - that they are substantially complete in order that we might have a more meaningful engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B01300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>A final question from Deputy Kelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B01400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>We asked for a copy of the risk register in respect of the Garda College.

In that context, I am going to ask the secretariat to prepare a briefing note for us that we can approve and then issue.  I can think of a few issues on which this committee has been roundly criticised in the past but was upon which it proved to be absolutely correct.  During the term of the last Committee of Public Accounts, Maurice McCabe arrived in here with boxes of speeding fines that had been cancelled, adding up to &euro;5 million.  That was one of the ingredients that led to where we are now.  The committee was attacked right, left and centre for dealing with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issue but a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General found that the committee was totally within its rights to do that.  We also dealt with the so-called Grace case in the south east and were attacked right, left and centre and told it had nothing to do with this committee.  Our work on that case has contributed to the establishment of a commission of inquiry.  We dealt with the issue of Project Eagle and NAMA.  A vague commitment had been made to establish a tribunal or commission of investigation but that had gone off the boil.  Our committee's report brought the issue back to the boil and that has now happened.  In terms of the Templemore issue, were it not for the work of this committee all that has unfolded would not be in the public domain but we were criticised heavily for doing that.  It is important that the committee secretariat would put together a briefing note for us in order that members would have such available to them and be able to say that despite the constant criticism, this committee is dealing successfully with very serious issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#C01400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I totally agree with that.

We have to ask questions without fear or favour and if we are not in a position to do that, we cannot do our job.  We need to collectively protect ourselves.

He has basically said what I wanted to express.  Effectively in my own constituency, three Deputies are attacking me politically.  Now, I am a big boy and I can take it.  That is not the issue.  They are attacking me because through the process by which this committee works, in conjunction with the Comptroller and Auditor General, issues relating to the Garda College in Templemore have come through the pipeline and have been dealt with in here.  Deputies are attacking this committee and by extension, me as a member of this committee.  I have no issue with that and will take them all on, collectively or individually.  The main issue for me is that they are undermining this committee and are creating a dangerous precedent whereby people who are members of this committee are to be picked on or almost victimised because of their work as members of this committee, which they are bound to do.  We all leave our politics outside the door of the committee room, or at least that is what we should do, and we do our job to the best of our ability based on what comes through to us.  There is a dangerous precedent being set because members of this committee will not be able to do their work, including Deputies Cullinane, Catherine Murphy and myself.  The attacks are also inappropriate.  In fairness to the Chairman, he has a good track record in defending this committee.  When we were attacked in the D&aacute;il, the Chairman stood up and defended the committee on behalf of all its members.  As Deputy Cullinane has said, we need to identify a way in which we can defend this committee and robustly argue against criticism made of it.  At the political level, we can all do our individual thing and that is fine.  However, we need a process or a way in which that defensive work can be done, possibly through the Chairman.  Dare I say it but some individuals in the Houses of the Oireachtas may need to be educated about the way in which information comes to the Committee of Public Accounts and the way in which it goes about its work.  They are either deliberately misunderstanding or they genuinely do not understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#C02000","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>There is a break coming up between now and the Easter period during which I will ask the secretariat to work on this because it is important.

We need to demonstrate what the Committee of Public Accounts has achieved, in spite of what those who want to knock us might say.  We will certainly come back to that matter.<\/p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1114B from Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, enclosing information requested by the committee on salary overpayments in respect of the HSE for 2016 and 2017.  The figure in question is approximately &euro;2.5 million.  We will note that.  The next item is No. 1116B<b><\/b>from Mr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, dated 20 February 2018 with further information on the quality capacity building initiative, QCBI, as requested by the committee at our meeting on 8 February 2018.  We will note and publish that.  Correspondence item No. 1118B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding public bodies within the remit of the National Shared Services Office, NSSO, and a briefing note on the feasibility and scoping study that was carried out to determine which Departments and bodies transferred to the NSSO.  We will note and publish that.  The next item is No. 1120B from Mr. Kieran Harrington, Department of Health, dated 22 February 2018 enclosing follow-up information requested by this committee in respect of the Dormant Account Fund and community based models to support people with dementia.  We will note and publish that.  A number of issues are arising regarding the Dormant Account Fund and as a committee, we found that engagement most unsatisfactory.  It was all over the place and nobody seemed to have a handle on it.  We will come back to that issue as part of our periodic report.  It was a glaring problem.  That is all I can say at the moment about the way that account has been administered in recent times.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 1121B from Ms Marie Ryan of the Courts Service, dated 22 February 2018, with an information note on the court poor box.  I want to highlight this because an individual wrote to me about it.  The note we received about the court poor box is very interesting.  The Courts Service has provided figures from 2013 to 2017 showing that the poor box received &euro;8.917 million in the period, with payments from the poor box amounting to &euro;8.734 million.  The poor box is running at close to &euro;2 million per annum and is now fully maintained by the Courts Service through its own accounting system.<\/p><p>All of those payments are centralised, recorded and verifiable.  The heads of the criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill are under consideration.  That proposed legislation would replace the Probation of Offenders Act, which deals with this.  It will come up in due course.<\/p><p> The most interesting part of the correspondence, however, is the comment that there are three categories of payments made to the court poor box.  The figures mentioned relate to category A payments, in respect of which the correspondence states, \"Such payments are accounted for in the Court office and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by both the C &amp;amp; AG and Internal Audit.\"  The correspondent goes on to say there are category B payments, made directly to a named charity by producing a receipt in court.  She states, \"These payments are not included in the annual Poor Box receipt figures.\"  It appears that, on some occasions, the judge can say some money should be put into the court poor box while, on others, he can ask that &euro;200 be given to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, for example.  The person has to come back with a receipt from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul the next month showing that the payment has been made.  It does not go through the system.  Therefore, we do not know what is going through that system.  There are also category C payments, referred to as payments made via the Probation and Welfare Service to the Garda on order of the court.  It is stated, \"These payments are not accounted for in the Court Office and are not included in annual Poor Box receipt figures.\"  Therefore, there are two categories of payments not going through the accounting system.  We should write to the Courts Service in this regard.  It is in its interest and in the interest of the administration of justice that the service get a handle on this.  One category of payments goes through the poor box and two other categories do not do so at all.  I am surprised by that.  I thank the correspondent for the information and for making it public.  It answers questions people have on payments through the poor box that do not seem to be able to be traced anywhere.  At least we are now hearing some of the reasons why this is happening.  It is not the way it should be; that is all I can say.  I do not want to trespass into the area of the authority of judges.  Judges issue the fines and request that amounts be paid, but they should be accounted for by the Courts Service somewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#C02300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Do the payments in category C, via the Probation Welfare Service or to the Garda by order, show up in the accounts of the Garda or the Probation and Welfare Service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#D00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I am not aware of it but, obviously, if they were receiving funds in any form, they should be accounted for through the accounting systems.

Between 2014 and 2017 there was expenditure of &euro;571,803 on that.  I will ask Deputy Kelly to advise us if that is going ahead.

My understanding of this is that the merger process was in place without being underpinned by legislation.  The legislation was on hold for a long time; it was pretty much suspended because there were political differences.  There is now a change in the sequencing where initially the institutes had to formally merge and then had to reach and meet criteria.  There were benchmarks around having a set number of graduates and so on.  Then there was an international panel of experts who would come in and adjudicate on the application and so on.  My understanding is that the legislation is going to change to allow the merger part of it to come in at the end of the process.  Much of the legal and consultancy advice was around some of that process.  It is glaringly obvious and jumps out from the page that if the process involved the proposed mergers is the same, how can it be logical for those engaged in the proposed Munster merger to have spent more than &euro;570,000 and for those involved in the other proposed mergers who are engaged in exactly the same process to have spent-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#E01900","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":93,"content":"<p>There were further advances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#E02000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>They had further advances to spend &euro;4,000 in one case.

Obviously this is a vast sum of money.  That is one thing, and UCC can make its own decisions about it, and it is not what I am questioning.  At committee meetings we have had numerous discussions on what is taxpayer funding and what is not.  There was a lot of discussion and argument relating to the institutions' own funding, and they stated they could use their own funding in whatever way they pleased.  However, the fact of the matter in many cases we saw was their own funding was put into a pot with taxpayers' funding and then utilised, and in many various scenarios we had to try to decipher whether this was value for money for the taxpayer.  Here we have a situation where UCC is spending this amount of money and is stating it is from non-taxpayer funded revenue.  I would ask the following question.  If UCC did not get taxpayers' funding in the first place would it be in a position to go out and get non-taxpayer revenue to be able to do this?  The manner in which UCC has explained this smacks of nothing being learned from our report of a few months back and the ongoing analysis on some colleges and universities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#F00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>We will write directly to UCC about the agreement and the secretariat has a note of the query.

It is wise for sectoral committees to observe the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  If these committees feel that we are encroaching on their work in any way, they have an absolute entitlement to inform us about that and write to us so I have no difficulty with that whatsoever.  We have consistently said that we do not want to duplicate the work of any other committee.  There is a difference between the sectoral committees do and what the Committee of Public Accounts does - even in terms of who appears before the different committees.  Ministers and Ministers of State appear before sectoral committees and can deal with issues of policy and so on.  We do not do that.  We deal with a look-back exercise, value for money and accountability.  This issue arose when the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment was here.  Almost 40% of the entire budget of the Department, which I think was &euro;170 million, was transferred to RT&Eacute;.  The Secretary General was not in a position to answer questions in the same way he was answering questions about the rest of the spend because it was a matter for RT&Eacute;.  I have very serious questions to ask about allegations of bogus self-employment and contracting of staff, which are genuine issues.  There is a potential cost to the State in terms of revenue as well so they are genuine issues that need to be addressed.<\/p><p>Another issue, which was probed by the Chairman, concerned whether or not a proper service-level agreement is in place between the Department and RT&Eacute;.  At no point would we want to duplicate the work of the sectoral committee nor would we want to interfere with the independence of the national broadcaster and ask questions about its decisions in terms of programmes.  It was never about that and we have said so <i>ad nauseam<\/i>.  There are specific issues we want to ask about and we have a responsibility and an entitlement to probe and ask questions about the spend of &euro;170 million of taxpayers' money even if RT&Eacute; is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is a lot of money so we have a responsibility.

The Committee of Public Accounts has an absolute obligation to see if that was the case because all political parties are funded by the taxpayer and are given funding to use for purposes such as advertising and so on.  They can spend money in many different ways but they must account for same.

Is the process working in terms of the rationale behind setting up the unit in the first place?  Was the money spent for those purposes?  Was the money spent for other purposes?

I agree fully that there is a value for money issue, but we should be very careful in talking at this committee about the misuse of money for political purposes.  This is an extremely important committee.  We are here every Thursday with numerous reports before us that we read, reflect on and question in terms of value for money and holding institutions to account.  It is extremely important that we hold them to account.  I agree that there is a serious value for money issue when it comes to the strategic communications unit and would like to tease out a little more with the Chairman and the Comptroller and Auditor General how best to proceed to ask questions about the unit which have been raised by many of us in different fora.  When I raised the issue, I was told the purpose was to save money.  That brings the role of the Committee of Public Accounts into it.  How did it save money?  As my colleague said, what business case was made and who made it?  Has it worked?  That is an issue for us.  To do it we should have immediate access to the business case made.  It should be forwarded to us with all relevant documents.  I agree with what has been said, but I would like to tease out what the precedent is.  We are looking at something without a report before us which is a new departure for us, although I am sure it has happened before.  Let us tease out these issues first and stick with the issue of value for money and to the best way to bring the matter before us before we say who we would bring in.  I have no difficulty in looking at that issue, but at this point we should tease out the issues involved and establish what we want to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#J00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>There is nothing more important than the independence of the media in doing its job.  In the past two weeks I have heard that they are under extreme financial pressure and have effectively been coerced into allowing this to run because of the financial strain they are under.  There is nothing more important than we have entered a sphere in which the State can buy the news.  We are not living in some Russian creation; this is not Trump-land but a republic.  In a democracy the independence of the media to present the news and people to disseminate are fundamental.  People have become obsessed with side shows, which is unfortunate, about whether Fine Gael members were in pictures, but it goes far deeper than that.  <\/p><p>The people running the campaign were extremely astute about what they wanted to achieve and I will tell the committee why.  They dealt with the design of the page, which is the most important point, newspaper by newspaper, including the fonts used in headlines.  One should not forget that it did not run as an advertorial, which is bad enough, but I will tell the committee how specific it was.  The headline and subhead fonts and text style were the same as on every other page in each newspaper.  The first thing one learns in journalism school is that every single newspaper uses a particular font which is unique to it.  Newspapers are precise in how their readers react to them.  If a newspaper engages in a redesign, it will be at pains to explain to its readers why it has changed the font.  When <i>The Irish Times<\/i>did it a number of years ago, it was at pains to explain that it engaged in the redesign to make it easier on the eye.  These guys were so specific that in every single newspaper the same headline font, subhead font and colours as on the other pages were used.  That takes some work.  The newspapers concerned have been caught out and they know it.  <\/p><p>The NUJ has commented on the issue because it is worried that if its members and the owners of newspapers allow it to happen, we have entered a dangerous sphere.  My local newspaper which is as guilty as all of the rest this week ran a full page viewpoint by Paul Murphy who is one of the most respected local journalists in the country and editor of the <i>Drogheda Independent<\/i>group for many years.  He was my first boss when I worked with that newspaper.  He said readers of the <i>Meath Chronicle<\/i>last week had come across details of the plan spread across the pages but that the words &quot;advertising content&quot; or &quot;advertorial&quot; did not appear anywhere in the copy.  An unsuspecting reader would have assumed it was part of the newspaper's normal news coverage.  He said it had been a mistake to present the copy in this way and expected it not to happen again.  <\/p><p>A number of experts in various fields had been asked to supply quotes about the national development plan, but they had not been told that their views would be part of advertorials paid for by the State.  Even the most brazen PR stunt man or woman would not pull that one and hope to get away with it.  It looks and is grubby in the extreme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#J00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I call Deputy David Cullinane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#J00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Chairman-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#J00500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I am sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#J00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>My point is there is no question that is more fundamental than if people can use public money to try to present spin as news and if the State is buying the news.

Newspapers know it.  This is clearly a misuse of public money and one does not need to set up a commission or a committee to investigate it.  Anything that fails to be presented as an advertorial and if public money is spent in doing so is a clear misuse of public money and the question demands to be answered.

On the face of it, it seems as if the unit pulled off a very slick, almost sly operation and our job is to test it.  Allegations and political charges are being made.  It is for the D&aacute;il Chamber to deal with the matter.  What we have to do as a committee is to evaluate whether there is any truth in the allegations that have been made.  I have my concerns as we can see it with our own eyes.  Teachta Shane Cassells was right in everything he said and I agree with all of it.  We will I hope have people before us.  We have to provide them with an opportunity to prove to us that the charges made are not true.  That is our role.<\/p> <p>  Teachta Catherine Connolly's point was that we needed to have a good sense of what we wanted to achieve before we invited people.  That is obvious, as Teachta Shane Cassells and others said.  It is obvious what we want to achieve and what the questions are and we should not delay or postpone making a decision.  I have already proposed one which I will reiterate.  I formally propose that we invite the individuals named and others.  The first session should include the key individuals - the Taoiseach, the Secretary General, Mr. Fraser, and Mr. Concannon, the head of the unit.  They are the three key individuals.  Others are also important.  The Taoiseach and others have been making the point that there are bigger issues.  There are, but there is a fundamental issue with how political parties are funded.<\/p><p>If any political party is gaining an advantage over others, that is not right.  There are also issues about how taxpayers' money is spent and there are now blurred lines between the communication of Government and public and Civil Service and how that has become political and party political.  They are fundamental questions.  The issue of value for money is then wrapped up in that and, as others have asked, whether we have achieved the savings we were promised.  The Committee of Public Accounts has a clear role in that.  That is our starting point and should be the avenue for those coming before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#J00800","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I am rarely accused of not being clear.

I expect the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment will look at this, as will the Department of Expenditure and Public Reform, and it has already been raised in the D&aacute;il.

When we come to the meeting and we have Accounting Officers before us, he will prepare a note then but we must get our end of it out of the way first before we involve the independent office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Members will understand why I am not calling him on this.  There are issues of value for money, process, savings and staffing.  What falls under this committee's remit is clear, namely the Accounting Officer in the Department of An Taoiseach, the Accounting Officer of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and perhaps other senior people.  They are currently under the committee's remit and are obliged to appear before it as requested.<\/p> <p>  I am not averse to inviting the Taoiseach before the committee but, as Deputy Cullinane said in relation to RT&Eacute;, it is important that we do not trespass on another committee.  I want to explain what committee the Taoiseach is appearing before.  He is going before the specific select committee, not the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach where they discuss policy issues.  It is a select committee of Deputies, no Senators are involved, and it will deal only with the Estimates for expenditure.  The purpose of that meeting is to deal with the Estimate of expenditure.  The Taoiseach is committed to going before that committee, as he does every year, as every other Minister goes before their relevant select committee, to get approval for his Department for the current year.  He will be before that committee on 29 March, I think, when he has returned from the United States.  The date has been set already.  Undoubtedly, the unit will be discussed at that meeting, because he is going before it to seek approval for expenditure in his Department, which includes the strategic communications unit and all other matters in that Department.  I am conscious of not duplicating work by bringing the Taoiseach before this committee.  I have confidence in our colleagues on that committee to tease out these matters with the Taoiseach during the Estimates debate.  Members might feel after that they did not ask all the questions that we feel should have been asked, but that meeting is already scheduled.  Normal political courtesy dictates that the meeting should be allowed to take place to deal with the Estimates.  However the Secretaries General as Accounting Officers are under the remit of this committee.  The secretariat will be well able to write to them based on the points that have been raised on the specific reasons they need to come before this committee as Accounting Officers as soon as possible after the break.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps I am over-reaching.  I am conscious as Chairman that there are several other forums where the politics of this matter may be dealt with and that the Committee of Public Accounts is not the place for party politics.  I am clear about that.

I do not know if it has been done.  There are some areas where we just need additional information and where we seeking information.  That is fine and we will deal with that aspect.  There are other areas where we need more scrutiny.  The committee needs to return to some issues with Cork Institute of Technology , the University of Limerick, Waterford Institute of Technology and some education and training boards.

The second session will focus on the Appropriation Account for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We may not complete the first session before divisions are taken in the D&aacute;il at 12.50 p.m., in which case the session will continue thereafter and we will take a break before the second session commences.<\/p><p>As chapter 8 deals with funding for local authorities, much of which is for roads, and we are also discussing the special report on the administration and collection of motor taxes, it is intended to discuss relevant matters with officials from the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning and Local Government and representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  However, only officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government need to be here for the second session.  It would be too unwieldy to deal with all these matters in one session.<\/p><p>The first session will focus on chapter 8 of the  Comptroller and Auditor General's report of 2016, which is on central Government funding of local authorities.  Members noted the importance of having a good understanding of how local authorities are funded.  While local authorities are not accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, they are substantially funded from the Central Fund, mainly through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We asked the Accounting Officers from all three bodies to appear for this reason.<\/p><p>We are joined from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, and his officials, Ms Maria Graham, Mr. Paul Lemass, Mr. Maurice Coughlan, Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue, Mr. Rory O'Leary, Ms Theresa Donohue and Ms Janet Jacobs; from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport by Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, and his officials, Mr. Ray O'Leary, Mr. Dominic Mullaney, Mr. Tim Scully and Ms Marie Gleeson; and from Transport Infrastructure Ireland by Mr. Michael Nolan, chief executive officer, who is joined by Mr. Peter Walsh and Mr. Pat Maher.<\/p><p>I ask the Accounting Officers to be as concise as possible in making their opening statements, which will be published and noted.  I am sure the weather of recent weeks placed considerable pressure on all Departments as well as Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  I expect, therefore, that they had more pressing priorities than usual while preparing to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Given the ability of the witnesses, I have no doubt they will be able to take this meeting in their stride, as they did when dealing with everything else in recent weeks.<\/p><p>On behalf of members of the committee and members of the public, I thank Mr. Se&aacute;n Hogan, national director for fire and emergency management, and all the staff involved in recent efforts for the commitment they showed in keeping the country as safe as possible.  It would be remiss of the committee not to thank them.  Mr. Hogan is not here today as he is probably still busy but perhaps he will be able to rest next week.  I would also like to record the gratitude of elected Members for the fabulous work carried out by local authorities and various agencies in recent weeks.  Their work is genuinely appreciated by the public.  The handling of recent weather difficulties enhanced the esteem in which the public service is held by the population.  People appreciated the role of public servants and their work with community and voluntary organisations.  It had a beneficial impact and much good came from it, notwithstanding the difficulties we experienced.<\/p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off or placed in aeroplane mode.  Placing telephones in silent mode is not sufficient as they will continue to cause interference with recording equipment.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p><p>I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make a brief opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#M00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>As the Chairman stated, central Government funding transfers to local authorities present a highly complex picture, with transfers from a number of departmental Votes and funds for a wide variety of purposes.  In my annual report each year, I include a chapter designed to present an overview of the level and trends of such funding and the purposes for which that funding is provided.  Figure 8.1 in the chapter, which is replicated on-screen, gives an indication of the many sources and flows of the funding for 2016.<\/p><p>I should point out that there have been some structural changes in how the funding moves since the report was published.  In particular, since the beginning of this year, motor tax receipts are no longer paid into the local government fund.  They are now paid into the Central Fund of the Exchequer, like other tax revenue receipts.  Moreover, local property tax receipts, which are collected by Revenue, are now paid directly into the local government fund, rather than into the central fund.<br\/><br\/>In 2016, the aggregate transfers of funding from central government to local authorities amounted to slightly more than &euro;2.2 billion.  Over 80% of this funding was provided either through Vote 34 - Housing, Planning and Local Government, or directly or indirectly from the local government fund.  Both the Vote and the fund are administered by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.<br\/><br\/>One of the key functions in administration of the local government fund is the allocation of local property tax receipts to individual local authorities using a redistribution model.  The result of that redistribution is summarised in figure 8.3 of the chapter, included with the Comptroller and Auditor General's submission.  The bulk of the funding transferred to local authorities in 2016 was earmarked for three spending areas; &euro;913 million for housing and urban regeneration, representing 41% of the total; &euro;639 million for transport investment, representing 29%; and &euro;310 million for local authority general purposes, representing 14%.  The final part of the chapter summarises the activities in 2016 of the Local Government Audit Service and of the statutory National Oversight and Audit Commission.  These are the primary mechanisms through which central government funders gain the necessary assurance about the application of the funding provided to local authorities.<br\/><br\/>The 2016 account of the local government fund received a clear audit opinion.  The account recorded income of just over &euro;1.9 billion, and expenditure of &euro;1.92 billion, resulting in a deficit of just less than &euro;16 million for the year.  The fund was financed mainly by motor tax receipts totalling &euro;1.049 billion, local property tax receipts of &euro;463 million and a contribution of &euro;397 million from the Exchequer through Vote 34.  However, it should be noted that on the expenditure side in 2016, a total of &euro;318 million was paid over from the fund to the Exchequer.<br\/><br\/>Aside from sums directly or indirectly transferred to local authorities, the other substantial expense on the local government fund in 2016 was a subvention of &euro;652 million paid to Irish Water.  Members may wish to note that a further &euro;184 million was contributed to Irish Water from the central fund of the Exchequer in 2016 in the form of capital contributions.  I have dealt with the overall funding of Irish Water in a section of chapter 1 of my 2016 report.<br\/><br\/>The final part of this morning&rsquo;s agenda relates to Special Report No. 97, which was completed in December 2016.  The report presents the findings of an examination we undertook which reviewed trends in motor tax receipts, the costs of collection of the tax and the effectiveness of controls in ensuring compliance with motor tax regulations.  The examination was carried out under co-operation arrangements between the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Local Government Audit Service.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned previously, annual motor tax receipts amounted to just over &euro;1 billion in 2016.  While the number of vehicles taxed has increased in recent years, revenue has fallen from &euro;1.16 billion in 2014.  This reflects the ongoing replacement of older private vehicles by lower emission vehicles, which attract lower tax rates.  The examination concluded that if other factors remain unchanged, decreases in motor tax revenue will continue.  For example, we projected on current trends that the replacement of older private vehicles will reduce motor tax receipts by &euro;260 million between 2015 and 2024.  That is almost a quarter of the current total receipts.<br\/><br\/>Members will be aware that vehicle owners have the option to renew their motor tax for a period of three, six or 12 months.  However, taxing vehicles for shorter periods is more expensive <i>pro rata <\/i>for taxpayers, and results in higher transaction processing costs for local authorities and for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We also found that on average, owners of older vehicles taxed on the basis of engine size renew their tax more frequently and for shorter periods when compared to owners of newer vehicles taxed on the basis of emissions.<br\/><br\/>Motor tax collection is now mainly done through the motor tax online system of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Local authorities collect a reducing share of motor tax revenue through their local motor tax offices.  As a consequence of the dispersed collection system, the overall cost of administering the motor tax system is not readily identifiable.  Data collected for the examination suggests that in 2014 the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and local authorities were incurring costs of around &euro;49 million each year.  We estimated that the cost of processing an online payment was around &euro;5 per transaction, whereas the cost was about &euro;10 per transaction when processed via a motor tax office.<br\/><br\/>In 2015, the online facility was used for two-thirds of transactions and increasing each year.  However, there is significant variation in the online processing rate in individual counties.  In Dublin and surrounding counties, close to 80% of transactions were conducted online.  In Donegal, Roscommon and Longford, the rate of use of the online facility was closer to 50%.  However, the examination found that there had been no recent evaluation of the factors influencing a customer&rsquo;s decision to pay tax online or at a local office, or the period for which they pay tax.  This information would help to inform planning for the provision of services in the future, including the use of IT solutions to increase the efficiency of service provision.<br\/><br\/>We also examined the operation of controls in relation to collection of motor tax.  We found that there was no current estimate of the level of motor tax evasion, and that the impact of changes in regulations governing off-the-road declarations had not been ascertained.  The examination also found that there was limited validation of key information such as name, address and insurance details when taxing a vehicle.  Furthermore, there had been an increase in the proportion of frequent transfer of ownership of individual vehicles, which may facilitate the evasion of motor tax because arrears are not pursued when ownership changes.<br\/><br\/>The report makes a number of recommendations concerning the need to monitor motor tax evasion and analyse transaction data to identify emerging trends and support risk-based enforcement measures.  As agreed, I will introduce the Vote at the beginning of this afternoon's session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be here this morning to assist the committee in its examination of chapter 8 of the Comptroller&rsquo;s report for 2016, dealing with<\/p> <p>central Government funding of local authorities and the accounts of the local government fund for 2016.  I am joined by colleagues whom the Chairman has already introduced<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I thank the Chairman for his kind remarks at the beginning of the hearing.  They are very much appreciated, not least by me, because they save me the embarrassment of having to explain why some of us on this side of the room probably look a little bit the worse for wear.  I echo the comments and I thank everyone involved, particularly in the Department and Met &Eacute;ireann as well as a range of other Departments, agencies and local authorities that came together in a tremendous national effort.  Also, I note the great sense of community.  Without that community effort in so many places around the country we would not have been able to respond in the way that we did.<\/p> <p>  As requested, I have provided some advance briefing for the meeting.  In addition, on 14 February I provided the committee at its request with detailed information on local government financing and oversight arrangements.  I will therefore keep these opening comments short.<\/p> <p>  The chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report concerning central government funding of local authorities provides an overview of local authority expenditure and income, detailing the range of programmes for which local authorities are responsible, including housing, roads and environmental services, and the range of related funding sources.<\/p> <p>  As the chapter shows, transfers of funding from central Government sources to local authorities in 2016 totalled over &euro;2.2 billion.  The local government fund, LGF, accounted for 42% of this amount.  A range of Departments, including my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as other organisations, are involved in providing this annual funding to local authorities.<\/p><p>The local government fund, LGF, accounts for 2016 give details of the operation of the fund in 2016.  The income sources to the fund that year totalled over &euro;1.9 billion made up of motor tax of &euro;1.049 billion, local property tax, LPT, receipts of &euro;463 million and a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;397 million.<\/p><p> The main payments from the LGF in 2016 included LPT payments to local authorities of &euro;453 million, a payment of &euro;349 million to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for works on non-national roads and for public transport infrastructure, a payment to the Exchequer of &euro;318 million and a payment of &euro;652 million as subvention to Irish Water.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, from January 2018, responsibility for motor tax transferred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, with consequential implications for the local government fund.  In particular, motor tax proceeds are now paid directly into the Exchequer rather than into the fund, which is now primarily a means of channelling LPT revenues to local authorities.<\/p><p> Funding for Irish Water is now routed through my Department's Vote and funding for roads and public transport, formerly routed through the fund, is now channelled through the Vote of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  All the changes result in much greater transparency in terms of the various flows of funds involved.<\/p><p> In terms of accountability, as the committee is aware, under the existing policy and legislative framework, the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, provides statutorily independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities and other local bodies.  The LGAS audits local government bodies in accordance with a<\/p><p>statutory code of audit practice, thereby fostering the highest standards of financial management and public accountability.<\/p><p> Where the annual audit has been completed by the local government auditor, the local authority is required to furnish a copy of the audited financial statement and any associated statutory audit report to every member of the local authority for their consideration at the next practicable council meeting.  In addition, the audit committee of the relevant local authority will review any audited financial statement, auditor&rsquo;s report or auditor&rsquo;s special report in regard to the authority and will assess any actions taken within that authority in response to either a statement or report, and will report to that authority on its findings.<\/p><p> Scrutiny arrangements for local government were also enhanced in recent years with the establishment of the NOAC, the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  The NOAC scrutinises local government performance in fulfilling national, regional and local mandates, scrutinises value for money where State funds are channelled<\/p><p>through local government and supports the development of best practice and enhanced efficiency in the performance of local government functions.<\/p><p> The committee has recently received at its request an update from the NOAC on its work programme.  I forwarded that to the committee with my letter of 14 February.<\/p><p> The NOAC chair appeared with others before the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government last November for a discussion on local government finance issues.<\/p><p> I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to questions or issues relating to the Department that emerge in the course of the committee&rsquo;s work this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>The Chairman has already introduced my colleagues.  I thank the committee for inviting me here today.  To briefly add to the Chairman's very kind words earlier, I would like to offer my thanks to the various teams within the transport family of agencies and operators, including those in the Irish Coast Guard, who worked tirelessly last week and into the weekend to ensure the safety of people throughout the recent Storm Emma.  I would like to thank also An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Civil Defence and local authority staff for the assistance and support given to our transport operators in restoring our transport services and in helping to keep open our road network.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with the report on central Government funding of local authorities.  I hope to clarify how the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport distributes funding to local authorities.  In 2016, local authorities received over &euro;2.2 billion from Departments.  Of that, my Department provided funding of just over &euro;620 million, representing approximately 28% of the total central local authority funding.<\/p> <p>  The roads maintenance and improvement area is by far the biggest recipient of funding from my Department representing over &euro;570 million of the overall amount from us in 2016.  Public transport received just under &euro;40 million, with the balance allocated between grants for swimming pools, sports capital grants and tourism related projects.<\/p> <p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  There are three main grant programmes operated by the Department and these are pavement sealing to protect the road surface from water damage; road strengthening to lengthen the life of road pavements; and a discretionary grant, which allows for a range of activities including pothole repairs, edge strengthening, renewal of signs and lines and winter maintenance.  Those three programmes account for most of the grant funding and are allocated based on the length of the road network in a particular local authority area.<\/p> <p>  The selection and prioritisation of works is decided by local authorities and is funded by their own resources supplemented by State road grants.  Local authorities can also apply each year for bridge rehabilitation grants and for safety improvement schemes to address particular hazards.<\/p> <p>  As our funding is intended to supplement local authority funding, the Department continues to emphasise to local authorities the importance of prioritising roads' maintenance when allocating their own resources.<\/p> <p>  The Department has focused in recent years on developing an evidence based approach to determining long-term funding requirements for annual maintenance of the road network.  The Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport was published in 2015.  That sets priorities for investment in land transport, and estimates an appropriate quantum of investment on an annual basis.  It seeks to cover the annual maintenance requirement for the network and allows some limited funding for new transport projects.  In 2015, it was calculated at &euro;1.6 billion per annum in total, with approximately &euro;300 million of this coming from non-Exchequer sources.  A sum of &euro;1.3 billion was therefore the annual Exchequer contribution required for capital maintenance of the land transport network.  The Department&rsquo;s evidence based approach has been influential in securing greater focus on the requirement for ongoing maintenance of the road assets.<\/p> <p>  The Building on Recovery Capital Plan 2016 to 2021 provided for a gradual build up in capital funding from a relatively low base in 2016 towards the levels needed to maintain the road network in a steady-state condition and allow for some investment in road improvement schemes.<\/p> <p>  The 2018 capital allocations are the first in a four year period of increased investment.  Allowing for an additional &euro;490 million approximately in funding allocated under the capital plan review last year, total roads investment for the period 2018 to 2021 is planned to be approximately &euro;4.3 billion.<\/p> <p>  By 2022, we will be in a situation where the maintenance and renewal of our assets matches the pace needed to protect our infrastructure such as national and regional roads and the public transport fleet.  We are acutely aware that this capital investment needs to be bolstered by current spending to support the services we deliver.  The national development plan has acknowledged that also.<\/p> <p>  The national development plan shows the breadth of capital investment this Department aims to bring forward for the benefit of our citizens and our economy.  Under that plan, the Department is in a position to bid for resources to move from maintaining our infrastructure to adding to that infrastructure investment in future years.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the multi-annual funding approach, the Department is now progressing a further project called the planning, land use and transport outlook 2040, working closely with our national transport agencies and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The goal is to develop a high-level outline of the amount, type and location of transport investment required to realise the strategic outcomes of the national planning framework.  We aim to look at protecting past investments, catch up on under-investment, research climate change adaptation needs and analyse the future transport needs of a growing economy and a growing population.  This is planned to be substantively complete by July 2018, with a public consultation planned to be issued in October 2018.<\/p> <p>  I would now like to offer some insight into the way our funding is distributed to local authorities.  Funding for roads is distributed in two ways.  First, the Department itself makes grant allocations directly to local authorities for the upkeep of regional and local roads and utilises Transport Infrastructure Ireland's, TII's, payments system for this purpose.  Second, the Department allocates an overall sum of money to TII in respect of national roads each year.  TII is then responsible for the allocation of those moneys to local authorities.<\/p> <p>  With regard to public transport investment, funding is also allocated in two ways.  First, under the sustainable transport measures grant and the regional cities programme funding to local authorities is distributed via the National Transport Authority.  Second, funding goes directly to local authorities under a number of programmes, including active travel towns, smarter travel and national cycle network programmes.  Regarding the smaller allocations, payments for tourism activities are paid via F&aacute;ilte Ireland to local authorities.  Lastly, the Department itself makes payments direct to local authorities under the sports capital programme and the swimming pool programme.<\/p> <p>  The Department also offers some supports for local authorities over and above direct funding.  A good example of that is the MapRoad project, which helps local authorities to monitor and track the performance of their road networks.  The system also incorporates a centralised web based licensing module which allows utility companies to apply online for road opening licenses and road works permits.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly mention the local government fund financial statements that are also being examined.<\/p><p>I understand my colleague from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has separately provided members with information on the local government fund financial statements which are also being examined and local government fund operations now and in the past.  The fund has historically provided local authorities with funding to meet some of their day to day activities, including the provision of water services, roads and other public transport infrastructure, and for certain other local government initiatives.  Motor tax receipts paid online are now routed directly to the Exchequer.  At the time of the reports under discussion the money had been routed to the local government fund.  Some moneys then came back to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport as appropriations-in-aid.  Since the beginning of the year, my Department has received the vast majority of its funding directly from the Exchequer.  The level of funding is the same as it would have been, regardless of the change in the routing of funding.<br\/><br\/><b><font color=\"#424282\"> <\/font><\/b>On special report No. 97 on the administration and collection of motor taxes, responsibility for motor tax policy transferred to my Department from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on 1 January 2018.  The functions transferred include motor tax policy and legislation, as well as responsibility for the related services provided by local authorities, including motor tax collection.  In that regard, motor tax will continue to be payable in 26 licensing authorities - motor tax offices - as well as through the online motor tax facility which is managed by the driver and vehicle computer services division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which is based in Shannon.  The transfer of the motor tax policy function from the start of this year brings the policy and operational aspects of the motor tax function under the umbrella of one Department.  This should provide for greater cohesion in future policy and technological developments.<br\/><br\/>The Comptroller and Auditor General made seven recommendations and progress has been made on all of them.

I am accompanied by Mr. Peter Walsh, director, capital programme, and Mr. Pat Maher, director, network operations.  While the invitation relates to the overall funding of local authorities, I will limit my statement to the allocations for the maintenance and improvement of national roads.  The briefing papers set out the significant roles our partner local authorities perform in supporting these activities.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On national roads improvements and maintenance funding provided for local authorities in 2016, Transport Infrastructure Ireland,<b><\/b>TII, received &euro;411 million in State funding to maintain, manage and improve the national road network in 2016.  This funding also provided for PPP committed payments amounting to &euro;119 million.  The final spend by local authorities on maintenance and improvements was approximately &euro;200 million.  The balance was principally allocated to centrally procured operations, asset renewals and maintenance activities.  A breakdown of the 2016 spend by category for TII and the local authorities is provided in the briefing material.  The trend in capital funding provision for national road improvements was downwards in the years 2010 to 2016, inclusive, as indicated in Chapter 8 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the central government funding of local authorities.  This reflects the successful conclusion of the major inter-urban motorway construction programme in December 2010.  The focus of TII post-2010 has been on maintaining the network and renewing assets to the extent possible but at the expense of maintaining a pipeline of new major road projects.  The expenditure on national road pavements and minor realignments, safety and bridge works remained relatively unchanged through the years 2010 to 2016, inclusive.  A graph depicting trends in local authority expenditure, by activity, has been provided in the briefing material.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>State funding available to TII in 2018 to maintain, manage and improve the national road network is &euro;466 million.  The most notable element of TII's 2018 grant allocations to local authorities is the increase in funding made available for pavement asset renewals which is over &euro;60 million greater than last year's allocation.  Maintenance funding is, however, down by 15% on 2017 levels which will pose particular difficulties for TII's management of what is now a more extensive and high speed network.  We also manage a more resilient and strategic winter maintenance system.  This system is expensive to operate.  Investment in such resilience has proved to be highly justified and warranted.  I thank the Department for supporting TII's investment in a network of salt barns and maintenance compounds strategically located around the network.  This investment was made following the experience of the winters of 2009 and 2010.  We will continue to work with the Department as we review road network requirements and strategies following the recent severe weather events.  Salt stocks are adequate as we approach the end of the 2017-18 winter season.  Other activities associated with the running of the national road network include incident response, traffic messaging and control activities.<br\/><br\/>The recently published national development plan recognises the importance of ensuring the quality and value of past investments are maintained to a high level to ensure quality levels of service, accessibility and connectivity.  Prioritisation of this type of investment is a recommendation of the recent public investment management assessment conducted by the International Monetary Fund.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport strategic investment framework for land transport analysis has established the investment level required to maintain, manage and renew the existing transport infrastructure to keep it in an adequate condition.  This is known as steady State investment.  The steady State investment requirement for the existing network is expected to be substantially achieved by 2021.  TII welcomes the commitment to increase maintenance and asset renewal expenditure over the lifetime of the national development plan to meet the required investment levels for the current transport network and as new projects are developed.  The IMF report acknowledges that Ireland operates a highly developed system for determining and monitoring pavement quality on the road network and estimating the amounts of maintenance and rehabilitation funding required to maintain steady State road quality and availability.<br\/><br\/>I appreciate the Chairman's remarks about the remarkable performance of public service agencies in the past week.  On behalf of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, I thank all local authority staff and motorway operation crews for maintaining service on national roads during the recent severe weather event.  While my opening statement has addressed the matters raised by the committee as they relate to national roads, we will be happy to answer questions on any particular issue raised or any other matter of interest.  Should we not have the information requested to hand, we will follow up with a written response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan.

As I said, we have a large number of witnesses this morning.  It is the most I have ever seen at the Committee of Public Accounts.  We also have a large number or reports, agendas, opening statements and accounts.  In my 17 years on the council, one always would be wary of bulging agendas because the wily county manager, who at the time had the old country secretary, would stuff an agenda and make sure it was fairly big.  When the councillors would come in, they would see the size of it and the fight would be gone out of them before even walking into the room.  They would be happy enough to go with perhaps just works on a local road.  I still remember talking to a manager in my early years as a councillor.  He was nursing a pint of Guinness and he said to me, &quot;Light agendas scare the bejaysus out of me, young Cassells, because God knows what they would ask me.&quot;  I have only 20 minutes.  I will focus on just one or two items and lighten this agenda.<\/p><p>I will kick off on the funding issue, in particular the local government fund, LGF, and people's property tax, a tax that, as we see from the information supplied, brings in some &euro;450 million.  In the broader context of the funding mechanisms, it is around 7% on that pie chart to which the Chairman referred so it is not a chief contributor.  For the people who must pay the tax, it is obviously a very big charge.  We know that the taxes are now under review for the charges for the coming years, and I know when Mr. Lemass was here a few weeks ago for the session on revaluation of commercial rates, he touched on the LPT very briefly, the review that was under way and the additional funds that could be raised from it.  Regarding all the scenarios the Department is painting out, how much extra revenue does Mr. McCarthy feel can be derived from this fund?  I am not asking him to go into the setting of policy but obviously he will present a number of scenarios and look at what is coming in in the first instance and not coming in in other areas.  Can he tell me how much additional income the Department is aiming to bring in from the LPT?  Is it a significant additional amount, based on the analysis of property price increases over the last five years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#Q01300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I will say two things about the LPT.  The LPT review that has been announced and which is under way is being led by the Department of Finance.  As for what it aims to achieve through that review and the terms of reference that have been set out, the Department expects the review to conclude by the end of August.  The Minister for Finance's statement refers to trying to achieve relative stability in the LPT payments of those liable for the tax and to provide clear direction on the likely payments faced by households in 2020.  Obviously, a number of issues are live regarding the LPT.  As it is based on valuations as of the autumn of 2013, from my recollection, properties completed since then are not within the LPT net at the moment and obviously, valuations to the extent that they may have changed since 2013 will also be relevant.  From the Minister for Finance's point of view, there is no predetermined outcome regarding the LPT review.  There is a separate issue which is of more concern - or certainly of as much concern - to us, which is, whatever pot of LPT proceeds is available, the manner in which that is distributed between local authorities.  I think at this point there is a recognition of this, and we have been looking at this internally and with the Minister.  I think there is a recognition that this distribution mechanism also needs to be looked at in parallel with the broader LPT.  I am not in a position to say anything more about that second piece at the moment, but the Minister will make an announcement on it very shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#Q01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I want to touch on this because the Taoiseach touched on it also and set out his personal views on the matter.  I appreciate that the Department of Finance is considering this in the first instance but it will surely liaise with Mr. McCarthy and all the chief benefactors of the fund.  Let us look at the scenarios without any predetermined outcome.  I note that when writing a piece on this issue, Dr. Brian Keegan of Chartered Accountants Ireland, referred to how the revaluation is due next year, by which time most residential properties could well have seen an uplift in value of 50% or more.  The tax is calculated on a percentage of the rounded value, so if the only change made is a higher property valuation, people will see their LPT bills increase substantially.  This is coming down the road very quickly for every homeowner in this State.<\/p><p>This also coincides with the phasing out of mortgage interest relief.  At the same time as losing mortgage interest relief that is benefitting households by &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,000 a year, people are facing a revaluation of the tax they pay on their property.  Leaving aside any possible predetermined outcome, I want to ask a simple question.  What is the Department's view on protecting people from the inevitable spikes in the bill they are to face if that is the outcome?  Is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government liaising with the Department of Finance to suggest that it does not want people pay double what they are paying at the moment, that it wants to protect homeowners and keep the amount of income at the same level and in order to do so if there is a revaluation the charge would have to drop?  Is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government painting that scenario for the Department of Finance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#Q01500","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Our engagement with the Department of Finance as part of this exercise will be within the context of what has been laid down by the Minister for Finance.

Obviously, the rate that is applied to that valuation is also relevant.  Needless to say there are other factors at play as well.

I have heard on my local radio station a county manager from a neighbouring county appealing on public airwaves for councillors not to do it because it would reduce the authority's income.

The power to both increase and decrease is very relevant in that context because while I would have heard some of the types of calls in media from some local authorities not to decrease the rate on the basis of how it would affect income, at the same time that can also become a driver of efficiency depending on what decisions people may wish to take.

As things stand at the moment the Exchequer is making a contribution to that pot.  In future - these are conversations we have regularly with local authorities - if the pot remains as it is and some local authorities are to gain through an exercise of redistribution, inevitably that means that other local authorities would actually lose.

The Chairman is trying to collate everyone in the room, which is why I am running out of time because there are so many people to ask questions.  If everyone is working in silos and we are just putting the money into the Central Fund and no one is really addressing how it is coming in, or if there are decreases in income, then we have a serious issue for local government.<\/p> <p>  Guess who picks up the problem when there are problems with decreases across the board in income from other areas?  The figure comes from central Government, which is what we are dealing with today.  Councillors will row forever and a day about the fact that they are left without income to run the services properly that they are now expected to run, not just across the normal areas of roads and hosing but also, because of the urbanised areas that we have created, on social issues, arts issues, parks and so forth.  They are the issues that communities now expect local government to resolve.  How is that shortfall made up?  It is made up by commercial rates.<\/p><p>The Chairman mentioned at the outset we are dealing here with &euro;2.2 billion of an overall spend by local government of &euro;6 billion, which is just over one third of what is spent.  Let us be honest that local business, not central Government, is the primary source of income for local government in Ireland, providing &euro;1.5 billion in that respect, which works out at 36%.  Income from commercial rates increased by &euro;137 million or 10% between 2008 and 2015 during a period of little or no inflation.  That reliance on commercial rates has increased from 26% to 37% during that period.  Nobody is addressing this issue.<\/p><p> When Mr. Lemass was here a number of weeks ago, we discussed the revaluation process that is causing such distress for so many business around Ireland.  When I asked the Valuation Office about it, it was not its officials' problem.  They were only doing what they were asked.  It was the Department.  When I asked the Department about it, it was not its officials' problem, it was the Minister.  The only people paying the bill here are the businesses of Ireland.  I want to address that here today.  Councillors will end up increasing commercial rates because they need funding to run the services and it is the SMEs which will pay it.<\/p><p> By the way, today we praised everybody for their response to Storm Emma in the past week, and rightly so.  One would have found that most businesses were closed for those three or four days.  They had no income coming into their shops.  They do not get a rates rebate for the four days that they were shut.  Interestingly, it was reported in the media that there was a bonanza in online sales during those four days.  It was as busy in Christmas for them.  People were stuck at home so they started buying online.  However, the poor people who are running a shop, who are dependent on the door opening and who keep our town centres alive, vibrant and contributing, got hit and got no rates rebate.  I think of a friend in Navan who runs a small bakery and has an additional premises up here near these buildings who pays a six figure sum on rates on them.  At the end of the year, if Meath County Council is short of money, he is the guy who gets hit.  When he thinks of growing his business on those tight margins and maybe employing a second person or whatever, he cannot do so because he does not have the certainty, which Mr. McCarthy rightly spoke about providing to houseowners over a five-year period on how much is due on their LPT.  Business owners in this country do not have that certainty when it comes to the commercial rates bill that they will be hit with because they do not know if councillors will be forced to increase commercial rates come the budget at the end of the year.

I, too, would like to add my voice to those who commended the efforts that we saw over the past week.  Some areas did it on tight resources.  When the review occurs, in the case of some of those resources it will be beneficial to look at where those deficiencies are so that the effort can be even better in the future.  I will highlight a little of that.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General talked about a highly complex picture.  His language is benign in relation to local government.  In some of the funding, particularly in the local government fund, the word \"opaque\" does not even go there.  I note that from last year the transfer of motor tax from the local government fund to the central Exchequer may make it a little clearer.  Until now, the motor tax was paying for water and the local property tax was paying for roads, which seems an Irish way of doing it.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased that there will be a review of the distribution and I will explore some of that particular aspect.  The baselines are an area that would be of significant concern.  They predate the local property tax and have their origins in the needs and resources model from 2000.  There were data collected right up to 2005, but from then on that has been the base.  There have been changes in functions, such as Irish Water, and there has been a pension change recently, but probably what will bring this into sharp focus is the fact that people will want to know where their local property tax is going.  It is fine saying that the local authority can retain 80%, but there is a limited amount of discretion within that.  In fact, some of the self-fund aspect of it is really a replacement for what might be central Government grants to local authorities.<\/p> <p>  There are some areas that are particularly badly affected.  I will describe the staffing as a case in point because that would have been captured as a need that had to be resourced in that model.

I put some tables together to look at the trend.  The trend is that in the case of County Wicklow, for example, which the Department uses as a case in point in its table for demonstration, there is total expenditure of &euro;91 million, while in County Mayo there is a total spend of &euro;125 million when everything is counted, although County Wicklow has a bigger population.  It is the same in the case of County Tipperary and County Galway.  County Tipperary has a smaller population than County Galway, it has a spend of &euro;135 million as opposed to &euro;104 million in County Galway.  There is the same trend if one matches Limerick city and county against Fingal.  In the Fingal County Council area there was a 43% increase in population in the 20 years from 1996 to 2016, but it is one of the biggest contributors to the local government fund.  In Limerick city and county there are nearly 100,000 fewer people, but the area has a greater expenditure amount from all sources.  It is not a question of saying one county has plenty of commercial rates income, while another receives a greater amount from other facilities and services.  It is looking at the total spend.  The common denominator is that one county is disadvantaged dramatically if its population is growing.  There are places that did not exist in 2000.  They could not be modelled, but they are now subject to this baseline.  What is being examined in the review of baselines?

There was a big pitch that they would see improvements in their areas, whereas there was a diminution of the fund from the point of view of motor tax and local property tax became the exclusive part of the local government fund.  On the idea that 80% is retained and the self-funding aspect, is it likely to feature in any review and will there be a requirement to self-fund things such as housing and roads projects?  This row takes place every year.  It happens more in Dublin City Council, for example, where &euro;106 million is collected nationally in the self-funding area and &euro;85 million is accounted for by the four Dublin local authorities.  One hears the argument that money is being taken from initiatives to deal with homelessness, whereas that would not be a feature for the bulk of local authorities throughout the country.

It might be helpful to move this issue on if Mr. McCarthy could write a note for the committee.  I ask specifically when the equalisation process came in, where the funding went to and what counties benefited.  I would also like a breakdown of the <i>per capita<\/i>spend for each of those local authorities.  That is where we will see whether those local authorities are getting the support they need or whether they are still being disadvantaged.  If the witness could come back to us with a note on that, perhaps we could follow up.<\/p><p>I want to make a broader point on the disjointed nature of funding.  The reason I spoke to the three chief executive officers, Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Doyle is to get a sense of whether we are empowering local government to develop towns and cities.  I am from Waterford.  Many of the big developments that took place in Waterford recently were actually driven by local authorities.  However, all of the chief executive officers I spoke to said local government funding mechanisms can frustrate and hold back reaching the potential that cities have and making decisions that have to be made in real time.  It can take two or three years, for example, from applying for funding to actually getting it.  <\/p><p>Some local authority chief executives have to take risks.  Sometimes, they spend money on the basis that they might or might not get money.  Mr. Doyle will be familiar with the example of the Waterford Greenway.  Everybody now says it is a fantastic project, which it is, and everybody wants to take credit for it.  However, Waterford City and County Councils was left holding the baby with the cost.  It invested in the Greenway at significant risk to the Council.  It was left with a significant shortfall between the cost of the Greenway and what it got from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government because in the end the level of funding the Council hoped for did not materialise.  <\/p><p>Similar examples could be given.  I am not sure if Mr. McCarthy is aware of the Carrickphierish project in Waterford.  A new neighbourhood is being developed.  The chief executive officer told me the difficulty and frustration he had having go to all of the various different Departments and agencies.  They were all working in silos, and not to the project he was working to.  They ended up with a neighbourhood without a library and without proper services because of the disjointed nature of the funding.  <\/p><p>Mr. McCarthy raised issues from an accounting perspective in respect of trying to understand how it all works.  It has an impact on the ability of local authorities to deliver projects.  Sometimes initiatives have to be taken in real time.  If they are not, then opportunities are lost.  I would like Mr. Doyle to answer the question in respect of the Waterford Greenway, because it is still a sore point for those in the local authority who took a risk.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to address the example I gave of the Carrickphierish project in Waterford, but also more generally because the convoluted system of funding can and does impede, hamper and hold back vision in local government.  I will leave it there and come back later.  I know that was a long contribution but I felt it needed to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#W02300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>On the issue of the Waterford Greenway funding, the Department puts out calls to local authorities across the country at certain junctures when funding is becoming available to invest in greenways.

On the review of the management and maintenance of local authority housing, more specifically, the purpose of the report was to identify best practice and roll it out across the local authority housing system.  We were particularly concerned about the extent to which there was a need to intervene with central government funding to bring long-standing vacant properties back into use.  This is now designed to be a platform which we will need to take forward to ensure that ongoing planned management and maintenance by local authorities gets us to a point where we should not really need to provide significant capital funding.

That house has been empty for almost two years and I pass it regularly.  I have checked and been told that it is allocated but not occupied.  We are into the language of Kafka as to the reasons it might be empty.  One finds it is not really empty in that it has been allocated but one then realises it is not occupied.  At any given time in Galway, we have 70 empty houses.  We have an oversight body looking at how to improve things, but at any given time we have 70 empty houses.  Some of that is due to major refurbishment, but most of them are empty for no good reason.  I am trying to relate the practice on the ground to the theory.  No house should be empty for longer than three or four weeks before it is turned over and allocated.  This is an example from a major city during a major housing crisis.

There were a few things happening at that time.  The starting point would have been the general purpose grants, GPG, as they stood at that point in time.  The water related costs were stripped out of the general purpose grants on the basis that these costs were being transferred across to Irish Water.  That left a figure of the net GPG minus the water costs for each local authority.  When it came to deciding how the proceeds of the local property tax would be distributed, one of the key planks of the policy decision that was made at the time was that no local authority should be worse off under the new regime than under the previous one.<\/p><p> LPT was collected in many local authority areas.  Some authorities would have been worse off compared to the previous regime and others would have been better off.  One of the key planks of the policy decision was that nobody should be worse off.  The decision taken was that 80% of LPT in a local authority area would be retained in that area, while the balance of 20% would go into an equalisation fund.  That 20% was then used to bring up the local authorities that would have been worse off, bringing them back to where they would have been if they system had not changed.  A supplementary contribution from the Exchequer was also needed to make sure that this could be done.  From memory, that brought 19 or 20 local authorities back to an equivalent position to what they would have been in if the system had not changed.  Then there was a balance of 10 or 11 local authorities that were in a surplus situation.  The policy decision that was made, taking account of the constrained financial circumstances of the State at the time, was that to the extent that any local authority had a surplus of that kind, it could retain an amount equivalent to 20% of the yield in its area for its own purposes and the balance of 80% would, in effect, be used to replace Exchequer funding, primarily for housing but also with a certain amount for roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#MM00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I am not sure Mr. McCarthy is getting my question.

They might hear about it in local newspapers or announcements.  Why can a process not be put in place so the CEOs in the councils can be directly informed of funding that comes from other State agencies?  It would make sense.  They could then plan and they would know what is happening in their areas, which is not the case if they are not informed.  Could this be examined to improve communications?

There is a sense that there is a culture of breaking up the funding to make many small announcements because it is great for Ministers to be able to make such announcements.

This link has always been there in the public mind, especially in rural areas.  People who pay their motor tax expect some payback for it in terms of the roads.  I want to read a paragraph from Mr. John McCarthy's opening statement in which he indicated:<\/p><blockquote>As the committee is aware, from January 2018, responsibility for motor tax transferred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, with consequential implications for the local government fund.  In particular, motor tax proceeds are now paid directly into the Exchequer rather than into the fund ...<\/blockquote><p>The link people believe is there was firmly broken and discontinued as of 1 January.  Since that date, motor tax goes straight into general Exchequer funding.  I want to put this on the public record.  It is no secret, but it will be a shock to most people because they have always felt that there is a link between their motor tax and the maintenance of roads.  Since 1 January last, however, it is part of general taxation and it goes directly to the Exchequer.  I know people will say that money can come back in the other direction to make up for it, but the direct link people perceived existed has been broken.  That will come as a bit of a surprise but I wanted to say it.<br\/><br\/>I want to make a few points on the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It pays special grants to local authorities for local roads.  I do not want the witnesses to go into too much detail.  There is a mechanism for national, primary and secondary routes, but where is funding obtained for a regional road to be improved?  If a town wants an inner relief road that is not part of the national plan how does it work through the system?  Is it based on submissions from each local authority?  What type of ranking system does the Department have nationally?  I would like a brief word on this.

Unfortunately, the recommendation has not been implemented.  In 2016 a budget was provided for the new office, but it remains unexpended.  The relevant legislation has been delayed repeatedly and is before the Seanad.  I appreciate the Department's involvement in a range of areas in recent years, whether housing, water services or dealing with planning issues such as lapsed planning applications and applications for planning extensions, which has probably taken up its time in terms of dealing with the legislative process.  However, given that the Mahon report was published in 2012, although it only became formally available in 2013, it is disappointing that a planning regulator has still not been appointed.  I say this as a Deputy who has supported the Government since 2011.  The findings of the tribunal relate primarily to matters in my constituency and former politicians in it.

The issue is as follows and it relates to the current mortgage-to-rent scheme.  A pilot scheme was being looked at after the last mortgage-to-rent scheme was up and running.  At the end of the pilot scheme, they will do a handful and in another year they might roll out some more.  Ms Murray has answered the question.  She said the matter is between the lender and the homeowner.  The lenders still reserve the right to come after the renter for the negative equity.  That has never been stated by the Department.  The Department always says it is not matter for the Department.  It is between the lender and the borrower and the Department does not interfere with that.  If one looks at the agreements as I have, they reserve the right to contact the renter who has given up the title to the house at any stage in the future to discuss that matter.  Officialdom is blind to that as it is not a matter for them; it is between the borrower and the lender.  That has put a lot of people off.  Under the new arrangements and the pilot scheme being looked at now, I understand the new companies coming into this field have agreed not to pursue the negative equity and to make it absolutely clear when they do the deal with the voluntary approved housing body that it is the end of the matter.  Those companies will take the write-down whereas previously lenders were not giving that absolute commitment.  I have encountered those cases.  It might not be the answer for it all, but it is certainly an answer for some of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#XX00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":784,"content":"<p>It is a part of it but in terms of the approved housing bodies - the seven agencies - are they operating efficiently in relation to their component of the transaction?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#XX00400","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":785,"content":"<p>They are purchasing individual units on a single acquisition transaction basis which, in itself, is cumbersome.

I saw very little building during my time on the local authority.  We now have a scheme approved by the Department in my town, where there are about 5,000 people on the housing waiting list.  The scheme is for 42 units and delivery is coming in at a cost of &euro;11.1 million, which works out at around &euro;280,000 per home.  That is the cost of it.  That was approved.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing represents my constituency.  I spoke to Mr. McCarthy about this site this time last year, I think, when he was before the committee about Farganstown.  This is just one example.  In that big town with 5,000 people on a waiting list, that is what we are getting: &euro;11.1 million, which is a lot of money, to deliver 42 homes.  The Department is tackling this problem across a number of areas but, from the point of view of empowering the county councils, the Department faces a big challenge to make sure they step up to the mark.  I would love to know what they are telling the Department.  I would love to know what all the city and county managers are saying.  They are all in the room together.  I see them on the television.

This flows to some extent from the Oireachtas special committee report that was done in 2016 which referred to 50,000 as the level of ambition.

The intention is to nail down the target setting process because there is no point in having part of the target delivery being reliant on direct build when access to land is a problem.  We are trying to match those up.  In some places it is quite a different picture.  Some local authority areas have very decent landbanks in the right locations and other areas do not.  In some cases, where local authorities do not have land where they want it, they have partnered with private developers who have planning permission to build but have not been able to access finance.  We have put those together to get social housing built through the public funding programme that is available.  We have a delivery team in place in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, which visits all the local authorities to go through all these issues.  I believe the team has been to 22 of the 31 local authorities at this stage.

The second priority we have pursued, which I have already mentioned, is other lands that are not in public ownership, but with planning permissions or a developer with capacity to build other than for lack of finance.  We put the public finance and the land together because significant prices are being paid for land at the moment and I am not sure it is the healthiest thing for local authorities to get in to land bidding wars and put up prices even further.  This is why we have tried to max out the potential from the existing landbank, or through the associated landbank of developers.

Some of those are units that are boarded up for very short periods.  In terms of estate management, as soon as a unit is vacated, the local authorities very often will need to go in and secure the unit to avoid antisocial behaviour or otherwise.  It can actually be boarded up for short periods.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally going back a number of years ago when we introduced this significantly increased voids programme, the situation we faced was that we were still in a very resource-constrained environment, as were local authorities, and yet we were seeing increasing numbers of vacant units.  In terms of addressing the housing situation we face, the first step has to be if we have a specific number of vacant units, we need to get those back into stock so that we can get families into them.  That was why even in the resource-constrained times we found ourselves in, we siphoned off a line of funding to support local authorities to bring those back into use because otherwise they would have just continued to lie idle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#DDD00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":977,"content":"<p>As it is 5.52 p.m., I will try to be helpful.

There is a reality.  It would not be evenly spread across the country but in large measure, pretty much most local authorities found themselves in a situation where they had a build-up of void properties.  According as the downturn hit, it was not only central government's financial position that was seriously compromised.  The reality was that the local government system's financial capacity was also significantly compromised.  Most local authorities saw a build up of units that were vacant in those circumstances for long periods of time that required significant investment and they just did not have it.  As I was saying earlier, the situation that we had to get to grips with four years ago was we had a serious housing problem which we still have, we were faced with a situation of limited capital resources - significantly less than we have now available - and at the same time we were seeing this build up of empty units, and we had to take a slice of the available capital resource and for much less money than what it would cost to build new units, put that in to getting the vacant units back into use quickly.  It was, with lesser cost, to get them delivered more quickly.  Obviously, according as the capital profile has increased so much over the last number of years, we are moving much more further back into direct build activity, both by local authorities and AHBs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#EEE01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>I suppose my point is if one has a local authority where there are proactive politicians who see something in front of them and they decide to take action, such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council did in 2004, changes can be made.

There is sometimes a concern as to whether we are getting value for the HAP scheme.  How does one control whether we are getting value?  Maybe somebody could elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  With big public sector construction projects, there is often concern about overruns, that the start price is not the finish price.  Has the Department provisions in place to mitigate against overruns?  Has Mr. McCarthy any examples of what sort of percentages of overruns the Department is looking at currently?  What is happening at the minute?  What are considered acceptable overruns due to unforeseen circumstances?  Has Mr. McCarthy a list of what he would consider to be acceptable?<\/p> <p>  Finally, because we all want to get home, I imagine there are often issues around the public appointment process.  It is a lengthy process and, I suppose, compared to the private sector, sometimes by the time people have gone through it they may not want the job anymore.  One hears anecdotal evidence of that.  Is there provision in place where the Department can bring people in on a short-term basis for a year and perhaps circumvent the lengthy process that may not yield people?<\/p><p>Could architects, quantity surveyors, site managers and so on be recruited on a short-term basis to help circumvent the lengthy process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#EEE01100","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>On the question regarding the housing assistance payment, HAP, in terms of value for money there are rent limits in place for each local authority area and there is discretion to go beyond those rent limits and these provide an important benchmark against which progress can be measured.  As part of the annual budgetary process, all Departments work with the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, which is based in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to identify a number of programmes for review.  The HAP scheme was the subject of one of those exercises last year, which concluded that the rents being paid were below average price levels in the market.  While it was concluded that we needed to keep rent limits under review, there are no plans at this stage to change them.<\/p> <p>  On construction projects, I made the point earlier to Deputy Burke that one of the most important mechanisms that we put in place to try to manage the cost of social housing construction projects is the four-stage approval process.  It allows us to move to the tender process, that is, from stage 3 into stage 4, with as good an understanding as possible of a site such that we have a realistic budgeted cost for the project.  Under the new contract arrangements that are in place, such projects are not affected by inflation.  Obviously, if exceptions arise - and they do - those need to be taken into account.  As the construction programme is still at an early stage of ramping back up, there is only a limited sample available for review in terms of projects that have completed.  To the extent that we have done so, on average approximately 3% to 4% have gone beyond the agreed budget.  <\/p> <p>  On staffing, I am always loath to use the word \"circumvent\" when before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Local authorities can choose to take on staff directly or, in some cases, to take on professional expertise through contractual arrangements.  In many cases, it is a mixture of both.  They can bring in people on temporary contracts but they must do so through a recruitment process.  Since 2015, the Department has approved more than 700 staffing requests for local authorities, specifically in the housing-related area.  Yesterday, we issued the local authorities with a circular on how they can avail of supports through the capital programme to cover some of the staff costs associated with building projects, whether those costs are for contracted expertise in terms of a private firm or for staff they take on, permanently or on contract.  As I said, we leave judgment in this regard to the local authorities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#FFF00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>Who pays the bill in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#FFF00300","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>The Department makes a contribution towards staff recruitment.

With their colleagues in all of the emergency services, they did us proud in providing support for individuals, families and communities at a very difficult time.<\/p> <p>  On 14 September 2017 the D&aacute;il ordered that the Revised Estimates for Public Services for the following Votes be referred to the committee for consideration - Vote 35 - Army Pensions; Vote 36 - Defence; Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs and Trade; and Vote 27 - International Co-operation.  In the first part of the meeting we will consider the Revised Estimates for Votes 35 and 36 and report back to the D&aacute;il on them.  I welcome the Minister of State with special responsibility for defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, and officials from the Department whom I thank them for the briefing material provided.  The proposed format is that at the outset of consideration of each programme we will hear a short overview from the Minister of State, including details of pressures likely to impact on his Department's performance or expenditure under the programme in 2018.  We will then open the floor to members to ask questions.

I concur with the Chairman's remarks and acknowledge, on behalf of the Government, the efforts made by all public servants, communities and volunteers in responding to the severe weather emergency.  In particular, I record my thanks to the civil servants, civilian employees, members of the Defence Forces and Civil Defence and all volunteer organisations for their particular contributions.  Overall co-ordination was led by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government from the National Emergency Coordination Centre which is managed by my Department's Office of Emergency Planning.<\/p> <p>  While I understand the select committee does not want an opening statement as such, it would be useful to set out briefly the overall position on the Votes and update members on some of the main developments within the defence sector in recent times.<\/p> <p>  The defence sector is covered by two Votes, Vote 35 - Army Pensions and Vote 36 - Defence.  The high level goal of both is to provide for the military defence of the State, contribute to national and international peace and security and fulfil all other roles assigned by the Government.  Accordingly, defence sector outputs are delivered under a single programme in each Vote.  The combined Estimates for defence and Army pensions in 2018 provide for gross expenditure of &euro;946 million.  The Army pensions Vote has a single programme for the provision of Defence Forces&rsquo; pension benefits.  It makes provision for retirement pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to, or in respect of, former members of the Defence Forces and their dependants.  It is primarily demand driven and non-discretionary, with superannuation benefits - retirement pensions and gratuities - and disability pensions accounting for 99% of all expenditure.  The 2018 Estimate provides for a gross sum of more than &euro;239 million for the Army pensions Vote.<\/p><p>Some &euro;229 million of this allocation covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.  Pension benefits granted are, for the most part, statutory entitlements once certain criteria are met.  There are currently 12,350 pensioners paid from the Army pensions Vote.  This is a net increase of 1,350 since 2007.  For the years 2018-20, inclusive, current projections are that some 1,050 military personnel will retire on pension.  During 2017, almost 330 Defence Forces members retired on pension, with a similar number anticipated for 2018.  As the committee will be aware, it has been my stated intention to seek extra funding for military pensions as part of the overall future budgetary negotiations, and solid progress has been made on that front.  As announced in budget 2018, the gross allocation for Army pensions has been increased by &euro;9.5 million to some &euro;239 million for this year, which is very welcome.  This builds on a funding increase of &euro;6 million in the 2017 Estimates.<br\/><br\/>I now turn to Vote 36, which is delivered under a single programme entitled &quot;Defence Policy and Support, Military Capabilities and Operational Outputs&quot;.  The Vote of &euro;707 million includes a pay and allowances allocation of some &euro;509 million, while the remaining non-pay allocation of &euro;198 million provides mainly for the renewal and maintenance of essential equipment, infrastructure and operational costs.  The pay allocation of &euro;509 million includes &euro;12.3 million to provide for increases due under the Lansdowne Road public service stability agreement 2018-20 commitments.  The public service stability agreement contains proposals for increases in pay ranging from 6.2% to 7.4% over the lifetime of the agreement.  I welcome the fact that the Defence Forces representative associations have accepted this agreement.<br\/><br\/>The defence pay allocation provides for the pay and allowances of a Permanent Defence Force strength of up to 9,500, 550 civilian employees, 350 civil servants, 18 chaplains and 14 Army nurses.  This level of funding provides the defence organisation with the resources necessary for it to deliver effectively across all its key domestic and international responsibilities.  There has been an ongoing and increasing level of recruitment taking place within the Defence Forces over recent years at both enlisted and officer level.  This includes general service recruits, apprentices, cadets and direct entry officers.  Recruitment has increased from 405 in 2015, to 690 in 2016 and to 751 in 2017.  It is anticipated that there will be over 800 personnel recruited in 2018.  The budget allocation also provides over &euro;2 million for Reserve Defence Force pay for 2018.  This will allow for 26,000 training days for reservists this year.<br\/><br\/>The defence non-pay allocation comprises both current and capital elements.  The current expenditure allocation of &euro;121 million provides mainly for expenditure on ongoing Defence Forces standing and operational costs such as utilities, fuel, catering, maintenance, information technology and training.  The capital expenditure allocation of &euro;77 million for 2018 will allow the defence organisation to undertake a programme of sustained equipment replacement and infrastructural development across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, as identified and prioritised in the defence White Paper.  Among the main equipment programme priorities planned for 2018 are the ongoing upgrade of the Army Mowag armoured personnel carriers, replacement of the Air Corps Cessna aircraft, continuation of the naval vessel replacement programme and the mid-life refit of naval vessels.  The overall capital allocation of &euro;541 million for defence for the period 2018 to 2022, as set out in the national development plan, emphasises the importance attached by this Government to ensuring that the Defence Forces have the capability necessary to deliver on all the roles assigned by the Government.  This funding<b><i><\/i><\/b>will play a vital role in ensuring that the priorities identified in the White Paper can be met and that the Defence Forces can deliver fully across all roles.<br\/><br\/>I will now briefly mention some of the key roles and outputs delivered under the defence programme.  The Defence Forces continue to make a considerable contribution in their international peace and security role.  As of February 2018, Ireland is contributing 586 Permanent Defence Force personnel to nine different missions throughout the world.  In addition, personnel are deployed to a range of international organisations and national representations.  The main overseas missions in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed are the United Nations interim force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 375 personnel, and the United Nations disengagement observer force, UNDOF, in Syria, with 136 personnel.  Since October 2017, the Naval Service has been participating in the EU naval mission Operation Sophia which specifically seeks to counter human trafficking and smuggling in the southern central Mediterranean, and the Government recently approved the continuation of this deployment for 2018.<br\/><br\/>The Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have primary responsibility for Ireland&rsquo;s domestic security, supported, as required, by the Defence Forces as part of its aid to the civil power function.  This role is multi-faceted and in 2017 included a varied set of tasks such as Garda air support missions, Central Bank security guards, prisoner escorts, explosive ordnance disposal call-outs and Naval Service diving operations.  The Defence Forces also provide assistance to the principal response agencies tasked with responding to major emergencies.  The professional competence shown by the Defence Forces in undertaking these roles is greatly valued and appreciated by all stakeholders and was further illustrated by the extensive and wide-ranging assistance provided in response to last week's severe weather emergency.<br\/><br\/>Civil Defence is also funded from the defence Vote and remains a vital component in each local authority's emergency response arrangements.  Volunteers from Civil Defence have responded very effectively when required, most recently during the flooding events that occurred in 2017, during Storm Ophelia and again in the most recent severe weather emergency last week.  Committee members have been provided with briefing material on the individual subheads for both the defence and Army pensions Estimates and I look forward to positive engagement on any issues the members may wish to discuss.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#A00500","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1079,"content":"<p>We will now take Vote 35, programme A, provisions for Defence Forces pensions benefits.

I question the whole concept of including an item called \"Pensions\" in an Estimate.  There should be an overall figure for pensions in, for example, the Department of Finance, rather than the Minister of State having to come in here and talk about Army pensions.  There is nothing he can do about it.  The people are retired and they are entitled to their pension, so let us get on with it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#C00700","speaker":"1219"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1095,"content":"<p>I would say the Deputy would have the support of every Government Department except the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#C00800","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1096,"content":"<p>Seriously, though, it inflates the Estimate to a level that is just not true.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#C00900","speaker":"1219"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1097,"content":"<p>True.

Anything I say is not a slight on them or their work.  It is more a question of how we can help them to provide even more assistance in the future.  <\/p> <p>  The allocation for Civil Defence has been reduced from the figure of &euro;5.1 million in 2016.  I think it was down to &euro;4.2 million in the budget for 2018.  What is the reason for the reduction?  Is it the drop in numbers?  The numbers have been set out somewhere.  If the numbers in Civil Defence are down, how do we attract more volunteers?  Obviously, on the back of the Trojan work done last week, it might be an opportune time to remind people of the role played by Civil Defence and encourage them to join it.  The allocation for Civil Defence in the 2017 Estimates was &euro;5,240,000, not all of which was spent.  A sum of &euro;300,000 was not spent.  The allocation in front of us is &euro;4,240,000, which represents a reduction of &euro;1 million, a substantial amount for such a small organisation.  Will the Minister of State explain the reason for the reduction?  The allocation for the Irish Red Cross is small.  Obviously, its outrun was far higher because of the storms and the same could happen this year.  We understand that in the event that there is storm damage, caused by floods in particular, the Irish Red Cross receives additional money, as it has during the years; therefore, I am not too worried in that regard.  However, given the significant role played by it, does Civil Defence have enough equipment or does it need new equipment?  Obviously, it will review its activities last week and the week before which might indicate, or perhaps not, that it needs more modern equipment.  It is about the Department having a sense at this stage because if Civil Defence needs additional equipment, rather than having to wait until later in the year, the allocation of funding should be fast-tracked for additional or new equipment, given that there are red alerts more frequently.<\/p><p>I have other questions on other issues, which I hope to raise later.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#D02300","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1138,"content":"<p>I will answer the question on the Civil Defence.

The European Union Training Mission Competence Centre project aims to improve the availability, interoperability, specific skills and professionalism of personnel trainers for EU missions across participating member states.  Moreover, it will accelerate the provision of EU training missions due to a higher situational awareness regarding trained, educated and available personnel for current and future EU training missions.  This is a capability that the Irish Defence Forces continually develop, and it is compatible with their efforts in this area.<\/p> <p>  The other project in which we are participating is the upgrade of maritime surveillance.  This project aims to integrate land-based surveillance systems, maritime and air platforms to distribute real-time information to member states to provide a timely and effective response in international waters.  The main objective of the programme is to enhance maritime surveillance, situational awareness and potential response effectiveness of the EU by using the existing infrastructure, deploying assets and developing related capabilities in the future.  It aims to provide a timely and effectively response new and old threats and challenges, such as energy security, environment challenges and security and defence aspects.  It also aims to ensure accurate awareness and rapid response to contribute to the protection of the EU and its citizens.  We will have a minimal participation, whether in European Defence Agency, EDA, or PESCO projects.  Participating in the projects will not stretch our finances. <\/p> <p>  The total allocation for litigation during the past three years has been &euro;5 million per annum.  The estimate for 2018 is &euro;5 million.  Expenditure has been somewhat less, ranging from &euro;2.4 million to &euro;3.7 million per annum.  The Department has no direct control over the quantum or timing of legal costs, claims or awards that fall for payment.

This is going to impose greater obligations on our Defence Forces and our Naval Service.  We should be hearing about this and talking about it before it happens.  The Naval Service had 1,376 vessel patrol days in 2016.  In 2017, that figure was 1,171.  There were 200 fewer patrol days for the Naval Service.  In 2016 the Air Corps had 4,287 operational flight hours.  In 2017 it flew 3,271.  There was a decrease of in excess of 1,000 flight hours between 2016 and 2017.  Whether we like it or dislike it, Brexit is going to cause us major problems.  We cannot allow a situation where Air Corps operational flights are reduced by more than 1,000 hours and the Naval Service's activity is reduced by about 260 patrol days.<\/p><p>These are important issues at which we need to look and for which we need to be prepared because Brexit is only 12 months down the road.  We need to examine how we can bolster both the Naval Service and the Air Corps in patrolling and protecting our waters.  It will be a new ball game.  The figures have been presented factually but they are alarming.  Not to take away from the great work being done by both the Naval Service and the Air Corps, but these figures are alarming when considering how they can protect our shores and assets locally.<\/p><p> While we may not have the time today to examine all these issues, I suggest that the Minister of State considers coming back to the committee to discuss the impact of Brexit on the Naval Service and the Air Corps.  There is no point in waiting until D-Day to discover we have serious problems.  I am not blaming the Minister of State but there is obviously a reason for this.  Whether it is lack of personnel or the fact that we are engaging in other activities, we have to look after our assets and ensure that our fisheries are protected.  I am just highlighting the fact that these figures are alarming.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#E00900","speaker":"1219","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1147,"content":"<p>The number of Naval Service vessel patrol days amounted to 1,204 in 2014, 1,376 in 2016 and 1,408 in 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#F00200","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1148,"content":"<p>My figures show 1,117.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#F00300","speaker":"1219"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1149,"content":"<p>The figures I have are 1,204 in 2015, 1,376 in 2016 and 1,408 in 2017.

We might come back to it.  The second issue I wish to raise with the Minister of State I have raised with him in the Chamber.  It concerns the state of barracks, specifically the accommodation and the bedding and equipment within barracks.  I am looking under subhead A12.  I see the 2018 Estimate provides for a slight increase in expenditure on this.  I wish to raise with the Minister of State the matter of Cathal Brugha Barracks in particular.  I was contacted very recently about this.  A career course was held in the barracks for, I think, corporal rank, and complaints came through concerning the bedding and the mattresses not being fit to sleep on.  When I addressed the Minister of State on this issue in the Chamber, I asked that a review of the accommodation across the board be considered.  I had reports back from Cathal Brugha Barracks that there were ripped mattresses and stained bedding that were not fit to be slept on and that some of those participating in the career course did not sleep in the barracks because of the state of the accommodation and stayed outside the barracks instead.  I doubt this is confined to Cathal Brugha Barracks, but there probably is a need to do an inventory check and a check of the accommodation to see what state the bedding and mattresses are in.  These are basic enough things.  They may seem minor in the overall context of the Defence Forces but these are the day-to-day things those serving must deal with.  Some small changes would make a big difference in this regard.  I therefore welcome the projected increase in spending on this area for this year but I ask the Minister of State to make a specific effort regarding the accommodation and bedding under subhead A12.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#G00700","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1181,"content":"<p>There is a five-year plan for the built infrastructure programme.

In this context I wish to comment on the record on the outstanding work of the Defence Forces in respect of Storm Emma.  So many of our soldiers went above and beyond the call of duty and worked day and night.  I am sure they are still recovering and still quite tired after the work.  I know some of them are still out on the ground assisting in various communities throughout the country.  In times like these when we see a red alert warning and a potential national disaster, when there is a real threat of loss of life, we see the huge value and the importance of our Defence Forces, how much we really need them and that they are there at the drop of a hat in the worst of conditions.  When everyone else is locked up in their homes staying safe, they are out helping people, bringing medical staff to hospitals and freeing people stuck at the sides of the roads.<\/p> <p>  This brings me back to the area of pay and conditions and members' allowances.  The notion that a serving soldier who does a 24 hour duty would get in or around &euro;20 has not been addressed yet and needs to be addressed.  I understand the pay review that is ongoing - I know all that - but the Defence Forces are different from other public sector workers, and this has been recognised in other jurisdictions.  Take, for example, our closest neighbours in the UK, where a military covenant is in place and the state, the government and society as a whole recognise the defence forces' very special and unique work and role and the fact that they are limiting their own rights as employees because of the work of the defence forces.  They do not have the right to strike and their work is extremely demanding and can often put their lives in danger.  On that note, we must look at our Defence Forces as a separate and distinct entity within the Civil Service and the public service.  The &euro;20 they get paid for a 24 hour duty needs to change.  I do not care how we go about doing so or what needs to be done to make it change, but that level of payment in itself is nothing short of a kick in the teeth for those who serve their country.  It is one of the reasons we are finding it hard to hold on to personnel.<\/p> <p>  Regarding the allowances, and I refer specifically to subhead A4, PDF allowances, there is only an increase of roughly &euro;100,000.  The Defence Forces as an organisation have been trimmed and slimmed as much as possible in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 and every year since then.  They have pulled back and made savings and efficiencies to the point that they can go no further.  They have probably gone too far, actually.  While their salary is one aspect of their pay, their allowances are a very vital other aspect, and it is in the latter area that we can make huge changes and alleviate some of the pressures on Defence Forces personnel and their families.  I see the Estimates for this year are pretty much the same as last year's.  If we are talking about taking in additional personnel and saying we now have more personnel on the books, even to stay at the same strength we would need to see a greater increase in spending on allowances than what we are seeing for this year.  Salaries are a difficult thing to move on and they are moving slowly in the right direction.  However, allowances really formed part of personnel's overall pay.  They became reliant on them, and I can understand why.  It is these allowances that were cut to nothing.<\/p> <p>  Will the Minister to look at the Estimate for this year for the allowances and see what we can do for our Defence Forces personnel in this area?  I appreciate the difficulties around public sector pay but I think a pay commission in the context of the Defence Forces would be worth exploring.  We do not need to reinvent the wheel.  We can look to our colleagues and neighbours in the UK.  They have done this and they recognised that the defence forces, their armed forces, are a unique entity among public sector workers and that the sacrifice they make needs to be recognised separately.<\/p><p>I will go on.

I know this question has been raised with the Minister of State but there are ongoing issues in respect of litigation.  We cannot get into that.  It is probably an explanation as to why litigation costs have gone up by &euro;1.5 million for this year.  I have my own views on that, which I have made known to the Minister of State within the Chamber.  I do not think the approach is the right one.  Granted, we cannot get into individual cases.<\/p> <p>  In respect of Air Corps equipment and support in subhead A9, there is only a slight increase of about &euro;500,000.  Considering the well documented and publicised issues in the Air Corps, including its inability to provide top cover 24-7 and the air ambulance service not being where it should be in respect of the level of cover, it strikes me as a very slim increase in that area of spending.  We know the Air Corps needs serious investment and support financially.  <\/p> <p>  My last question is on the area of military transport.  Can the Minister of State advise me on the state of fleet within the transport corps? My understanding is that much of our fleet is old and needs replacing.  The &euro;500,000 allocated for this year is not going to get an awful lot of replacement transport vehicles.  Will the Minister of State comment on where we are at with the transport corps?

Any Defence Forces member out during the last number of days, as in Storm Ophelia before, will receive the maintenance of essential services allowance.  They will get that, as was the case with any storm where the Defence Forces have been called out in the last couple of years or where they have been called out under aid to the civil power, under which heading this comes.  On the 24-hour duty allowance, I have been in negotiations with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe on that.  That is completely separate to the Public Service Pay Commission.  The representative organisation, PDFORRA, is aware of that.  I understand it is back with it.<\/p> <p>  The Department of Defence, and the Defence Forces, is making a submission to the Public Service Pay Commission.  That submission will be made, I understand, in the next couple of weeks.  Last week's weather conditions delayed it.  The review of the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme is happening.  I appointed Mr. Gerald Barry as an independent chair.  That began to sit the week before last.  Both representative organisations, the Defence Forces, the Department of Defence and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are all part of that.  <\/p> <p>  I mentioned specialist pay.  On the allowances, the difference between 2016 and 2017 was a &euro;4 million increase.  The estimate for 2018 is &euro;39,680,000.  If more is required, then we will find it.  There is no issue around that.  If people are entitled to an allowance, then they will get their allowance.  On transport, there has been a significant investment in the replacement programme.  Within the Air Corps, the Cessna replacement programme is worth &euro;40 million.  The naval vessel replacement programme will see a new ship expected in mid-2018.  The armour protective vehicle refit programme is under way at the moment.  In 2017, there were 24 minibuses, ten Citro&euml;n Berlingo vans, four Mercedes coaches, three Fiat Ducato trucks, three Scania recovery trucks, two Citro&euml;n Relay vans, two Mercedes Sprinter vans.  In 2018, over &euro;2 million in spending is planned for 130 cars, 20 minibuses, 20 store vans, 17 off-road motor cycles and one electric van.  The purchase of tools and equipment for 2018 will cost &euro;2 million.  I have not been told of complaints from anyone in the Defence Forces about equipment or vehicles.  I have had no complaints from any member, the general staff or anyone.  No one has approached me for further investment, unless the Deputy has been told differently.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#H00700","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1208,"content":"<p>I have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#H00800","speaker":"1336"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1209,"content":"<p>There is also, between now and 2022, &euro;540 million to be spent on infrastructure, whether that is equipment, vehicles or buildings, under the capital plan.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#H00900","speaker":"1365"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1210,"content":"<p>I have one brief follow-up point.

One is in relation to the Reserve Defence Forces.  The effective number of Army and Naval Service reserves is at 46%.  That suggests there is a major crisis.  How is that going to be reversed?  How can we ensure the Army and Naval Reserve is at something akin to 90% to 95% of its effective strength?  I do not know if the Reserve Defence Forces played a role during storm Emma recently.  Was there a role and if not, why not?<\/p> <p>  In respect of the other issues, I refer to recouping of funding and specifically appropriations-in-aid.  We are not expecting to receive any moneys back from the EU for fishery protection costs in 2018.  That seems odd, given that our fisheries and fishery stocks are still being plundered.  On page 10, PDF allowances breakdown is expected to cost &euro;8 million plus for allowances for security duties.  Is any of that recouped from private banks and the likes?  Is that what is in appropriation-in-aid as No. 3 \"Receipts from banks and other organisations\", and is that the State recouping some of the costs?  It is not equivalent; one is &euro;1.3 million and the other is &euro;8,212,000.<\/p><p>In terms of military education and training, while the drop in the Estimate is not substantial, it is a drop nevertheless.  I would have presumed that we would continue to enhance the education and training of members of our Defence Forces.  I am wondering why, given that the budget had been increasing each year prior to this, there is a small drop in it now.  <\/p><p> Deputy Barrett mentioned earlier the matter of Naval Service vessel patrol days.  The figures indicate a slight increase but Irish naval vessels were on operational duty in the Mediterranean continuously in 2017.  Are those days in the Mediterranean counted as patrol days?  If so, that means that the number of patrol days in the Irish seas have reduced substantially in terms of fisheries protection and other duties.  <\/p><p> I think we were all across the road for the annual remembrance ceremony for war veterans.  The grant this year is &euro;55,000.  I know that those in receipt of the grant have asked that it be increased substantially.  I am aware that &euro;55,000 represents an increase on the previous year but it still seems a minuscule amount considering what the veterans associations and the various representative associations want to do to assist past members of the Defence Forces, some of whom have fallen on hard times and others have lost contact with friends and so forth.  These organisations are doing tremendous work trying to liaise with former members, reunite them with colleagues and organise special events, particularly for more elderly and infirm former members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#H01400","speaker":"1305","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1216,"content":"<p>On the veteran associations, I meet them at least and sometimes twice a year.  I last met them in December of 2017.  Their allowances were discussed and officials in my Department are in negotiations with them on that matter.<\/p> <p>  In 2016, the budget for military education and training was &euro;1,983,000 while in 2017 it was &euro;2,173,000.  The Estimate for 2018 is &euro;2,150,000 but if additional funding is required for 2018, it will be provided.  It is most important that we continue to train and educate members of our Defence Forces.  If members want to participate in any training or education programmes, they will be facilitated in doing so.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy also spoke about the Reserve Defence Forces, RDF.  In 2017, there were 139 inductees.  The most recent recruitment campaign for the Army's Reserves and the Naval Service began in July 2017 and attracted 121 applications.  A total of 139 personnel were inducted into the RDF in 2017.  It is planned to hold a further Reserve recruitment campaign in 2018.  Having regard to training demands arising from the significant ongoing requirements of the PDF, it is proposed to hold the RDF general services recruitment campaign between 23 April and 4 June 2018.  Applications for the Reserve are vetted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and standard vetting takes four weeks.  However, additional vetting also takes place appropriate to the role of the Defence Forces as an element of national security.  If at all possible, we try to facilitate members of the Reserve who are working by scheduling medical checks, fitness tests and so forth at weekends.  One of my priorities is to increase the numbers in the RDF.  However, it is also a priority in build up the numbers in the PDF.  The fall-out rate for those who apply to join the RDF is very high as people go through the different stages of the recruitment process.  I know that the process has been speeded up to try to get as many applicants through as quickly as possible.<\/p> <p>  Defence Forces allowances include a Border duty allowance, an overseas allowance, a miscellaneous allowance and a security duty allowance.  The Deputy focused on the latter allowance which is payable to personnel to compensate them for the additional hours and responsibilities associated with security duties.  These can include aid to civil power duties, barrack security duties or explosive ordnance disposal, EOD, duties.  Personnel may also receive a patrol duty allowance, subsistence allowance and uniform allowance.  <\/p> <p>  The Deputy also spoke about the number of patrol days carried out by the Naval Service.  The figures provided are for actual patrol days in 2016 and 2017 and the projected number for 2018.

I sincerely hope that I am wrong but I do not think so in light of the comments of Prime Minister May that a border similar to the Canadian-US border could work here.  We have all seen the pictures of how that border works in terms of hardware and the huge queue of vehicles and so on.  Members of all Governments should be very conscious of the remarks of former Prime Minister John Major and Senator George Mitchell on the need to avoid borders.  Given the current status of the talks I am not optimistic that we can avoid a border in this country but, as a person who lives in a Border community, I sincerely hope I am wrong.  I understand that the Minister is not in a position to brief the committee on the preparations being made in this regard by the Department and the military authorities but like Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, I hope that good work is under way.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#K00300","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1225,"content":"<p>Brexit and ensuring there is no hard border is a priority for the Taoiseach and the Government.

The report for 2016 was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 5 October 2017.  The following motion has been placed on the Order Paper of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and referred to this committee:<\/p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2016, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 5 October 2017, in accordance with section 13 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.<\/blockquote> <p>In commending the motion, I will shortly outline some of the key aspects of Ireland&rsquo;s involvement with the UN in 2016.  Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to supporting the UN on international peace and security issues has been demonstrated through continuous participation in UN peacekeeping missions since 1958.  Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting Ireland&rsquo;s international obligations as a member of the UN and the EU.  At present, there are some 586<font color=\"#FF0000\"> <\/font>members of the Permanent Defence Force serving in missions overseas.  Irish troops are deployed in UN-led and UN-mandated missions in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.  <\/p><p>Ireland&rsquo;s main commitments during 2016 were to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights.  The UNIFIL mission continues to represent Ireland's largest overseas deployment.  At the request of the United Nations, a contingent of Defence Forces personnel deployed to UNIFIL in mid-2011.<font color=\"#FF0000\">  <\/font>Ireland has served as part of a joint battalion comprising Irish and Finnish troops since June 2012.  Since May 2015, the Finnish contingent has included an Estonian platoon of some 40 personnel.  Command of the joint battalion has rotated between Ireland and Finland, by agreement.  Ireland has been in command of the joint battalion since November 2016.<\/p><p>Partnership with like-minded states has become an increasing element of our overseas peacekeeping operations.  Working with like-minded states is critical to overcoming the new and ever-emerging challenges we face.  Together, we can provide support for fragile states and work to prevent conflict from escalating.  Also, in the absence of partners, the range and nature of overseas operations which Ireland could undertake in support of international peace and security would be notably curtailed. <\/p><p>There were two rotations of Irish personnel during 2016 comprising the 53rd Infantry Group in May and the 109th Infantry Battalion in November.  At 31 December 2016, there were 379 Irish personnel serving with the mission.  An Irish officer, Major General Michael Beary, took up the post of head of mission and force commander with UNIFIL in July 2016.  At the request of the UN, his appointment has been extended until July 2018.  His appointment to this prestigious post is a tribute to the fine reputation of Irish peacekeepers over the years and to the skills and attributes that they bring to the job.  It is also a tribute to the professional competence, experience and integrity of Major General Beary himself.  <\/p><p>The United Nations Security Council has extended the mandate of UNIFIL until 31 August 2018.  Ireland's second largest overseas deployment in 2016 was to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights.  The Defence Forces contribution to UNDOF in 2016 comprised the 52nd Infantry Group and the 54th Infantry Group, each with approximately 130 personnel.  The Infantry Group operated in the role of a quick reaction force on stand-by to assist with ongoing operations within the UNDOF area of responsibility.  At the request of the UN, Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon was extended in his appointment as deputy force commander, UNDOF, until 21 May 2016.  The security situation in the UNDOF area of operation is continually reviewed by the UN and the Defence Forces.<\/p><p>The continued presence of the UNDOF mission remains an important element in ensuring stability on the Golan Heights and in the Middle East generally despite the ongoing conflict in the region.  It should be noted that the role of UNDOF is one of being an observer in regard to the separation agreement between Israel and Syria.  It is not a peacekeeping or peace-enforcement mission.  Its continued presence is supported and welcomed by both Syria and Israel.<br\/><br\/>Ireland continued to contribute military observers and staff to various UN missions throughout the year under review.  The main mission in this regard is UNTSO.  Twelve Irish personnel were deployed to this mission in 2016, including Colonel Eamon Caulfield as Deputy Chief of Staff of UNTSO.  <br\/><br\/>Ireland increased the contingent of personnel deployed to the EU training mission in Mali to 18 during 2016.  The objective of this mission is to improve the capacity of the Malian armed forces to maintain security in Mali and restore the authority of the Malian Government.  Ireland has participated in EUTM Mali since the mission was launched in 2013.  Ireland's contribution to the mission has been further increased and currently 20 Irish Defence Forces personnel are deployed to EUTM Mali.<br\/><br\/>Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel were deployed in 2016 were the EU-led mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUFOR, with seven personnel; the NATO-led international security presence in Kosovo, KFOR, with 12 personnel; and the Resolute Support Mission, RSM, in Afghanistan, with seven personnel.  Ireland withdrew from RSM in March 2016.<br\/><br\/>In addition, during 2016 a small number of Defence Forces officers continued to serve with MINURSO, the UN mission for the referendum in Western Sahara, MONUSCO, the UN stabilisation mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and UNOCI, the UN operation in C<font color=\"#2F2F2F\">&ocirc;<\/font>te d'Ivoire.<br\/><br\/>I had the opportunity to travel to Mali in October 2016 to meet the Irish personnel serving with the EUTM Mali mission.  The Taoiseach and I visited UNIFIL in December 2017, and next week I will be travelling to the UNIFIL, UNTSO and UNDOF missions.  Such visits are a valuable opportunity to be briefed on the situation and the challenges facing the respective mission areas.It is also an opportunity to thank the members of the Defence Forces for the incredible work they are doing in overseas missions.  <br\/><br\/>During 2016 and again in 2017, I met with fellow defence Ministers to discuss contributions to peace-support operations and UN commitments to progress peacekeeping reform.  These summits provide an opportunity to consider the evolution of UN peacekeeping as we face new and more complex security and peacekeeping challenges across the globe.<br\/><br\/>A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has taken seriously its obligation under the UN charter to make available to the Security Council armed forces, assistance and facilities in order to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security.  The current contribution, of some 586 personnel, to overseas missions is very significant in the context of the resources available for defence.  This figure will increase further in 2018, with the planned consecutive deployments this year of two Naval Service ships as part of Operation Sophia in the Mediterranean.  In 2018, in the region of 650 personnel will be deployed to overseas missions.<br\/><br\/>As a long-standing contributor to UN peacekeeping missions globally, we are very aware of the challenging nature of the missions we assign to our personnel.  The UN is in the process of reforming its peacekeeping operations with a view to becoming more effective and cost-efficient and being more transparent and accountable in its decisions.  In this connection, the promotion of a strong gender perspective is a key element in all our peacekeeping operations and an important part of improving the effectiveness of UN peacekeeping operations. <br\/><br\/>UN peacekeeping continues to be one of the most flexible and effective tools available to the international community in responding to crises around the world.  Any reforms that create the conditions for successful peacekeeping operations and thereby produce tangible improvements in the lives of the people under protection in mission areas are to be welcomed.<br\/><br\/>Operational experience in peace-support operations is essential for the ongoing development of the Defence Forces.  It is important to acknowledge, however, that participation in peace-support missions comes at a personal cost for individuals, who must be away from families and friends for extended periods of time in unfamiliar and difficult environments.  Without their commitment and dedication Ireland's strong tradition of service overseas, under the auspices of the United Nations, would not be possible.  <br\/><br\/>Since 1958, over 65,000 Defence Forces personnel have served on overseas missions.  This year also marks significant anniversaries in relation to our UN peacekeeping role.  It will be the 60th anniversary of Irish participation in UN peacekeeping missions and it will be the 40th anniversary of our first deployment to Lebanon as part of the UNIFIL mission.  This is an opportune time for me to acknowledge the significant contribution that they have made to UN peacekeeping operations over many years. <br\/><br\/>I commend the motion to the committee. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#K01200","speaker":"1365","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1235,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a number of issues.  I welcome the report in the main.  I commend the work over 40 years.  UNIFIL, in particular, has been a testament to the work of the soldiers in the Defence Forces.  They have set a standard and have earned much praise for the country because of their actions.  It is opportune that Major General Michael Beary is heading the mission in UNIFIL although he has come under quite vicious attack from both the Israeli representatives and the United States Ambassador to the United Nations in recent times.  His credibility has been slighted by those representatives.  In December, what was being said of him was reported.  We should use the opportunity to stand fully behind him and the soldiers who have acted under him in recent times and also the previous detachments from the Irish Defence Forces who have served in Lebanon with distinction and who have been under physical attack from the forces they were trying to keep apart and that are represented at the United Nations.  They are the very same ones who are attacking or questioning the Major General's ability.  The US ambassador to the United Nations, Ms Nikki Haley, said UNIFIL was giving terrorism a pass in the area and that Major General Beary was blind to Hezbollah's actions.  Furthermore, she said he had an embarrassing lack of understanding of what is going on and seemed to be the only person in southern Lebanon who was blind to what Hezbollah was doing.<\/p> <p>  The Minister of State said he is visiting the UNIFIL mission next week.  I hope he will be able to inform Major General Beary and the soldiers serving under him of the support of this committee and that, despite the attacks at such a high level, we are fully behind the work in the area.  The actions of Irish soldiers and others in the UNIFIL mission have resulted in relative peace in the area.  As I stated, their work has stood up for us internationally.<\/p> <p>  I have had and still have doubts about the mission in Mali because of the activity of the Malian army in the past and its still-questionable activities.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the mission in Western Sahara, it is good that the Irish are participating.  It is a pity it is not matched by the European Union's actions.  We need to see the referendum on independence in Western Sahara.  That is what the mission is meant to encourage but it has not happened to date.<\/p> <p>  The Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan is a NATO mission.<\/p><p>I do not think Irish troops should have any role to play in a mission that has any connection with NATO.

We should be very proud of them.<\/p> <p>  I reject any criticism that is levelled at us from anybody in respect of the work of our peacekeepers.  We are not and should never become associated with one group or another.  We are there for a given purpose, to keep peace.  It is important that this committee let its feelings be known.

I have seen it myself and the Minister of State has seen it as well.  They are wonderful and are highly respected throughout the world.  I reject any criticism that is levelled.  People should be reminded that they are peacekeepers.  They are not there to support one regime or another.

Overall, the report is very positive and very welcome.  As Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett has said, we are extremely proud of our soldiers who serve on overseas missions.  I have made the point several times that it is not a holiday they embark upon but very serious missions which pose a threat to life and safety and to their health and well-being.  They undertake this in the service of their country, maintaining peace and sometimes enforcing peace.  It is part of our international obligation to participate with other like-minded states in working towards global peace and ensuring security across the globe.  We have as important a role to play as any other country.  Despite our small geographic size, we have quite a large stature on the international stage and we certainly display that, particularly with our Defence Forces and our work overseas.  To see that we have sent some 65,000 members of the Defence Forces overseas since 1958 is quite remarkable and extremely impressive.  As citizens, we should all be very proud of this.<\/p> <p>  We are celebrating our 60th anniversary with UN peacekeeping missions and our 40th anniversary in UNIFIL.  These are milestones to be celebrated and to be proud of.  Has the Minister of State or anyone in his Department thought about how we might mark the occasion?  Might it be worth erecting some sort of statue or monument to recognise our UN veterans, in particular, and those who have served on UN missions overseas?  They have represented our country and our Defence Forces with distinction.  Given the year that it is in it and the fact that we have reached these incredible milestones, it would be a really worthwhile project to consider some sort of monument, perhaps somewhere here in the capital.  It could become a location for children in school, young people and citizens across the board who are very proud of their soldiers to come and learn about the history of Ireland's participation in UN projects.  It could form part of a visitor attraction.  We should think about doing this to try to acknowledge the work that has been done.  Ours is a unique achievement in this regard.  There are plenty of people who might come up with some design concepts.  I have seen one that included the blue helmet as part of the design, which I thought looked very impressive.  It would be instantly recognisable in what it represents.  The Minister of State might discuss this with his officials to see if it is something that could be achieved this year.<\/p> <p>  I thank our Defence Forces members.  There are nearly 600 members overseas at present.  I thank them and their families, who are without their loved ones for the period of the mission.

The families are suffering as well.  Young children and wives, partners and everybody else associated with our peacekeepers have a difficult job while the soldiers are serving abroad.

It is not easy but they have given and continue to give great service to our State.<\/p> <p>  I saw some political commentary at the weekend suggesting that some Fine Gael MEPs will be bringing out a radical policy document on neutrality and our defence policies.

Members will have seen the advance briefing notes provided by my Department on the two Votes, which summarise the main activities and priorities under each strategic programme.  For 2018, the overall gross estimate for the foreign affairs and trade group of Votes, which is Vote 27 and Vote 28, is &euro;738 million compared with &euro;715 million in 2017, which is an overall increase of &euro;23 million or 3.2%.<\/p> <p>  The Vote 28 priorities for 2018 include the passport reform programme, Brexit, Northern Ireland, provision for urgent capital building and security works in our missions abroad, continuing investment in the Department&rsquo;s global ICT network and addressing increased operating cost pressures abroad across the mission network, which is growing all the time.  I announced last October the decision by Government to open six new missions as part of the doubling our global footprint by 2025 initiative.  The Government&rsquo;s overarching ambition under this initiative is to ensure that Ireland is well-positioned to secure our national interests, particularly our economic interests, globally.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention is that a finalised plan will be ready for consideration by Government shortly.  Our expanded network will enhance Ireland&rsquo;s visibility globally, extend our influence and position us for trade and investment growth in new and existing markets.  It will also benefit our citizens travelling overseas and will involve reaching out to our diaspora and exploring new platforms for engagement.  It will also involve us in political debates and considerations in parts of the world, in particular the Middle East, which is the main reason we will be opening an embassy in Jordan.  <\/p> <p>  The programme structure for Vote 28 corresponds with the Department&rsquo;s strategy statement 2016-2019 and also mirrors the priorities set out in the foreign policy review document \"The Global Island: Ireland&rsquo;s Foreign Policy for a Changing World\".  It sets out the Department&rsquo;s work in five priority areas: supporting our people, engaging actively in the European Union, promoting our values, advancing our prosperity and strengthening our influence.  These correspond directly with expenditure programmes A to E in the 2018 Revised Estimates volume. <\/p> <p>  As has been proposed, I will now make some very short introductory comments on programme A to open the discussion.  When we complete our discussion of the programme, I will then take each of the following programmes in sequence, as the Chairman has asked me to do.<\/p> <p>  Programme A is to serve our people at home and abroad and to promote reconciliation and co-operation.  Work under this programme includes the effective delivery of passport and consular services for our citizens; supporting our emigrants and deepening engagement with our diaspora; sustaining peace and enhancing reconciliation and political progress in Northern Ireland; increasing North-South and British-Irish co-operation.  The amount allocated for current expenditure under programme A in 2018 is &euro;73.4 million compared with &euro;69.7 million in 2017, which is an increase of 7.4%.  The programme is about Irish citizens at home and abroad and covers a number of key priority areas for the Department.  Given the breadth of issues covered by this programme, I can only briefly touch on some of them in my short introduction.<\/p> <p>  Our consular services and consular assistance includes a group of people who many committee members are familiar with as a result of some of the cases they have raised.  Providing high-quality consular assistance and other consular services to Irish citizens at home and abroad remains a key priority of the Department.  The Department and our mission network responded to around 3,000 serious consular assistance cases in 2017, including 320 cases where Irish citizens died while overseas.  The year also saw the Department responding to a series of terrorist incidents in which Irish citizens were caught up including in London, Barcelona and Melbourne and major adverse weather crises in the US and the Caribbean.  A high priority for my Department is ensuring that the travelling Irish public is well-informed about risks and has access to accurate and relevant information and advice.  My Department&rsquo;s TravelWise smartphone app is helping to keep Irish citizens informed and safe while abroad and gives us an additional means of contact with citizens in the event of an emergency.  I encourage all members of the committee and indeed all public representatives to do everything possible to make the public aware of the TravelWise app.  If one uses it, one will see it is very pragmatic and useful.  Many people do not realise the extent to which our consular services are working every day or that we assisted in 3,000 cases last year.  If one thinks of 3,000 cases, one will realise how many are being assisted and supported every day.  The number is significant.  If one thinks of the 320 cases in which Irish citizens died abroad, many in accidents and very tragic circumstances, one gets an understanding that our consular services are involved in very difficult cases virtually every day and are working with families and individuals.  <\/p> <p>  The passport service issued 781,375 passports in 2017.  This represented an increase of over 6% on the previous year.  We expect the number of passport applications to continue to increase throughout 2018.  Applications in recent weeks are already showing increases of over 10% on last year.  Last year was the highest ever.  We will probably be 10% up on that this year.  They are dramatic numbers for our passport services to deal with.  There have been tens of thousands more applications.  The increase in demand is driven by a number of factors including a general increase in the number of Irish residents travelling abroad and a growing population.  There are about 54,000 more people in Ireland now than 12 months ago.<\/p><p>Our population is growing by at least 50,000 annually, which means over the next two decades there will be an extra million people, which is why we have a 2040 plan.  It also why the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is gearing up capacity around passport delivery and also consular services.  The increase in demand is driven by a number of factors.  There is a growing population and a significant rise in applications from Northern Ireland and the UK, driven by concerns around Brexit.  Last week&rsquo;s snow has impacted on demand also and the passport service is making every effort to deal with urgent cases.  The Passport Office had to close for a couple of days last week because people could not get to work.  We have sanctioned overtime this week to try to make up for the loss of time, as it has put a lot of stress on the system.  People have expectations of receiving their passports in a particular timeframe and we are trying to meet those expectations as best we can.<\/p><p> Our online passport application service was launched in March 2017 as part of the passport reform programme and offers the convenience of an online application system for adult applicants who wish to renew their passport, anywhere in the world.  It is planned to extend the online application facility to further categories of applicants, including first-time applicants and children.  The 2018 allocation includes a capital allocation of &euro;5.5 million in respect of the passport reform programme, which is money well spent.<\/p><p> I will now turn to the emigrant support programme and diaspora issues, which Deputy Darragh O'Brien in particular has raised with me several times.  Through the emigrant support programme budget of &euro;11.595 million annually, the Government provides funding to non-profit organisations and projects to support our most vulnerable emigrants abroad, to strengthen global Irish communities, and to facilitate the development of closer and more strategic links between Ireland and the global Irish.  This important budget supports the Government&rsquo;s vision of a vibrant, diverse global Irish community, connected to Ireland and to each other.<\/p><p> I commend the work of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cannon, in this important area in his role with special responsibility for the diaspora, and he will take any questions that members have on these matters.  He is doing a very good job in this area.<\/p><p> This programme deals with matters relating to Northern Ireland and delivers funding for projects to bolster peace and reconciliation on this island.  In the context of the current political challenges within Northern Ireland and the potential impact of Brexit, it will be no surprise that this area of work is a particular focus of my Department and a particular priority for me personally.<\/p><p> The interests of the island as a whole and protecting the gains of the peace process remain a priority for the Government in the Brexit negotiations.  The Government&rsquo;s priority is to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement and the overall balance of the settlement is not in any way disturbed by the UK&rsquo;s exit from the EU and to maintain the open and effectively invisible Border, which I think everyone, including those in Britain, wants.  Finding a way to do it, apart from using the backstop which has been agreed, will be the big challenge to these negotiations.  If that is not possible, the backstop is there and we will insist on using it, but our first priority is to work with the British Government to find an option A or options A and B that can deal with the Irish Border issues comprehensively as well as the east-west trade interest that Ireland has in the context of Brexit.<\/p><p> In 2017, the reconciliation fund made grants to more than 100 projects, supporting organisations across the community and voluntary sector, most based in Northern Ireland.  These groups are building meaningful links across communities, addressing the issues that are impacting on their lives, including sectarianism, and are working to create better understanding between people and traditions on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.  As we approach the 20th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, it is clear that this work is as important as ever.  In recognition of this, the Government has protected the reconciliation fund&rsquo;s budget in recent years and included a commitment in the Stormont House Agreement to maintain its annual budget at &euro;2.7 million.<\/p><p> I welcome any comments or questions from committee members on programme A.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#O00700","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1259,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.

That is fair enough.  We can reschedule it.  The Minister referred to the consular staff and the service in particular, and the work that is being done here in Dublin by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I want to record my appreciation of this.  Unfortunately, we all have instances where tragedies happen to families that we represent.  The professionalism, efficiency and compassion shown at very difficult times is exceptional.  It makes me proud and I mentioned it to the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, in the D&aacute;il.<\/p> <p>  I have raised the issue of the emigrant support programme.  I am disappointed that there is no increase there.  I note there were 490 applications, which is an increase from 319 different groups last year.  What is the approval rate?  It is a really good programme and I have seen it work.  I have seen it on visits to London, Chicago and other places.  It is very valuable and a very good link.  Will the Minister comment on why we have not increased the funding?<\/p> <p>  The passport service has had its funding increased 6% year on year up to the end of 2017.  It is very pressurised and I understand that.  Does the Minister feel he has the resources required to meet the increased demand which will continue to increase this year?  Last year well in excess of 10% of the passports issued were issued to people in the North and Britain, and that will increase further.<\/p> <p>  Will there be an additional requirement for the public services card to be used when applying for a new passport, whether it is a first passport or a renewal?  If there is a plan to do this, would it mean that there was a different requirement for those applying for passports outside the Republic of Ireland, in the North of Ireland or Britain?<\/p> <p>  Looking to the Brexit challenges, it is a shame that we cannot have a policy debate here now.  I was in Brussels the week before last and have met some of the additional staff who have been employed to deal with the challenges of Brexit in our permanent representation there.  They are doing a superb job.  Over this year and up to March 2019, every priority must be given to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure that it is staffed and resourced.  When Fianna F&aacute;il, the main Opposition party, has travelled abroad, it has given the Government approach on Brexit and Ireland's challenges with Europe and we are showing a united front.  I want to make sure that the Minister's Department is happy that it has the resources needed.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to official development assistance, ODA, in his opening remarks and the commitment to reach 0.7% of gross national income, GNI.  We have discussed this several times and all parties are in agreement.  The Minister said that he would publish a roadmap on this, which is something that I have called for.  When does he intend to do that?  It might be a question for the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon.<\/p> <p>  The Minister referred to the additional six missions which he announced will open and the doubling of the global footprint by 2025.  I was told that doubling does not necessarily mean the doubling of the number of embassies or consulates.<\/p><p>I have tried to grapple with that answer.  What does it mean and how many embassies or consulates will we reopen?  I welcome that the Minister has stated that he will publish a plan in that regard, which I presume will go to Cabinet to be agreed.  Will he publish that plan and the criteria on which the decisions are made?  I wish to know how we decide where embassies are opened.  I welcomed the openings of embassies in Bogota, Mumbai and elsewhere but it is important for us to know the rationale for opening embassies and what our priorities are in that regard.

I wish to start on a negative note, which will be of no surprise to the Minister.  Members yesterday received a briefing note from the Department which outlined that the overall gross Estimate for Votes 27 and 28 is &euro;738 million, as the Minister stated, but we have no independent analysis of how that money is being spent.  I have raised this issue with previous Ministers.  I am uncomfortable with the process in that regard.  It is a huge amount of money and we have a responsibility in terms of governance and oversight but do not even have a copy of the Minister's speech.  That is an appalling way to treat members of the committee.  I do not believe that the briefing note on the spend which has been given to members was only available from yesterday.  Members have been to other countries to discuss parliamentary oversight and so on and how that is carried out there.  We would be uncomfortable if we observed another country dealing with such a large amount of money in this fashion.  I have previously complained about the process in regard to the European defence fund and other breakdowns and that is similar to these huge sums we are being asked to approve under general headings without knowing the detail of how the money is being spent.  It is a fair point but I have laboured it long enough.<\/p> <p>  Like others, I thank the Minister's office, the Passport Office and the consular service for their efforts in regard to passport issues.  The Minister mentioned problems caused by the recent snowfall.  One person who could not get a passport because staff were unable to get into the office contacted me.  He was unable to join his family on their planned trip to New Zealand because he could not get a passport.  I do not know how one can legislate or provide for such situations.  I am sure others were also affected and I welcome that the Minister is contemplating additional overtime for staff and so on to deal with the backlog.  I welcome the &euro;5 million increase for the passport reform programme and I understand that big reforms have been undertaken in recent years.<\/p> <p>  Recent figures indicate that 53,715 people in the North applied for Irish passports in 2015, 67,582 in 2016 and 80,964 in 2017.  Staff in the Passport Office are doing a fantastic job under immense great pressure as a result of Brexit but the Government must acknowledge that increased demand.  Has money been set aside to establish a passport office in the North?  That could take the form of a dedicated citizen hub providing a place for passport applications but also a valuable resource in terms of assisting Irish citizens with their legal rights and entitlements in regard to Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#Q00300","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1272,"content":"<p>I will be very brief.  Like the previous speakers, I compliment and acknowledge the tremendous work of our offices and embassies abroad.  Some 320 Irish people died abroad last year.  When a Deputy gets a phone call informing him or her of such a death, he or she contacts the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, a representative of which contacts the family of the deceased within minutes.  That phone call from the Department to an individual who might have lost somebody abroad means an awful lot to the family and I wish to acknowledge that, as well as the tremendous work done by departmental officials abroad in dealing with serious injuries or deaths.  I recently dealt with a case where there were no Irish diplomatic, embassy or consular staff in a particular country but the embassy in a neighbouring country dealt with the incident very effectively and did tremendous work, which I wish to acknowledge.  As mentioned by previous speakers, the Minister plans to open six new missions abroad.  What are the criteria for choosing where to open those missions and what determines whether they will be full embassies or mission offices?<\/p> <p>  On passports, I compliment the staff of the Passport Office.  I have had occasion to contact the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, in a panic regarding passports.  However, 780,000 is a huge number of passports to be processed and the staff in the office must be complimented.  They have not seriously let anyone down in terms of providing a passport and I compliment them in that regard.  I welcome the Minister's comments in regard to being able to apply for a passport online from anywhere in the world.   That is a brilliant service as passports previously had to be sent to people's family homes.<\/p> <p>  One issue on which I hope the Chairman will give me latitude on is the possibility of allowing online applications for driving licences.  If one can apply for a passport online, why can one not do so for a driving licence?  I was contacted this week by a young lady living in New York whose driving licence has expired.  Unfortunately, she is there illegally and cannot do without a driving licence.  It is the first thing for which one is asked when stopped by a police officer.  There is to be a clampdown on people in the United States who do not have their driving licence with them when stopped by a police officer and such people are going to be pulled in.  I appreciate this point does not directly relate to the issues under discussion but I ask that the Government find a solution to that problem such that people abroad will be able to renew their driving licences online.  I am not saying that one should be able to make a first-time application online but the Government should come up with a solution to give Irish people living abroad a chance to renew their licence.  It is a huge issue which I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, has encountered while dealing with the Irish abroad.  I know of a case involving a young person who had to come home from Australia to renew his Irish driving licence and then fly back out again.  Will the Government please give some consideration to that issue, in honour of God?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#Q00400","speaker":"1313"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1273,"content":"<p>I am not sure God has much to do with it but-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#Q00500","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1274,"content":"<p>We are coming up to Easter and St. Patrick's Day.

Members know some of the demand is as a result of Brexit.  Is that spike expected to continue?  The online service is very successful.  Are there plans to roll out more online passport services?  It would be very helpful if there were.<\/p> <p>  As regards North-South co-operation and the funding provided in that regard, the same funding is to be provided in 2018 as was allocated in 2017.  As all members know, there are difficulties in communities in Northern Ireland.  That programme has been very successful over the years in helping some of the most disadvantaged communities, and those of us who have regular interaction with both communities and traditions in Northern Ireland know that such funding can be critical in assisting a regeneration of communities and that it is an area that needs additional attention.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#Q00800","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1277,"content":"<p>I will address the questions in reverse order.  I am very aware of the Chair's interest in Northern Ireland and community relations there.  One of the reasons we are not reducing funding which supports community engagement and reconciliation through a series of community and civic-led projects in Northern Ireland in spite of the fact that we are two decades after the Good Friday Agreement is that we recognise there is still much work to do in that regard.  In the context of some of the negotiations and discussions in our attempts to try to re-establish an Executive in Northern Ireland, we considered increasing funding for some minority Border communities in particular.  We wished to send out a very strong signal that both Governments are very anxious to recognise diversity and minority groups living on both sides of the Border.<\/p><p>If anything, we might see slight increases in funding.  I assure the committee that I do not envisage any reductions.<\/p><p> With regard to Deputy Grealish's point, the online passport service has been an extraordinary success.  Approximately 40% of people applying to renew are doing so online and we think that we can get that number up much higher than 50%.  We are solely confining the service to those over the age of 18 but, hopefully, in the future the service will be available for children.  It makes sense that people should be able to apply for a driver's licence online.  My understanding is that is likely to be the case after October.  It would be a little more complicated to apply online from abroad for a licence.  I am informed by the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, that under EU law passports can only be sent to an address in the EU.  If someone is in Sydney, it is hard to apply online and have an Irish passport sent to Australia but if he or she is returning home and applies for a passport, he or she should be able to update it online.<\/p><p> Members may had have an opportunity to debate the Indecon report and the diaspora generally in the D&aacute;il earlier.  Indecon has done good work on the barriers facing returning emigrants in a series of areas, some of which have been raised by members in the past, including driver's licence applications, opening of bank accounts, credit ratings, discrimination in respect of life and health insurance, accessing education and social housing lists and so on.  The report is a good basis for Government consideration.  The Minister of State will bring a set of recommendations to Government in a few months but significant cross-departmental co-ordination will be necessary to do that because different Departments will need to provide solutions.  Hopefully, we will have something for Government by the end of May.  If not, it will certainly happen before the summer recess.  However, we have a set a target of the end of May.<\/p><p> Deputy Crowe said he would have liked more information to have been provided before the meeting and that is a fair criticism.  When I have gone through the Estimates process previously, more detail was available to the committee earlier.  We will look at that and try to correct that for next year.  If we are to have a proper Estimates process, members need time to digest the detail of where and how we are spending money.  I will try to make sure that is improved for the next occasion.<\/p><p> With regard to whether a passport office is needed in Northern Ireland, even with the dramatic increase in online applications and the increase in applications from Northern Ireland, in particular, the system is working well and I am not sure that we need to open a physical office in the North to respond to, and deliver on, the expectations and the aspirations of those seeking Irish passports there.  We will keep this under review.  I do not want an unnecessary outlay of capital to open new offices when we provide a good service online.<\/p><p> Deputy O'Sullivan and a number of others asked about how we choose the cities and countries for new missions.  One of the big priorities is new trade opportunities.  That is partially a response to Brexit but even if that was not taking place, there are exciting markets that Irish companies are not part of to the extent that they should be.  The obvious place is to start is countries that have trade agreements with the EU.  That is why we considered Latin America.  There are currently trade agreements in place with both Chile and Colombia.  We have a strong historical relationship with both countries, which few Irish people know much about.  However, I suspect some members do.  We have also had an active interest and involvement through some Irish personalities in the Colombian peace process, which is deeply appreciated in Colombia when I speak to politicians there.  We looked on Bogota and Santiago as two cities with significant populations in reasonably stable countries.  They have similar business traditions to Ireland, particularly in respect of agrifood and technology.  Both economies are expanding and they are seeking EU partners for trade opportunities.  There were many reasons for looking to both countries.  Our diplomatic representation in South America generally is light but it is particularly light in Latin America.  If we are serious about building engagement and trade opportunities with Colombia, it is not a runner to cover the country from Mexico.  These are two exciting opportunities.<\/p><p> We probably should have opened an embassy in New Zealand a long time ago.  There are large numbers of Irish people there and they are involved in the construction industry, in particular.  There are many young Irish students there as well.  We have a huge amount in common with the country.  It has a significant agrifood and dairy industry.  We compete with New Zealand in many markets but we also share a great deal of research and ambition.  When one considers the size of our economies and how they are shaped, New Zealand and Ireland have a great deal in common and, therefore, we were anxious that opening an embassy there would be an early decision.<\/p><p> With regard to Vancouver, CETA is the new trade agreement with Canada.  We have an embassy in Toronto but Toronto is as close to Dublin as it is to Vancouver.  Canada is a massive country and the Irish population there is significant, as it always has been.  The Irish influence on Canada is enormous but a significant trading opportunity exists and we are starting to develop that.  There have been 12 ministerial visits to the country in 13 months.  The political engagement has been undertaken to support this expanding footprint.  A consulate will open on the west coast because we have the embassy in Toronto but essentially that is similar to opening a second embassy.  We do not need an embassy in Mumbai to exploit trading opportunities because we have one in India.  However, Mumbai is a major commercial capital in which Ireland needs to have a presence and that is why we are opening a consulate in the city.<\/p><p> We have also decided to open an embassy in Amman, Jordan, for different reasons.  Our global footprint is not all about economics and trade; it is also about ensuring Ireland plays a role and is relevant in political decision-making, human rights advocacy and overseas aid.  We spend significant amounts supporting refugees and refugee camps in Jordan.  Most of the refugees are Syrian but some are from Palestine.  I welcome the Palestinian ambassador to the Gallery.  He is always welcome.  It is not a secret that the Government and I want to increase the priority of the Israeli-Palestinian relationship and Ireland's involvement in trying to advocate for progress in that area.  One of the linked decisions to that increased priority is to open an embassy in Amman.  There will be some limited trade opportunities as well.  Jordan is a stable country and there will be opportunities in the agrifood sector, in particular.<\/p><p> There will be other announcements.<\/p><p>When we bring a plan to Government, it will not involve naming every embassy and consulate we will open between now and 2025, but it certainly will specifically name embassies and consulates we would like to open in 2019, after the list the committee has heard for this year, and there will be reasons for this.  There are parts of the world where Ireland has a very light diplomatic presence.  North Africa is a good example, as is west Africa.  There are also countries such as Ukraine and Serbia where the vast majority of EU member states have embassies and we do not.  We need to understand the pressures and political considerations coming from the east as well as the concerns of western European countries.<\/p><p> I do not think there will be any huge surprises here.  There are obvious gaps we are filling.  The early decisions in terms of expanding our footprint are about the low hanging fruit and the obvious areas where Ireland, now that we can afford to, is looking to ensure we have a presence, never mind increasing a presence.  Then, of course, we will build on an existing presence in countries that are strategically important for us.  It will not be a surprise to people that we will be beefing up our teams in Paris and Berlin.  Potentially in the future, we will also look at consulates in terms of having a secondary presence in markets such as France and Germany, and looking at places such as Munich and Lyon to see whether Ireland needs to increase its presence there.  There is also Britain post-Brexit in terms of ensuring Ireland has the presence we need to maintain the closeness we have built up over the past 20 years.  Over time, we will look at cities such as Cardiff and some English cities.  I am not announcing that we are doing this now.  I am just saying this is the type of thinking that guides the global footprint.<\/p><p> To answer Deputy Darragh O'Brien's question on whether doubling the global footprint means doubling the number of embassies we have globally, we have approximately 80 missions abroad at present, with 60 embassies and the rest are consulates.  I do not think we will be announcing another 80 in the next seven years.  When we speak about doubling our global footprint, we are speaking about doubling Ireland's reach and presence abroad, using all of the tools we have available to do so.  Some of this means embassies and consulates and some of it will be using arts and culture more proactively.  Some of it will be more proactively reaching out to our diaspora.  Some of it will be dramatically increasing, in my view, our overseas aid development budgets, and the increased reach that comes with this, in terms of the opportunities that come from it.  Some of it will be using technology to reach out more successfully to ensure there is an Irish voice commenting on world affairs in parts of the world where there is little or no Irish intelligence or voice at present.  There are many ways in which we can use the arms of the State and the talent that we have in Ireland in the public and private sectors, through our diaspora and through the infrastructure of the State, to be able to dramatically increase Ireland's reach globally.  This is what the global footprint project is all about.  I apologise for going on a bit about it, but it is important to give a detailed explanation about it.<\/p><p> Of course there is an opportunity for new groups in Northern Ireland with new thinking to get funding.  There is an application process they can follow and we will put in place an assessment process that is impartial in terms of support.  I will let my colleague answer the question on the emigrant support programme; I do not want to hog the whole thing.<\/p><p> With regard to the question on passports, I expect we will see an increase in passport numbers for some years to come.  Ireland's population will continue to grow.  If anything, the estimates in the 2040 plan are conservative.  In the next two decades we could see closer to 1.5 million more people in Ireland rather than 1 million, but let us wait and see.  The Irish proposition is very attractive, and at least half of the increased population will be people who will not have been born in Ireland, and this is a very good thing.  This is not just a guesstimate by me randomly at the table.  It is from the conversations we had when we put together the 2040 plan in terms of trying to understand what drives population growth and where it is likely to come from.<\/p><p> I will leave it to the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, to deal with overseas development aid in more detail, but if there is one thing he and I want to do while we are in this Department it is to leave behind a total change in direction in terms of Ireland's contribution to overseas aid.  Developed countries such as Ireland have an obligation not just to give what they can and decide on this year on year, where overseas development aid has to compete with health care, education and all of the other issues, but actually to make much more fundamental commitments that a certain percentage of wealth in a country would be assigned to help people with little or nothing in various parts of the world involved in conflict and desperately tragic and exposed circumstances.  We would like to set Ireland on a course that is very clear.  This requires a financial commitment from the Government over time to get to where we promised we would be, which is to reach 0.7% of gross national income in Ireland.  This will take some time because we are a little above 0.3% at present.  It is important to be realistic in terms of what is possible, but I would like us to have a very ambitious plan in this regard.  We are working to get a plan together that I can bring to the Government soon.  I will be very happy to come before the committee again to talk about this once it is done.  The work of the committee on assessing our overseas aid programme and the report it published is very helpful in this regard.  We will also launch a White Paper process on the overseas aid development programme, which I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, will speak about.  Obviously we want the continuing input from all political parties and the committee.  I have spoken about many other areas, but the questions strayed outside programme A so I hope we will be a lot quicker on programmes B, C, D and E.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#Q00900","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1280,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#S00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1281,"content":"<p>There will be disappointment in some countries they will not get an embassy or consulate.

It is being led by the Taoiseach's Department, but it is supported by mine.<\/p><p> On the public services card, since 29 March 2016 the Passport Office has required all first-time applicants aged 18 years and over who are resident in Ireland to submit a copy of their public services card.  It is not anything new and also applies to a small number of adult passport applicants whose passports were issued before 1 January 2006 and reported as lost, stolen or damaged.  The measure has been an important step in providing protection against fraud and identity theft and upholding the integrity of the Irish passport.  All passport applications from Irish citizens will continue to be subject to rigorous identification and entitlement checks.  The introduction of the PSC requirement has allowed the Passport Office to dispense with the requirements to supply certain additional documentation and reduces the overall volume of documentation Irish citizens must submit when applying for a passport.  The purpose of the public services card has been twisted in the political debate, but it tries to create a more efficient system to provide services for people quickly and with the minimum amount of bureaucracy.<\/p><p> On 17 July 2017 the Government agreed that, by the fourth quarter of this year, all adult applicants resident in the State who wished to renew their passport would require a public services card.  We recognise that many changes are happening in passport delivery.  We were asked to introduce the change at the start of this year, but I said that was not viable as too much was going on in the Passport Office in terms of efficiency improvements.  By the end of the year, however, we will I hope be able to introduce the requirement which we think makes sense from the point of view of efficiency.  <\/p><p> The Deputy also asked about passport applications from abroad.  The public services card requirement does not and will not apply to Irish citizens who are normally resident outside the State.  They include people living in Northern Ireland.<\/p><p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan asked about choosing embassies and countries.  One cannot choose countries solely on the basis of being comfortable with everything they do.  There are question marks against Iran, for example, but many people would be able to make a coherent case for opening an embassy there at some stage in the future, as practically every European country has an embassy there.  There are challenges in post-conflict Colombia, but it is trying to build a stable society and economy, in which task we want to be able to support it.  Once one moves beyond comfortable territory such as with EU member states which all apply the same rules and into the Arab world, North Africa and Latin America one will have challenges, but having an embassy in a country gives us a say and an opportunity to have conversations we would otherwise not have.  They may be on human rights issues or may help us to better understand the challenges certain countries face.  Morocco has an embassy here.  We will have to look at reciprocating in the future because we do not currently have any embassy in that part of Africa.  It does not mean that we agree with Morocco on everything, but creating relationships through proper diplomatic channels allows us to extend our reach and become relevant in political debates in different parts of the world.  It is easy to refer to problems in countries in other parts of the world which have a different history from ours, but the point in expanding our global footprint is to move out of our comfort zone and create new friendships and partnerships.  On the back of this there will be trading opportunities for Irish businesses and businesses that wish to use Ireland as a gateway to the European Union.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#S00700","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1287,"content":"<p>Deputy Darragh O'Brien asked the Minister of State a question about the emigrant support programme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#T00200","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1288,"content":"<p>As the T&aacute;naiste said, the diaspora will play a critical role in expanding our global footprint.

Equally, the programme supports Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the European Union's global engagement on peace, security, trade and development, as well as security in the wider European region.<\/p> <p>  The allocation for the programme in 2018 is &euro;27.3 million, compared with a figure of &euro;22.3 million in 2017.  It represents an increase of &euro;5 million or 17.5%, reflecting the top priority attached to Brexit and our place in Europe.  I can go through in some detail where the money will go.  We have had to gear up significantly for the challenge of Brexit and I hope members are seeing the results in how Ireland is negotiating.  It has meant more people, infrastructure, time and travel to Brussels.  We are also gearing up to ensure Ireland will have its say in the debate on the future of Europe.  All of these tasks require more resources and that, essentially, is what is happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#U00500","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1300,"content":"<p>There is much in this programme which is crucial.

At the appropriate time I would like us to come back to the element of how we are approaching not just the negotiations but also the future of Europe piece.

As members know, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, is organising public meetings throughout the country, of which she has had a series.  I believe she is in Letterkenny today.  One of the problems with debates such as that on the future of Europe is that they often take place in a bubble in which like-minded people speak to each other about Ireland's commitment to the European Union and its future.  When decisions are made on the back of some of these debates, the public responds in a way that suggests they were never told that the European Union was moving in that direction.  It is one of the reasons we sometimes see disenchantment with how decisions are taken at a European level within European institutions and so on.<\/p> <p>  We know exactly what is going on in the debate on the future of Europe and want to try to include as many people as we can to ensure all stakeholders will have an opportunity to have an impact on whether a non-governmental organisation wants to extend the European Union's levels of ambitions on the continent of Africa, in the Middle East, in the areas of common security and defence, terrorism and radicalisation or the internal market for banking and financial services.  All of these issues are being debated in the context of where the European Union is going and what it will look like in five and ten years's time.  If we do not put resources in place to ensure there is a proper conversation taking place nationally, it will not happen and we would then be accused, after decisions are made, of having the elites make decisions.  People will say they were never consulted.  As a result of the lessons learned in the past, we are trying to address that issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, is doing a really good job in that respect, although it is difficult to generate much interest in the debate on the future of Europe when much of the debate is dominated by Brexit because of the tensions or drama surrounding the negotiations.  We have seen a significant increase in percentage terms in the section, but it is still a relatively modest amount of money, given the importance of the issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#U00800","speaker":"1286"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1303,"content":"<p>Shall we proceed to programme C?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#U00900","speaker":"1270"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1304,"content":"<p>Programme C covers the Department's contribution to a more just world through the promotion and protection of human rights internationally and a more secure world based on a stable and secure rules-based international environment.

My Department&rsquo;s commitment to promoting international peace, security and human rights is channelled through programme C, for which there is a total allocation of &euro;51.6 million in 2018, compared with a figure of &euro;55.8 million in 2017, representing a reduction of &euro;4.8 million which is due to reduced projected contributions to international organisations.  It should be noted, however, that the allocation for administration under the programme has increased by just over &euro;500,000.  Most of the expenditure under the programme relates to Ireland's mandatory contributions to international organisations of which we are a member, including the United Nations.

The contributions that we make to the UN each year are mandatory contributions and they fluctuate slightly.  For example, a big part of UN expenditure is on peacekeeping operations.  It is a multi-billion euro expenditure programme.  Obviously, Ireland benefits from that in the context of our interest in UN peacekeeping operations, such as UNIFIL and UNDOF.  Those operations are all funded through UN funds to which Ireland makes a contribution.<\/p> <p>  There is concern within the UN generally that were the US to reduce its funding to the UN significantly in percentage terms, given the US provides nearly 40% of funding to the UN and it is a significant funder, it would have major consequences.  There is a reform programme under way, that the US is buying into and supporting, in respect of value for money and ensuring there is no duplication to try to break down some of the silos in the UN that undoubtedly need to be challenged.  We need to ensure, however, that the output in the form of the results the UN achieves in helping some of the most vulnerable people in the world is not reduced in the effort to ensure efficiency and value for money.  Unfortunately, there are more conflicts and crises for the UN to deal with than we have seen for many years.  For a start, there are multiple famines, which are inexcusable in this day and age, and for the most part are preventable if there is intervention at the right time.<\/p> <p>  Potential reductions by the US in contributions to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, are a major concern for Ireland and for many other countries.  UNRWA is the UN organisation that essentially supports Palestinian refugees in the West Bank, Gaza, Jordan and Lebanon.  Historically, the US is a big funder of UNRWA.  I have visited UNRWA schools within Palestinian territories, as I am sure have members of this committee.  They are impressive and effective ways of educating young Palestinians, who, by the way, are really well educated generally, which is why it is such a tragedy that we cannot allow a state of Palestine to grow and build sustainably for itself.  The immediate concern - I will stand corrected on this - is that between 70% and 80% of the population in Gaza are reliant in some way or other on UNRWA support through health care, education or food supports.  Consequently, because the US is a very significant funder a significant reduction would have significant consequences.  This is so much the case that Ireland will be participating, as will many other countries, in a funding conference for UNRWA, led by Sweden and Jordan, which will be held in Rome in a few weeks' time.  I think I am right on that detail - I will happily stand corrected if I am not - but I think that is where it is happening.<\/p> <p>  Incidentally, this year we have already committed &euro;5 million to UNRWA.  I signed off on that a few weeks ago.  We would encourage other countries to do the same.  Most important, we would encourage - I have directly asked - the US to reconsider its decision to reduce funding for UNRWA.  Undoubtedly, in the medium term, there is reform required of the role that UNRWA plays because people should not be refugees forever.  Many Palestinian refugees, unfortunately for them and their families, have been refugees for a lifetime.  There is a need for a transition in time from a refugee organisation to a support organisation that can allow a Palestinian government to be able to provide for health care and education in its own territories for its own people.<\/p><p>However, that is no consolation to a parent who has a child in a UNRWA school today or a woman who is relying on a UNRWA health care clinic, living in very difficult conditions in Gaza or in any of the other refugee camps today.  I am sorry about the detail on the UNRWA, but I feel strongly about it.<\/p><p> Finally, I was asked a specific question on the UN Security Council campaign.  Our UN Security Council campaign is currently being managed within existing resources but before the election in 2020 an extra spend undoubtedly will be required, which we will have to factor into our budget.  With respect to our last UN Security Council campaign in 2000, additional staffing needs at that time were supplied by redeployment and the creation of temporary posts.  Approximately &euro;1.5 million was allocated to cover additional costs relating to that campaign.  We will probably spend a little more than that this time.  If Ireland wants to be at the table where major decisions are taken on global issues, which is the UN Security Council, it must win a very competitive campaign process.  There are two places available and three countries are going for those places, namely, Ireland, Norway and Canada.  We happen to be competing with two very influential countries in the UN structure.  It is not an easy task but we are well placed to be able to be in the top two if we focus on a well run campaign, which is what we are trying to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#V00800","speaker":"1286","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1314,"content":"<p>I have a question about the destruction of UNRWA-funded and Irish Aid-funded schools in the West Bank.

Vote 27 funds over 70% of Ireland&rsquo;s official development assistance, ODA, programme, better known to the public as Irish Aid.  The Vote provides the funding necessary to deliver on the Department's high level goal to work towards a fairer, more just, secure and sustainable world.<\/p> <p>  This year the Government has provided just over &euro;707 million for ODA, an increase of &euro;26 million on last year's allocation.  This increased allocation builds on the momentum started in 2016 of increasing budget allocations to ODA in an incremental, measured and sustainable way.  Some &euro;500 million of the total will be managed through my Department while the remainder, an estimated &euro;207 million, will be managed through other Departments and Ireland's share of the EU development co-operation budget.  The sum of &euro;707 million is a significant investment on behalf of the Irish taxpayer and represents a clear demonstration of the Government's firm commitment to the aid programme and to our stated position of increasing allocations as economic conditions permit.<\/p><p>In line with aspirations that are shared with this committee we remain committed to making incremental, sustainable and manageable progress towards achieving the 0.7% UN target by 2030, over the period of the sustainable development goals.  This progress will build on Ireland's recognised role as a reliable and effective partner in contributing to ending global poverty and hunger, and in providing flexible humanitarian assistance to those most in need.<\/p><p> The committee will appreciate that reaching the 0.7% target will involve significant increases to the official development assistance, ODA, budget.  Currently Ireland spends roughly 0.3% of gross national income, GNI, on ODA.  The projected growth in aid budgets to match this ambition will be substantial and will require careful planning and consultation with other Departments and stakeholders, including Irish citizens and civil society organisations and, importantly, this committee.<\/p><p> I acknowledge the recent review undertaken by the committee.  I was delighted to attend the presentation of the review.  I reiterate that the conclusions and recommendations of that report will form a key input to the development of a new White Paper on international development co-operation.  One of my Department&rsquo;s key objectives this year is to produce a new White Paper on international development co-operation.  This will inform an ambitious pathway towards making greater but sustainable progress on the UN target.<\/p><p> The international development context has evolved significantly over the past five years.  The White Paper will build on our existing aid programme and will allow us to take stock of the implications of a fast-changing global environment and prioritise our role in fulfilling the ambitious international development policy agenda.  Internal preparations and analysis are already under way for the White Paper.  The process to develop the new policy will include a period of consultation from March to May across Government and with the public, following Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines.  It is intended that the new policy will be produced by the end of July 2018 at the earliest.<\/p><p> I am passionate about Ireland&rsquo;s development co-operation programme and in making sure that we excel in how we target and deliver our resources for maximum impact.  Ireland and the Irish people can be very proud of our country&rsquo;s impact.  Any member who has travelled abroad would certainly echo that sentiment.  We are reducing inequality, poverty and hunger.  We bring our authentic experience as a people to this work as we continue delivering a world class programme, aimed at some of the world&rsquo;s most vulnerable and marginalised people, helping to save lives, build livelihoods and bring lifesaving humanitarian assistance to those most in need and in times of crisis.  I welcome comments and questions from committee members.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#W02400","speaker":"1241","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1338,"content":"<p>We have discussed this before and I welcome the stated commitment to get back on track to reach the 0.7% target.  I know that there is a real opportunity now to seize the goodwill that is there and to seize the political consensus, certainly through this committee, which was evident at the report launch.  It is a valuable report.  When the Minister of State is working on the White Paper he could, while not rewriting it, use the committee's report as a basis.  It is very important that we publish the roadmap, get political agreement on it, which I believe the Minister of State will get, and show it in euro and cents.  We should not lose the opportunity right now to seize the goodwill to create that momentum.  I understand that there were economic reasons the momentum slowed, but as we are moving forward, if we can start to show a real leap forward, it will mean a significant increase in one year to the next if we are to catch up in real terms.  This is not from a selfish perspective.  The T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State have already referred to the UN Security Council and the credibility that Ireland has abroad.  I absolutely encourage the Minister of State to do this.<\/p> <p>  I reiterate my concerns around the third country arrangements and Ireland's funding of certain projects alongside the EU.  I am very uncomfortable with the EU-Turkey arrangement.  There are 15 or 16 other arrangements that the EU have been working on also which, as a European Union member state, Ireland is also part of.  There is one arrangement for resettling refugees back to Afghanistan.  There seems to be a bit of a carrot and stick approach at an EU level, not from Ireland, that unless conditions are adhered to and figures for repatriation happen, there will be a question over the annual action programmes, AAPs.  When addressing the White Paper, I encourage the Minister of State to look afresh at entering into these arrangements.  Can Ireland dissent from them?  I believe we can.  I do not believe Ireland should be going down that route.  Where it makes sense for member states to pool resources, third country arrangements can be done, but we must be ultra-careful when it applies to refugee resettlement especially.  I could not get a full answer on an absolute assurance that none of the money Ireland puts into that programme has gone on security measures as opposed to welfare for the person who is the refugee.  Ireland carefully guards it reputation.  I am, however, concerned about those third country arrangements, and I wanted to flag it here.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#X00200","speaker":"1228"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1339,"content":"<p>I have a query about subhead A5.

With regard to A3 and the Africa section, I understand the focus is on the least developed countries, LDCs.  Ireland met the UN target of spending at least 0.15% of its GNI on overseas development to LDCs in 2015.  This does not seem to have happened in 2017.  Will the Minister of State confirm that the target will be met in 2018?<\/p> <p>  Do the figures include any funding for new EU policies in Africa that are focused on migration or does it come under the European Development Fund, EDF?  Again, this is deeply concerning and is an instrument of moving EU aid way from what I believe is genuine and sustainable development in favour of migration control, securitisation and the private sector in donor countries.<\/p> <p>  Section A4 is fine.  I have a concern about the provision in subhead A5 of &euro;5 million for the EU-Turkey deal.  As other members have said, we have repeatedly stated our concern about and deep opposition to this deal.  I believe it hampers the human rights of refugees and is effectively a bribe to Erdoan's autocratic regime.  I also wish to flag the &euro;45.6 million due to be spent on the EDF.  Many members have raised this issue and are concerned about accountability for multilateral spending.  I am thankful that we have had some meetings on the issue, and some of our concerns have been clarified.  I am, however, concerned that the EDF is largely unaccountable and that Ireland does not have enough influence to ensure that its work is in line with Ireland's priorities.  If, for example, we give money to the EDF, how can we say that 100% of Ireland's ODA is untied?  The EDF has openly admitted that EU aid is partially tied.  There is a contradiction there.  It is probably a debate for another day but I have concerns about it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#X00500","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1342,"content":"<p>The sum of &euro;707 million is a lot of money but I welcome the increase of &euro;26 million, especially when one goes abroad, particularly on the most recent visit to Malawi and Mozambique, and one sees the programmes in place to help the most vulnerable people in the world.  I compliment our staff out there.  I would like to see a lot more co-operation between nations to get better value for the money.  This was evident in the Mozambique education programme administrated by the Irish office there.  They have said that if they had more staff, they could do a lot more.  They led the education programme in that country and I compliment the staff on that.<\/p> <p>  I have highlighted previously, and the T&aacute;naiste has spoken about, the occupied Palestinian territories and the cut the United States of America has brought in.  The T&aacute;naiste has said an extra &euro;5 million is allocated towards the occupied Palestinian territories.  I welcome this.  The world should come around to supporting the Palestinian people and putting extreme pressure on the United States of America to continue providing the aid towards that.<\/p> <p>  The briefing document on Irish Aid lists all the money allocated to various countries.  In addition, &euro;10 million has been allocated to the south-east Asia region programme, mainly in favour of Vietnam.

What measures are being put in place to ensure that policy coherence can be achieved?  We referred to it on the day of the launch.<\/p> <p>  Colleagues have mentioned concern over the balance between bilateral and multilateral programmes.  We understand we need to be involved in some multilateral programmes, but there is a strong view on the value of our bilateral programmes.<\/p> <p>  The final matter is something we all need to address.  On the day we launched the report, we referred to communicating the value of the good work done by Irish Aid to the citizens at large.  We could all more in that respect.

We need to be cognisant that it is an increase of approximately &euro;100 million to &euro;130 million per annum, moving from &euro;707 million at the moment to about &euro;2.5 billion by 2030.  As Deputy Darragh O'Brien pointed out, the political support is already apparent from everyone in this room and from the political parties.  I would argue that the public is equally supportive.  Much of that public support stems from our history as a people.  Reflecting on our history, we feel the need to reach out to communities and countries across the world in a spirit of solidarity and to respect that many countries are embarking on a journey upon which we embarked more than 100 years ago.<\/p> <p>  We have garnered considerable experience from that, particularly in the area of education.  We have travelled a considerable journey in the past 50 years following the landmark decision by Donogh O'Malley in 1966.  When I attended a pledging conference for education in Africa held in Dakar recently, it was wonderful to be able to reflect upon that experience and to commit to &euro;25 million, to double our commitment to the global partnership for education over the next three years to reflect our history of having an educational landscape that changed Irish society and the Irish economy forever.  It is an opportune time.<\/p> <p>  I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy O'Brien that we will need to nail down that definitive, staged, incremental move.  Ultimately, that will happen as part of the White Paper process and members of the committee will have a critical role to play in that.  I agree with the Cathaoirleach that the committee's report is a fantastic starting point to develop the White Paper strategy in coming months and it will feature heavily in that.<\/p> <p>  I had expected many of the members to voice concerns over Turkey.  The resources we are providing in Turkey are not being used in any context for either security measures or border control.  I want to make that clear.  Of the &euro;3 billion committed to programming under the facility, &euro;60 million or 2% has been committed to the Turkish Directorate General of Migration Management to support migrants upon their return to Turkey, covering food, health care, transport and accommodation expenses.  Some &euro;20 million or 0.67% has been committed to the International Organization for Migration for its work in enhancing the capacity of the Turkish coastguard to carry our search and rescue operations in an effective manner.  I want to make clear that none of our resources are being used for any security or border control matters.  In addition to our active participation in the steering committee, Ireland has placed an officer from the development co-operation division of the Department in our embassy in Ankara with the specific brief to cover the humanitarian response to the Syrian crisis, including that facility for refugees in Turkey.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe spoke about oversight in general and in particular relating to the European Development Fund, EDF.  EU development assistance, including the EDF, is subject to various forms of rigorous monitoring and evaluation by a number of separate bodies: the European Court of Auditors, the EU's results-oriented monitoring and external independent review system, the EU's own evaluation unit, ultimately the European Parliament, and member states, obviously including Ireland.  There is a significant audit and oversight structure in place to ensure that every cent we contribute to that is spent wisely and effectively.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Crowe also asked about the untied aspect.  I can confirm that all the funds we channel through the European Union are used solely and uniquely for untied aid.  That is a stipulation we include in any commitment we make.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#Y00200","speaker":"1241"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1345,"content":"<p>What about the least developed countries in Africa and meeting the target?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FDS2018030800002#Y00300","speaker":"1309"},{"type":"speech","time":1520517600,"counter":1346,"content":"<p>We were just below the target in 2017, but overall our <i>per capita <\/i>contribution compared with other EU member states means we are one of the top contributors on a <i>per capita <\/i>basis.

Prior to the Supreme Court decision in the Setanta case, the industry, through the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, would be responsible to meet not only all the motor third-party liabilities, MTPLs, of Setanta but also for any other company which may enter liquidation.  Clearly, the circumstances where a prudent company would be responsible for the liabilities of a less prudent competitor was a classic example of market failure.<br\/><br\/>Insurance Ireland has always been of the view that in order to maintain the orderly functioning of the motor insurance market in Ireland it is vital that certainty exists around the annual contribution rate.  Such certainty is the key feature of both the UK and French markets.  In the UK, there is a monetary limit to the contributions which the sector is required to meet in any given trading year.  In France, an <i>ex-ante <\/i>contribution is collected in advance of any liquidation event.  This rate does not change from year to year and therefore it also provides the certainty to which I referred earlier.<br\/><br\/>The proposed methodology in the general scheme is in line with international norms of consumer protection and as such is to be welcomed.  Furthermore, we accept that it is prudent to begin the collections at a level of 2% of motor gross written premium and to taper this back as the fund is built up to an appropriate size.  The collection of the fund is also equitable because the entire market would be required to contribute based on the previous years motor gross written premium.  Insurance Ireland agrees with the general direction of the general scheme that the best manner to avoid the complications and unnecessary uncertainty which arose as a result of the Setanta liquidation is to collect an ex-ante contribution for all insurers writing motor business in Ireland.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#D01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1371,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Thompson.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#D01500","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1372,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Thompson and Mr. Jackson for their attendance and for the opening statement.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Thompson could summarise his understanding of how the reformed system that will be brought about when the general scheme of the Bill is eventually enacted will work in practice in the event of another insurance collapse in Ireland and how will that be different from the saga we have had over the past four years following the Setanta collapse?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#D01600","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1373,"content":"<p>First, I will provide a bit of context in terms of how we got to where we got to with the Setanta situation.  If one looks at the current insurance legislation, I suppose the anomaly reaches back to the 1964 Insurance Act which was amended in 2011.  Under that Act, if a company - up until Setanta - went into administration, 100% would be paid through the ICF.  Unfortunately, with Setanta, when it was put into liquidation by the Maltese regulator, it was the first time a liquidation had occurred within the State and an anomaly had appeared within the 1964 Act where in such cases one had a cap in terms of what could be claimed through the ICF, namely the lesser of 65% or up to &euro;825,000.  In short, unfortunately, that meant we had a liability of 35% for the claimants.<\/p> <p>  The proposed amendments to the Act would bring liquidation in line for compensation in relation to administration.  They also propose a pre-funding mechanism to build a fund up to a maximum of &euro;200 million through a 2% collection on gross written premium for market participants in the previous year.  In addition, should the fund be called upon before an adequate amount could be built up within that fund, the Insurance Compensation Fund, ICF, would backstop it until the ICF could be paid through the pre-contributions of the industry.  There is also provision within the proposed general scheme that an extra 1% could be called upon in extraordinary cases.<\/p> <p>  The pre-funding mechanism, in terms of getting this lump sum or funding together, will bring stability to the market in that policyholders who are affected by such liquidations in the future would have moneys to call upon.   From an industry point of view, it brings certainly in terms of the contribution that will have to be made to the fund, and which is in line with international practice.  Under the French model, for example, they collect a 1.1% levy from policyholders and the industry makes a 1% contribution as well until they build the fund up.  That is our view of it.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#D01700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1374,"content":"<p>In essence, in the event of a further collapse, instead of this 35% shortfall, the ICF will meet 100% of the cost of outstanding claims-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#D01800","speaker":"1223"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1375,"content":"<p>Correct.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#D01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Kevin Thompson"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1376,"content":"<p>-----and that will be funded by the levy.

We have also argued that the level of personal injury claim costs, as borne out by independent facts, is out of kilter with costs in other jurisdictions.  Hence, we have actively engaged with the Personal Injuries Commission under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns.

I am joined by my colleague, the director of insurance supervision, Ms Sylvia Cronin.  In my short opening remarks I will briefly outline the bank's current role regarding the insurance compensation fund, provide a brief overview of the Central Bank's involvement to date regarding the revised framework for insurance compensation in Ireland and outline the new envisaged role for the bank as set out in the Bill and our views on this proposed role.<\/p><p>Overall, the Central Bank supports the proposed amendments set out in the general scheme of the Bill as a welcome development for consumers.  The failure of Setanta Insurance and the uncertainty that followed over compensation arrangements had a detrimental impact on Irish policyholders.  The bank welcomes the enhanced clarity that this Bill will bring to the insurance compensation framework.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, the insurance compensation fund, ICF, was established under the Insurance Act 1964.  This Act has been amended on several occasions, most recently by the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011.  At that time, the insurance compensation fund levy was reintroduced and a significant policy change was made, as the scheme changed from a home-based to a host-based insurance compensation scheme.  Under a home-based scheme, compensation is paid by the insurance compensation scheme of the member state of the regulator of the insolvent insurance company while under a host-based scheme, compensation is paid by the member state in which the risk is located.  Ultimately, this means that the scheme is targeted at Irish customers of Irish and EU insurers rather than at the EU and Irish customers of Irish insurers.<\/p><p> The bank's current role in respect of the ICF involves the following functions: carrying out an annual assessment of the financial position of the fund; determining an appropriate contribution to be paid to the fund by non-life insurance companies, not to exceed 2% of gross written premium; liaising with the Department of Finance in relation to interest rates and repayment terms on any loan advanced by the Exchequer to the fund; and publishing a notice on the Central Bank's website and delivering a notice to each non-life insurance company specifying the contribution to be paid to the fund. <\/p><p> In early 2016, the Department of Finance set up a joint working group comprising representatives from the Departments of Finance and Transport, Tourism and Sport to review the current insurance compensation framework in Ireland.  The focus of the review was primarily on motor insurance.  The Central Bank, drawing on expertise across a number of areas within central banking and financial regulation, provided technical input and policy views to the Department of Finance during the early stages of its proposals.  The bank is supportive of the extension of compensation for third party motor claims in the case of insurer insolvency from 65% to 100%.  This removes an inconsistency and is positive from a consumer perspective.  In regard to the split funding concept for third party motor liability claims, where the insurer is insolvent and in liquidation, whereby the liability for the payment is to be shared 35% and 65% between the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, and the fund respectively, the bank has been concerned to ensure that the practical operation of this arrangement not give rise to undue complexity for affected consumers.  Our view is that the proposed approach appears to address this concern.  There do remain some points of complexity in the wider scheme that might be considered as part of this process.  In particular, we would like to see some analysis of the current difference of approaches between the situations where a firm is in administration and when it is in liquidation.<\/p><p> Notwithstanding the above points, the main impact on the bank directly is, of course, that the administration of the fund will be transferred from the accountant of the High Court to the bank.  In January 2017, the Governor of the Central Bank confirmed to the Minister for Finance that, subject to an appropriate legislative framework and consultation with the European Central Bank, ECB, the Central Bank would be willing to take on this function.  It already administers the deposit guarantee scheme, DGS, which protects depositors in the event of a bank, building society or credit union authorised by the bank being unable to repay deposits.  In administering the fund, the bank will liaise as necessary with the relevant stakeholders, including the State Claims Agency, relevant liquidators and the Department of Finance, to ensure the proper operation of the fund.  In the event of the liquidation of an insurance company resulting in a draw on the fund, the liquidator will make an application to the High Court to approve payments from the fund, on receipt of a verified claim with due diligence completed by the State Claims Agency.  On High Court approval, the bank, as administrator of the fund, will pay the specified amount to the liquidator for distribution to claimants.  The bank will also provide an annual statement of account for the fund to the Minister for Finance.  This will be in an agreed format, similar to that currently provided to the Minister by the accountant of the High Court.<\/p><p> It is important to note that the proposed conferral of new tasks on a national central bank in the European system of Central Banks must be assessed against the prohibition on monetary financing.  In the context, therefore, of the proposals to transfer this new function to the bank, an assessment is required as to whether the task proposed to be undertaken by the bank is a central bank task or a government task.  Assuming the latter, the bank must be fully compensated for the work that it will carry out in administering the ICF.  The bank cannot provide any moneys to the fund from its own resources nor can it have any liability from the fund.  This is provided for in Head 4 of the Bill.  The assessment mentioned is to be carried out by the ECB.  We understand that the Department of Finance will request that the ECB assesses this once the legislation is published.<\/p><p> Work is currently under way at a European level on recovery and resolution in the insurance sector.  Currently, there is no European harmonised framework of recovery and resolution for the insurance sector.  The Central Bank is participating in work being carried out by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, to examine what such a framework might look like.<\/p><p> The Bank is supportive of the proposed amendments to the Insurance Act and its objectives of addressing the lack of clarity in current compensation arrangements for claimants as highlighted in the Setanta case.  In regard to the bank's proposed new function as envisaged under the Act, we will continue to work with the Department of Finance, the accountant of the High Court, the State Claims Agency and other relevant stakeholders to ensure the successful transition of this function to the Central Bank in line with the finalised legislation. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#G02200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Gerry Cross","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1448,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Cross for his opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#H00200","speaker":"1412"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1449,"content":"<p>I, too, thank Mr. Cross for his opening statement.

Acknowledging very much the issue the Senator identifies, the answer goes back to what I said to Senator Conway-Walsh at the beginning.  Whenever one wants to provide a compensation scheme and there is money to be paid into it, one has a distribution question.  It is hard to avoid that distribution question.  My answer to the question Senator O'Donnell puts relates to the work that has been done by this committee and the cost-of-insurance working group under the Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  Various pieces, proposals for change and recommendations emerged there and the work is ongoing.

In my opening statement I wish to give it the up-to-date facts on the ongoing tracker mortgage investigation.  As the investigation develops, it brings up more questions every day, some of which remain unanswered for affected customers.  I will address some of the key issues that remain outstanding and update members on the key matters that remain unresolved by some of the lenders.<\/p> <p>  Of the lenders affected by the investigation, the following still have \"cohorts\" of customers whose accounts have not been corrected, as well as customers who have been deemed not to have been impacted on.  I will deal with the banks in alphabetical order.  <\/p> <p>  First, there is AIB and its subsidiary the EBS.  The mortgage accounts that remain outstanding are those of homeowners who took out mortgages with the EBS and have not been returned to the tracker mortgage rate.  The number affected could be up to 3,000.  The key matter in the case of this cohort is that no customer was told that he or she was forgoing the variable rate basis of the loan in applying for a fixed rate for a period of the loan.  The other issue is that the variable base rate tracked the ECB rate perfectly until 2008 and then magically transformed into a standard variable rate.  There are outstanding issues that must also be dealt with by the EBS in a satisfactory manner.  There are issues for the staff who took out mortgages with AIB.  The question I pose is whether AIB or its subsidiary the EBS is sorry for the manner it is treating its customers?<\/p> <p>  Cases remain outstanding in Bank of Ireland, especially of the bank staff who availed of a fixed rate for two years on the understanding their loans would revert to the tracker mortgage rate of the ECB, plus a margin of 0.75%.  Of the cases corrected, I have seen none that has been restored to the ECB rate, plus a margin of 0.75%, as was supposed to happen as per the infamous letter.  There is a small cohort of customers who could have availed of the tracker mortgage rate but who instead chose a two year fixed rate as there was certainty, given that the roll-over position was the ECB rate, plus a margin of 0.75%.  There remain outstanding cases that became tracker mortgage loans after the loan offers were issued and that have not, as yet, been restored to the tracker mortgage rate.  In total, there could be approximately 800 cases.<\/p> <p>  Danske Bank also has outstanding cases that it has deemed were not impacted on.  The stated position of the bank which it seems to have forgotten was that the customer on a tracker mortgage rate prior to moving to a fixed rate would at the end of the fixed rate period revert to the ECB rate, plus a margin.  Danske Bank has many questions to answer about tracker mortgages, especially as it is the lender that began the race to the bottom in the margin being charged on tracker mortgages.  In October 2006 it introduced a product called the LTV, loan to value, tracker product.  It resulted in all other lenders immediately putting in place retention departments in their mortgage departments as it became clear to the other lenders that retaining their book of business was just as important as garnering new business.  It was more important to some banks, especially the main lenders which wanted to protect their market share.  This is a very important issue for all lenders, as well as in the investigation into the crisis.  This key issue had a dramatic fall-out effect on other lenders, as has become clear in the investigation.<\/p> <p>  In summary, many customers of Danske Bank have not been restored to their tracker mortgage product, even though the bank stated in its communications that I have seen and hold in my office: &ldquo;You have the option to choose between one of the following: To move to a Variable Rate; To Agree a new fixed rate period; To revert to an ECB Tracker rate (with the margin which had applied before your fixed rate period)&rdquo;.  This has not occurred and remains an ongoing issue.  The statement is from the lender&rsquo;s own communication, that it should be applied to the loans affected, but to date that has not been done in the accounts I have reviewed.<\/p><p> KBC Bank, formerly known as IIB Homeloans, resisted all matters related to tracker mortgages for many years.  It consistently attempted to suggest it never had an issue in denying people their right to a tracker mortgage, even though it was clear to me from the outset that the opposite was the case.  The bank's loan offers stated clearly: \"The interest rate shall be no more than [a factor] above the European Central Bank Main Referencing Operations Bid Rate (&ldquo;REFI&rdquo; Rate) for the term of the loan\".  I have listened to statements made by KBC Bank representatives to the committee and want to pose the following question and thoughts to the committee: have they been given the communication to which they made reference in their most recent presentation which supposedly had been issued in February 2008?  The communication sent to all brokers which is now being described as a \"flyer\" was never removed or discontinued in any subsequent communication that I know of and if it was, I should have been sent an email.  The communication, now known as the \"flyer\", did not reference any preference that it only applied to homeowners.  That is simply not true.  It is clear that there seems to be an agreed or negotiated position adopted on the issue between the Central Bank and KBC Bank, but it is wrong to try to dismiss the other affected cohorts within KBC Bank.<\/p><p> The communication was crystal clear.  It stated: \"Fantastic News From IIB Homeloans ... All IIB Homeloan fixed rates will now roll onto tracker rate upon expiring.  Offering your clients even better value\".  It did not apply to new business only because all lenders at the time were reacting to the launch by Danske Bank of the loan-to-value tracker product.  KBC Bank did so with this announcement in late 2006.  It applied to existing business, as well as new business, but it was primarily directed towards existing business.  The new business aspect of the communication was covered in bold print, with a further offering which was available to \"ALL NEW CUSTOMERS* who want to take out a mortgage with IIB Homeloans\".  I reference this to highlight the differentiation in the communication between existing and new business .  I will be asked what is the current position on these matters and, unfortunately, I do not know the answer, as I do not know what was agreed to by KBC Bank in its discussions with the Central Bank.  The numbers the bank has issued are on record.  However, I know for certain that the communication of November 2006 was not withdrawn in February 2008 as claimed.<\/p><p> Another matter that has not yet been addressed by KBC Bank in the investigation concerns the loan applicants who began on a fixed rate for three years or more.  The only reason KBC Bank did this was, astonishingly, fixed rates for three and five years were not stress-tested by the bank which allowed it to lend more money than any other lender could have.  Other lenders would have had to stress-test the rate, which was generally done at a rate of 2% above the rates on offer.  To now suggest the  reason customers cannot go to a tracker mortgage rate is the bank lent more money as a result of the non-stress-testing of the loan cost is wrong and utterly unfair.  The \"flyer\" issued in late 2006 addressed this issue of concern at the time among customers and brokers alike.  There are still many of these cases with KBC Bank.  However, I am pleased to report that I met KBC Bank management recently and hope to expand on these issues in future meetings, but, for now, large cohorts of customers are still in the waiting room of not knowing what is going to happen.<\/p><p> The level of ongoing issues with PTSB is staggering.  What is more remarkable is that this lender will inform the committee that it believes it has addressed the issues surrounding tracker mortgages.  It has not and many issues remain.  However, I am pleased to report that I have reopened lines of communication with this lender and its senior management and hope some of the key matters that remain will at least be discussed at the coming meetings.  I believe there is a growing acceptance within PTSB that if it is serious about putting its customers first, it needs to revisit some matters that remain unresolved.  I have begun recently, including yesterday, with broad-based matters such as the treatment of appeals and the restoration of accounts that were moved to another bank.<\/p><p> The margin issue has not gone away.  I am certain that I am 100% right on the issue which is central to the big remaining issue within PTSB.  I am 100% certain that the position I hold on what the correct margins should be for each individual loan account is the right one.  The loan offer and the ESIS sheets applicable to each loan inform, with 100% accuracy, what the correct rate should be.  I want to give an example of what is occurring on this matter.  Many of the loans that remain unresolved were commenced on what was called a \"discounted tracker rate\".  I have only one question: what was the rate from which it was discounted?  A parent rate applies to enable the discount to apply from it and that is the rate to which the loans should be returned.  PTSB never had what is now calls \"The non-price promise tracker\".  It simply did not exist in 2006, 2007 or 2008.  The Danske Bank matter is the reason the margins were not included in the loan offers.  The margin could be improved but not increased.  I will report later on the progress I make on this matter and continue to challenge the Central Bank to deal with the margin matter properly.<\/p><p> The key ongoing issue with Ulster Bank relates to First Active account holders, few of whom have been reimbursed and restored to their tracker mortgage rates.  There is also the ongoing delay in the issuing of redress letters and statements.  Ulster Bank, in its replies to me during the years in respect of First Active, seems to be satisfied that the documents customers signed to apply a fixed rate for a short period were clear and that the forms also included what Ulster Bank now titles \"A Tracker Removal letter\".  Of course, it was not titled or stated or even indicated when customers went to fix their interest rates, but nobody was told directly that he or she was forgoing the tracker mortgage rate.  Not one person was told by a member of staff of First Active that fixing his or her interest rate also had the effect of removing and altering the variable interest rate basis of his or her loan.  If it was the case, this is what should have been printed and stated in all communications between the customer and the bank: \"If you fix the interest rate on this loan, you will lose the right to go back to the tracker rate\".  If it had been stated and printed in this clear fashion, I would have no argument and that applies to all lenders.  Ironically, the terms and conditions of a First Active Tracker loan include the following clear and unequivocal condition: \"In order to transfer from the Tracker Mortgage product to another mortgage product the Borrower must [among other things] first redeem the tracker mortgage loan\".  No loans were, or have ever been, redeemed by First Active when a customer chose to fix the rate and the reference number never changed for the accounts I have reviewed.  On the first page of the same book of conditions the following is stated: \"(m) \"fixed rate period\" means the period during which First Active has agreed to fix the interest on the loan\".  That is the key.  First Active agreed to fix the interest rate for a period without first redeeming the loan; therefore the underlying variable rate basis of the loan continues to remain in force.<\/p><p> Overall, there are outliers which are outstanding across all lenders, but they are more individual and singular arguments by nature.  The issues I have covered comprise large cohorts in each bank that have not as yet been addressed.  It raises the question as to whether the relevant lenders are sorry for these customers or apologetic for their actions, or whether they are glad that, to date, each has not been forced to fully correct the position on the accounts.   It is important to acknowledge that the investigation is ongoing.<\/p><p> Another matter that still comes up on a regular basis is the churning of loans.  This has occurred in different volumes across all lenders.  I mention as an example, with permission, Ms Marian Kenny who took out an interest only loan with PTSB for &euro;550,000 for the full term through a broker.  She then applied for a top-up loan of &euro;80,000 but went directly to a branch of PTSB and ended up with a new interest only loan for the entire amount of &euro;630,000 but only for three years.  She lost not only her competitive tracker mortgage rate but also, crucially, the basis of the agreement for the main loan.  The branch gained a \"new\"  lending figure of &euro;630,000 when all that needed to change was the top-up facility of &euro;80,000.  That is just one example of how churning affected customers when the drive for new lending was at its highest and it occurred across all lenders.  I was told by a bank branch manager in 2007: \"I have to get &euro;7 million out that door each week and they don&rsquo;t care how I do it.\"<\/p><p> I had established a triage process to deal with appeals directly with AIB, but that has now been set aside, wrongly.  I must submit all aspects of an appeal through the relevant appeals process.  I have spent the past few weeks putting in place a process that will assist customers who have grounds for appeal to submit same in a detailed and formatted way.  I have a sample of an appeal.  They do not come easy to customers.  I hold grave concerns, however, about the issuing of data access requests, as some pertinent documents seem to be withdrawn by banks.  It is utterly unfair and wrong that a process that requires a high level of proof to substantiate an appeal is restricted because banks are not making paperwork or evidence such as telephone calls available to support a position.  This is relevant to appeals and in proving if a case should be deemed to have been impacted on.<\/p><p>Importantly, not all customers submit appeals but for some the impact of this issue on their lives has left scars that will not heal if an appeal is not brought.<\/p><p> In summary, I have not heard from the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  I am meeting the Financial Ombudsman in the coming weeks.  I have held meetings in the recent past with senior management of Ulster Bank, Bank of Ireland, KBC, AIB and Permanent TSB in the hope of resolving outstanding matters for their customers.  I am also in ongoing communication with the Central Bank.<\/p><p> The appeals process is difficult for people to complete simply because the customers who most need to bring appeals are the ones most affected by what has occurred.  Travelling back over that period of time is not easy.  I began working on this issue in 2009 and it is not acceptable that some matters remain unresolved nine years later.  I am aware of the customers watching who know that I may not have covered all the relevant accounts affected.  However, they can be certain that I am aware of them.  There could be another 5,000 cases outstanding and while tracker fatigue could become a factor, it is vitally important that we continue to work for all those families who have been deemed by the banks not to have been impacted.  In that context, the following considerations must be borne mind by those lenders that still have issues with tracker mortgages.  First, where there is doubt about the meaning of a term, the interpretation most favourable to the consumer should prevail.  This is not just a desire but is the law.  Second, if there is any doubt about what was to occur following a fixed rate period, lenders should disregard the fixed rate period and behave as if it never occurred.  That will address the lack of clear information.  Third, if a tracker mortgage was one of the options then the lender should offer the customer the tracker rate even if tracker mortgages are no longer available.  That comes from the CCMA.  Fourth, if the lenders' apologies are sincere and if their desire to put customers first is real they should resolve these outstanding matters immediately.  This will send the clearest signal yet that attitudes and the culture within banks has changed for the better.<\/p><p> I was asked by a reporter recently if I would do it all again, given the tough journey involved for me and my staff.  I said that I would do it all again but that the question should be whether the banks would do it all again.  I fear the answer to that question might be \"Yes\" but I hope I am wrong, for once.  Finally, I want to thank this committee for all of its work on behalf of the people affected.  I believe that saying sorry is just not good enough for what has happened.  I am happy to take questions from members now.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#N00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Kissane","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1554,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Kissane and call Deputy Pearse Doherty.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#P00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1555,"content":"<p>Go raibh maith agat.

There was a maximum amount that they could borrow on the staff rate but there was always a link between the underlying basis of the other loan that could have been adopted in.  However, when the trackers were removed, the bank used it as a reason not to give it back but there was an unwritten understanding among bank staff that the tracker option was always going to be available to them as a default position.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#P00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Kissane"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1559,"content":"<p>Does Mr. Kissane understand that there are many people in that cohort?

There were two panels there - the independent review panel and the customer appeals panel.  Of the submissions that I made on behalf of customers to the latter panel, the only description I can use is that those customers were \"treated disgracefully\".  I make no bones about saying that.  Thankfully, however, the bank itself has now realised that.  Members must understand that submitting an appeal in the first place is very difficult for people.  They are talking about matters that are very personal to them.  There did not seem to be any credence given by the bank to the fact that I had met these people, listened to them and assessed their case.  Essentially, I listened to them and determined whether an appeal was merited.  Members of the aforementioned panel - and the  chairperson, in particular - then called into question their position.  Members must remember that customers were automatically awarded 10% of the interest that was overcharged.  If someone was overcharged &euro;50,000 then he or she was awarded &euro;5,000, for example.  People who were rich and who did not care whether the interest rate was 10% or 0% got the 10% payment.  That is fine because there should have been an acknowledgement for the wrongdoing.  However, what seems to have morphed into the appeals process was that if customers got 10%, they had to prove their claim to be above that in order to get any money.  If that was to follow, then there was no acknowledgement of any wrongdoing.  The people who suffered the most were those who were financially restricted.  They were also the people who submitted appeals because the cause and effect was more dramatic for them.<\/p> <p>  While I am not here to defend Permanent TSB, it was the first out of the block on this.  It was adapting to a process that was new to all the banks and was the first to do so.  It did not look right that a member of Permanent TSB staff would be on the panel.  Thankfully, that has now been addressed by all the banks.  As Deputy Michael McGrath said here, it was like having a member of the defence team on the jury.  The statistics are clear on this.  I saw their last presentation here.  They are still reluctant to deal with the independent review panel statistics and the customer appeals panel statistics separately.  That is because the customer appeals panel statistics are astonishingly in favour of the bank.  That is ironic, given who is causing the effects.<\/p><p>If somebody was awarded &euro;2,000 in compensation and decided to appeal, he or she would have to prove that the damage done to them was in excess of &euro;2,000.  Mr. Kissane can correct me at any time.  Such a person would actually have to show that he or she lost the value of &euro;2,000.  Is that correct?  For example, perhaps he or she incurred expense in travelling to Dublin to meet with legal advisers or taking other steps.  If he or she could not show that the damage exceeded &euro;2,000, the appeal was not successful.  That meant that the wrongdoing, which should be an automatic sum because the banks took money from their customers wrongly, never occurred.  A customer was left out-of-pocket.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#P01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Kissane","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1566,"content":"<p>That is what I said.  No compensation was given.  It was an astonishing position, and I could not understand how it was sustained.  Essentially I did not consider what customers were awarded in redress at all.  I listened to people.  What I told all the banks is that everyone assumes that everyone who came to me brought an appeal.  That is not the case at all.  In a lot of cases where people came to me, there was no reason for an appeal.  I would assess their situation as an adviser.<\/p> <p>  However, I heard people's accounts of the carnage that had happened.  I will give an example.  Yesterday I spoke to a lady who was so upset that I had to make time to speak to her even though I was busy at the time.  She sold her house in 2016 because the family was fearful of going into debt.  However, KBC does not classify that as a lost home.  Just a month ago, KBC approved her for another loan of &euro;200,000.  The mortgage was originally for a sum of &euro;220,000, but it was not on a tracker.  It is astonishing.  I give this case as an example.  This woman was completely broken.  I had to say that although it would be difficult to re-crash this car, she had to do it.<\/p> <p>  I had a lady in my office recently who was dealing with another bank, but this example is illustrative of all the lenders.  I asked her what she would want from the appeals process if I had a magic wand and I could do anything.  She picked up her redress letter and said she would like me to travel back in time with it by four months, because she did not want it.  She could not relive that period.  That is the feeling I am trying to express.<\/p> <p>  What really annoyed me about the customer appeals process in Permanent TSB was that it just dismissed all these concerns and threw them in the bin.  I met a girl who had receipts for the babysitters that she needed to hire on the days she had to go standard financial statements meetings in the bank.  Those expenses were all thrown in the bin.  She had proved every cent of extra money she had spent.<\/p> <p>  People go on a journey before they go into arrears.  This is an important issue with regard to the warehousing cases and so forth.  They empty every single bucket that they have.  They then run up every credit facility they have to the maximum.  They then go to their friends, parents and other family members.  Only then do they go into arrears.  They travel that journey before they get to the arrears position.  I am not talking about the strategic defaulters, a group about whom I do not even care.  Families, in particular, will tighten every single belt they can before they get to arrears.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Kissane"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1567,"content":"<p>I agree with Mr. Kissane and with his sentiments.

Astonishingly, one of the things all the people I have met want from me is a way to draw a line under the matter.  They just want to move on with their lives.  The parts that cannot be captured in an appeal are the financial plans that were destroyed.

In respect of the quantitative damage done to somebody who has lost their home, one can visualise the evening the person had to leave it but then to be told a certain number of years later \"oops, systems error, we made a mistake and we overcharged you\" can destroy some people.  It pushes them right back over the edge.  Many of these cases are subsequent to PTSB if the banks are not prepared to step up but they would be individual by nature.  They are not really something I would classify as a class action or grouping position because they are individual by nature.  One must understand the journey of coming to arrears and then serious arrears.  The banks will defend some of those positions.  I have concerns, if they do go to court, about the six-year timeframe for the statute.  The statute is supposed to be set aside but my legal advice is that they could challenge that setting aside in some aspects.  In other words, the cause and effects that are being challenged within the banks on the appeal stage at a court case could be challenged if they are outside statute.  It is something about which I would have grave concerns if they push that line because we should remember that these lenders have far greater access to legal teams than I have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#R00100","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Kissane"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1583,"content":"<p>I previously sent two cases to the Central Bank.  Those cases involved documentation and evidence showing that during the period of the investigation by the Central Bank, lenders continued to challenge borrowers who were within the scope of the Central Bank examination and in those two cases, homes were lost as a result of the actions.  The Central Bank is investigating that but given its rules, it cannot inform me about any progress or lack thereof.  Does Mr. Kissane have any evidence about whether or not this is widespread issue?  Is it an individual issue?  Another case with which we are dealing, which presented recently, involved an individual who is seriously ill.  I have the consultant's letters here.  The medical documents I have state clearly that the illness is as a result of the stress that individual was placed under by the financial institution in question.  During a period of the individual's account being deemed within the scope of the Central Bank investigation, this institution continually pursued the individual about issues like repossession and voluntary surrender of the house.  It eventually materialised that the individual was not deemed to be impacted by the tracker mortgage scandal.  Nonetheless the rules were breached during that period to a point where the individual has a serious and long-term illness as a result.

It is a case of the bank saying a department was not involved in the tracker investigation and did not know and it had to continue with the legal route because of the issues involved.  I have cases in my office, one of which involved a lady who got a phone call from the arrears unit while she was in the cardiac unit of a hospital.  I have come across cases of attempted suicides.  They are not explained but they are not with us any longer.  I have come across health issues.  I said a long time ago that what is within it still has to come out.  If financial stress is brought to bear on a family or a person, isolation, health and relationship issues arise.  The tentacles of this octopus spread everywhere.  If somebody takes &euro;400, which was the average overcharge, out of a person's wallet, purse or bag every month for seven years, at what point does it get in on that person?  That is what happened.  Taking money by stealth is the way I would describe it.  One of the first things people have difficulty understanding is when they have to revisit it.  I would get people to print off details of every single bank account they had at the period, because it jogs the memory.  I recently asked a man from Kerry who came to me whether he had ever had a rejected direct debit.  He told me he had lots of them and I said that they were &euro;10 a go.  I told him that &euro;10 is a lot of money and he made a very important point to me when he said, \"Padraic, where I was, &euro;1 was a lot of money\".  He told me that &euro;10 was a fortune and was the difference between him eating and not eating.  I would love a project to be undertaken to see how much was made from rejected direct debits through this period because I would say it is a small fortune.

The money that was overcharged, in the collective, is probably about &euro;700 million.  There are a couple of aspects that probably do not get as much prominence as they should.  In taking &euro;700 million from customers, they also took it from the economy, at a time when the economy could have done with &euro;700 million extra to be spent.  It is a key issue that a lot of people miss.<\/p> <p>  Another thing about the &euro;700 million is one has to double it to earn it.  That means there is &euro;1.4 billion that has to be earned to create &euro;700 million of overcharge.  Even if it was only &euro;100 million it would still be wrong but the fact is that the numbers are so astounding.<\/p> <p>  One of the connective issues was that the standard variable rates that were being charged at the time were the highest in Europe, as the committee has heard.  That is what made it more pertinent in respect of the importance of the tracker.  If the ECB rate is at 0% and the tracker margin is 1% but customers were being charged 4.5%, the differential was off the charts.  Add to that the tsunami of the economic crisis and it was a perfect storm that hit families.  Importantly, when it hit those families, they did not know there was a wrongdoing going on in the background and that is the issue that hurts the most.  Whatever about the money aspect, the fact that the banks did it is what hits them hardest.  That has become clear to me from the meetings I am holding with people.  Banks were held in a regard of trust and they have broken that.  It is going to be very difficult to restore and regrow that trust.  The banks' behaviour and the ongoing nature of the issues are certainly not helping.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#T00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Kissane"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1653,"content":"<p>There was a huge amount of money taken from people and from the economy.

The part that will be intriguing for me is the final report that will come from the Central Bank.  Will it be a synopsis, as happened in the UK recently with the global restructuring group, GRG, division of Royal Bank of Scotland, or will the Central Bank issue the full report?  It will probably be the full report and there will probably be some very damning statements in there.  If the banks could be trusted, in an idyllic world, we would not need the Central Bank because we would not need an overseer.  Putting the desire to return to shareholders ahead of customers is what is wrong.<\/p> <p>  There are other connected issues with regard to the non-payment of loans and the difficulty in taking repossession and getting the debt repaid.  It cannot be viewed as an easy ride, either, for non-payers, because then the whole thing will crumble.  One of the questions I have is why it is necessary for the bank to make &euro;143,000 on a &euro;300,000 loan, rather than &euro;53,000.  How much is enough?<\/p> <p>  If I was to give any indication of what should happen going forward, I would suggest that the family home should be treated as a cheaper loan anyway.  The desire to own a home - however, we have to be careful that this does not drive the prices crazy as well.  It could have a double edge to it.  There is a certain level of affordability for people.  It is estimated that about 35% of income is what people should be spending on a mortgage, yet we are up at 60% and 70% at the moment in some cases because the supply of housing is not there.<\/p> <p>  As for the fallout, to learn from this and reposition it again is going to be difficult.  We are back with the same leopards, same spots, same treatment.  If it happened again, would they do it again?  I hope they would not because of their reputations and the carnage they are starting to see in the appeals.  One could not do it to anybody willingly.  There are good people in these banks and they know, but some people made the decisions.  There were deliberate actions taken by some of these banks to ensure the restoration of the tracker did not occur.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#T01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Kissane"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1655,"content":"<p>To follow up on that, when Mr. Bernard Byrne, CEO of AIB, was before the committee two or three months ago, he described taking people off tracker mortgages, etc., as an unforeseen and unintended consequence of the decision to stop offering tracker mortgages to new people.

Some banks did it deliberately.  Deliberate changes were made to their mortgage systems.  That I know.  In regard to why, the reasons were extant for every bank, namely, trackers were costing money.  It was a short-term cost, by the way; trackers are freely available in the UK as I sit here today.  They are not a product that has suddenly vanished.  If I was advising the banks, I would suggest applying a floor in respect of trackers below which the rate could not go.  That would probably have solved a huge issue.<\/p> <p>  We are moving into the area of the criminality of this and to be honest, I have concerns about some lenders and how they did it and the deliberate nature of it.  However, more of the concerns are about how they have resisted it.  For example, AIB is stating one position about AIB customers and that it was a natural fallout, yet EBS homeowners are all sitting in listening today - I know lots of them are - and not one of them is back on a tracker.  They got the wrong form.  The wrong form for whom?  I find it astonishing that the wrong forms are always in favour of the bank.<\/p> <p>  There is a rule of law here.  If the documentation is not clear, the rule is that it should favour the lesser party, and the lesser party should be and is the customer.  There is a lot more I could say on the issue but I do not think it would be fair in the middle of the investigation with lines of communication open.  As a warning to the banks, I would say that I have a lot more information than I am stating.  The Central Bank has been informed and is aware.  It has told me it is absolutely accepting and working with the information I am submitting.  Obviously, it has to go and prove it.

If we remember when Bank of Scotland came into the marketplace, it brought in a tracker product, and within three years every bank had a tracker product.  It was naturally going to follow that if Danske Bank was the only bank that stated that as someone's margin loan to value improved it was going to lower that margin, every bank had to react to it because it could have cornered the entire market as the product was going to be a loss leader and it was going to garner everybody.  What ended up happening was that many people negotiated to get the deal approved with Danske Bank, and then went back to their own banks and got it matched or even bettered.  As a broker at that time, we sent email after email to the banks to state if they did not improve on 1% we would move the customer because we were obligated to do so.  If there is a better available rate we are obligated to tell our customers about it.  At that point, all of the banks were coming back with improving rates all of the time.<\/p> <p>  The reason I say it became a race to the bottom is because the desire then was not how much profit the banks were making from a mortgage, it was market share and how much they were lending.  If we listen back to all of the announcements, they were all about how much they lent in each year.  It had nothing to do with the margins at which they were lending.  It resonated because the volumes were so great they were making profits, but the profits in a normal banking environment should have been a lot more.  They were charging minimal amounts and it was about getting volume.  The bank manager who spoke was factually stating what the position was.  He had to get &euro;7 million out the door of one branch in a week, and he did not have lot of footfall crossing.  That is an astonishing amount.

One of the issues with EBS, and what was unusual, was if someone wanted a tracker mortgage he or she had to sign a tracker application form which stated the person could move to a fixed rate or a variable rate once without penalty throughout the life of the loan.  I have consistently challenged this bank as to where is the without penalty aspect of this.  I have received a reply from EBS that there would be a penalty if there was a breakage fee in going from a tracker to a fixed or variable rate, which could never apply because there are no fees for breaking with a variable rate because it is a variable rate.  Its loan offer, which in many cases was issued after that application form - and we are getting technical here - mentions the variable ECB rate plus 1.25%.  With the tracker mortgage, the margin is linked to the specified index or indices and remains constant for the life of the loan.<\/p> <p>  One part not accepted by the banks - I am not going to say it is not understood by the banks - is that the first thing everybody forgot about with regard to a tracker mortgage was it was a product first and not an interest rate.  The legalistic view is the underlying contractual basis of the loan was established when it became a tracker.  It did not get altered when someone went into a fixed rate for a short period of the loan, it remained running.  The only part that would change was the ECB rate, and nobody could predict what that would be at the end or at the outset, but the margin was constant.  Everyone signed up to the very same tracker product.  All that has happened since July 2008 is the banks have attempted to state retrospectively that this what they meant, or that they had a non-price promise tracker product, as Permanent TSB has said.  All of this is made up.  With certainty, in every system a loan must be underwritten before it is ever issued, and the margin is there because the underwriter must know if it stresses it to plus 2% what that will cost the customer.  This is in everyone's system.  What the banks did, and one can imagine the work that went into it because of the cost issue of more than &euro;600 million, was looked to see whether there was any way to get people off tracker rates.  I am absolutely certain this happened in all 15 banks.<\/p> <p>  As a complete aside, people who had credit issues and had to go to Springboard Mortgages, which is owned by Permanent TSB, to get a mortgage are on better margins today than someone with a 50% loan to value offer with Permanent TSB, and Permanent TSB thinks this is right.  The important thing is no margin was stated in the Springboard Mortgage loan offer or in the Permanent TSB offer, but the Springboard Mortgage person is back on the margin used in the system and the Permanent TSB person is not.  I had an exercise which I showed the Central Bank.  I could put out four identical loan offers, one at 0.8% above the ECB rate, one at 1% above the ECB rate, one at 3.25% above the ECB rate and one at 2.25% above the ECB rate, and the job is to match the margins to the loan offers.  Nobody could do it, because all of the loan offers are the same, but people think they are right.  This is why I state today I am 100% certain I am right on the margin issue.  I am challenging and continuing to challenge the Central Bank on this and I do not know why it is taking it so long, because these are the questions it should be asking Permanent TSB.  My question on the non-price promise tracker is whether any of the customers were told this is what it was, because otherwise, why are they all challenging this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#U00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Kissane"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1664,"content":"<p>To clarify a matter Senator O'Donnell raised about Danske Bank, we got a reply from Danske Bank on 12 January and I will ask the clerk to circulate it to members again.

One thing which is common is that I have had no one come to me to say that the bank did it.  In any appeal I have dealt with, I have not met anyone who would get out of a car and say they had whiplash unless they had it, in other words we are not naturally a claiming nation.  This involves middle Ireland which pays for everything.  It is people who ordinarily would never argue, complain, claim or appeal about anything.  Over the many hundreds of meetings I have had, I have come to understand it and can see the upset in their eyes and in what they tell me.  When people visit my office, they may share a bed but they are on separate pillows.  Both are pretending to be asleep but both are awake.  <\/p> <p>  Niamh Byrne was of of four customers before this committee.  Thankfully Niamh has been redressed by Ulster Bank but the other three are in the same position that they were in in October.  I recall Hazel Melbourne told this committee that she was literally begging it to help them.  She does not say that lightly, and she is a special lady anyway.  I recall Jenny who said \"I might be 74 years but I am not dead\".  She lost three of her investment properties.  I have hundreds or thousands of these cases.  One must be careful, however.  It is fine to continue and wallow in the difficulty but something that I say to many clients is that the problem may not be solved tonight but it is shared.  They need to be given assistance to show them how to get out of this.  Remember, until they received the redress letter, many of these people did not have a tunnel never mind a light at the end of it.  There are cases.  In common with the staff issue, it is not something that I would like to politicise or get public kudos for it but members can be certain that it has happened.  It is not something that I wish to speak about publicly.  It is too personal to people and it is something that I would handle with greater care than any other matter at issue here out of respect for the people who are picking up the pieces and who are still here.  The media ask me to get people who lost their homes to talk to them but nobody will.  Shame alone stops people from doing that; there is embarrassment having learned the excuses they gave for having to move from their home are now lies.  One cannot expect them to do that.  I was intrigued to see KBC tell this committee that of the six owner-occupied properties lost as a result of the bank's error and failure, it still had five in its possession.  Good luck with moving back into that house.  It is an impossibility.  KBC thought this would be easy, that it still owned the properties so that it might give the customers back the house.  Imagine the evening those people had to move out and think of the state of play, particularly for the children.  I could have any bank before me, but when children are affected I get angry because that is unfair and it is abuse.  It might be financial abuse and dressed up in white collars, but I do not care, it is still abuse.  Parents have to take difficult choices, and I do not mean not taking holidays, Irish courses or so on, I mean real issues such as the standard of food they are giving.  I raise this because it is the culture that must change.  Banks telling people that they must stop shopping at a particular shop and they must shop elsewhere to save more money has to stop.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#V00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Kissane"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1668,"content":"<p>Professor Philip Lane has told us that all customers will be compensated by the end of June.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#V00400","speaker":"1378"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1669,"content":"<p>The desire is that would be the case for all customers who have been identified.

My intention was only ever that everyone would be given back their tracker mortgage.  It is absolutely the case that there are concerns but I would hate for the real life issue of the tracker rate being restored to be lost in the debate over who was or was not guilty.  There are people who engaged in deliberate actions but they probably did so with the intention of trying to save their bank and secure its profits.  The reasons they did it could have been laudable but it was still wrong.  I have been asked how much of it was criminality and whether it was fraud many times.  That was never my concern.  If I press that button I would lose control of what people want, which is having their tracker rate restored.  They are not interested in the wider aspect.  Obviously they are very important questions in this forum and for the Central Bank.  If it needs to move to that level, I would give what I know but for now, my concern is for my customers.  I have moved from getting them back to the tracker to the clean-up phase which was always going to be the tougher part of the job.  The banks nearly sighed with relief when they put the customers back on tracker but they did not know the carnage that would arrive at their door.  I did not expect Permanent TSB's appeal panel to treat it as it did, with the one panel cap.<\/p><p>What was astonishing about the appeals was that the more serious ones were with the independent review panel.  All of those bar two were resolved with me.  It is quite astonishing.  An oral hearing was given to everybody.  If I were to raise any issue here, it would be that, while appeals take time, the people need to be heard.  One cannot put into that what it has done to people.  It must be acknowledged that it is not easy for the people brought in.  Astonishingly, bringing an appeal that has merits is therapeutic.  It is actually the best way to draw a line on the matter.  It has nothing to do with the level of compensation.  I know many believe compensation is what is desired.  I have asked the question on compensation in my office umpteen times but I have never got an answer from a borrower to the effect that he or she wanted &euro;1 million back.  None of them is looking for it.  They just want the wrong to be acknowledged and proper compensation to reflect it.

Mr. Joe Meade, the original ombudsman, wrote to the Central Bank in late 2008 and warned it of the tracker issue.  That is how long ago it was.  In some sectors, there is over-regulation by the Central Bank, and in others there is none.  When a former Minister referred to the importance of having pillar banks in this economy, I asked him to define one.  The definition to date is not of what I would regard as a pillar bank.<\/p> <p>  Interestingly, Italy, which is also in the mire economically, has very competitive mortgage rates.  It took a different view from the ECB on some matters.  It can still be done.  I have said before that what is despicable about what has happened here is that it concerns homeowners.  This is the one sector one should never have been gone near.  Whatever about the global restructuring group, GRG, issues &ndash; they are here in Ireland too &ndash; and the commercial aspects, there is not the same carnage and tentacle stretch as with a home.  The Central Bank came in here initially and said it did not have enough powers.  The family home is protected in the Constitution.  There were enough powers.  The attack to which I am referring was on the family home.  It is absolutely connected to renters.  For the investors, most of whom were amateur, losing the properties was the same as losing a home.  Many people kept their first home and went on to buy another with the increased value.  They lost the rental property.  They were classified as amateur investors.  They paid the stamp duty, VAT and non-principal private residence tax, property taxes and water rates.  The amateur investor is almost a collection device for tax for the Revenue because the level of tax being paid.  We wonder why there is a housing crisis in terms of the private rental market.  Eighty percent is the only amount of interest a private investor can offset on a rental property.  If it is a commercial loan, it is 100%.  I acknowledge there are other aspects but the banks come in here, deliberately in my view, and talk about the lost homes and this other number that does not seem to matter.  It does matter, however, because most of those affected viewed the properties as their pension plans or homes, or believed they had the option to trade back to them if they sold their original home.  That is all set aside.<\/p> <p>  I said a long time ago that I do not know how this State allowed the Revenue Commissioners bail out our banks, as well as the taxpayer.  Most people would ask what I am talking about.  Banks are currently being allowed to increase rates on tracker mortgages if capital and interest payments cannot be picked up, Bank of Ireland being the main culprit in this area.  The loans were underwritten as interest-only.  If there is a 20-year loan of &euro;1 million, it is &euro;50,000 and 0%.  If there is only ten years to go, it is &euro;100,000.  There was never the affordability to pick it back up but the banks have used it as another opportunity to take the borrowers off trackers.  They were given permission to do this.  The interest on &euro;1 million at a rate of 1% is &euro;10,000.  Eighty percent of that is deductible against rent.  If the interest rate is moved to 2%, &euro;16,000 is deductible against rent, so the Revenue Commissioners lose out.  How did that happen?<\/p> <p>  I wrote a letter to the Central Bank on this in 2011.  I said the institutions would start with investors, move to arrears and then to homeowners because the intention was to get everybody off a tracker.  I wrote that to the Central Bank in 2011.  It still went with what was happening.  I asked how, after we had given what we gave, we were allowing the Revenue Commissioners to lose out with interest.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#W00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Padraic Kissane"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1520501400,"counter":1681,"content":"<p>Senator Gerry Horkan took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1682,"content":"<p>Is Mr. Kissane saying that if somebody is on a tracker and is unable to make capital payments, the bank can force him off the tracker under Central Bank rules and put him on a variable rate?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#W00700","speaker":"1374"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1683,"content":"<p>Yes.

Ironically, very few banks ever hedged fixed-rate mortgages and they took the chance that they would continue to make money from them.  The bond issued yesterday was oversubscribed at 0.68% for seven years.  That is the rate at which Irish banks are borrowing money and not one bank in Ireland is losing money on a tracker mortgage, apart from Danske because its rate is 0.2%.  According to the banks themselves, it is that they are not making enough money from them, though they made a loss for a period when EURIBOR and the ECB rate went in different directions.

We are presenting today the Economic Survey of Ireland 2018.  We joined the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, this morning and presented the main conclusions.  This is the PowerPoint presentation of the full document and it is for very busy chairs of committees.  This is a three-pager and all three are meant to have to have the same messages and substance.<\/p> <p>  It is a pleasure to be back in Ireland to share the main conclusions from our economic survey.  Ireland could be said to be at the origin of modern economic surveys.  Back in the 17th century, William Petty&rsquo;s efforts to collect and collate data put Ireland at the forefront of what we now call evidence-based policy making, even if the policy was made elsewhere.  What evidence would he find today?  He would probably find that Ireland is doing well and the recovery in economic output since the crisis has been stronger than in any other OECD country.  That is an important fact of which Ireland should be proud.  The unemployment rate has dropped from over 15% in early 2012 to approximately 6% today, which is below the OECD average.  Domestic demand is growing at around 5% while inflation is still only 0.2%.  Some of us, especially when we were finance Ministers, have spent our lives trying to bring inflation down but it is only now, paradoxically, that we are trying to put up inflation, which is proving difficult.<\/p> <p>  The overall growth outlook is good too and we expect Ireland&rsquo;s gross domestic product, GDP, to expand strongly, albeit at a more sustainable pace, by around 3% this year and 2.5% next year.  The economic successes of recent years owe much to the Government&rsquo;s efforts to address the legacy of the crisis.  The fiscal deficit declined from 11.5% of GDP in 2009 to only 1% five years later and the reforms of the banking sector are starting to bear fruit.  There was a relatively high cost of having cleansed the banks and made them functional again.  The country bit the bullet when it was necessary and it would have been very destabilising not to do that at the time.  Eventually, the country has received the benefits of a more stable and stronger banking sector.<\/p> <p>  Parliament played a role in this.  Three years ago we produced a report with some ambitious recommendations about how the Parliament scrutinises and influences the annual budget.  Many of these recommendations have now been implemented.  Today, in addition to the work of the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach, the new budgetary oversight committee has been established, with an intensive work schedule that includes reviewing the fiscal position of the Government and examining the expenditure policy proposed by the Government.  In addition, a new Irish parliamentary budget office is up and running.  I know of the Chairman's insistence throughout his career on the question of delivery of bang for the buck and getting public servants to deliver their commitments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#MM00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angel Gurr&iacute;a"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1726,"content":"<p>Somebody is doing the job of briefing you.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#MM00300","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1727,"content":"<p>The tax and transfer system continues to be highly redistributive.  I mentioned this morning that this was something that was slowly disappearing from the taxation systems of other countries, including all the OECD countries.  Like all other countries, Ireland initially had uneven and unequal income distribution but after the taxes and social security contributions, as well as the delivery of social security services, the country ends up with a much fairer society and much less inequality.  That is a very desirable result and it allows the benefits of growth to be shared more widely.<br\/><br\/>The Irish people report a high level of satisfaction with their work-life balance, and social indicators such as number of social connections are also favourable.  A parliament&rsquo;s work is never done, as members know, and it still has to tackle some of the legacies of the crisis and build resilience to future shocks.  That means reducing debt or continuing to reduce debt.  Ireland&rsquo;s gross public debt was around 75% of GDP in 2016 and it has continued to reduce in 2017.  In <i>per capita<\/i>terms, it is high compared with the OECD average and reducing public debt would create scope for budgetary policy to support the economy in the event of a negative shock, such as a disorderly Brexit.  This could be achieved through broadening the tax base in a growth-friendly manner.  For example, VAT preferential rates and exemptions should be phased out and the property tax yield raised through more regular revaluations of the tax base.<br\/><br\/>I welcome the Deputy.  It is nice to see her again.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#MM00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angel Gurr&iacute;a"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1728,"content":"<p>It is very nice to see Mr. Gurr&iacute;a.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#MM00500","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1729,"content":"<p>She is a frequent visitor and has worked a lot with us.  Financial sector vulnerabilities also need to be further addressed.  While non-performing loans on bank balance sheets have declined by approximately 60% since their peak, the stock remains high.  It is still in the double digits and it should be addressed.<\/p> <p>  The OECD Economic Survey has a special chapter on productivity.<\/p><p>It paints a contrasting picture, showing that foreign-owned companies outperform local businesses by a wide margin and that this margin is getting wider.  The labour productivity index of locally-owned firms has remained practically flat over the past ten years, while for foreign-owned firms with a baseline of 100 in 2006, it has risen to almost 400 in manufacturing and, almost eight times, to 800 in services, such that in ten to 12 years it has multiplied.  Regional disparities are large too.  Data from the Central Statistics Office show that the gap in disposable income <i>per capita<\/i>between the Border, midlands and western region and the rest of the State has not been reduced since the early 2000s and is still approximately 10%.  <br\/><br\/>The resilience of the Irish economy and the fight to make growth inclusive hinge on boosting the productivity of local businesses and equipping workers with the skills to improve their outcomes.  Only approximately 6% of the population aged 25 to 64 participated in education and training in 2015 compared with over 15% in Britain and almost 30% in Sweden.  Irish-owned companies in most sectors have reduced employee training since 2000, when they should have been doing the opposite.  The Government could allocate a greater share of funding under the national training fund for training for those already in employment.  Online education could help but some workers and jobseekers may be caught in a vicious circle because, according to the survey, only 48% of Irish individuals had basic or above basic digital skills in 2017, which is 9% below the EU average.  Therefore, if attempts to upskill are online based only, at least half of them would not be in a position to access it simply because they do not have the basic skills to do so. <br\/><br\/>Obstacles to entrepreneurship which could be addressed include high regulatory barriers that make it hard for innovative new firms to gain a foothold and reinforce the position of incumbents.  There are costly regulations relating to commercial property and legal services.  The cost of business failure is too high.  Modern entrepreneurship means being able to learn from experimentation and this sometimes means being allowed to fail and learn from mistakes and to get back up again.  The firms have to make an effort too to improve their management skills and invest more in research and development but, again, Government can help by creating an enabling environment.  It can also help citizens through reforms focused on housing, health and getting back into  employment.  <br\/><br\/>Ten years ago, when I was last in Ireland, ghost estates and unsellable property were making the headlines.  Today, housing affordability is the issue for many people.  I note that one of the national policy objectives of the Project Ireland 2040 is to prioritise the provision of new homes at sustainable locations and at an appropriate scale relative to location.  While the latter is the preferable problem to have, it is still a problem and it needs to be addressed.  The Government has implemented several policy measures to improve affordability but any long-term solution must focus on increased housing supply.  Abolition of unnecessary housing regulations that raise costs and reduce the potential for greater density is a priority.  So too is pushing the market to put well located but underutilised swathes of land to good use.  To achieve this, the introduction of a broad based land tax would be a useful weapon.<br\/><br\/>The health system is another area of concern.  There are worrying trends in terms of cost, patient satisfaction and waiting times.  There is a graph in the study on waiting times, which shows that waiting times here are a multiple of those in New Zealand, Spain, Germany, France and other countries.  In Ireland, waiting times for some treatments range from two to three weeks to six months.  While there is scope for further improvements in health spending efficiency, a path to providing universal coverage should be laid out, keeping in mind the likely impacts of population ageing.  There is a video game in which a little face known as the Pac-Man eats everything.  Ageing does this with budgets.  Ireland has a demographic window of opportunity in that its population is still younger than the populations of most of its peers in Europe.  It must use this time to prepare for a time when ageing will catch up with Irish society and it will experience vast increases in health expenses.  <br\/><br\/>Apart from housing and health, employment is a concern.  This might sound surprising given that unemployment rates have been falling, but some groups, such as young, low educated individuals and women, must be encouraged to further participate in the labour market.  They are under-represented.  One way to do this is to change those aspects of the social welfare system that make people worse off when they take up a job.<br\/><br\/>Ladies and gentleman, the financial crisis is now behind Ireland, due in no small part to its dedication to promote better policies for better lives.  The OECD looks forward to working with Ireland and for it in fulfilling this mission and in showing how, in the words of William Petty, &quot;a small Country and few People, by its Situation, Trade, and Policy, may be equivalent in Wealth and Strength, to a far greater People and Territory.&quot; <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#MM00600","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angel Gurr&iacute;a","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1731,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Gurr&iacute;a for his opening statement.

One does not need to come up with some short-term solutions if they are not well thought out or consensus based and they do not take a longer-term approach.  We must not do anything today that will make it difficult to have a long-term solution.  If one feels compelled to do something because one needs to come up with something politically, let us talk about it and be very careful because many countries, including Ireland, are saying we should do something after we have thought about it very carefully, consulted and talked among ourselves.  After all, according to the schedule, we should produce a final proposal in 2020, which means there is no need to deliver a proposal now.<\/p> <p>  The only issue is that there seems to be political urgency, an emergency almost, about being able to say digital companies are being taxed.  The issue is not about digital companies but about the digital economy.  We have an increasingly digitalised economy, with everything becoming digitalised, and the question is how to deal with this in terms of taxation.  Imagine that the tax base is reducing dramatically because everything is digital and digital is not being taxed.  How do we come up with a means of taxing a modern economy, period?

It is not a problem if the companies pay their fair share and should not be a problem if everybody is dealt with in the same way.  If Irish small and medium enterprises and large corporations know they are being charged 12.5% on their profits, the country will have a level playing field.  The problem arose when there was a perception that while Ireland was taxing companies 20% and subsequently 2.5%, some companies were paying 2% or 0% tax under sweetheart deals.  The clear view of the OECD is that we do not take a position on countries' overall tax number or level provided it is applied to everybody.  If a country can make its economy work and make ends meet by applying a corporation tax rate of 0% or 9%, as some eastern European countries do, or 12.5%, as Ireland does, that is fine.  Our threshold is that everyone must be treated the same.  We do not believe a country that can make its economy work with 12.5% taxes is doing anything wrong or intrinsically taking competitive advantage.<\/p> <p>  We have been advocating that a number of the highest taxed countries reduce their taxes.  The global trend is to lower corporate taxation, which is hovering around an average of between 20% and 25%, with few countries still applying a rate of 30% or more.  Taxes on wages and labour, known as the tax wedge, are also reducing, although the wedge in some European countries is still higher than 50%.

Does Mr. Gurr&iacute;a have a view on the different ways in which this type of loan can be reduced, for example, through more aggressive provisioning, write-offs, enforcement actions, more loan restructures or the option of portfolio sales.

There is a recognised new lower value than the nominal value to the mortgages that are on the books.  We should remember how the crisis started.  Millions of mortgages were placed in very nice boxes tied with a ribbon and a triple A sign was attached by the rating agencies which sold the goods as triple A goods.  However, they were not triple A goods and when non-payment started, they unravelled and the crisis unfolded.  The first thing to do is to recognise that these are substandard loans.  From the point of view exclusively of the banks and bank regulators - those checking whether the banks are stable - they do not want to pay for another bank crisis.  Ireland paid a harsh price for the bank crisis.  They also want to ensure the banking system is stable, transparent and reporting correctly.<\/p><p>Second, they want the judicial system to be able to process cases quickly whenever a borrower is not paying and the lender wants to take action.  Again, judges should not be asked to formulate social policy.  It is not for them to do this work.  Third, if in its collective wisdom Irish society wishes to take the political decision to support some of the mortgage holders who may be unable to continue to pay their mortgages for whatever reason,  not because it wants to salvage the banks or make the vultures better off but because it wants to help such people because they are especially vulnerable or a small group, it should do so transparently.  The system and the banks should be made to cleanse their balance sheets.  The judges should be made to adjudicate and move quickly.  Then, for those whom society really wants to help, this support should be made transparent through the budget.  It would be a line item of expenditure that the Government should choose.  The Government should let those affected know it is doing this but also let all taxpayers know because they would actually be helping those whom the Government chooses to help.  They would be contributing to help them, so the way it is done should be transparent.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#OO00900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angel Gurr&iacute;a","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1744,"content":"<p>Mr. Gurr&iacute;a is very welcome again to Ireland, and it is very nice to meet him.  I will outline one or two points concerning a number of areas.  The OECD gave Ireland a lot of very valuable assistance during the crisis on trying to get people back to work, in particular in areas such as youth unemployment and long-term unemployment, both of which are referred to in the OECD's report.  I certainly recommend that the Government consider commissioning a further report from the OECD, as independent experts in this area, specifically on the failure to create enough apprenticeships, particularly in housing and construction, because this area collapsed.  The agency which provided the training in the old days, F&Aacute;S, collapsed as well, and a new agency was formed, but much of its attention is devoted to analysis.  Regarding supply problems in the housing market, one of the key problems is that smaller and medium-sized firms cannot really take on apprentices because the format of the market has changed.  It would be very helpful to have an independent set of eyes such as the OECD's look at this area because it may have examples from other OECD member states which might be useful for us to adapt.<\/p><p>Another issue is jobless households.  I note Mr. Gurr&iacute;a said Irish employers are putting less into training than any other OECD country.  Regarding the future of work, on which I know the OECD has done some work, it is really important that employers and government continue to invest in workers to raise their skills levels.  I also wish to raise the issue of inequality of income and inequality in respect of the indices on well-being.  I do not know whether the OECD has a policy <i>per se<\/i>on this, but we in Ireland need to move to a living wage.  Wages have been very flat, notwithstanding the fact that, as Mr. Gurr&iacute;a said, the worst of the crisis has passed.  This means that it has become extremely difficult for a person or a couple on a modest income to purchase or rent a house at a reasonable price.  In certain areas, including in some of the professions such as teaching, many people are now going abroad because they are finding the traditional lifestyle expectancy they had of being able to begin to buy a house through a mortgage or rent is no longer realistic for them.<\/p><p>My other question concerns taxation, on which I know Mr. Pascal Saint-Amans has done a lot of work.  How do the witnesses feel Ireland is performing?  We have got quite a bad reputation in this regard, as they know, with certain countries almost seeming to target Ireland, as it were, as being responsible for all corporate tax inequality in the world, which is rather unfair.  What are their observations on this?  One of the attractions for foreign direct investment into Ireland is the calibre of the workforce here, both young graduates and young people from countries such as Italy, Spain and Greece who are willing to come here and work.  Again, in many cases they are very highly educated young people from different countries.  I ask the witnesses to comment on that.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#PP00200","speaker":"1253"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1745,"content":"<p>Regarding getting people back to work, particularly youth unemployment, we would be very honoured, and we are certainly ready, to work with Ireland and for Ireland in doing an analysis or an update of the analysis we did a few years ago of jobs.  What the Deputy is suggesting is that certain sectors in particular - she mentioned the construction sector specifically - have both an institutional and a market failure, the institutional one being the agencies that were set up in order to provide special training and which did not fly.  The market is not working, evidently, because it is producing price bubbles.  Ireland is not alone in this regard but this is no consolation.  Australia, Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands - all these countries contain certain cities in which housing has become unaffordable.  It is not an issue throughout the entire countries affected.  An example of this problem is Stockholm, Sweden, which has a waiting list of 600,000 who want access to rentals because the rental market there is not very well developed.  Therefore, even in the best social democracies, the welfare states, housing in certain parts of the capitals are becoming unaffordable either to rent or to buy.  This requires public policies.  In our chapter on housing in Ireland, we say, among other things, that supply needs to increase.  There are financing issues but there are also land use issues.  We recommend possible modifications in order that Ireland can have better land rezoning.  I ask my colleagues to feel free to chip in if they think something needs to be said.  This is a very difficult problem and goes all the way from China to Australia, passing through Ireland and the UK, which is in a very bad way.  The UK has a very specific zoning and land use problem.  The rigidity or lack of flexibility there sometimes produces these distortions and then housing is suddenly made impossible, which is an issue.  This tends to exacerbate inequality - or rather inequalities.  There is inequality of income, inequality of accumulated wealth and inequality of opportunity.  Of course, to the extent that housing is unaffordable, this also provides for a rigidity.  It is not easy for someone who knows there is a job waiting here for him or her to move because the problem is that he or she must live somewhere.  If the living is impossible, this becomes very difficult.<\/p><p> The Deputy mentioned a living wage.  There are different ways to take this on.  In the case of Ireland, it used to have 15% unemployment and it is now 6%.  As we have documented, wages are recovering - not from 2008 and 2009 and the big crisis, but from 2011 when they dropped further again.  What does this mean?  That means that the scarcity of labour, talent and skills is producing a recovery in the wages simply because supply and demand is acting.  The country has more demand, investment is coming in and it needs more skilled labour.  Wages are actually increasing.  It is more than just providing money to people, although in some cases that must be done for the vulnerable.  It is a question of providing skills, upskilling and reskilling.<\/p><p> Ireland presided over economic revitalisation in a way and it knows how important it is.  However, it has this paradox.  There is a bunch of people saying they cannot find a job and a bunch of companies claiming they cannot find the talent.  The two cannot be matched because people's skills are not consistent with what the companies need.  We need to be better at getting the Government, the private sector, the productive sector, the trade unions, the individuals and the universities to produce the right kinds of skills so that they match.  We would then be better able to address the question of inequality.<\/p><p> Last, but not least, I come to the reputation of Ireland in terms of taxation.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, went to the OECD and basically offered to dismantle the double-Irish system.  Ireland did so and three years later it was no longer there.  Today the big issue is the Apple case and the &euro;13 billion.  This would no longer be possible because the mechanisms that made it possible are no longer in place.  It is something from the past that has to be addressed, but it could not be repeated today.  People do not know this.  People do not generally know that Ireland has dismantled the system that made it possible to have such a situation in the past.<\/p><p> We took Ireland's solution to the Dutch and we said: \"Double-Irish is no more; how about dealing with the double-Dutch?\" and they did.  Then we took this to the UK and they did.  Eventually we now have more of a level playing field by dismantling these special systems where basically all companies are treated the same, but not with the same level of taxation.  Each country has a different level of corporate taxation as long as it treats them all the same.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#PP00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angel Gurr&iacute;a","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1747,"content":"<p>As I am conscious of the time, I will ask Senator Horkan to contribute.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#QQ00200","speaker":"1248"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1748,"content":"<p>I have been to the OECD a number of times and it is good to see the ambassador here as well.

I am concerned that one or two US companies contribute a huge chunk of our corporation tax, which in one way, as Mr. Gurr&iacute;a acknowledges, is good because we are good at it, but if any of those companies were to move or the US decided to work differently with those companies, we could have a problem.  It would create a very big hole in our budget if one, two or three of those companies were to disappear or the tax generated by those companies was gone.  How vulnerable is Ireland being that focused on a very small number of companies contributing a large proportion of tax?<\/p> <p>  I ask Mr. Gurr&iacute;a to outline his attitude towards property tax.  People in this country are not very willing to embrace the concept.  They feel it is a tax on something they have had to earn money to buy and then they are being taxed on already owning it, whereas if they did not own it in the first place, they would have no tax to pay.

It has already received a few hundred million euro in unplanned extra revenue simply because the taxpayer reached the conclusion that his name would end up on the taxman's desk.  People have asked: \"Mr. Taxman, what could we do in a hypothetical case?\"  Taxmen all over the world have provided special windows to normalise.  They do not want to put people in jail; they want people to pay taxes.  We have provided that incentive and now everybody is on board.  Some &euro;85 billion in extra taxes were paid before we started the work.  Now it is ongoing; we have started; the train has left the station.  With BEPS, Ireland is on board and working actively.<\/p> <p>  Do I think Ireland is vulnerable?  No, I think Ireland is being very successful in attracting the companies.  It is very simple.  Ireland has a set of rules by which it taxes the companies that operate here.  That includes everyone who comes.  Ireland applies the rule.  The golden rule is: a company pays taxes where it generates the profits.  It is that simple.  We need to keep it like that.  If the company generates them elsewhere, it pays elsewhere.  If it generates them in Ireland, it pays in Ireland.  Of course, there are also some intellectual property payments.  It needs to be reasonable and companies should just pay taxes where they generate the profits.  I would recommend keeping it like that and keeping it simple.  It is a message that everybody understands.  The tax reform in the United States is going in that direction.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is worried because there may be a tariff problem on steel, etc., and there is concern that it might bring about a trade war.  However, basically the tax reform moves more in the direction of what the Senator is saying, rather than against it.  I think we are generally moving in the right direction.<\/p> <p>  On property tax, what is the trend in the world?  It is less tax on companies; less tax on labour; more tax on property; and more taxes on carbon emissions.  There is more tax on consumption, such as VAT.  This is the trend in the world.  Not everybody is moving at the same speed and not everybody uses the same tax mix, but this is the mix.  This means making it more attractive to make a new investment or to create a new job, rather than making it more expensive.<\/p> <p>  The Senator asked about Japan and its debt.  Japan has 240% debt to GDP.  The OECD average is 100%.  Italy has 130% and Greece has 170%, moving to 180%.  Ireland has 75%.  Does that mean it has to use that other 25%?  No way.  It should keep it coming down.  As I have said repeatedly, Ireland belongs to the Avis club.<\/p><p>Remember when one wanted to rent a car from Avis, the employee at the counter had a sign around his neck saying: \"We are No. 2; we try harder\".  We have to try harder, those of us in countries which are in second place.  That includes everybody, except the USA and perhaps Japan and Germany.  The threshold of tolerance of rating agencies and banks is very low and we cannot make too many mistakes.  It is not the absolute number, but the trend.  Frankly, there is a good story here.  Ireland has said it wants to go to 45% and the Taoiseach mentioned that if 15% infrastructure were added, that could go to 60%.  That is more like an investment than just a debt and it is going to be recovered.  Around those levels, one is safe but it should always be coming down because one may need it again for a rainy day.  Rather than to put a lot of money in a rainy day fund, albeit that is a good idea, Ireland should pay down the debt to the greatest extent possible because that is its best umbrella.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FPJ2018030800002#QQ00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. Angel Gurr&iacute;a","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1751,"content":"<p>Before Mr. Gurr&iacute;a goes, I note that we have had a number of EU Commissioners here over the last week or so.  Like Mr. Gurr&iacute;a, they referred to the financial crisis and how well we are doing.  They talk up the story of Ireland, which is fair enough.  However, while the financial crisis may be over, the effect it has had on our individual citizens and businesses in this country is far from over.  The banking system brought us to this place and was partly the cause of austerity but it was the people who bore the burden of that austerity and helped us back.  While there were some policies from Government, the people carried the can at the end of the day.  These very same banks - Mr. Gurr&iacute;a refers to some of this in his report today - have still not learned their lesson.  They still need the extreme regulation, which is called for, because their culture has not changed.  The indebtedness of businesses to the banks is such that if they do not begin properly to write down debt and allow businesses to be freed up to trade and provide employment, the country will suffer for even longer than it has suffered already.  This will continue for longer than we expected.<\/p> <p>  When the IMF came in, the country responded by saying it would bring about the reform of local government, central government and administration.

It is timely to have this discussion now and it is a worthwhile focus for the committee over the months ahead.<\/p><p>I thank the committee for its interest in the area.<\/p><p> In accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, housing authorities are responsible for the assessment of the accommodation needs of Travellers and the preparation, adoption and implementation of multi-annual Traveller accommodation programmes, TAPs, in their areas.  My Department&rsquo;s role is to ensure there are adequate structures and supports in place to assist the authorities in providing such accommodation, including a national framework of policy, legislation and funding.  Under section 10 of the Act, housing authorities are required to prepare and adopt a TAP for their respective areas for a five-year period or such shorter period as the Minister may direct.  These programmes provide a roadmap for local authority investment priorities over the period.  They also form the basis for the allocation of funding from my Department for Traveller-specific accommodation such as group housing and halting sites.  Section 10 of the Act also requires relevant housing authorities to review their TAPs at least once in each three-year period, or at such time as the Minister with responsibility may direct.  A local authority also has discretion to initiate a review at any time during the period of its TAP.<\/p><p> Over the past ten years, from 2008 to 2017, my Department has recouped in excess of &euro;105 million to local authorities from a capital budget of &euro;156.8 million.  This represents a 67% drawdown on capital funding by local authorities collectively.  Capital funding of &euro;12 million has been provided by my Department for Traveller-specific accommodation in 2018, which is an increase of &euro;3 million on the 2017 allocation, and a similar increase on the 2016 allocation.  We would all agree it is an area we want to see increased funding in, which is part of the reason we are here.  The budget allocation has increased gradually over the past number of years.  It took a hit like all social housing projects during the years of the downturn.  I am committed, as Minister of State, with the Department and the committee, to trying to restore the funding over time but also find improved ways of spending it.  <\/p><p> Given the increased capital budgets allowing for the provision of Traveller-specific accommodation and also the fact that we are now approaching our fifth TAP commencing in 2019, it was opportune to explore issues and barriers to the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation.  My Department is particularly concerned about the underspend in this area, given the demand of Traveller-specific accommodation from the Traveller community.  Rebuilding Ireland, the Government&rsquo;s action plan on housing and homelessness, committed the Housing Agency to undertake an expert, independent review of capital and current funding for Traveller-specific accommodation to date.  This review was to have regard to targets contained in the local authority Traveller accommodation programmes and units delivered, the current status of accommodation funded and funding provided for accommodation maintenance and other supports.  The purpose of this was to provide factual information, analysis and identification of particular challenges, as a key platform to undertake an audit of implementation and delivery of the TAPs with a focus on appropriate supply of accommodation.<\/p><p> The Housing Agency submitted its report to my Department in June 2017.  The report was subsequently considered by the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, NTACC.  This committee has a statutory responsibility to advise me, as the responsible Minister of State, on matters concerning Traveller accommodation.  The NTACC subsequently recommended to me that an expert group, independent from the NTACC, be established to examine and make recommendations on issues regarding Traveller accommodation policy, strategy and implementation.  I fully support this recommendation.  The NTACC is meeting later today to consider the terms of reference for the work of the expert group.  A second meeting is scheduled for later in the month.  It is my intention to establish this group as soon as possible with a view to it concluding its work within a short timeframe.  If we can get the terms of reference agreed in today's meeting or the one before the end of March, there is no reason we cannot pick the members of the expert group soon afterwards to get their work under way.  There is no reason that work cannot be completed in a three-month or four-month timeframe.  I will not dictate to the NTACC how to do its work but I met the chairman and I have asked it to expedite its work because we have a lot of research done in the report we will discuss today.  Hopefully the expert panel can get on with its work quite quickly after that.<\/p><p> I look forward to the report arising from the expert group&rsquo;s work which should provide an insight into issues while also providing a platform for a future plan for the delivery of safe and culturally appropriate accommodation.  The Department will consider any recommendations made by the expert group to improve the delivery of Traveller accommodation nationally and to ensure that full use is made of the increasing level of funding available for investment in Traveller accommodation.  I will reinforce the point that the aim is to increase the funding but also to make sure we are spending it.  When one analyses the report, one sees the percentage that is not being spent.  It is not good enough.  It is not acceptable.  We have to change the way we are doing our business.  We have to change the relationship between local authorities and the Traveller community and the settled community and find new ways to make it happen a lot faster.  There are different reasons this money is not being spent.  We have to find ways to make sure it is spent and that everyone carries out their duties and responsibilities in this area.  I am delighted the committee is taking it on as an area of work over the next number of months to monitor the work of the expert panel.  When we get the recommendations back from the expert group, which I hope we will get in the summer, we will make quick decisions as a Department.  We will not hang around.  The aim is to make the changes this year, if at all possible.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#B00500","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1769,"content":"<p>We are pleased to be here this morning to assist the committee in its examination of the issues facing us in Traveller accommodation.  The agency&rsquo;s vision is that everyone is able to live in good quality and affordable accommodation.  To this end, our research team has undertaken and commissioned a number of studies on Traveller accommodation, working closely with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee.  Traveller accommodation has been planned and provided for under multi-annual Traveller accommodation programmes, TAPs, since 2000.  Each local authority&rsquo;s programme establishes the scale of the need for Traveller accommodation in the area and the investments over a five-year period that will assist in meeting this need.  To date, three TAPs have been completed and the fourth runs from 2014 to the end of 2018.  The current programme for Government highlighted the need for an assessment of the Traveller accommodation programmes.  This commitment was included in Rebuilding Ireland, the action plan for housing and homelessness, in which the Housing Agency was tasked with commissioning an independent review for the period from 2000 to the end of 2016.  The review was to include targets contained in the local authority Traveller accommodation programmes, the actual homes delivered, the current status of the accommodation funded and the funding provided for accommodation, maintenance and other supports.  Where targets were not met, analysis was undertaken to identify the reasons for them not being met in order to identify particular challenges that need to be addressed to underpin future progress.  The terms of reference for the study and research is in appendix 1.<\/p> <p>  The agency commissioned an independent review to address these questions, which was undertaken by RSM.  The review was based on available administrative information kept centrally and by local government.  Local authorities were also asked their views on the implementation of the Traveller accommodation programmes to evaluate progress made under the respective programmes and to identify factors that impede the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation.  Informed by the results, a second phase of the research involved consultation with 11 different Traveller representative groups, at a local and national level, and seven local authorities.  This element of the review explored the issues raised by survey respondents in greater depth and identified other concerns expressed by key stakeholders regarding the operation of the Traveller accommodation programmes.<\/p> <p>  The key findings of the review of funding for Traveller-specific accommodation found that over the period 2000 to 2016, &euro;356 million was spent on providing 6,394 Traveller-specific homes, an average of 376 homes per year.  This was below the targets set, which if achieved would have seen an average of 494 Traveller-specific homes provided per annum.  In all but one TAP period, spending was below the budget allocation.  The summary details are provided in appendix 2 of the submission to the committee.  The review found that local authorities are regularly refurbishing properties under the TAPs.  In fact, the share of the funding consumed by refurbishments and maintenance of the existing stock is higher in more recent TAP periods compared with the earlier programmes.  The reported level of demolition of properties that are in the region of 12 to 16 years old suggests a significant rate of deterioration of homes.  Local authority staff consulted as part of the review suggested that the growing need for repairs on existing Traveller-specific housing was slowing the delivery of new homes.  The review notes that the level of targeted provision has increased from one TAP period to the next but that the level of allocated funding is below the levels set in the earlier programmes.<\/p><p> When local authorities were asked for their views on the standard of Traveller-specific accommodation in their area, some interesting points emerged.  Almost all respondents, in the first survey of local authorities, felt the standard of accommodation provided to Travellers was good.  However, when probed, the local authorities consulted reported a mix quality of accommodation, from good to poor accommodation.  Local authorities used a variety of ways to monitor the condition of homes delivered under the Traveller accommodation programmes, TAPs, but many participants agreed that condition surveys should be carried out more regularly.<\/p><p> In terms of two specific questions, the first of which is why Traveller-specific properties fall into disrepair, local authorities ranked the most common causes for this as general wear and tear, resident related, both accidental and intentional, and external factors such as criminal damage and extreme weather conditions.  Most importantly, as to why there are delays in delivering on Traveller accommodation programme targets, Traveller representatives and local authority employees cited extensive delays in the planning process as a principal cause for the underprovision of homes, that is, the planning process was highlighted as the principal reason for the underdelivery.  The process of assessing the need for Traveller accommodation was another key area of concern.  Travellers tend to experience higher rates of household growth compared with the settled population.  A level of need is identified at the outset of a Traveller accommodation programme and homes are provided on this basis.  However, by the time local authorities deliver the planned Traveller accommodation, the homes provided are sometimes insufficient to meet the need on the ground due to changes in household circumstances since the assessment.  Stakeholders suggested that better engagement with Travellers and clear guidance to local authorities on the assessment of need would lead to improved outcomes.<\/p><p> There is much more detail in the review itself.  I have only provided headline results.  We are happy to answer any questions which members may have or to provide further details as required.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#C00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1771,"content":"<p>I thank the Minister of State and Mr. O'Connor for their presentations.  I have a couple of comments and specific questions.  First, I welcome the report.  It is an important publication.  There is not necessarily much new information in it in terms of what we know anecdotally from our own experience, but I welcome that it lays out clearly and unequivocally the problems that the Traveller accommodation programmes have been experiencing.<\/p> <p>  I also welcome the Minister of State's proposals to set up an expert group and his desire for that expert group to report back in a speedy fashion.  In my view, it would be good if all changes, if there are any arising out of that, would be implemented well in advance of next year's local government elections so that can inform the new Traveller accommodation programmes.<\/p> <p>  I also want to put on record that if the Minister of State comes back with positive proposals that will address some of the problems outlined in the report, he will have my party's full support, both here and in local authorities, but I would also like to see this committee play a constructive role over the period of time of that expert group and the subsequent policy or legislative changes.  That is a positive contribution we could make.<\/p> <p>  The report confirms the scandal of the way in which Traveller accommodation programmes are rolled out by most local authorities.  Some local authorities are worse than others, but that just has to be stated.  While the Minister of State correctly said that in the most recent period there was a 67% drawdown, in fact, last year was the worst year of drawdown that I am aware of.  A total of 45% of funding was drawn down last year by local authorities.  That is the largest underspend in recent times.  It also means, both in 2016 and 2017, that none of the modest funding increases by Government were spent.  The amount of money that was spent last year is marginally above that spent the year before, which was marginally above that spent the year before that, and people are not taking advantage of those modest increases, which is a real problem.<\/p> <p>  We have to be honest about this.  Our problems are twofold, namely, some politicians and some county managers or senior managers.  I note Mr. O'Connor states the problem is the planning process.  The planning process is an abstract element.  It is what people do or do not do with that process that is the real problem.  We must get into the business of naming and shaming - not for party political advantage - those local authorities and individuals who are denying people access to adequate and appropriate accommodation, because that is what this is really about.<\/p> <p>  It is not enough for us to talk about volume.  We need to see this money spent and we need to see more money allocated, but we also need to talk about quality.  The comments that the report and Mr. O'Connor highlighted in terms of maintenance are really important.  The South Dublin County Council area, part of which I represent, would have a reputation as having maybe a better record of Traveller accommodation provision than some local authority areas, but I have recently visited half of the 11 sites in my half of the local authority area and one could describe few of those sites as adequate.  Meaning no disrespect to the good people who are living there, I would not live in them.  The quality of the accommodation and the services in those locations are not adequate and quality is key.  Choice is also key.  Where Traveller families want Traveller-specific accommodation, that must be provided in appropriate locations.  Where people want other choices, those should be provided, within reason and within resources.<\/p> <p>  What has the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the Department been doing over the past two years since this Government was formed to address the current underspends?  Particularly last year, how is it that local authorities can get away with a 45% underspend?  Some local authorities are spending nothing.  South Dublin County Council - I will name and shame the local authority area I am in - spent not a single cent of its &euro;1 million plus allocation last year.  What role is the Minister of State and his officials playing to address that?  Notwithstanding the fact that the Minister of State has a review group, what will he do this year to ensure that when we look at the figures at the end of 2018, we do not have the same problem?<\/p> <p>  In terms of the research report, will Mr. O'Connor be more specific about the problems?  I understand him citing the planning process.  What bits of the planning process is Mr. O'Connor referring to?  Is it that councillors are delaying Part VIII planning applications?  Is it that managers are not bringing forward Part VIII applications?  Is it that councillors or managers are blocking section 183 land disposals?  What are the problems?  If we are to overcome them in policy and legislative changes, we need to know what those are.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#D00200","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1772,"content":"<p>I thank the Chair for her comments.  First, I welcome the positivity of Deputy &Oacute; Broin and his party towards what we are trying to do here with the expert review recommended by the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, NTACC.  The NTACC is the policy group which would make recommendations to me and I work closely with it.  Like that, if positive suggestions come forward, we will certainly move on them as quickly as we possibly can.  I welcome the support of Deputy &Oacute; Broin, and I am sure others here, for us to do that.  I want to put that on the record too.  At the start, I stated that I welcome the committee's interest in this area because all of us together, politically, need to work on this because it is quite clear that some areas are failing in their duties on this and we will have to make these changes if necessary or find new ways to do our business as quickly as we possibly can.<\/p> <p>  On the specific question of what we are doing to try to get the money spent, the number one priority has been to get increased resources allocated.  We have been working on that across social housing projects, including Traveller-specific accommodation.  It is a welcome increase in funding, but it is not much use if we do not get it spent where we want it.  There was an underspend last year.  We tried to use that in recent months and allocated it to buy other accommodation which can be used for Traveller-specific accommodation as well.  It should end up in the right place but it is not the project we wanted to happen.  We are engaging directly with some local authorities in specific areas to track projects that should be moving through the system and that are not.  I myself visited a number of sites recently.  I will do more of that over the months ahead, try to track them, and push the agenda and push the question mark over what is happening.  We have also moved to quarterly reports to try to follow and monitor the money and make sure it is being spent because it is not good enough that we say in the D&aacute;il come September or October that only 50% has been spent and that we hope to spend it before Christmas when that does not happen.  We will track those projects more clearly.  We are bringing greater focus to this.<\/p> <p>  Looking at the report, the issues include site selection and planning.  For whatever reason, I would say there is a lack of commitment in certain counties.  There is no point in denying that.  There is also the issue of effective assessment of the needs.  There is much work to be done with all the various groups and stakeholders on assessment of the genuine needs and demand for Traveller-specific accommodation versus traditional social housing and getting that accommodation right.  In some cases there is also a need to address the issue of overcrowding.  Often some of these issues are just not resolved and then we get inaction.  As a Department, we are trying to focus on the areas where money has been allocated and where projects are not moving forward.  We are also focusing on trying to drive that through and deal with the issues that are blocking some of the delivery.  In some cases it means we need to have much more consultation to strengthen the relationship with members of the Traveller community, certainly on some sites, and try to work more closely through local authorities.<\/p><p>In some cases those relationships have disintegrated as opposed to getting better.  We are trying to work on that because we will not get action here if we do not change the system and that connection or relationship as well.<\/p><p> They are the key areas.  In terms of policy changes, it involves working with the NTACC to bring in those changes.  There was the initial report analysing what has happened over recent years.  There have been numerous reports over the past 20 years from different committees.  I read some of the reports from the early 1990s and the issues have not changed very much.  That is the reason for having the expert group.  It should be a small panel of independent experts.  Nobody has any nominating rights to that group and it is to be hoped we will get the expertise we need to make decisions.  It will make recommendations to us to enable us to make the changes, whether they relate to planning, site selection, working with local authorities or whatever it takes.<\/p><p> The report also mentions the monitoring, which is tracking that money and making sure it is spent.  They are the types of changes we have made in general to the social housing spend across the various sites and programmes.  It is about tracking the money and putting a project management team in place if necessary to make it happen.  The same emphasis will be brought to Traveller-specific accommodation as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#D00300","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1774,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, I will stick to the findings of the report in terms of the planning process and its comments on that.  There are two areas in the report.  One is on page 33 regarding the planning process.  According to the report, representatives believe that the requirement for public consultation can result in radically discriminatory comments and feedback from the public, which can block proposals going forward.  The concern is that when Traveller accommodation is being provided, part of that involves a public consultation process which does not happen for other accommodation.  Furthermore, representatives stated that they believe elected members are campaigning against Traveller accommodation to win elections and that some of these politicians are involved with TACCs for the purpose of opposing Traveller accommodation.  They stated that county development plans and other policies are connected with the TAPs, which cause issues when trying to secure land for Traveller accommodation.  Sites for Traveller accommodation should be specified in wider county development plans to help secure Traveller-specific accommodation.  It is about the consultation process, the development plan and the individual planning applications.  Issues were highlighted throughout the planning process.  Other parts of the report also deal with it, but these are at a high level.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#E00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1775,"content":"<p>It is important to note that the 45% underspend last year compares with an overspend in the general social housing budget allocation.  In fact, the Department sought an additional &euro;100 million in the Estimates last year because it was ahead of schedule with the albeit very modest social housing targets.<\/p> <p>  There is an issue here of political leadership.  That also applies to us.  There is a high-profile case in the media currently, so I have no difficulty raising it.  It is in Stillorgan.  Recently, county councillors tabled a motion regarding a piece of land that is currently earmarked for Traveller-specific accommodation asking that the land be revalued at the price it would go for in the market if it were not designated for Traveller-specific accommodation.  One can see what is happening there.  They are trying to say that the piece of land is of too high a value for that purpose, as part of a type of subterfuge to have the council remove it from the Traveller accommodation plan.  In such instances I wonder if the Minister and the Department could take a more hands-on role.  Clearly such behaviour, no matter how sophisticated the presentation by the advocates of that particularly offensive motion, is designed to undermine the already democratically agreed Traveller accommodation programme in that local authority.<\/p> <p>  In that context will the Minister consider options such as potentially removing powers from local authorities, be it under Part VIII or section 183, where local authorities have a clear track record, whether it is managers or councillors, of refusing to provide adequate Traveller-specific accommodation?  We had detailed discussions about this in the Committee on Housing and Homelessness.  None of us wishes to see powers taken away from local government.  Most of us are former local authority councillors and we wish to have stronger local government.  However, in instances where councils are clearly failing in their statutory obligations there should be consideration of either sanctions or removal of powers from individual local authorities for set periods and of going above their heads to prevent such electioneering and politicking.  Is that something the Minister of State is considering or is he hopeful that the expert group will consider it?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#E00300","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1776,"content":"<p>I will not prejudge what the expert panel will suggest.

Ideally, the expert group will bring the report to the NTACC and it will agree with it and make recommendations to us.  We can act on that.  This committee will be involved and will track that work too.  It would be great if we could get agreement in the committee, too, on what we have to do in this area.  I will not shy away from what has to be done.<\/p> <p>  Given the current way money is spent, the current way of tracking this and the current rules that have been in place for a long time, I am not in a position to be able to lecture the councillors.  I will certainly engage and work with them on certain projects.  We are doing that at official, councillor and political level across all parties.  I will try to work with them to work through all our duties in this regard, but I am not in a position to make them do something.  I do not have those powers and I do not want to be given those powers.  For now, we must try to work through the process we have.  I would have preferred if we had moved more quickly with the next stage of work on the expert panel.  We agreed last July to do this, yet we are still here in March and it is not up and running.  I hope progress will be made this month at the meetings with the NTACC and that we will get the expert panel established so it can report back to us.  I do not see any reason that we cannot have a report back in three months.  If it says it needs longer, I will listen, but to be honest, I am not interested in waiting months for reports.  We want to get moving on this.<\/p> <p>  As to whether we will make changes before that, there is not much point in going through a process of having a consultative committee such as the NTACC recommending a report and then recommending an expert panel if I just jump in and make my own decisions.  I will not do that.  I will see what they send back to me first and then we will make decisions on the recommendations.  I certainly have views but there is no point in me prejudging their work.  That would be a defeatist attitude.  However, I would like the committee to be involved in this and to engage with the expert group.  The terms of reference have not been agreed yet but I have been clear to the chair of the NTACC that all the Traveller groups should be involved and consulted on that through all the stages, and that they should have a strong say in it.

From what I have seen, while there is a commitment, the resources and staff must be supplied to make things happen.  That is something my Department is trying to do in certain areas.  We are trying to focus on these matters and officials are available to help people arrive at solutions.  There is a combination of reasons.  Planning, focus and commitment exist and various processes are involved.  As Deputy Casey will know as a former councillor and a Deputy, selecting a site can be an issue.  We need to deal with such matters.  Planning gains can be used to make the planning process a little bit easier.  We will examine different solutions.<\/p><p> In terms of making recommendations, one can do so but I do not want the process delayed.  Terms of reference will be discussed at our meeting at 2 o'clock today.  Some people from that decision-making body will be here and I urge members to use the occasion of this meeting to make suggestions.  I am sure my staff will take their suggestions on board.  The terms of reference may not be agreed to today but they will be by the end of March.  Members of the committee have time to submit suggestions to the members of the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, NTACC, or to the Chair of this committee.  The members present and any who are listening to this discussion can make suggestions today.  I have not dictated the terms of reference.  I want them to be as inclusive as possible and to be solution-focused.  I also want them to lead to changes that will increase revenue.  In some cases, there are legal problems with sites which, again, must be dealt with.  There was a reduction in money which meant there was a reduction in the amount of time staff had to work on these projects.  We are trying to improve the situation.  We must become solution-focused at local authority level.  I have discovered cases that have lasted for between 20 and 30 years, which is unacceptable.  To be honest, decisions must be made.<\/p><p> We must have a realistic expectation in terms of the number of families that can be accommodated on certain sites.  The report has highlighted the need for a genuine assessment and sought greater focus and clarity on same.  In some cases, the number of families can increase quite dramatically due to the nature of the accommodation.  We must work with the people who live in these communities and ensure they understand what is manageable on a site.  We must convey to people the fact that we cannot continue to expand some of the sites and must find suitable accommodation nearby.  All sides must move a little in terms of what we can safely accommodate.  We must strengthen the relationship with communities and make things easier.  That is what we are doing at the moment and we will see whether the expert panel will recommend that changes should be made.<\/p><p> There are two more specific questions.  I cannot guarantee the timing.  I want the report yesterday.  The terms of reference must be signed off this month.  Two meetings are scheduled to take place.  They could have taken place two months ago but I am not in charge of the schedule.  I have asked the chair to convene the meetings as quickly as possible.  One meeting will take place this afternoon and a second meeting is scheduled if business cannot be finished today.  I hope the terms of reference are cleared in March and that the expert group can be put together in April when they can start their work.  I do not see any reason the report cannot be completed and given to us in three months.  If it is, then we can deal with this matter over the summer.  The report should not take any more than four months.  I have no intention of being here in a year's time and still waiting for the report.  I cannot promise when it will be completed.  Everyone here claims we have not spent enough money, which I accept.  We are trying to put the money back in.  I want to see the money spent.  Clearly, the Government wants this as much as anybody else.  We will not delay the delivery of the report.  I am not sure whether reports are outstanding but I will check it out.<\/p><p> Questions have been asked about the trend and recommendations.  I have addressed the matter.  In some areas there are.  I get a sense that local authority members want to make progress but they feel they cannot do so for various reasons.  I hope the export panel will make suggestions to improve the situation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#E00600","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1780,"content":"<p>Does Mr. O'Connor wish to comment?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#F00200","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1781,"content":"<p>My colleague, Mr. Silke, will respond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#F00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. John O'Connor"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1782,"content":"<p>As part of the review, we collected all the information from the local authorities and from the Department in terms of spending.

In my constituency of Cork North-Central, there is one site at Nash's Boreen where a family has lived unofficially in a field for nearly 30 years.  The family has a child with leukaemia and she must regularly travel to Birmingham for treatment.  Thankfully, she is in remission but she still needs to travel regularly.  Storm Ophelia was a disaster for that family because it destroyed the roof of their caravan in which they still live.  They also do not have a replacement portaloo.  The council will not act because the family live unofficially on the site.  I can confirm that the family would take Traveller-specific accommodation if it was offered to them and appropriate.<\/p> <p>  A couple of miles down the road on Spring Lane in Blackpool a site with ten bays has been built.  I believe the Minister visited the location before Christmas.  Two new generations live at the site.  There are 31 families, comprising 126 people, 59 of whom are under the age of 12.  The under-12s do not have a safe place to play.  As many as 25 people do not have proper access to toilets or washing facilities.  A national fire safety audit was carried out in the aftermath of the Carrickmines fire.  The audit outlined that there were huge ongoing fire risks at the site in Blackpool.  Some remedial steps have been taken since the publication of the audit.  When there is such overcrowding, one cannot say that the issue has been properly addressed.  Again, the site suffered a lot of damage when Storm Ophelia struck and as many as 20 caravans were severely affected.  The council has offered second-hand caravans as replacements.  The second-hand caravans are single glazed and are not the right fit for the site.  The root of this problem is the 50:50 rule.  In other words, the Department will pay 50% and the council will pay 50%.  The council budgets have been slashed.  Therefore, when one must spend on such a scale, the council can only offer second-hand caravans that are completely inadequate.<\/p> <p>  I now refer to the bigger picture.  As many as 4,700 Travellers in this State live in shared or overcrowded accommodation.  Traveller homelessness is also 11 times higher than that suffered by the rest of the population.  Therefore, it is no surprise that the European Committee on Social Rights ruled against this State less than two years ago.  In a landmark judgment, the committee found that the Government had violated Travellers' rights under the European Social Charter.  It also stated that there was insufficient provision of accommodation, inadequate accommodation and an inadequate protection of rights in cases of eviction.<\/p><p> It was stated that funding took a bit of a hit during the downturn.  That is a bit of an understatement.  Pavee Point states that in 2008, &euro;40 million was allocated for Traveller accommodation and in 2013 it was down to &euro;4 million.  This is a 90% cut when cuts to social programmes across the board and cuts to Government spending across the board for the State as a whole were closer to 4% or 5%.  There has been a failure by successive Governments and on the local authority front, with the track record of some local authorities being particularly poor in this regard.<\/p><p> The discussion seems to be focusing on the idea of taking powers out of the hands of councils.  Normally, I am very reluctant even to consider the idea of taking powers out of the hands of local councils, but where councils are not doing their job and human rights are not being respected, it is a different matter.  Traveller organisations have raised the idea of An Bord Plean&aacute;la or other national bodies having the power to act on these issues.  I would like to see more of a democratic check on this whereby whatever body might be put in place would have democratic representation, and this would include representation for Traveller organisations and groups that represent the interests of Travellers.  I would like the witnesses to comment further on this idea because we are getting to the stage where it will need serious discussion and debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#F01300","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1793,"content":"<p>Deputy Barry has raised several issues specific to Cork and more general issues.  I am not familiar with the case of the individual caravan in the field but I will certainly get it checked out.  There is no reason for anyone to be living in a caravan without a roof.  I would be surprised if it were the case and I would be disappointed with the situation.  It is something we will look into.  I would be surprised if it were exactly like that.  It would not be good enough and it is not acceptable.  There are plenty of schemes to deal with it and to accommodate those people properly.  If it has been going on for 30 years, there is obviously a lot of history of which I am unaware and which the Deputy has probably not shared with the committee meeting.  We will check this out.  There is a difficulty in some cases with local authorities assisting families or people on unofficial sites, but in many cases they find a way to do so and step in, even when it is unofficial, to try to make the place safe and bring it up to a liveable standard, even though it is not permanent accommodation.  I have visited unofficial sites where work has been done.  It is not just because it is unofficial, but I am sure we will get to the bottom of the story.<\/p> <p>  I have visited Spring Lane and I have met most of the families there.  I spent a few hours there with the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton.  We had quite a good engagement with all the families living there.  I believe it is a site on which we can make progress.  The site has a lot of history over a long number of years, and there is a combination of reasons that activity has not happened in the way it should.  It is a case of getting all sides together around the table to make some decisions.  Some realities also have to be faced.  I spoke to families that day and we had a genuine conversation.  While they might like to have all of their family members living on that one site, they recognise it might not be possible.  We had this chat and discussion with them.  It is about bringing this to a resolution and making progress.  From what I can see, there is great potential to address the issue in Spring Lane, but it has gone on long enough.  We met some of the council officials that day and my officials have visited Cork since.  The Department of Justice and Equality is very keen to work with us on this, as are other Departments.  I am determined we will find solutions for the specific site and all of the families living there.  It will need greater co-operation from all sides and greater engagement.  There have been many attempts to have this engagement but, for whatever reason, it has not happened satisfactorily.  I am determined to take a personal interest in it and use it as a test case so that we can change this, and rightly so.  I will not go into the whole history of the site here today, but it does have a lot of history and people have to take responsibility for this also.  We will deal with this also.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy is right to say the budget for Traveller-specific accommodation was slashed.  No one is denying this.  Social housing capital across the board was slashed.  This is why we have difficulties.  I have been trying to say this for a long time.  I wish we had a magic wand to put the money back earlier.  We did not have the money, but as soon as the money came back, we tried to pump it into social housing through all the various schemes, including Traveller-specific accommodation.  It is the only scheme of its nature with ring-fenced money.  The budget needs to be increased and we will do this.  Many of the other social housing provisions and budgets also provide accommodation for members of the Traveller community.  We want to have more in the specific area of Traveller accommodation and we are doing this.  No one is denying that the money was hit hard.  This is factual.  This was the case across every Department for a long number of years because there was no money.  This is the bottom line.  Thankfully, we are back in a situation now where people are working very hard and contributing taxes, so taxes are back up and we can spend the money wisely.  Now that we have this increased money, it is important that we spend it wisely and that we get it spent and get results.  This is why we have these reviews.  This is what we are trying to do.  That is what this conversation is trying to focus on.<\/p> <p>  The Deputy asked me to comment on what the recommendations should be.  I am not going there because that defeats the purpose of setting up an expert group.  I hope it comes back with solutions we can use and recommend.  I welcome the support expressed here and ask people to do this if the report comes back with recommendations.  The National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, NTACC, is the advisory group to me, or whoever has responsibility at the time.  I work with it and listen to it.  When it asked for this expert group, I agreed immediately.  We will make a quick decision on this.  It is not something on which we will delay.<\/p> <p>  With regard to Storm Ophelia and the damage it and other storms did to accommodation, we have asked local authorities to leave resources for specific accommodation needs that have been damaged and to let us know about it so we can make money available.  There has been a review of the loan and grant scheme for the purchase of caravans.  That was completed in the autumn.  I signed off on it this week, and it will be available to committee members to look at once it goes to the NTACC today.  It has to get first view of it.  It includes recommendations on the scheme.  If we can make changes here and have a standard model for how the scheme operates throughout the country, it could be very successful.  It has worked very well in some areas and very badly in others.  It should be able to provide a solution for people who have substandard caravans.  It is a way of being able to get a grant or loan towards purchasing a new or second-hand caravan.  We will work on this.  Again, this is something people pay for themselves.  We just operate a loan or grant scheme and we are happy to do so.  I would like to see it working in a much better way.  It is a good report, which the committee will get, and it might be something the members might want to discuss at the next committee meeting.  We could not get it signed off in time for today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#G00200","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1794,"content":"<p>I thank Deputy Barry for his comments.  It is important to say with regard to the individual family living in the field that the Traveller population has grown over the past 20 or 30 years and the number of families living in unauthorised sites has remained constant at approximately 500.  It is a big issue that has not been dealt with over time.  A lot of Travellers have moved into Traveller-specific accommodation or standard local authority accommodation, but a substantial group of families are still living in unauthorised sites which, as has been described, are very unsuitable for people to live in.  I hope the expert group will be able to examine what can be done to help these families.<\/p> <p>  An issue regarding Spring Lane was also mentioned.  This is reflected in the report we conducted on the need to consult Traveller families about their long-term requirements.

We look at what needs to be done going forward, but we will not get things right unless we accept what happened in the past, and the fact the cuts made to Traveller programmes were on a scale not seen by other programmes in the country and were way above and completely disproportionate to the cuts implemented in other areas.<\/p><p>I oppose all these cuts, but this by far the most.

According to the last local authority count of 2016, almost 7,000 Travellers are either sharing housing, are in bays or are living in unauthorised halting sites.  In 2016, the Residential Tenancies Board found that 82% of landlords consulted were unwilling to rent to Travellers while the local authority plan for Traveller accommodation has a preference for rental.  Its preference is for rental but the landlords will not let.  This is a massive problem.  According to the 2016 census, seven times more Travellers are living in overcrowded situations compared with the general population.  That has a knock-on effect on safety.  I am sure that when the Minister of State visited Spring Lane, he saw how close and overcrowded it was and how overloaded the electricity is.  They are death traps.  It is happening in sites throughout the country and is something that resulted in the Carrickmines tragedy.  According to the local Traveller accommodation plans, there is unspent money, which we have already discussed, but there is also money that has not been drawn down.<\/p> <p>  Does the Minister of State accept the scale of the problem and its urgency?  It is an important point of understanding.  The Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act provides no sanctions against local authorities which do not take measures to provide accommodation for Travellers.  According to the European Commission in 2002, that may weaken effectiveness.  We know that it weakens effectiveness.  We have heard all the statistics and the individual stories and situations.  We must recognise the scale of the problem and the fact that the Act is not working.  We have the review but it is disappointing that the group has not met yet.  The report has to come as soon as possible.  Every day that passes is a day longer for people living in inadequacy.  There must be a sense of recognising that we have a massive problem and there must be a sense of urgency.<\/p> <p>  Deputy Barry mentioned the European Committee of Social Rights.  There have been serial violations of Article 16 of the charter, which have been identified on five different grounds.  This is writ large in Europe.  I have just become a member of the Council of Europe.  It is mortifying and shaming for all of us to be justifying what is not happening for people in terms of accommodation.  We are very sensitive to what others think of us, but they do not think much of our record on Traveller accommodation.  There is a lack of sanctions or will, money is not being spent and there is delay and waste.  There is a huge lack of trust among the Traveller community that anything can or will happen and their trust is further breached with every day that passes.  I want to get a sense of urgency from the Minister of State and for the expert group to meet.  He is the Minister of State, he should tell them it has to be done within three months.  Let us just get on with it and build the faith that we need.  According to the census, the Traveller population of Ireland is 30,000 but it is probably more like 40,000.  That is not a large number of people.  Had we the will to do this right, we could do so.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#H01100","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1807,"content":"<p>I know Senator Kelleher's commitment to this.  We have had a number of meetings on the subject and I know her commitment is genuine, so I will respond to her in that positive context.  I also want the expert panel to be up and running.  I have had a couple of meetings with the chair and members of the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee before Christmas and since in an effort to make that happen.  I believe it is meeting today and I hope it will sign off on terms of reference today, and if not, at its next meeting.  I have asked its members to do that.  It is my advisory group.  They are the people I want to sign off on the terms of reference.  That is what they are there for.  I cannot make them do it, but I know that they want to.  Any issues have been sorted out and I expect that it will happen this week.  All the members of the group are genuine and want the expert group to be set up.  If it does not happen today, I believe it will happen during the month at its next meeting.  I have made it clear that I want a report back as quickly as possible which is as much as I can do.  After the members have been chosen and my Department has signed off on them, as it must do, my message to them will be to try to finish in three months.  I do not see why it could not do that.  A lot of good work has already been done with the agency report as well as other reports in recent years.  Much evidence has been gathered, some of which Senator Kelleher quoted.  There is plenty of information.  We are looking for it to come back with recommendations on how to change this.<\/p> <p>  Senator Kelleher referred to the lack of trust.  We are trying to change the system to build that trust back up and to earn it.  I have also made it clear to all the stakeholders that there must be change and movement on all sides.<\/p><p>We must change the working relationship and decision-making process in some areas.  As I stated, I met families living in the Spring Lane site, with which Senator Kelleher is also familiar, and made it clear to them that not all of the solutions they seek are feasible.  I told them we had to find common ground and that there must be agreement to change.  The families agreed to amend their position and more meetings with them are to be held.  We must understand that there is no magic wand which will fulfil every desire but we can and must make a lot of progress.  Some sites may not be able to accommodate all the families who wish to live there and we must accept that, move on and do something rather than do nothing.  If we can strengthen the relationship and trust, we will be able to make progress and I wish to try to do so.<\/p><p> Many local authorities genuinely want to help on this issue, although some have not followed through on previous commitments.  However, I acknowledge that previous Governments put money into this area when funding was available, which was probably in 2004 and 2005.  I may not always compliment previous Fianna F&aacute;il-led Governments but they allocated money to this issue and put plans in place for Traveller accommodation programmes, TAPs, that could deliver up to 10,000 units, which would deal with much of the demand that exists.  Approximately 10,000 families have a specific Traveller accommodation need and those plans aimed to meet that need.  They fell short and delivered fewer than 7,000 but the ambition was there.  In some cases the money was allocated but the project did not proceed.  We will change the system to ensure such plans are followed through.  Communities should realise that previous Governments attempted to invest in this area when resources were available, as will this Government.  We must ensure we get the resources.  Even when the money was there, we sometimes did not get the desired results.  Some brilliant projects came through the system, some of which I have visited and which are managed extremely well.  They work much better when caretakers are involved, they are well maintained and all residents agree to a standard of maintenance.  That goes down very well and helps to get projects accepted by local communities, which is an area on which we must also work.  I have visited other projects that are of very poor standard.  I visited sites in Galway on which the accommodation standard is deplorable and unacceptable in terms of current living standards.<\/p><p> Senator Kelleher asked if I accept the scale and urgency of the problem.  I accept that there is a serious problem in certain areas and that major changes are needed in that regard.  The report presents the demands that exist in each county.  Some have done quite well but others have not.  The scale and urgency of the problem is very pressing in some counties and less so in others.  We must take action where it is needed and that is what we are trying to do.  We will not hold back in terms of the urgency required to tackle this issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#H01200","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1809,"content":"<p>As regards the private rental sector, we, along with the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee and the Residential Tenancies Board, produced a report last year on the experiences of Travellers in private rental accommodation and can make that available to the committee.

However, it is to be hoped that as we invest far more taxpayers' money into various housing solutions, we will not have to rely upon the private sector to the same extent and it will not have as much power.  Senator Kelleher is correct that the figures indicate that quite a high number of families who are on the homeless list or in emergency accommodation are from a Traveller background.  That is certainly the case in the greater Dublin region.  It has been particularly difficult to get accommodation for those families and that is a reality with which we must try to deal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#J00600","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1814,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses and the Minister of State for their attendance.  This is an important issue, which is one of the reasons for their attendance and why the committee decided to put this in our programme.  I apologise for stepping out of the meeting.  I was here earlier but had to attend the Seanad Committee of Selection to ratify some transfers and other items.  However, I read the submissions and wish to home in on one or two areas.  I mainly direct my questions to the Minister of State.<\/p> <p>  We are told that much of the delay in delivering Traveller accommodation is due to planning issues.  As a member of a local authority for many years, I know there are many other reasons for such delay.  There are several issues in this regard.  We must carry out a root and branch analysis of all planning applications that have gone through a Part VIII process for approval and determine the stage such applications are at.  Every local authority has included a Traveller accommodation programme, TAP, in its county development plan, as all members are aware.  However, in many cases that is where it stops.  The programme is included in the plan and all involved agree that the box has been ticked and the local authority has a Traveller accommodation programme.  However, in some cases nothing further happens.<\/p> <p>  I wish to acknowledge that there are some very good Traveller accommodation set-ups.  I lived very close to one with which its residents and the local community are exceptionally happy.  As the Chair is aware, that Traveller accommodation, beside the soldiers and sailors public park in Monkstown, is very much a success story.  Councillors, including myself, in conjunction with the council executive, decided to put a playground at the entrance to the Traveller accommodation site.  The playground is used by everybody, regardless of their colour, creed, status, religion or anything else.  It is a clear example that where resources and structures are put in place, such projects can be successful.  The playground is being used.  The Chair is familiar with it.  Children know no division and do not seek divides among people.  The commonality in that project is play and engagement, and Traveller children and other children - there is no such thing as ordinary children - are all engaging there.  It is an example of how the siting of Traveller accommodation is of great importance.  The people who live there are happy, as are local residents and the council.  It is a beautiful park and a lovely playground.  Such success can happen but requires engagement and constructive thinking.  Many people asked why a playground would be situated there but children were playing in it within days of it being opened.  I cite that example because I am familiar with it and pay tribute to those from D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council who were involved in the project.<\/p> <p>  All members know of very successful Traveller accommodation in their own areas.  We must get the model and sizing right.  We must get people who are happy to live there.  However, several Traveller accommodation sites which I have recently visited contain empty units that are boarded up with metal shuttering.  When I contact the local authority regarding such units, I am given reasons such as suggested antisocial behaviour or inter-family rivalry.  However, the Traveller community, their advocates, the Department and the committee must ask why such Traveller accommodation units are empty and why we cannot bridge the divide and get them reopened.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps the Minister of State might reconsider reviewing how many Part VIII applications have been made in each the 31 local authorities and how many have been approved.  Part VIII applications have a continuous life.  They do not end but, rather, stay there.  They are approved.  We should see why we cannot take action in regard to some of the approved Part VIII applications because to do so makes sense.  They have been through a public consultation process and should be progressed.  It is a big issue.  Local councillors have let some programmes down.  There has been opposition from all parties and none to some applications, which is unsatisfactory.  However, there are successful projects throughout the country to which we must look and ask why they are successful.  I cite the example in Monkstown Avenue which has a community playground at the entrance to the Traveller accommodation.  The Travellers, the community and the council are happy.  That is what we should be achieving everywhere and I ask the Minister of State to consider the example set by that site.  We should conduct an analysis of all current Part VIII applications and then go back to the local authorities, tell them that engagement and consultation has been carried out, issues in regard to the acquisition of the necessary lands have been dealt with, and demand a scheme from each local authority.  It would be great to be able to say that within the next few months we would have a scheme from each of the 31 local authorities.  We must start somewhere, and that would be a start.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#J00700","speaker":"1379"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1815,"content":"<p>I thank the Senator for his comments.  There are a number of reasons for delays in delivering projects.  One is the planning process and another is site selection.  There needs to be a commitment from all sides to make it happen as well as a conversation with all the various stakeholders about the realistic possibilities on a specific site and what is possible on a particular site.<\/p> <p>  The Senator mentioned that there are vacant properties.  There can be different reasons that.  We might not want to use a property or it might have been offered and it was refused for accommodation purposes, which happens with all social housing projects.  In other cases, it relates to the management of the site, estate or accommodation in question.  Rather than walk away from some of these problems because they are difficult to solve, we need to get around the table and solve them.  From what I can see,  in some cases due to the fact that everyone is very busy, they get put to one side for a while and suddenly that period becomes a year and then two years.  We need bring focus to this issue through this committee, the expert group and the work of the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, NTACC, and track progress.<\/p> <p>  The Senator is correct regarding the need for an analysis of Part VIII proposals.  We do a good deal of work on that in the Department.  I can get the Senator a report on that.  We track those proposals.  I was asked by colleagues earlier what we are doing to make these happen while we are waiting for a new report.  Part of that involves tracking some proposals that have been allocated money, granted planning permission and that have gone through the Part VIII process.  We do that.  I will get the Senator a report on that.<\/p> <p>  Like the Senator, I have seen plenty of projects that have worked extremely well and there has been a great acceptance of the various estates and projects by communities.  That generally happens when they are well designed, built and maintained and everybody agrees to look after their area and then does so.  With many social housing projects, regardless of whether they are Traveller-specific, there are difficulties with the planning process and with them being accepted by some communities.  That applies to social housing projects across the board.  Often we try to be upfront with members in explaining the reasons for delays on certain sites for rapid build housing.  It can sometimes be down to a difficulty with planning and in getting a project accepted by a community.  That is something we are working on to see if we can improve that process and bring more planning gain to it.<\/p> <p>  As the Senator said, a playground is a great example of a project that worked very well.  That is a planning gain.  That is the type of project we are looking at.  It comes down to putting in place the right resources and the right team of people.  Without doubt, the management and maintenance of accommodation and maintaining it to a high standard and quality for all the right reasons makes all these projects much more acceptable and we should also be able to get them through the system much more quickly.  I will come back to the Senator with an analysis of the Part VIII proposals.<\/p> <p>  Neither I nor the Minister, Deputy Murphy or any of those in my Department are happy with vacant properties not being used, regardless of the social housing projects for which they were built.  They should be utilised.  We have made almost &euro;150 million available in recent years to bring voids back into use.  Most long-term voids have been dealt with, although there are still some short-term ones, and that includes Traveller-specific accommodation.  It is not acceptable that accommodation that is available and ready for use lies empty.  I cannot be any clearer than that.  We have been very clear in sending out that message.  Generally, local authority managers and teams accept that also and they have worked hard to bring many properties back into use.  We have brought more than 7,000 voids that had been lying idle for a number of years back into the system.  That is progress.  It is not often talked about but it is good progress.  We had voids in the first instance because of a lack of resources but we cannot let that happen again.  We have made it clear to the local authorities that we must have a high level of maintenance to keep these properties in use all the time and to have a quick turnaround in their use.  I understand the Senator's point, namely, that in certain areas specific accommodation can lie idle for other reasons as well, but that needs to be dealt with and not merely put to one side.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#K00100","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1816,"content":"<p>I would make two requests of the Minister of State for the benefit of this committee.

My second request is that he would provide us with a comprehensive report of the proposals that have gone through the Part VIII process, which involves a public consultation planning process - in essence, the Part VIII proposals that have been completed.

The number of disgraceful situations around the country speaks for itself.  We have a major problem.  We had the Carrickmines situation which was one of the greatest avoidable tragedies that took place in this country.  The aftermath of it, when the alternative accommodation was opposed by the local community, told us a lot.<\/p> <p>  The Bishop's Field halting site in Galway was found to be overcrowded on foot of an examination of it.  Nothing is happening about it.  There is a worse case in that a temporary halting site was provided on the Curragh Line beside a very large disused tip head, which had been used for Galway city for many years, and the Minister of State will be aware of the dangers associated with that.  Galway County Council got planning permission of three years' duration for it.  I supported that application at the time.  The council did nothing in that three-year period, and a month prior to the end of the three-year period, it applied for a new permanent permission on an unsuitable site.  We had the unusual situation of the Travellers and the local community traders going into the council and stating that the site could not be made permanent but that they accepted there should be an extension of the permission because there was nowhere else for them to go.  They were literally put up against the wall.  That was about four years ago.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la scarified them and gave Galway City Council one year - the site is in Galway County Council's jurisdiction - to resolve the issue.  Three years later the council has been in default on that.  I must be critical of Galway County Council as it has not pursued enforcement in that respect with the same energy with which it would pursue other people who broke the law.<\/p> <p>  We have to face up to the facts.  We cannot pussyfoot around this issue.  There are local authorities throughout the country that will do anything to avoid facing up to this issue and then they wonder why there are illegal sites.  I am not talking about the illegal one that this council has, which is the ultimate disgrace, but the reason people in other circumstances are forced to have unofficial halting sites.  A procession of Travellers call to the clinic I hold in Galway every Monday.  They find it harder than others to get private rented accommodation.  Families with children in any event find it harder than families without children to get rented accommodation.  I apologise for being long in making this point but I am sure the same issue is replicated around the country.  There is also a feeling among those in the local authorities that do the job well that they will get a non-solvable problem because people will migrate from the local authority areas that are avoiding their responsibilities into the areas that are dealing with what they should be dealing with.<\/p> <p>  I believe in solutions to problems. We should stand back and take stock of a problem.  The first consideration is the Traveller accommodation programme, TAP.  For the moment, that should be left as it is.  The local authorities should be allowed to prepare the TAP in the same way that they prepare the county plans.  I presume that is subject to oversight by the Minister of State's Department or by the new planning regulator just as the rest of the plan will be.  However, we must face up to a reality.  In more than 90% of all other planning proposals, once the local authority elected members are finished with the proposed planning, the decision on individual planning proposals is not a matter for the local authority members.  I would not altogether agree with Deputy Barry in that it is an unusual feature - it is exclusively because we are talking about local authority lands - that the permission is granted by a vote of the members as opposed to an independent body, namely, the executives in the council acting off their own bat or, if it is contentious, inevitably, An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Therefore, my firm belief is that this is not working.  We threw money at this issue in the 2000s, as the Minister of State rightly pointed out, because we were told that a lack of funding was the problem, but that did not work.  Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that planning for Traveller housing should go to where most planning proposals go if they are contentious, namely, to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and it would be legally obliged to have regard to the TAP in making its decisions.<\/p> <p>  I hear about a long process being involved.<\/p><p>In County Galway the planning application for the Apple data centre is still very contentious.  The vast majority of people want it to go ahead.  In looking at the rules, the Government was very quick to state it would make adjustments.  The reality is this Traveller planning issue has been going on for years and we have not made any decisions.  Wishing and hoping people will do what people will not do is a waste of time.  I am not convinced many local authority members want this particular power because, let us be honest about it, many of their constituents would rather close their eyes to a human rights injustice than see a hard decision made that might in some way impinge on them.  It is time for decisions.  If I thought we would get a decision and a process in place by the autumn of this year, I would be pleased, knowing the way the system works.  Beyond this would be totally unacceptable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#K00500","speaker":"1312","continuing":true},{"type":"unspoken","time":1520501400,"counter":1820,"content":"<p>Deputy Pat Casey took the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1821,"content":"<p>We thought that by getting Travellers to avail of a voluntary housing company they set up themselves, we would get around this problem, but a new problem has arisen.

After this, it should be like all other planning decisions.  My belief is if we really want to tackle this problem, we should take the local authority members out of individual planning decisions.<\/p> <p>  How many of all the thousands of planning applications made to a local authority would go through if they had to go to local authority membership votes?  How many of them would be subject to such pressure that they would be put on the long finger?  Make it the same as everything else, whereby it is a third party system with An Bord Plean&aacute;la.

The performance against the drawdown on the part of local authorities was actually much greater when there was far greater money around in 2008.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#L00300","speaker":"1372"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1824,"content":"<p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is absolutely right.  There are too many disgraceful cases and this is why we are here.  There are some great projects and some have been very successful, but some of the sites I have visited are nothing short of disgraceful, and I agree with the Deputy on this.  He went through the history of a particular Galway site, which I have also visited.  It is a failure - there is no other way to put it - that it has dragged on for so long.  I find it hard to believe solutions cannot be found in the city of Galway to find accommodation for people.  It is not acceptable and it is something we must deal with.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#L00350","speaker":"1264"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1520501400,"counter":1825,"content":"<p>Deputy Maria Bailey resumed the Chair.<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1826,"content":"<p>In saying this, while the site is temporary and people are there without permission now, the accommodation is not acceptable either.  In some cases, people possibly cannot wait for a solution for the site without finding new accommodation and putting it on the site, because some of the accommodation is just disgraceful.  It is not acceptable and people should not be asked to live in it.  I have made this clear to the local authority also and we will deal with it to find solutions.  There are different forms of temporary solution.<\/p><p>What the Deputy said is discussed in his clinics reflects what a lot of us also see in our clinics.  A high percentage of people from a Traveller background find it extremely difficult.  This is what Senator Kelleher also said earlier and I agree.  There is a similar occurrence in my clinics.  Again, this is why we are here and why we are bringing the focus of the committee, my focus and the focus of various experts to this through the NTACC to try to make this happen and make changes.  It has been going on for a long time.  I read reports from the early 1990s and before that, and we have not moved on enough on this.  There have been some great projects in this time but not enough.  This is not because of a shortage of money.  It is because the progress was not there.<\/p><p>I agree the TAP is a good process to identify and make commitments on needs but it does not always make the selection of sites and deal with this end of it.  I know from being involved as a councillor in my early days that there was difficulty in finding transient sites.  If we are to bring solutions here, we also need to have some transient sites to accommodate in a much better way, which is acceptable to everybody, the culture of moving around from county to county, with proper transient sites that are well serviced and maintained for people who can book in and out.  It would be much better than an <i>ad hoc<\/i>site without planning that can cause difficulties for everybody involved.  The TAP process is good from this perspective.  It does not always deal with planning issues or site selection, which is part of the problem also.<\/p><p>The Deputy has suggested solutions, which I will bring to the expert group.  I will not prejudge its work, but a range of people here have suggested various solutions and they can all be looked at.  It is very clear to me that everybody here wants solutions and wants to put us in a position to be able to spend money, and this is what we also want to do.<\/p><p>I agree absolutely that it has gone on too long.  Originally we agreed to set up the first report and this has been completed for almost a year.  Last July, I was asked if I would agree to an expert panel that would make changes that we would have to work on and I agreed absolutely.  I agreed with it that day and did not wait for a second meeting.  This process is taking longer than I would have liked, but we are at a stage now where an expert panel can be established quite soon, and there is no reason it should not report in the summer with decisions being made in the autumn at the latest.  We are on the same timelines here.  I do not see any reason for slippage.  A lot of the evidence and research we need has been gathered, and it is just to make some firm recommendations and decisions.  I am happy to work with the committee and share the process with it throughout the system.  Someone asked about coming back and there is no problem.  I will come back as often as the committee wants me to on this issue.  We all have to refocus here, because the standard of accommodation in some of these cases is not acceptable.  Again, I want to be very clear that it needs everybody, all stakeholders and all sides, working together to find solutions.<\/p><p>With regard to whether we make quick changes on data centres, this is not technically true.  We set out a commitment to make changes, the same as I have set out today.  These changes must go through the Houses of the Oireachtas and they will be in the Seanad on Report Stage, with some recommendations and amendments that may not pass.  We have not made the changes but we have made a commitment.  Likewise, I am making a very strong commitment here, as is the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that we want changes to make this happen and get this money spent and make this progress.  This is what we can do as a Government.  The process has to go through the Houses and I respect the process.  I recognise the commitment of the committee in this area.  It can be difficult for some people, but the committee is very strong and clear on this, and it is good to have this support in doing our work.<\/p><p>To answer Senator Warfield, I did not go into the percentage of every budget.  They have all been slashed too much across all of the services, never mind just housing.  Any budget for providing services, including education, to people who need them have been cut and slashed far too much.  The aim here is to put the money back in as quickly as possible.  I do not have a target of what I want to get back to.  When the money was allocated by previous Governments, they were complimented on it but it was not always spent.  Over a five-year TAP process we saw money spent in the last two years but not necessarily in the first three years, and the reports reflect this.  There have been various degrees of 80% and 90%, and it probably hovers at approximately 80% in most years.  It is not enough and it has dropped a lot lower in recent years.<\/p><p>I have no problem fighting for an increased budget, and we will get it because there is a commitment.  It has been gradually increasing over recent years, with an extra &euro;3 million this year.  It will not be enough, but if we cannot spend what we have, it will not help me make the argument for more money.  This is why I want to be able to have a stronger business case so that when I go to my Department for various discussions on social housing projects and when we go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to look for more money, and we have a lot of money ring-fenced for housing in the coming years, we are able to show, as we have to be able to, that we can spend it in a proper and high-quality way, with high design that is acceptable to everybody and brings in solutions.  This commitment is there.<\/p><p>Eventually, we probably need to go beyond the money allocated in 2008 and 2009, when we can get there, but this is about the process of making sure we get it spent and that we can find Traveller-specific accommodation that is acceptable to the Traveller community and that the members of the community like and want, that they are part of that decision-making process, and that they also understand that some sites have a limited amount of space and some do not.  However, we must plan enough to deal with the demand for Traveller-specific accommodation and other types of accommodation they want according to various research.<\/p><p> There was one last question about performance.  We will try to track the performance of the various local authorities in this.  Some of them are extremely good at this and put considerable work into it.  Some local authorities have met barriers they have not been able to overcome.  We are trying to help them through that.  Not all local authorities have the same commitment.  There is a variance.  We want a standard approach across the system.  Everybody needs to live up to their responsibilities here.  In some cases there is an avoidance of responsibility.  In some cases it can be difficult to get solutions.  That is no reason not to find solutions.  We need to make it happen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#L00400","speaker":"1264","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1828,"content":"<p>In response to Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, the report highlighted the long delays in the provision of Traveller accommodation.

We are here to bring solutions that have come from our community, and it is unfortunate that we have run out of time within this session due to the overrun in the first session.  We are hopeful that we will get the time to outline our solutions in the discussion period.<\/p> <p>  We welcome the report commissioned by the Minister of State, Deputy English, into funding for Traveller-specific accommodation and the implementation of Traveller accommodation programmes.  We also welcome his decision on the advice of the NTACC to review the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act.  However, we are mindful that this Act was reviewed in 2004 and today we are bringing the same recommendations to the committee.<\/p> <p>  Despite the requirements within the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 to address the cultural needs of our community, we have experienced long-term insufficient accommodation provision within the State.  As already mentioned, in May 2016, the European Committee of Social Rights found that Ireland was in breach of its obligations regarding provision of accommodation, living conditions and eviction rights by not having the safeguards that should be in place for evictions.  In the resolution adopted in October 2016, the committee concluded that Ireland violated Article 16 of the charter under five grounds.<\/p><p>To date no directive or amendment to policy or practice has been put in place by the State to redress those violations.  That needs to be addressed by the expert panel as a matter of urgency.<\/p><p> The European Committee of Social Rights also found there was a not insubstantial shortfall of transient accommodation across the country, and of the 1,000 transient bays identified as needed in the 1995 task force report, only 54 are in existence nationwide and are not functioning as proper well-managed transient sites.  Hearing the comment and commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy English, to the delivery of transient accommodation is most welcome to the Irish Traveller Movement and its members.<\/p><p> In the 20 years since the Act came into effect, the delivery expected under the overseeing monitoring body, the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, NTACC, governed by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, has not happened.  In fact, NTACC has overseen consistent underdelivery and underspending.  Nothing happens, except that the Travelling community continues to live in Third World conditions.  This has not been addressed.  We are hoping for charge during the upcoming review of the Act.<\/p><p> Figures are not available to us for 2016 and 2017, but I want to outline some of the trends since the development of the Traveller accommodation programmes which came into place in the year 2000.  Although I will focus on the statistics, it is important to note that the community is suffering and many Travellers are living in Third World conditions, with their cultural needs not being recognised and catered for.  This must change.  My colleagues will focus further on that.<\/p><p> It is welcome that we can broadcast our video because figures paint a picture but seeing people living under those conditions, which they do day in, day out, and seeing little children struggle with them gives the committee members a flavour of the reality that Travellers are facing.  During that period the number of Traveller families counted by the State as in need of accommodation has more than doubled.  However, the number of Traveller families living on unauthorised halting sites has halved.  That looks promising if it were not for the fact that the number of people sharing overcrowded housing rose from approximately 1,000 people in the year 2000 to approximately 4,724 in 2016.<\/p><p> Since the year 2002, there has been an almost threefold increase in the number of Traveller families sharing housing.  There has been almost a 16-fold increase in the number of families who are now living in private rented accommodation, which is not permanent secure accommodation.  That cannot be deemed as meeting the target in the Traveller accommodation legislation.  It is neither permanent nor culturally appropriate accommodation.  The number of families in specific group housing schemes has only doubled.<\/p><p> The recent review report found that the option of living in private rented accommodation is \"extremely difficult for Traveller families to access\", yet we know that some local authorities use private rented housing as the alternative to staying on a waiting list for Travellers wanting culturally appropriate specific homes.  These local authorities use the option of private rented accommodation as a means of reaching their targets, which as I have said is not the same as providing permanent, safe, secure and culturally appropriate accommodation for Travellers.  The local authorities are not meeting their targets.<\/p><p> There has been a critical rise of homelessness, with 517 Travellers affected, which is 11 times higher than the rise experienced by the general population in the past five years.  Homelessness is three times higher for Travellers compared with the doubling of homelessness for the majority population.<\/p><p> The figures clearly show that in the 16 year period up to 2015, the policy adopted set low targets for developing Traveller-specific accommodation, such as halting sites, group housing and transient sites, whereas high targets were set and have been overdelivered on standard housing.  There has been a lack of adequate planning for population growth and inaction on overcrowding and homelessness.  We have all heard stories and there have been case studies of the impact of overcrowding on the health and safety of families.  No child deserves to live in unsafe and unhealthy conditions.  We need to identify overcrowding as a problem to be addressed in the planning process throughout the country.<\/p><p> There is no reference to the delivery of transient accommodation to facilitate nomadism.  Overall there has been underdelivery of targets for Traveller accommodation by local authorities coupled with underspending of the allocated budgets.<\/p><p> I will discuss in detail areas of consistent underdelivery, use of temporary accommodation and lack of Traveller-specific provision, which is widespread.  Some 963 families, comprising approximately 4,700 men, women and children are sharing or living in overcrowded accommodation.  The highest recorded numbers in 2016 were in the county council areas of Carlow, Kerry, Limerick, Meath and Wexford, and in Cork City Council.  In the review report, local authorities agreed overcrowding was an issue leading to &ldquo;health and safety concerns&rdquo; and all stakeholder groups agreed &ldquo;that the future assessment of need for Traveller families was unfit for purpose\".<\/p><p> Twenty-six out of a total of 31 local authorities responded to the survey under the review that we are discussing today, and only 22 had all the data needed to answer all the questions in the survey.  This could suggest a level of disregard in some local authorities.  Since the Act came into force, only 68% of units were provided and &euro;55 million from the allocated budgets went unspent.  We have all heard of the level of underspending and the lack of sanctions for this failure.  The local authorities that continue to fail in spending the allocation in their budgets year after year are not directed to address this failure.  The failure to spend the money allocated in the budget to address Traveller accommodation must be a priority area to be addressed.  We welcome the recommendation of imposing sanctions on local authorities that continue to underspend their budget allocation.<\/p><p> In the past two decades, increasingly regressive eviction legislation has been introduced, whereby speedier and harsher forced evictions are permitted against Travellers or transient families living by the roadside.  These eviction laws have been passed and used even though the Government has failed in the past 20 years to implement Traveller accommodation programmes to provide permanent and transient halting sites and other accommodation to Travellers, thereby criminalising and eroding the nomadism which is an important element of the cultural identity of Travellers.  That element of Traveller culture needs to be recognised and prioritised as there is no well-managed and maintained transient accommodation to be used for that purpose.<\/p><p> I have some suggested solutions, but to facilitate the showing of the video, I am willing to share them as part of the discussion.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#M00600","nonspeaker":"Ms RoseMarie Maughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1834,"content":"<p>I thank Ms Maughan.

Overcrowding and unsafe living conditions are the reality for many Travellers living throughout the country, as well as the isolation they experience by being placed on the outside of towns, often in completely unhealthy environments, such as the dump at Carrowbrowne or near a crumbling cliff in Spring Lane.  Spring Lane in Cork is home to 31 families and 12 single adults.  The site is seriously overcrowded with very poor sanitation facilities.  The living nightmare of sites such as this is having a detrimental impact on Traveller health and well-being and on the right of their children to thrive as equals.<\/p> <p>  There has been a gross failure of delivery of Traveller accommodation, with no sanctions imposed on local authorities for not meeting their own targets.  Even when plans are agreed and funding is available, there are long and unreasonable delays in building getting started, as can be seen with the current situation with Labre Park in Ballyfermot.  The high number of families living without permanent accommodation or in inadequate accommodation has particular consequences for Traveller women and children.  Women spend more time in the home and are the primary carers so they bear the brunt of having to cope with conditions such as poor or no sanitation, no running water, no refuse collection and especially no safe play areas for the children.  Accommodation is one of the key determinants of health, and the appropriate type and standard of Traveller accommodation impacts greatly on life expectancy.  According to the all-Ireland Traveller health study, almost one in three households living in temporary accommodation has no sewerage facilities and one in five has no piped water source.  A review of fire safety in Traveller accommodation in September 2016 found that 76% did not have a working smoke alarm, 72% did not have a working carbon monoxide alarm and the condition of electrical installations was an issue in 78% of the sites.<\/p> <p>  According to 2016 Government statistics, 536 families are now living in unofficial, unrecognised and unserviced accommodation and 1,876 families are sharing housing, sharing bays or living on unauthorised or basic service halting sites.  Young Travellers are living in dangerous, substandard and inadequate accommodation where there is serious overcrowding.  Unauthorised sites are where Travellers are forced to live on the roadside or in other poor environments.  We could substitute the word \"sharing\" for Travellers living in chronic overcrowding.  The term \"basic service bays\" refers to sites that are often rat infested and have poor facilities.  These Travellers are in effect homeless but they are not reflected in the Government's statistics on homelessness.  Their number was three times higher in 2016 compared with the 2011 census.  We have had almost 20 years of failed accommodation programmes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#O00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Bridget Kelly"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1838,"content":"<p>Pavee Point submitted two documents late yesterday at around 4.30 p.m.  I apologise for that but I hope members received them.  I do not propose to read the documents now but I will make a few overarching points.  My colleagues, Rose Marie Maughan from ITM and Bridget Kelly from the NTWF, put the issues in context very well, as did Angela Delaney.  That personal testimony is very powerful and could be replicated hundreds of times, if not thousands of times, across the country in terms of Travellers' experience with accessing accommodation.<\/p> <p>  We have just emerged from a very cold spell.  We had Storm Ophelia a few months ago as well as the beast from the east and Storm Emma last week.  We saw on RTE television and on other media outlets stories about pipes being frozen, leaking pipes, people being without water and tanks being brought into estates by local authorities so people can get access to water, and rightly so.  People have a human right to access clean running water.  However, this is a daily occurrence every winter for Travellers.  When exposed pipes are frozen or burst, Travellers must go to garages to get water to clean their children, wash themselves, feed themselves and prepare food.<\/p><p>No local authorities come onto the sites with tankers.  This goes unnoticed and certainly gets no publicity.  Travellers, as a result of this, are going to use swimming pools to wash themselves as well, if they are lucky enough to get in.  Many swimming pools will not allow Travellers in.  This happens every winter.  It is not a once in every 15 or 20 years event as was the beast from the east or Storm Ophelia.  That is the reality for hundreds of Travellers.  There are 5,000 Traveller men, women and children living in substandard primitive conditions.  The United Nations, UN, and other human rights bodies have said this constitutes a human rights violation.<\/p><p> It is important that we retain that language.  These are human rights violations.  This Oireachtas, this Government and this State, as my colleagues have said, continually fail Travellers in respect of access to culturally appropriate, adequate and secure accommodation, whether that is group housing schemes, halting sites or conventional housing.  That is the reality.  We need to hold on to that language.  It is a human rights abuse.  We welcome the review of the Act and think there is an implicit recognition there by the State and the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and Minister of State, Deputy English, that what is there is not fit for purpose.  I would describe it as shambolic.  What is happening to my community as a result is shameful and an indictment on society.<\/p><p> Ms Maughan alluded to the European Committee of Social Rights where Ireland was found wanting on five grounds in respect of inadequate provision, lack of legal protections around evictions and so forth.  Our starting point is the principle needs to be that what is there is not fit for purpose.  It is broken.  It is inherently fragmented and we need a new approach.  If we can establish and accept that principle, that we need a new approach, then we can begin to negotiate in a constructive way what should replace that.<\/p><p> I disagree with everybody here.  I am for decentralisation and local democracy.  However, in this context local democracy has not worked for my people.  It means more local democracy and less rights for Travellers.  That is the reality.  The evidence is overwhelming.  There is a need for a new approach in respect of Traveller accommodation provision.  We know there are going to be local elections next year in the summer of 2019.  We know the present Traveller accommodation programmes come to an end at the end of this year.  I urge the Government not to synchronises those events and not to try to develop or adopt Traveller accommodation programmes to coincide with a local election.  We all know what is going to happen.  Travellers are going to be used as a political football, as we have been all of our lives.<\/p><p> Unscrupulous politicians, of which there are many, let us be honest about this, will use this to garner some cheap political votes.  It is reckless, irresponsible and potentially incites hatred.  Somebody spoke about political leadership.  We need more political leadership at a time like this.  Travellers feel let down and disillusioned by the system.  When I say the system, I mean the Oireachtas, the State and the Government.  I hope that advice will be taken and the two processes separated.<\/p><p> Accommodation continues to be the most visible manifestation of the ongoing racism and exclusion of Travellers in this society.  Ms Delaney spoke about being forced to live on the side of tip heads, dumps and in remote isolated areas with no running water and no sanitation.  It is the opinion of many, and indeed the UN human rights bodies, that it continues to be the most visible manifestation of the ongoing racism and exclusion experienced by Travellers.  There has been much commentary on that.  Accommodation under international law is not just a stand-alone right.  Any human rights expert will say that it is an enabling right.  Having adequate accommodation allows people to access other rights such as access to education, employment and health care.  It is a linchpin.  It is not a stand-alone right.  Sometimes we lose sight of that.  In our discussions around this, we need to make those connections in respect of enabling other rights in health, education and so forth.<\/p><p> I work with a lot of good people in local authorities as well as public representatives and officials.  However, they are operating in a system that is fundamentally flawed and they will say that privately.  Some people say that supporting or voting for Traveller accommodation would be akin to a turkey voting for Christmas.  That is why I am suggesting we need to decouple the local elections and the adoption of Traveller accommodation programmes in 2019.  Overall, there is a culture of impunity.  Nobody is held to account.  All we get is a systems failure.  No individual is held to account.  I refer to the private sector where there are key performance indicators, KPIs, which need to be met.  I am not saying we should privatise because we know what happened with privatisation and the overreliance on that, so while I am certainly not advocating that, I am using it as an example.  There is no accountability.  No individuals are brought to account.  There is a culture of impunity.  Plans do not get implemented and there are no sanctions and no penalties.  That sends out a serious and dangerous message that this sort of behaviour is acceptable.<\/p><p> Chief executive officers of local authorities have an executive function.  They have the power to override the elected members if they fail to implement Traveller accommodation programmes.  We need more leadership from the chief executive officers of local authorities.  They need to do the right thing and implement the Traveller accommodation programme if the elected members fail to do it.  That power is not being utilised to the extent it should be.  I remind people of that.  Also, in the absence of local authorities fulfilling their obligations, there needs to be a moratorium on evictions.  No evictions should be carried out.  We saw that as a result of the terrible tragedy in Carrrickmines where ten people in our community lost their lives, there was a pathetic response of giving a fire alarm there, a fire blanket here and a little hose there.  I am sorry to say our community colluded with that.  I am embarrassed by that.  It was like rearranging the chairs on the Titanic when these sites are fundamentally and inherently dangerous for people to live on.  A major investment and refurbishment programme is needed, not a little alarm here, a fire blanket there and a hose there.  That was inexcusable and indefensible.<\/p><p> While I have an audience, I will continue.  I know we are operating in the frame around the review of the provision of and funding for Traveller accommodation.  However, there is also a sizeable Roma population in this country.  The most recent national Roma needs assessment, published by Pavee Point, spoke about the accommodation needs of Roma.  Many are living in vacant buildings and abandoned cars.  They are being let down by local authorities under housing Circular No. 41\/2012.  In all fairness to the local authorities, they are not responsible.  It is a circular from the Department of the Housing, Planning and Local Government that imposes huge restrictions on what local authorities can and cannot do to meet the housing needs of the Roma community.  We are looking for that circular to be repealed.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#O00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1840,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Collins.

I am joined by Mr. Seamus Hanrahan, who is the senior architect with Limerick City and County Council.  We share many of the concerns expressed here.  We are caught in the middle of the storm in many respects, so we welcome the review the Housing Agency has completed and, equally, the review of the Act and the expert panel that has been put in place.  I hope that will be in the next short while.  We do broadly share the view that significant change is needed.<\/p> <p>  It is a matter of record that the drawdown of funding, if we want to measure it in the context of performance over recent years, has not been what it could have been.  Ironically, if it is to be fairly expressed, looking at the Housing Agency report, in the earlier years in the first two TAP programmes, the targets were met 70% or 80% in the generality.  It may not have been entirely in respect of the type but the funding drawdowns and otherwise were reasonably successful.  What has happened in the past seven or eight years post recession is that the budgets have plummeted at one level and at the other level, ironically, the drawdown has plummeted as well in the context of those budgets.  There is a message in that.<\/p> <p>  The reason for that is always multifaceted.  The simple reality is that the local authority system took a severe pruning post-recession, the housing area in particular.   The pressures in that broad area, both in Traveller and standard accommodation, are significant.  We are trying to manage all our services with 20% less staff and with significantly reduced normalised budgets.  Traveller-specific budgets have been reduced as well.  All of those elements in a sense are contributing to that.<\/p> <p>  I will pick up on the budget scenario in a minute.  Some elements are contentious.  There are definitely issues.  Our colleagues here, Mr. Collins, Ms Maughan and Ms Kelly, sit on the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee, NTACC, as well.<\/p><p>We have met a lot of the local Traveller accommodation consultative committees and it is very obvious that our partnership is pretty good in those spaces.  We probably agree on this.  The thing delivers reasonably well.  Where it is not happening in those spaces, it does not work that well.  That is the simple reality.<\/p><p> In many respects the problem is reflected here.  Members will have seen it in the video.  Local elected representatives merely reflect the chasm between the settled community and their acceptance of Traveller accommodation.  We are sitting in the middle of that storm and we find that really difficult to resolve in the majority of cases.  For example, Mr. Collins said that the chief executives should do more with their powers, but it is even more complicated than that, as was outlined.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v averted to the difficulty whereby there is decision-making power on one side of the issue but not where the land issue is concerned.  It is not quite as simple as a need for the chief executives to do more.<\/p><p> We really want a situation where Traveller accommodation is delivered in a relatively normal fashion as a part of standard procedure, not by imposition.  Imposition automatically hardens reservations or poisons relations with the other side.  The simple reality is that chief executives, myself included, are very slow to resort to that, because it is a space from which there is no coming back.  We need to get to a point where we can start delivering appropriate Traveller accommodation on the basis of acquiescence and understanding from the respective communities.<\/p><p> There are a few issues which have to be addressed.  I would not object to more evidence-based research here because we have to change the things that are informing the view of the settled community and creating the resistance.  We also have to change the dialogue.  Some of these issues are merely perception in many instances.  However, we have to do something societally to change those perceptions.  The maintenance of the existing sides is impinging on people's perception of the situation of the Traveller community.  Wherever the fault lies, if we are to use that word, the settled community perceives that Traveller-specific accommodation has a significant impact on them.  This must be addressed somehow.<\/p><p> There is another element which I think is significant.  Travellers have either aggregated into urban areas or they have been forced to.  Their natural cultural relationship with horsemanship, if I could use that language, is a locus of conflict, because there are two competing tendencies here.  One is Travellers' wish to sustain solely residential settled occupation, and the other is activity around horses.  That is an inherent part of their culture.  Somehow we have to talk about that issue and create a solution that satisfies both parties.  From my perspective, that dialogue is not really happening at the moment.<\/p><p> At the moment, the system is pushing solutions that frankly do not meet the needs of the Traveller community.  We must somehow change this system so that it does meet these needs, and we must do so in a way that creates genuine understanding.  To be fair, that is happening in some areas, but in other areas the chasm is just too great.  That is simply reflected across the political system.  We must create another dialogue.  I see this review, the review of the Act and the expert panel as an opportunity to commence that dialogue and to try to create the necessary fundamental change.<\/p><p> There are other practical issues here.  The complexity of funding and approval systems have a bearing on this.  The Traveller community perceives local authorities to have a budget.  We do not have a budget.  The Oireachtas votes a budget annually and we make an application for an element of that budget.  For example, in the current year we will be informed what the allocation to the individual local authorities will be.  That allocation is from a Vote of very limited funding.  Last year I had a budget of &euro;500,000, of which only &euro;38,000 was drawn down by the end of the year.  There was &euro;500,000 to spend, but there was a period between the allocation of funding and the projects we had to do.  I would not argue that we pursued these goals as quickly as we could have.  However, local authorities must go through processes related to procurement, getting contractors on site and consultation with the Traveller community before a project can be executed.  I accept that, in some respects, those are excuses.  If I had one appeal it would be to change the process to one of multi-annual funding or some other structure.  In the earlier meeting, it was noted that in previous years of the Traveller accommodation programme, TAP, the spend came at the end of the year.  That reflects the need for planned progression of spend.  The Traveller accommodation programme involves a process of identifying sites and moving forward with them.  The reality is that it takes two or three years and the spend only comes at the end of the TAP.  The answer to that is to make the budgets multi-annual and allow them to function as a continuum.<\/p><p>I wish to make a couple of other points.  I am not certain that the Traveller representatives would agree with this, but from my point of view, having some sort of standardised template for the nature of the different types of accommodation to be provided would help to streamline the process.  We need not try to reinvent the wheel.  I am not saying there would not be architectural involvement in changes of layout etc.  I refer to the type of basic specifications that we are moving towards in standard social housing.  It does not mean that the houses will look the same.  However, there will be basic specifications for the facilities to be provided.  If those were agreed at national level, it would certainly help to streamline our activities.<\/p><p> In response to a point raised by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, I would not object to another approach that would go through the normal planning processes.  The Part VIII process is a difficulty here.  The committee should have no illusions about that.  I refer to the approved housing bodies AHBs.  I am conscious of CENA and the difficulties it has had in some places, but I would welcome more of that.  It facilitates another entity, ideally on private lands, making an application through the normal planning processes, with An Bord Plean&aacute;la having the final say.  We would welcome that.<\/p><p> Moreover, the overall budgets need to increase significantly.  There is no point in saying otherwise.  The Traveller community's overall housing need, demand and population is increasing, and we have to address that collectively.  I make that point in the context of the reduced budgets in recent times.  This is hard to explain, but sometimes it is easier to deliver a &euro;3 million scheme than a &euro;300,000 scheme.  The &euro;3 million scheme gets the resources and full application.  I will cite a specific example, and I know there are many similar cases.  I have one halting site for which I need between &euro;2 million and &euro;3 million.  It is very difficult for anybody at Department level to sign off on expenditure of &euro;3 million in any one year, when the national budget was between &euro;6 million and &euro;8 million a year or two ago and is now &euro;9 million.  That quantum of money must be increased.<\/p><p>We are not talking about large-scale solutions but we need to get back to the early parts of the Traveller accommodation programme, TAP, programmes where there was &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000 per unit on average.  That is the reality if one wants to provide proper solutions and the quality of accommodation the community requires.  That scale of intervention is needed.  It is not doable for &euro;20,000 per unit.  In today's terms, &euro;100,000 per unit is required to deliver Traveller-specific accommodation.  We need to think in those terms and get back to that budgetary place.  I thank the Chair.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1844,"content":"<p>From the perspective of Limerick City and County Council, we also welcome the report and agree with the vast majority of the recommendations coming from it.  Specifically, from an architectural perspective, which is my background, the discussion about standardisation of unit types is quite interesting.  The discussion around culturally appropriate accommodation gets to the nub of the issue.  The examination of that needs far more research and investigation.  A good study done in 1993 and Pavee Point was involved with it, namely, The President Robinson Awards for the Design of Traveller Accommodation.  That started to look at the issue of culturally appropriate accommodation.  The expert panel could make reference to that and build on the research that was done at that period to try to get a full and common understanding of what culturally appropriate accommodation actually is.<\/p> <p>  I refer to funding from the Limerick City and County council's perspective.  To take Mr. Walsh's point, back in the second TAP period, we spent over &euro;15 million, with a budget of &euro;15 million.  There was a significant spend in that period and it was in many ways easier to spend a larger amount of money.  However, we have been overspending on our current budgets for the last four years.

The committee members fully understand the witnesses frustrations that they are back here again talking about the same stuff that they were talking to the committee about in the D&aacute;il Committee on Housing and Homelessness two years ago and all the previous occasions.  The committee also understands, and maybe \"suspicion\" is not the right word, that the witnesses may want to welcome the review but that there is a nervousness that it is another review and it may not resolve the issues.  The reason this committee has decided to do this piece of work is because it wants to try to make sure that this time things genuinely change.  A number of the members of the committee have been talking and we are very keen that this will not be a one-off meeting but that the committee will meet in this format on a number of occasions throughout the piece of work of the expert group and the Government's follow up so that we can support and, as Senator Kelleher said, push it along at a faster speed.<\/p> <p>  My question to the Traveller advocacy organisations relates to the expert group.  Obviously there is long list of things that the witnesses would like to see changed, but if there was something they really wanted to prioritise in terms of a change that would come out of that expert group or the Government's actions afterwards, what would they like that to be?  The committee members could to try to focus on one or two key issues.  I appreciate that all the issues Mr. Collins raised are important but it would help for the committee to have a sense of his priorities in all that.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Walsh knows me well.  I am a very strong advocate of the local authorities and I defend the local authorities very strongly, often when they are coming in for unfair criticism.  This is one area where I am a strong critic.  It is not because I want to beat up on local government.  It is because the record is really poor.  I understand the delays with approval, tendering and procurement but last year, for example, the Department had to come back to the Oireachtas looking for an extra &euro;100 million because, by and large, local authorities were exceeding their general needs social housing targets yet we see that last year, they had the biggest underspend in Traveller accommodation budgets for quite some time.<\/p> <p>  Mr. Walsh mentioned his own local authority and it is a case in point.  I have the figures for the last three years here.  In 2014 there was a budget allocated of &euro;413,000, none of it was spent.  The following year there was a budget of &euro;263,000, but only 5% of that was spent.  Then last year only 4% was spent.  I am not picking on Waterford but what I do not understand is how, for example, Limerick significantly overspent last year and in the two years previous.  Last year, Limerick spent nine times what its allocation was.  How is it that some local authorities perform better than others?<\/p> <p>  I absolutely accept multi-annual funding.  That is eminently sensible.  Some of the suggestions around template designs are workable solutions but is Mr. Walsh suggesting, and I think he was at the end, that we should move away from Part 8?  If Traveller accommodation applications are then put, for example, through the standard process, how can we get over the land issue, the section 183?  If standard planning is used for Traveller accommodation, would managers be willing to step in and use their powers or are new ministerial powers needed to ensure the land is provided?  How will that circle be squared?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#R00400","speaker":"1215"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1847,"content":"<p>I call Deputy Barry and I ask the Deputy to tell the Chair who he wants to answer the question he will ask.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#R00500","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1848,"content":"<p>I thank the witnesses for coming in and for their presentations.  I am a Deputy for the Cork North-Central constituency.  As I mentioned to the Minister when he was in earlier on, Cork North-Central is the constituency that contains Spring Lane, Blackpool and Nash's Boreen.  I notice from some of the handouts that I have been given, that those halting sites, had been highlighted as case studies of what is wrong and what is shameful, in how issues have been dealt with.  I strongly agree with those points.<\/p> <p>  I listened to the points raised by Mr. Walsh about resistance and opposition from within the settled community being an issue and a problem in terms of resolving Traveller accommodation issues.  I am familiar with that.  Yes, that is an issue, but the point is, it cannot be an excuse and it does not explain the situation.  It does not explain the fact there was &euro;40 million for Traveller accommodation in 2008 but that it was cut to &euro;4 million. There was a 90% cut in the middle of the austerity years.  It does not address the issues raised by the European Committee on Social Rights, that there are human rights violations taking place here.  Where there are human rights violations taking place, whatever needs to be done in order to resolve them must be done.  That is my first question.  It is addressed to any or all of the representatives of the Traveller groups here today.<\/p> <p>  I refer to the question of taking powers out of the hands of local authorities and giving powers to a body that is charged with resolving issues, and An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been mentioned.  Could the witnesses give more information and detail as to what they would like to see in that regard?  I made the point earlier to the Minister that I would normally be extremely reluctant about taking powers from local authorities, but if there are human rights violations, that is a strong argument to say this has to be considered now.  I would like to hear more from the witnesses on how they would see that panning out.<\/p> <p>  The second question I have, again for any or all of the representatives of the Traveller groups, relates to Storm Ophelia.  Mr. Collins mentioned it in passing when he was talking about the weather crisis last week and what Travellers have to deal with on a regular basis.  It is a number of months since Storm Ophelia but I am struck by the number of people who are living in caravans that do not have a proper roof, the number of people who have been offered second-hand caravans with single glazed windows, caravans that are the wrong size for the halting sites and so on and the number of people who are still in emergency accommodation.  Do the witnesses have any more information on the number of people who are still in emergency accommodation after Storm Ophelia?  I would like to hear more about how that storm affected the community as well as the events of last week.<\/p><p> I have a final question which might seem a little bit off beat for a discussion at the housing committee but it is becoming more of an issue.  I have always noticed in my dealings with the Traveller community that there was an awareness, which was particularly strong among women, that Travellers would not be second class citizens anymore and there was a determination to fight against that.  It struck me from a number of dealings that I have had with young Travellers in recent times that that seems to be becoming a quite powerful feeling among young Travellers, in particular.  I had a conversation with a group of young Travellers around the time of the Standing Rock Native American protest in the United States.  They were extremely knowledgeable about it and talked about how members of the LGBT community in Ireland are now standing up for their rights as are other minority groups in Ireland and around the world.  I would be interested in hearing a little bit about changes in attitudes, consciousness and political awareness among Travellers in general but young Travellers in particular.  Do the witnesses notice particular changes as a result of the housing and the accommodation crises and other issues they are dealing with?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#R00600","speaker":"1432","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1850,"content":"<p>I endorse the comments made by Deputies Barry and &Oacute; Broin.

I am very conscious of what Mr. Collins said, that housing is an enabling right.  If one does not have housing, one does not have health.  I was really struck when Mr. Reilly said at the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care that 95% of Travellers are dead by the time they are 65 years of age.

It would be easy in some respects for the local authority system to get somebody else to do this because it is a tough space much of the time.<\/p> <p>  I do not wish to get into specifics, if the committee does not mind, and I will come back to Deputy &Oacute; Broin, separately.  I did not approve, and my officials did not make, an application for funding that we did not have to make without good intentions and a really serious intention of making it happen.  However, we could not make it happen.  There is something inherently wrong when that is the case.  People can say it was incompetence on our part but I can assure members there were other forces.  That is the way I would put it.<\/p> <p>  In the current year, it was a timing issue and the money has been spent and the work has been done but it is difficult.  That is the point.  It is difficult because there is so much resistance.  We do most things in our lives as statutory entities with the acquiescence of the majority of the people and part of the problem here is that if one does not have the acquiescence of the majority, it is very difficult to get it done and because the resistance comes from everywhere.  It is not only on one specific Part 8 application.  Every element of the equation is resisted.  That can be seen in some of the larger statutory processes - in planning and elsewhere, whether it is Shell to Sea or otherwise - where the acquiescence of the community is not there in substantial form.  The whole thing then is neutralised across a whole load of spaces.<\/p> <p>  The challenge is to change the dialogue and to change the reality because we have got to get to the point that both the settled community and Traveller community can come to an understanding and an accommodation that can allow these things to happen in a reasonably normal fashion.  One can say it is a statutory imposition or the State has failed but society is failing because it is society that is actually creating that resistance.  How can that be changed?  Let us use the example of drink driving.  We changed society's attitude to drink driving and did so through investment and by arguing and generating debate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Walsh"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1854,"content":"<p>The law.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#S00600","speaker":"1430"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1855,"content":"<p>I appreciate that but the law would not work without the other factors because the resistance would ultimately go against it.

I am 35 years a Traveller activist and a Traveller advocate.  In those 35 years of activism, I am not aware of an instance where the local authority proposed to build a site and there was no opposition.  I am not aware of a single instance where it was welcomed with open arms.  Maybe my colleagues have a different experience but I certainly have not.  In terms of acquiescence, we have tried negotiating, persuasion and dealing with local communities.  I remember in 1986 going to Tallaght when a site was being proposed.  It was a big mistake on my part.  The meeting was a big community centre with about 300 settled people and three Travellers.  I was lucky to get out with my bloody life in trying to persuade the local community to accept a site.<\/p><p>I am all for dialogue but it is about how it is framed.  In terms of acquiescence, human rights are non-negotiable.  Human rights in terms of access to accommodation are not something to be compromised or to be negotiated.  It is a human right and it needs to be framed in that way.  We have always adopted the approach where information, education and legislation have a huge bearing and a huge influence on people's behaviour.<\/p><p> I refer to one practical thing in terms of accommodation.  There is no constitutional right, or any other legal right, to accommodation in this country and I know there is a campaign to have incorporated into our Constitution the covenant on economic, social and cultural rights where the right to accommodation can be invoked before the courts.  We do not have that facility at the moment but I know there is a campaign going on to have that covenant incorporated into Irish law.  In fact, the United Nations committee recommended on a number of occasions that the Government incorporate the covenant on economic, social and cultural rights into Irish law so that these rights on accommodation can be invoked before the courts, so that needs to happen.<\/p><p> In terms of being politicised, people started at different times on different journeys but since 1985 I have seen huge politicisation and huge consciousness raising within the community and it is not just among Traveller organisations.  Every time a Traveller is discriminated against in a public house, a hotel or in public swimming baths, his or her consciousness is raised around human rights issues.  The oppressor can do that much more effectively than we can within the community.  It is important that people get organised and mobilised and that we develop alliances with other grassroots and other social movements, which is something we could do a lot more of.  That is why I am glad to say - I know the Irish Traveller Movement, ITM, is taking the lead on this - that on 7 April there is a mass rally around housing and accommodation.  ITM is trying to mobilise Traveller groups to get involved in that.  We need to see a lot more of that.  We did it in the early years with the Irish anti-apartheid movement, with Kader Asmal calling for laws to outlaw discrimination.  Even at that time, people were talking about changing attitudes.  We are having the very same debate now.  We need strong laws as well.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#S00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Martin Collins","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1858,"content":"<p>If there was one key ask, what we would ask for is implementation at local level.  We welcome the review, but in reality the provisions within the existing Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act are statutory and if they were put in place, it would address some of the issues in terms of the conditions in which Travellers have to live.  Implementation at local level is a key block and that would be a key ask.  Instrumental in that is the systematic, institutional racism and discrimination Travellers experience in all aspects of their lives, including societal.<\/p> <p>  I refer to Part 8.  Taking that consultation with the public out of the remit in relation to Traveller accommodation is key.  It is not a new concept and it has been said time and again.  It has been done in other areas where provision is difficult in terms of social housing and homelessness and if the number of units is under 100.  This is not difficult but there is absolutely no political will to make this happen.  To say that this is difficult with the onus of blame on the community is damning and shaming and it should not be said by public servants.  There is a public sector duty, which local authorities, like all State agencies, are obliged to implement from a human rights framework but they are not doing their duty on that in relation to Travellers and Traveller accommodation.<\/p> <p>  In terms of young people and politicisation, huge numbers of young Travellers are being so negatively impacted on in relation to accommodation.  We heard this morning about the conditions on a site and that is not unique to one part of this country.  A number of case studies have been submitted to the committee, including Labre Park and Spring Lane.  They are the big ones and they are the headliners but this is an everyday occurrence because Travellers are being subjected to substandard, and overcrowded conditions.  Implementation is key to ensure that projected need is addressed and to ensure that culturally appropriate provision is made available, and we do not need lessons in this day and age on what culturally appropriate accommodation is and should be.  We also have to address the countless Traveller-specific accommodation that is there in terms of sites or group housing that is substandard.  Given the lack of Traveller accommodation such sites have become more overcrowded, more dangerous and more unsafe and those conditions are not being addressed either.  Those are just some of them.<\/p> <p>  We also have to remember that the suicide rate among Travellers is eight times higher than the national average, and that is in a country that has one of the highest levels of youth suicide in Europe.  The impact of accommodation, as has been said earlier, across all aspects of Travellers' lives cannot be emphasised enough.  I refer to good health and good education.  I refer also to children leaving their homes in the morning without breakfast because of the toxic smells coming from the place in which they live, that is, a decommissioned site.  It is shameful that we are actually saying that because it should not be happening.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#T00200","nonspeaker":"Ms Maria Joyce"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1859,"content":"<p>Ms Maughan, you have 30 seconds to wrap up, if that is okay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#T00300","speaker":"1246"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520501400,"counter":1860,"content":"<p>I fully support what my colleagues, Mr. Collins and Ms Joyce, have said.  In terms of ITM members, we believe in democracy but unfortunately from what we heard today from elected representatives and from Traveller representatives, there is no democracy for Travellers who are living in third world conditions.  We had engaged with these structures in which we had high hopes when we got the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act over the line.  We thought and we hoped it would work.  We worked hard and shed blood, tears, sweat, you name it, to make sure it would work.  It has not worked.  It has failed miserably and it is down to the implementation at a local level.  We heard from different people in the room that one of the biggest blocks is Part 8 and it came up strongly in the review we are discussing as well as objections from local residents.  Local Traveller accommodation consultative committee, LTACC, members have said it is a block to Traveller accommodation.  ITM members have said taps are signed off on by the local Traveller accommodation consultative committee and then it goes before the council and the targets are diluted.  Some local authority representatives come out publicly with anti-Traveller racist sentiments towards Travellers but nothing is said and it is tolerated.  Some local representatives say Traveller-specific accommodation is a failed concept.  These people are sitting on the LTACC advising local authorities on our behalf on how Traveller accommodation programmes need to be implemented.  How is that democracy for Travellers?  How is that democracy for the poor innocent Traveller children living on the roadside?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/HPJ2018030800002#T00400","nonspeaker":"Ms RoseMarie Maughan"},{"type":"speech","time":1520501400,"counter":1861,"content":"<p>I was listening to the debate and if anybody doubts, scientifically, the evidence of prejudice against Travellers, he or she should read the reports over 30 years that have been done systematically by an t-Athair Micha&eacute;l MacGreil, where he shows that Travellers are the group against which there is the most prejudice in our society by a mile.
