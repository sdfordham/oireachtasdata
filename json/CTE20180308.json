I would like to highlight two issues with which I am not happy.  First, when we were discussing issues relating to the Garda College, a document was sent to the then Garda Commissioner by the head of legal affairs, Mr. Ken Ruane, in July 2017.  I understand it was a letter rather than a legal document but, nevertheless, the then Garda Commissioner claimed legal privilege.  When the current acting Commissioner, Mr. D&oacute;nall &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in came before the committee, I asked him whether he would release the document because the commissioner is no longer in place and one cannot claim privilege when one is no longer the Garda Commissioner.  I asked for that document to be released.  It is now four or five months later and we have received a two-line reply stating that the committee was previously advised in respect of the claim of legal privilege regarding the legal advice provided to the former Commissioner.  The position remains unchanged.  That is a joke.  Frankly, it is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable as a reply.  It does not look as if the request was considered.  It looks as if they were ticking a box to say that they came back to us - only because they were chased.  On the substantive matter, the acting Commissioner has not explained why he will not release a document which was given to the previous Commissioner, who claimed privilege in the role as commissioner but who is no longer in place.  How can Mr. &Oacute; Cual&aacute;in, as acting Commissioner, claim privilege in respect of a document that was sent to the previous Commissioner, who is no longer in place?  Even if he has some argument as to how he can do this, he needs to explain it to the committee.  This two-line letter is an insult to the Committee of Public Accounts.  It speaks volumes about what the acting Garda Commissioner thinks of the committee.  We need to respond, asking that the Garda authorities write back within a week and give a full explanation as regards that document.  We should also indicate that the document be released.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":13,"content":"<p>I will call Deputies Cullinane and Catherine Murphy in that order.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":14,"content":"<p>I wish to raise a second issue.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B00400","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":15,"content":"<p>Does it relate to this batch of correspondence?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B00500","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":16,"content":"<p>Yes.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B00550","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":17,"content":"<p>I have three issues and I propose to deal with them all, rather than coming in separately on each.  I understand the point Deputy Kelly is making on the legal advice given to the then Commissioner.  Can the Committee of Public Accounts get legal advice on whether privilege still exists when the then Commissioner is no longer in office?  I presume that the legal adviser to the acting Garda Commissioner is the same person as previously, namely, Mr. Ruane.  I question whether the latter is still bound by confidentiality.  To be fair to everybody involved, we need certainty regarding what is the actual position.<\/p> <p>  My second point is that we did a great deal of work on this issue.  In fact, we published our own report on the matters relating to the Garda College in Templemore.  If one reverts to the internal audit report, the headline issue - leaving aside the salacious stuff and the madness when had the heads of different departments, who almost collapsed before us - there was recommendations made by the head of internal audit and changes were to be made.

I refer to the fact that efforts are being made by other politicians to undermine the work of the committee.  We see it both inside and outside the D&aacute;il Chamber.  It happened in respect of this issue as well.  There was correspondence from some Government Deputies criticising members of the Committee of Public Accounts for defending the work of the committee.  We must defend the integrity of the committee and not allow people to make what are political charges.  They are entitled to do so but those charges should not go unchallenged.  We have an absolute right and entitlement to raise issues, especially those we raised in the context of Templemore.  The issues in question arose on foot of an internal audit report; we did not invent them.  The internal auditor said that he could not give any assurances whatsoever that the controls in place at the Garda College in Templemore are what they should be.  He said he was frustrated in his work.  We saw what happened.

It will arise in other scenarios.  It is general advice regarding privilege but I suspect that the Garda authorities and the acting Commissioner have a right to tell us what we do not want to hear.  It would be useful to receive guidance.  However, I would hazard a guess that such guidance would indicate that the Garda has a right to claim privilege.<\/p> <p>  When we are tracking the issues that are outstanding, we should ensure - before we come back to do the work - that they are substantially complete in order that we might have a more meaningful engagement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B01300","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":25,"content":"<p>A final question from Deputy Kelly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#B01400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":26,"content":"<p>We asked for a copy of the risk register in respect of the Garda College.

In that context, I am going to ask the secretariat to prepare a briefing note for us that we can approve and then issue.  I can think of a few issues on which this committee has been roundly criticised in the past but was upon which it proved to be absolutely correct.  During the term of the last Committee of Public Accounts, Maurice McCabe arrived in here with boxes of speeding fines that had been cancelled, adding up to &euro;5 million.  That was one of the ingredients that led to where we are now.  The committee was attacked right, left and centre for dealing with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na issue but a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General found that the committee was totally within its rights to do that.  We also dealt with the so-called Grace case in the south east and were attacked right, left and centre and told it had nothing to do with this committee.  Our work on that case has contributed to the establishment of a commission of inquiry.  We dealt with the issue of Project Eagle and NAMA.  A vague commitment had been made to establish a tribunal or commission of investigation but that had gone off the boil.  Our committee's report brought the issue back to the boil and that has now happened.  In terms of the Templemore issue, were it not for the work of this committee all that has unfolded would not be in the public domain but we were criticised heavily for doing that.  It is important that the committee secretariat would put together a briefing note for us in order that members would have such available to them and be able to say that despite the constant criticism, this committee is dealing successfully with very serious issues.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#C01400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":41,"content":"<p>I totally agree with that.

We have to ask questions without fear or favour and if we are not in a position to do that, we cannot do our job.  We need to collectively protect ourselves.

He has basically said what I wanted to express.  Effectively in my own constituency, three Deputies are attacking me politically.  Now, I am a big boy and I can take it.  That is not the issue.  They are attacking me because through the process by which this committee works, in conjunction with the Comptroller and Auditor General, issues relating to the Garda College in Templemore have come through the pipeline and have been dealt with in here.  Deputies are attacking this committee and by extension, me as a member of this committee.  I have no issue with that and will take them all on, collectively or individually.  The main issue for me is that they are undermining this committee and are creating a dangerous precedent whereby people who are members of this committee are to be picked on or almost victimised because of their work as members of this committee, which they are bound to do.  We all leave our politics outside the door of the committee room, or at least that is what we should do, and we do our job to the best of our ability based on what comes through to us.  There is a dangerous precedent being set because members of this committee will not be able to do their work, including Deputies Cullinane, Catherine Murphy and myself.  The attacks are also inappropriate.  In fairness to the Chairman, he has a good track record in defending this committee.  When we were attacked in the D&aacute;il, the Chairman stood up and defended the committee on behalf of all its members.  As Deputy Cullinane has said, we need to identify a way in which we can defend this committee and robustly argue against criticism made of it.  At the political level, we can all do our individual thing and that is fine.  However, we need a process or a way in which that defensive work can be done, possibly through the Chairman.  Dare I say it but some individuals in the Houses of the Oireachtas may need to be educated about the way in which information comes to the Committee of Public Accounts and the way in which it goes about its work.  They are either deliberately misunderstanding or they genuinely do not understand.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#C02000","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":47,"content":"<p>There is a break coming up between now and the Easter period during which I will ask the secretariat to work on this because it is important.

We need to demonstrate what the Committee of Public Accounts has achieved, in spite of what those who want to knock us might say.  We will certainly come back to that matter.<\/p><p>The next item of correspondence is No. 1114B from Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, enclosing information requested by the committee on salary overpayments in respect of the HSE for 2016 and 2017.  The figure in question is approximately &euro;2.5 million.  We will note that.  The next item is No. 1116B<b><\/b>from Mr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, dated 20 February 2018 with further information on the quality capacity building initiative, QCBI, as requested by the committee at our meeting on 8 February 2018.  We will note and publish that.  Correspondence item No. 1118B is from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding public bodies within the remit of the National Shared Services Office, NSSO, and a briefing note on the feasibility and scoping study that was carried out to determine which Departments and bodies transferred to the NSSO.  We will note and publish that.  The next item is No. 1120B from Mr. Kieran Harrington, Department of Health, dated 22 February 2018 enclosing follow-up information requested by this committee in respect of the Dormant Account Fund and community based models to support people with dementia.  We will note and publish that.  A number of issues are arising regarding the Dormant Account Fund and as a committee, we found that engagement most unsatisfactory.  It was all over the place and nobody seemed to have a handle on it.  We will come back to that issue as part of our periodic report.  It was a glaring problem.  That is all I can say at the moment about the way that account has been administered in recent times.<\/p><p>The next item is No. 1121B from Ms Marie Ryan of the Courts Service, dated 22 February 2018, with an information note on the court poor box.  I want to highlight this because an individual wrote to me about it.  The note we received about the court poor box is very interesting.  The Courts Service has provided figures from 2013 to 2017 showing that the poor box received &euro;8.917 million in the period, with payments from the poor box amounting to &euro;8.734 million.  The poor box is running at close to &euro;2 million per annum and is now fully maintained by the Courts Service through its own accounting system.<\/p><p>All of those payments are centralised, recorded and verifiable.  The heads of the criminal justice (community sanctions) Bill are under consideration.  That proposed legislation would replace the Probation of Offenders Act, which deals with this.  It will come up in due course.<\/p><p> The most interesting part of the correspondence, however, is the comment that there are three categories of payments made to the court poor box.  The figures mentioned relate to category A payments, in respect of which the correspondence states, \"Such payments are accounted for in the Court office and the accounting procedures are subject to audit by both the C &amp;amp; AG and Internal Audit.\"  The correspondent goes on to say there are category B payments, made directly to a named charity by producing a receipt in court.  She states, \"These payments are not included in the annual Poor Box receipt figures.\"  It appears that, on some occasions, the judge can say some money should be put into the court poor box while, on others, he can ask that &euro;200 be given to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, for example.  The person has to come back with a receipt from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul the next month showing that the payment has been made.  It does not go through the system.  Therefore, we do not know what is going through that system.  There are also category C payments, referred to as payments made via the Probation and Welfare Service to the Garda on order of the court.  It is stated, \"These payments are not accounted for in the Court Office and are not included in annual Poor Box receipt figures.\"  Therefore, there are two categories of payments not going through the accounting system.  We should write to the Courts Service in this regard.  It is in its interest and in the interest of the administration of justice that the service get a handle on this.  One category of payments goes through the poor box and two other categories do not do so at all.  I am surprised by that.  I thank the correspondent for the information and for making it public.  It answers questions people have on payments through the poor box that do not seem to be able to be traced anywhere.  At least we are now hearing some of the reasons why this is happening.  It is not the way it should be; that is all I can say.  I do not want to trespass into the area of the authority of judges.  Judges issue the fines and request that amounts be paid, but they should be accounted for by the Courts Service somewhere.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#C02300","speaker":"1216","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":51,"content":"<p>Do the payments in category C, via the Probation Welfare Service or to the Garda by order, show up in the accounts of the Garda or the Probation and Welfare Service?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#D00200","speaker":"1226"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":52,"content":"<p>I am not aware of it but, obviously, if they were receiving funds in any form, they should be accounted for through the accounting systems.

Between 2014 and 2017 there was expenditure of &euro;571,803 on that.  I will ask Deputy Kelly to advise us if that is going ahead.

My understanding of this is that the merger process was in place without being underpinned by legislation.  The legislation was on hold for a long time; it was pretty much suspended because there were political differences.  There is now a change in the sequencing where initially the institutes had to formally merge and then had to reach and meet criteria.  There were benchmarks around having a set number of graduates and so on.  Then there was an international panel of experts who would come in and adjudicate on the application and so on.  My understanding is that the legislation is going to change to allow the merger part of it to come in at the end of the process.  Much of the legal and consultancy advice was around some of that process.  It is glaringly obvious and jumps out from the page that if the process involved the proposed mergers is the same, how can it be logical for those engaged in the proposed Munster merger to have spent more than &euro;570,000 and for those involved in the other proposed mergers who are engaged in exactly the same process to have spent-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#E01900","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":93,"content":"<p>There were further advances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#E02000","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":94,"content":"<p>They had further advances to spend &euro;4,000 in one case.

Obviously this is a vast sum of money.  That is one thing, and UCC can make its own decisions about it, and it is not what I am questioning.  At committee meetings we have had numerous discussions on what is taxpayer funding and what is not.  There was a lot of discussion and argument relating to the institutions' own funding, and they stated they could use their own funding in whatever way they pleased.  However, the fact of the matter in many cases we saw was their own funding was put into a pot with taxpayers' funding and then utilised, and in many various scenarios we had to try to decipher whether this was value for money for the taxpayer.  Here we have a situation where UCC is spending this amount of money and is stating it is from non-taxpayer funded revenue.  I would ask the following question.  If UCC did not get taxpayers' funding in the first place would it be in a position to go out and get non-taxpayer revenue to be able to do this?  The manner in which UCC has explained this smacks of nothing being learned from our report of a few months back and the ongoing analysis on some colleges and universities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#F00200","speaker":"1349"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":100,"content":"<p>We will write directly to UCC about the agreement and the secretariat has a note of the query.

It is wise for sectoral committees to observe the work of the Committee of Public Accounts.  If these committees feel that we are encroaching on their work in any way, they have an absolute entitlement to inform us about that and write to us so I have no difficulty with that whatsoever.  We have consistently said that we do not want to duplicate the work of any other committee.  There is a difference between the sectoral committees do and what the Committee of Public Accounts does - even in terms of who appears before the different committees.  Ministers and Ministers of State appear before sectoral committees and can deal with issues of policy and so on.  We do not do that.  We deal with a look-back exercise, value for money and accountability.  This issue arose when the Secretary General of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment was here.  Almost 40% of the entire budget of the Department, which I think was &euro;170 million, was transferred to RT&Eacute;.  The Secretary General was not in a position to answer questions in the same way he was answering questions about the rest of the spend because it was a matter for RT&Eacute;.  I have very serious questions to ask about allegations of bogus self-employment and contracting of staff, which are genuine issues.  There is a potential cost to the State in terms of revenue as well so they are genuine issues that need to be addressed.<\/p><p>Another issue, which was probed by the Chairman, concerned whether or not a proper service-level agreement is in place between the Department and RT&Eacute;.  At no point would we want to duplicate the work of the sectoral committee nor would we want to interfere with the independence of the national broadcaster and ask questions about its decisions in terms of programmes.  It was never about that and we have said so <i>ad nauseam<\/i>.  There are specific issues we want to ask about and we have a responsibility and an entitlement to probe and ask questions about the spend of &euro;170 million of taxpayers' money even if RT&Eacute; is not audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  This is a lot of money so we have a responsibility.

The Committee of Public Accounts has an absolute obligation to see if that was the case because all political parties are funded by the taxpayer and are given funding to use for purposes such as advertising and so on.  They can spend money in many different ways but they must account for same.

Is the process working in terms of the rationale behind setting up the unit in the first place?  Was the money spent for those purposes?  Was the money spent for other purposes?

I agree fully that there is a value for money issue, but we should be very careful in talking at this committee about the misuse of money for political purposes.  This is an extremely important committee.  We are here every Thursday with numerous reports before us that we read, reflect on and question in terms of value for money and holding institutions to account.  It is extremely important that we hold them to account.  I agree that there is a serious value for money issue when it comes to the strategic communications unit and would like to tease out a little more with the Chairman and the Comptroller and Auditor General how best to proceed to ask questions about the unit which have been raised by many of us in different fora.  When I raised the issue, I was told the purpose was to save money.  That brings the role of the Committee of Public Accounts into it.  How did it save money?  As my colleague said, what business case was made and who made it?  Has it worked?  That is an issue for us.  To do it we should have immediate access to the business case made.  It should be forwarded to us with all relevant documents.  I agree with what has been said, but I would like to tease out what the precedent is.  We are looking at something without a report before us which is a new departure for us, although I am sure it has happened before.  Let us tease out these issues first and stick with the issue of value for money and to the best way to bring the matter before us before we say who we would bring in.  I have no difficulty in looking at that issue, but at this point we should tease out the issues involved and establish what we want to do.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#J00200","speaker":"1316"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":171,"content":"<p>There is nothing more important than the independence of the media in doing its job.  In the past two weeks I have heard that they are under extreme financial pressure and have effectively been coerced into allowing this to run because of the financial strain they are under.  There is nothing more important than we have entered a sphere in which the State can buy the news.  We are not living in some Russian creation; this is not Trump-land but a republic.  In a democracy the independence of the media to present the news and people to disseminate are fundamental.  People have become obsessed with side shows, which is unfortunate, about whether Fine Gael members were in pictures, but it goes far deeper than that.  <\/p><p>The people running the campaign were extremely astute about what they wanted to achieve and I will tell the committee why.  They dealt with the design of the page, which is the most important point, newspaper by newspaper, including the fonts used in headlines.  One should not forget that it did not run as an advertorial, which is bad enough, but I will tell the committee how specific it was.  The headline and subhead fonts and text style were the same as on every other page in each newspaper.  The first thing one learns in journalism school is that every single newspaper uses a particular font which is unique to it.  Newspapers are precise in how their readers react to them.  If a newspaper engages in a redesign, it will be at pains to explain to its readers why it has changed the font.  When <i>The Irish Times<\/i>did it a number of years ago, it was at pains to explain that it engaged in the redesign to make it easier on the eye.  These guys were so specific that in every single newspaper the same headline font, subhead font and colours as on the other pages were used.  That takes some work.  The newspapers concerned have been caught out and they know it.  <\/p><p>The NUJ has commented on the issue because it is worried that if its members and the owners of newspapers allow it to happen, we have entered a dangerous sphere.  My local newspaper which is as guilty as all of the rest this week ran a full page viewpoint by Paul Murphy who is one of the most respected local journalists in the country and editor of the <i>Drogheda Independent<\/i>group for many years.  He was my first boss when I worked with that newspaper.  He said readers of the <i>Meath Chronicle<\/i>last week had come across details of the plan spread across the pages but that the words &quot;advertising content&quot; or &quot;advertorial&quot; did not appear anywhere in the copy.  An unsuspecting reader would have assumed it was part of the newspaper's normal news coverage.  He said it had been a mistake to present the copy in this way and expected it not to happen again.  <\/p><p>A number of experts in various fields had been asked to supply quotes about the national development plan, but they had not been told that their views would be part of advertorials paid for by the State.  Even the most brazen PR stunt man or woman would not pull that one and hope to get away with it.  It looks and is grubby in the extreme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#J00300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":172,"content":"<p>I call Deputy David Cullinane.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#J00400","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":173,"content":"<p>Chairman-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#J00500","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":174,"content":"<p>I am sorry.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#J00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":175,"content":"<p>My point is there is no question that is more fundamental than if people can use public money to try to present spin as news and if the State is buying the news.

Newspapers know it.  This is clearly a misuse of public money and one does not need to set up a commission or a committee to investigate it.  Anything that fails to be presented as an advertorial and if public money is spent in doing so is a clear misuse of public money and the question demands to be answered.

On the face of it, it seems as if the unit pulled off a very slick, almost sly operation and our job is to test it.  Allegations and political charges are being made.  It is for the D&aacute;il Chamber to deal with the matter.  What we have to do as a committee is to evaluate whether there is any truth in the allegations that have been made.  I have my concerns as we can see it with our own eyes.  Teachta Shane Cassells was right in everything he said and I agree with all of it.  We will I hope have people before us.  We have to provide them with an opportunity to prove to us that the charges made are not true.  That is our role.<\/p> <p>  Teachta Catherine Connolly's point was that we needed to have a good sense of what we wanted to achieve before we invited people.  That is obvious, as Teachta Shane Cassells and others said.  It is obvious what we want to achieve and what the questions are and we should not delay or postpone making a decision.  I have already proposed one which I will reiterate.  I formally propose that we invite the individuals named and others.  The first session should include the key individuals - the Taoiseach, the Secretary General, Mr. Fraser, and Mr. Concannon, the head of the unit.  They are the three key individuals.  Others are also important.  The Taoiseach and others have been making the point that there are bigger issues.  There are, but there is a fundamental issue with how political parties are funded.<\/p><p>If any political party is gaining an advantage over others, that is not right.  There are also issues about how taxpayers' money is spent and there are now blurred lines between the communication of Government and public and Civil Service and how that has become political and party political.  They are fundamental questions.  The issue of value for money is then wrapped up in that and, as others have asked, whether we have achieved the savings we were promised.  The Committee of Public Accounts has a clear role in that.  That is our starting point and should be the avenue for those coming before us.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#J00800","speaker":"1258","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":178,"content":"<p>I am rarely accused of not being clear.

I expect the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment will look at this, as will the Department of Expenditure and Public Reform, and it has already been raised in the D&aacute;il.

When we come to the meeting and we have Accounting Officers before us, he will prepare a note then but we must get our end of it out of the way first before we involve the independent office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Members will understand why I am not calling him on this.  There are issues of value for money, process, savings and staffing.  What falls under this committee's remit is clear, namely the Accounting Officer in the Department of An Taoiseach, the Accounting Officer of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and perhaps other senior people.  They are currently under the committee's remit and are obliged to appear before it as requested.<\/p> <p>  I am not averse to inviting the Taoiseach before the committee but, as Deputy Cullinane said in relation to RT&Eacute;, it is important that we do not trespass on another committee.  I want to explain what committee the Taoiseach is appearing before.  He is going before the specific select committee, not the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach where they discuss policy issues.  It is a select committee of Deputies, no Senators are involved, and it will deal only with the Estimates for expenditure.  The purpose of that meeting is to deal with the Estimate of expenditure.  The Taoiseach is committed to going before that committee, as he does every year, as every other Minister goes before their relevant select committee, to get approval for his Department for the current year.  He will be before that committee on 29 March, I think, when he has returned from the United States.  The date has been set already.  Undoubtedly, the unit will be discussed at that meeting, because he is going before it to seek approval for expenditure in his Department, which includes the strategic communications unit and all other matters in that Department.  I am conscious of not duplicating work by bringing the Taoiseach before this committee.  I have confidence in our colleagues on that committee to tease out these matters with the Taoiseach during the Estimates debate.  Members might feel after that they did not ask all the questions that we feel should have been asked, but that meeting is already scheduled.  Normal political courtesy dictates that the meeting should be allowed to take place to deal with the Estimates.  However the Secretaries General as Accounting Officers are under the remit of this committee.  The secretariat will be well able to write to them based on the points that have been raised on the specific reasons they need to come before this committee as Accounting Officers as soon as possible after the break.<\/p> <p>  Perhaps I am over-reaching.  I am conscious as Chairman that there are several other forums where the politics of this matter may be dealt with and that the Committee of Public Accounts is not the place for party politics.  I am clear about that.

I do not know if it has been done.  There are some areas where we just need additional information and where we seeking information.  That is fine and we will deal with that aspect.  There are other areas where we need more scrutiny.  The committee needs to return to some issues with Cork Institute of Technology , the University of Limerick, Waterford Institute of Technology and some education and training boards.

The second session will focus on the Appropriation Account for the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We may not complete the first session before divisions are taken in the D&aacute;il at 12.50 p.m., in which case the session will continue thereafter and we will take a break before the second session commences.<\/p><p>As chapter 8 deals with funding for local authorities, much of which is for roads, and we are also discussing the special report on the administration and collection of motor taxes, it is intended to discuss relevant matters with officials from the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Housing, Planning and Local Government and representatives of Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  However, only officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government need to be here for the second session.  It would be too unwieldy to deal with all these matters in one session.<\/p><p>The first session will focus on chapter 8 of the  Comptroller and Auditor General's report of 2016, which is on central Government funding of local authorities.  Members noted the importance of having a good understanding of how local authorities are funded.  While local authorities are not accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, they are substantially funded from the Central Fund, mainly through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Transport Infrastructure Ireland and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We asked the Accounting Officers from all three bodies to appear for this reason.<\/p><p>We are joined from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government by Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General, and his officials, Ms Maria Graham, Mr. Paul Lemass, Mr. Maurice Coughlan, Ms Lorraine O'Donoghue, Mr. Rory O'Leary, Ms Theresa Donohue and Ms Janet Jacobs; from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport by Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General, and his officials, Mr. Ray O'Leary, Mr. Dominic Mullaney, Mr. Tim Scully and Ms Marie Gleeson; and from Transport Infrastructure Ireland by Mr. Michael Nolan, chief executive officer, who is joined by Mr. Peter Walsh and Mr. Pat Maher.<\/p><p>I ask the Accounting Officers to be as concise as possible in making their opening statements, which will be published and noted.  I am sure the weather of recent weeks placed considerable pressure on all Departments as well as Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  I expect, therefore, that they had more pressing priorities than usual while preparing to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Given the ability of the witnesses, I have no doubt they will be able to take this meeting in their stride, as they did when dealing with everything else in recent weeks.<\/p><p>On behalf of members of the committee and members of the public, I thank Mr. Se&aacute;n Hogan, national director for fire and emergency management, and all the staff involved in recent efforts for the commitment they showed in keeping the country as safe as possible.  It would be remiss of the committee not to thank them.  Mr. Hogan is not here today as he is probably still busy but perhaps he will be able to rest next week.  I would also like to record the gratitude of elected Members for the fabulous work carried out by local authorities and various agencies in recent weeks.  Their work is genuinely appreciated by the public.  The handling of recent weather difficulties enhanced the esteem in which the public service is held by the population.  People appreciated the role of public servants and their work with community and voluntary organisations.  It had a beneficial impact and much good came from it, notwithstanding the difficulties we experienced.<\/p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile telephones must be switched off or placed in aeroplane mode.  Placing telephones in silent mode is not sufficient as they will continue to cause interference with recording equipment.<\/p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l<\/i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<\/p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.<\/p><p>I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to make a brief opening statement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#M00600","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":231,"content":"<p>As the Chairman stated, central Government funding transfers to local authorities present a highly complex picture, with transfers from a number of departmental Votes and funds for a wide variety of purposes.  In my annual report each year, I include a chapter designed to present an overview of the level and trends of such funding and the purposes for which that funding is provided.  Figure 8.1 in the chapter, which is replicated on-screen, gives an indication of the many sources and flows of the funding for 2016.<\/p><p>I should point out that there have been some structural changes in how the funding moves since the report was published.  In particular, since the beginning of this year, motor tax receipts are no longer paid into the local government fund.  They are now paid into the Central Fund of the Exchequer, like other tax revenue receipts.  Moreover, local property tax receipts, which are collected by Revenue, are now paid directly into the local government fund, rather than into the central fund.<br\/><br\/>In 2016, the aggregate transfers of funding from central government to local authorities amounted to slightly more than &euro;2.2 billion.  Over 80% of this funding was provided either through Vote 34 - Housing, Planning and Local Government, or directly or indirectly from the local government fund.  Both the Vote and the fund are administered by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.<br\/><br\/>One of the key functions in administration of the local government fund is the allocation of local property tax receipts to individual local authorities using a redistribution model.  The result of that redistribution is summarised in figure 8.3 of the chapter, included with the Comptroller and Auditor General's submission.  The bulk of the funding transferred to local authorities in 2016 was earmarked for three spending areas; &euro;913 million for housing and urban regeneration, representing 41% of the total; &euro;639 million for transport investment, representing 29%; and &euro;310 million for local authority general purposes, representing 14%.  The final part of the chapter summarises the activities in 2016 of the Local Government Audit Service and of the statutory National Oversight and Audit Commission.  These are the primary mechanisms through which central government funders gain the necessary assurance about the application of the funding provided to local authorities.<br\/><br\/>The 2016 account of the local government fund received a clear audit opinion.  The account recorded income of just over &euro;1.9 billion, and expenditure of &euro;1.92 billion, resulting in a deficit of just less than &euro;16 million for the year.  The fund was financed mainly by motor tax receipts totalling &euro;1.049 billion, local property tax receipts of &euro;463 million and a contribution of &euro;397 million from the Exchequer through Vote 34.  However, it should be noted that on the expenditure side in 2016, a total of &euro;318 million was paid over from the fund to the Exchequer.<br\/><br\/>Aside from sums directly or indirectly transferred to local authorities, the other substantial expense on the local government fund in 2016 was a subvention of &euro;652 million paid to Irish Water.  Members may wish to note that a further &euro;184 million was contributed to Irish Water from the central fund of the Exchequer in 2016 in the form of capital contributions.  I have dealt with the overall funding of Irish Water in a section of chapter 1 of my 2016 report.<br\/><br\/>The final part of this morning&rsquo;s agenda relates to Special Report No. 97, which was completed in December 2016.  The report presents the findings of an examination we undertook which reviewed trends in motor tax receipts, the costs of collection of the tax and the effectiveness of controls in ensuring compliance with motor tax regulations.  The examination was carried out under co-operation arrangements between the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Local Government Audit Service.<br\/><br\/>As I mentioned previously, annual motor tax receipts amounted to just over &euro;1 billion in 2016.  While the number of vehicles taxed has increased in recent years, revenue has fallen from &euro;1.16 billion in 2014.  This reflects the ongoing replacement of older private vehicles by lower emission vehicles, which attract lower tax rates.  The examination concluded that if other factors remain unchanged, decreases in motor tax revenue will continue.  For example, we projected on current trends that the replacement of older private vehicles will reduce motor tax receipts by &euro;260 million between 2015 and 2024.  That is almost a quarter of the current total receipts.<br\/><br\/>Members will be aware that vehicle owners have the option to renew their motor tax for a period of three, six or 12 months.  However, taxing vehicles for shorter periods is more expensive <i>pro rata <\/i>for taxpayers, and results in higher transaction processing costs for local authorities and for the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We also found that on average, owners of older vehicles taxed on the basis of engine size renew their tax more frequently and for shorter periods when compared to owners of newer vehicles taxed on the basis of emissions.<br\/><br\/>Motor tax collection is now mainly done through the motor tax online system of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Local authorities collect a reducing share of motor tax revenue through their local motor tax offices.  As a consequence of the dispersed collection system, the overall cost of administering the motor tax system is not readily identifiable.  Data collected for the examination suggests that in 2014 the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and local authorities were incurring costs of around &euro;49 million each year.  We estimated that the cost of processing an online payment was around &euro;5 per transaction, whereas the cost was about &euro;10 per transaction when processed via a motor tax office.<br\/><br\/>In 2015, the online facility was used for two-thirds of transactions and increasing each year.  However, there is significant variation in the online processing rate in individual counties.  In Dublin and surrounding counties, close to 80% of transactions were conducted online.  In Donegal, Roscommon and Longford, the rate of use of the online facility was closer to 50%.  However, the examination found that there had been no recent evaluation of the factors influencing a customer&rsquo;s decision to pay tax online or at a local office, or the period for which they pay tax.  This information would help to inform planning for the provision of services in the future, including the use of IT solutions to increase the efficiency of service provision.<br\/><br\/>We also examined the operation of controls in relation to collection of motor tax.  We found that there was no current estimate of the level of motor tax evasion, and that the impact of changes in regulations governing off-the-road declarations had not been ascertained.  The examination also found that there was limited validation of key information such as name, address and insurance details when taxing a vehicle.  Furthermore, there had been an increase in the proportion of frequent transfer of ownership of individual vehicles, which may facilitate the evasion of motor tax because arrears are not pursued when ownership changes.<br\/><br\/>The report makes a number of recommendations concerning the need to monitor motor tax evasion and analyse transaction data to identify emerging trends and support risk-based enforcement measures.  As agreed, I will introduce the Vote at the beginning of this afternoon's session.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#M00700","nonspeaker":"Mr. Seamus McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":233,"content":"<p>I am pleased to be here this morning to assist the committee in its examination of chapter 8 of the Comptroller&rsquo;s report for 2016, dealing with<\/p> <p>central Government funding of local authorities and the accounts of the local government fund for 2016.  I am joined by colleagues whom the Chairman has already introduced<\/p> <p>  At the outset, I thank the Chairman for his kind remarks at the beginning of the hearing.  They are very much appreciated, not least by me, because they save me the embarrassment of having to explain why some of us on this side of the room probably look a little bit the worse for wear.  I echo the comments and I thank everyone involved, particularly in the Department and Met &Eacute;ireann as well as a range of other Departments, agencies and local authorities that came together in a tremendous national effort.  Also, I note the great sense of community.  Without that community effort in so many places around the country we would not have been able to respond in the way that we did.<\/p> <p>  As requested, I have provided some advance briefing for the meeting.  In addition, on 14 February I provided the committee at its request with detailed information on local government financing and oversight arrangements.  I will therefore keep these opening comments short.<\/p> <p>  The chapter of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s annual report concerning central government funding of local authorities provides an overview of local authority expenditure and income, detailing the range of programmes for which local authorities are responsible, including housing, roads and environmental services, and the range of related funding sources.<\/p> <p>  As the chapter shows, transfers of funding from central Government sources to local authorities in 2016 totalled over &euro;2.2 billion.  The local government fund, LGF, accounted for 42% of this amount.  A range of Departments, including my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as other organisations, are involved in providing this annual funding to local authorities.<\/p><p>The local government fund, LGF, accounts for 2016 give details of the operation of the fund in 2016.  The income sources to the fund that year totalled over &euro;1.9 billion made up of motor tax of &euro;1.049 billion, local property tax, LPT, receipts of &euro;463 million and a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;397 million.<\/p><p> The main payments from the LGF in 2016 included LPT payments to local authorities of &euro;453 million, a payment of &euro;349 million to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport for works on non-national roads and for public transport infrastructure, a payment to the Exchequer of &euro;318 million and a payment of &euro;652 million as subvention to Irish Water.<\/p><p> As the committee is aware, from January 2018, responsibility for motor tax transferred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, with consequential implications for the local government fund.  In particular, motor tax proceeds are now paid directly into the Exchequer rather than into the fund, which is now primarily a means of channelling LPT revenues to local authorities.<\/p><p> Funding for Irish Water is now routed through my Department's Vote and funding for roads and public transport, formerly routed through the fund, is now channelled through the Vote of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  All the changes result in much greater transparency in terms of the various flows of funds involved.<\/p><p> In terms of accountability, as the committee is aware, under the existing policy and legislative framework, the Local Government Audit Service, LGAS, provides statutorily independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities and other local bodies.  The LGAS audits local government bodies in accordance with a<\/p><p>statutory code of audit practice, thereby fostering the highest standards of financial management and public accountability.<\/p><p> Where the annual audit has been completed by the local government auditor, the local authority is required to furnish a copy of the audited financial statement and any associated statutory audit report to every member of the local authority for their consideration at the next practicable council meeting.  In addition, the audit committee of the relevant local authority will review any audited financial statement, auditor&rsquo;s report or auditor&rsquo;s special report in regard to the authority and will assess any actions taken within that authority in response to either a statement or report, and will report to that authority on its findings.<\/p><p> Scrutiny arrangements for local government were also enhanced in recent years with the establishment of the NOAC, the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  The NOAC scrutinises local government performance in fulfilling national, regional and local mandates, scrutinises value for money where State funds are channelled<\/p><p>through local government and supports the development of best practice and enhanced efficiency in the performance of local government functions.<\/p><p> The committee has recently received at its request an update from the NOAC on its work programme.  I forwarded that to the committee with my letter of 14 February.<\/p><p> The NOAC chair appeared with others before the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government last November for a discussion on local government finance issues.<\/p><p> I and my colleagues will be happy to respond to questions or issues relating to the Department that emerge in the course of the committee&rsquo;s work this morning.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#N00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":235,"content":"<p>The Chairman has already introduced my colleagues.  I thank the committee for inviting me here today.  To briefly add to the Chairman's very kind words earlier, I would like to offer my thanks to the various teams within the transport family of agencies and operators, including those in the Irish Coast Guard, who worked tirelessly last week and into the weekend to ensure the safety of people throughout the recent Storm Emma.  I would like to thank also An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Civil Defence and local authority staff for the assistance and support given to our transport operators in restoring our transport services and in helping to keep open our road network.<\/p> <p>  I will begin with the report on central Government funding of local authorities.  I hope to clarify how the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport distributes funding to local authorities.  In 2016, local authorities received over &euro;2.2 billion from Departments.  Of that, my Department provided funding of just over &euro;620 million, representing approximately 28% of the total central local authority funding.<\/p> <p>  The roads maintenance and improvement area is by far the biggest recipient of funding from my Department representing over &euro;570 million of the overall amount from us in 2016.  Public transport received just under &euro;40 million, with the balance allocated between grants for swimming pools, sports capital grants and tourism related projects.<\/p> <p>  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  There are three main grant programmes operated by the Department and these are pavement sealing to protect the road surface from water damage; road strengthening to lengthen the life of road pavements; and a discretionary grant, which allows for a range of activities including pothole repairs, edge strengthening, renewal of signs and lines and winter maintenance.  Those three programmes account for most of the grant funding and are allocated based on the length of the road network in a particular local authority area.<\/p> <p>  The selection and prioritisation of works is decided by local authorities and is funded by their own resources supplemented by State road grants.  Local authorities can also apply each year for bridge rehabilitation grants and for safety improvement schemes to address particular hazards.<\/p> <p>  As our funding is intended to supplement local authority funding, the Department continues to emphasise to local authorities the importance of prioritising roads' maintenance when allocating their own resources.<\/p> <p>  The Department has focused in recent years on developing an evidence based approach to determining long-term funding requirements for annual maintenance of the road network.  The Strategic Framework for Investment in Land Transport was published in 2015.  That sets priorities for investment in land transport, and estimates an appropriate quantum of investment on an annual basis.  It seeks to cover the annual maintenance requirement for the network and allows some limited funding for new transport projects.  In 2015, it was calculated at &euro;1.6 billion per annum in total, with approximately &euro;300 million of this coming from non-Exchequer sources.  A sum of &euro;1.3 billion was therefore the annual Exchequer contribution required for capital maintenance of the land transport network.  The Department&rsquo;s evidence based approach has been influential in securing greater focus on the requirement for ongoing maintenance of the road assets.<\/p> <p>  The Building on Recovery Capital Plan 2016 to 2021 provided for a gradual build up in capital funding from a relatively low base in 2016 towards the levels needed to maintain the road network in a steady-state condition and allow for some investment in road improvement schemes.<\/p> <p>  The 2018 capital allocations are the first in a four year period of increased investment.  Allowing for an additional &euro;490 million approximately in funding allocated under the capital plan review last year, total roads investment for the period 2018 to 2021 is planned to be approximately &euro;4.3 billion.<\/p> <p>  By 2022, we will be in a situation where the maintenance and renewal of our assets matches the pace needed to protect our infrastructure such as national and regional roads and the public transport fleet.  We are acutely aware that this capital investment needs to be bolstered by current spending to support the services we deliver.  The national development plan has acknowledged that also.<\/p> <p>  The national development plan shows the breadth of capital investment this Department aims to bring forward for the benefit of our citizens and our economy.  Under that plan, the Department is in a position to bid for resources to move from maintaining our infrastructure to adding to that infrastructure investment in future years.<\/p> <p>  In the context of the multi-annual funding approach, the Department is now progressing a further project called the planning, land use and transport outlook 2040, working closely with our national transport agencies and the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  The goal is to develop a high-level outline of the amount, type and location of transport investment required to realise the strategic outcomes of the national planning framework.  We aim to look at protecting past investments, catch up on under-investment, research climate change adaptation needs and analyse the future transport needs of a growing economy and a growing population.  This is planned to be substantively complete by July 2018, with a public consultation planned to be issued in October 2018.<\/p> <p>  I would now like to offer some insight into the way our funding is distributed to local authorities.  Funding for roads is distributed in two ways.  First, the Department itself makes grant allocations directly to local authorities for the upkeep of regional and local roads and utilises Transport Infrastructure Ireland's, TII's, payments system for this purpose.  Second, the Department allocates an overall sum of money to TII in respect of national roads each year.  TII is then responsible for the allocation of those moneys to local authorities.<\/p> <p>  With regard to public transport investment, funding is also allocated in two ways.  First, under the sustainable transport measures grant and the regional cities programme funding to local authorities is distributed via the National Transport Authority.  Second, funding goes directly to local authorities under a number of programmes, including active travel towns, smarter travel and national cycle network programmes.  Regarding the smaller allocations, payments for tourism activities are paid via F&aacute;ilte Ireland to local authorities.  Lastly, the Department itself makes payments direct to local authorities under the sports capital programme and the swimming pool programme.<\/p> <p>  The Department also offers some supports for local authorities over and above direct funding.  A good example of that is the MapRoad project, which helps local authorities to monitor and track the performance of their road networks.  The system also incorporates a centralised web based licensing module which allows utility companies to apply online for road opening licenses and road works permits.<\/p> <p>  I will briefly mention the local government fund financial statements that are also being examined.<\/p><p>I understand my colleague from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has separately provided members with information on the local government fund financial statements which are also being examined and local government fund operations now and in the past.  The fund has historically provided local authorities with funding to meet some of their day to day activities, including the provision of water services, roads and other public transport infrastructure, and for certain other local government initiatives.  Motor tax receipts paid online are now routed directly to the Exchequer.  At the time of the reports under discussion the money had been routed to the local government fund.  Some moneys then came back to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport as appropriations-in-aid.  Since the beginning of the year, my Department has received the vast majority of its funding directly from the Exchequer.  The level of funding is the same as it would have been, regardless of the change in the routing of funding.<br\/><br\/><b><font color=\"#424282\"> <\/font><\/b>On special report No. 97 on the administration and collection of motor taxes, responsibility for motor tax policy transferred to my Department from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government on 1 January 2018.  The functions transferred include motor tax policy and legislation, as well as responsibility for the related services provided by local authorities, including motor tax collection.  In that regard, motor tax will continue to be payable in 26 licensing authorities - motor tax offices - as well as through the online motor tax facility which is managed by the driver and vehicle computer services division of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which is based in Shannon.  The transfer of the motor tax policy function from the start of this year brings the policy and operational aspects of the motor tax function under the umbrella of one Department.  This should provide for greater cohesion in future policy and technological developments.<br\/><br\/>The Comptroller and Auditor General made seven recommendations and progress has been made on all of them.

I am accompanied by Mr. Peter Walsh, director, capital programme, and Mr. Pat Maher, director, network operations.  While the invitation relates to the overall funding of local authorities, I will limit my statement to the allocations for the maintenance and improvement of national roads.  The briefing papers set out the significant roles our partner local authorities perform in supporting these activities.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>On national roads improvements and maintenance funding provided for local authorities in 2016, Transport Infrastructure Ireland,<b><\/b>TII, received &euro;411 million in State funding to maintain, manage and improve the national road network in 2016.  This funding also provided for PPP committed payments amounting to &euro;119 million.  The final spend by local authorities on maintenance and improvements was approximately &euro;200 million.  The balance was principally allocated to centrally procured operations, asset renewals and maintenance activities.  A breakdown of the 2016 spend by category for TII and the local authorities is provided in the briefing material.  The trend in capital funding provision for national road improvements was downwards in the years 2010 to 2016, inclusive, as indicated in Chapter 8 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the central government funding of local authorities.  This reflects the successful conclusion of the major inter-urban motorway construction programme in December 2010.  The focus of TII post-2010 has been on maintaining the network and renewing assets to the extent possible but at the expense of maintaining a pipeline of new major road projects.  The expenditure on national road pavements and minor realignments, safety and bridge works remained relatively unchanged through the years 2010 to 2016, inclusive.  A graph depicting trends in local authority expenditure, by activity, has been provided in the briefing material.<br\/><br\/><b><\/b>State funding available to TII in 2018 to maintain, manage and improve the national road network is &euro;466 million.  The most notable element of TII's 2018 grant allocations to local authorities is the increase in funding made available for pavement asset renewals which is over &euro;60 million greater than last year's allocation.  Maintenance funding is, however, down by 15% on 2017 levels which will pose particular difficulties for TII's management of what is now a more extensive and high speed network.  We also manage a more resilient and strategic winter maintenance system.  This system is expensive to operate.  Investment in such resilience has proved to be highly justified and warranted.  I thank the Department for supporting TII's investment in a network of salt barns and maintenance compounds strategically located around the network.  This investment was made following the experience of the winters of 2009 and 2010.  We will continue to work with the Department as we review road network requirements and strategies following the recent severe weather events.  Salt stocks are adequate as we approach the end of the 2017-18 winter season.  Other activities associated with the running of the national road network include incident response, traffic messaging and control activities.<br\/><br\/>The recently published national development plan recognises the importance of ensuring the quality and value of past investments are maintained to a high level to ensure quality levels of service, accessibility and connectivity.  Prioritisation of this type of investment is a recommendation of the recent public investment management assessment conducted by the International Monetary Fund.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport strategic investment framework for land transport analysis has established the investment level required to maintain, manage and renew the existing transport infrastructure to keep it in an adequate condition.  This is known as steady State investment.  The steady State investment requirement for the existing network is expected to be substantially achieved by 2021.  TII welcomes the commitment to increase maintenance and asset renewal expenditure over the lifetime of the national development plan to meet the required investment levels for the current transport network and as new projects are developed.  The IMF report acknowledges that Ireland operates a highly developed system for determining and monitoring pavement quality on the road network and estimating the amounts of maintenance and rehabilitation funding required to maintain steady State road quality and availability.<br\/><br\/>I appreciate the Chairman's remarks about the remarkable performance of public service agencies in the past week.  On behalf of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, I thank all local authority staff and motorway operation crews for maintaining service on national roads during the recent severe weather event.  While my opening statement has addressed the matters raised by the committee as they relate to national roads, we will be happy to answer questions on any particular issue raised or any other matter of interest.  Should we not have the information requested to hand, we will follow up with a written response.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#P00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Michael Nolan"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":239,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Nolan.

As I said, we have a large number of witnesses this morning.  It is the most I have ever seen at the Committee of Public Accounts.  We also have a large number or reports, agendas, opening statements and accounts.  In my 17 years on the council, one always would be wary of bulging agendas because the wily county manager, who at the time had the old country secretary, would stuff an agenda and make sure it was fairly big.  When the councillors would come in, they would see the size of it and the fight would be gone out of them before even walking into the room.  They would be happy enough to go with perhaps just works on a local road.  I still remember talking to a manager in my early years as a councillor.  He was nursing a pint of Guinness and he said to me, &quot;Light agendas scare the bejaysus out of me, young Cassells, because God knows what they would ask me.&quot;  I have only 20 minutes.  I will focus on just one or two items and lighten this agenda.<\/p><p>I will kick off on the funding issue, in particular the local government fund, LGF, and people's property tax, a tax that, as we see from the information supplied, brings in some &euro;450 million.  In the broader context of the funding mechanisms, it is around 7% on that pie chart to which the Chairman referred so it is not a chief contributor.  For the people who must pay the tax, it is obviously a very big charge.  We know that the taxes are now under review for the charges for the coming years, and I know when Mr. Lemass was here a few weeks ago for the session on revaluation of commercial rates, he touched on the LPT very briefly, the review that was under way and the additional funds that could be raised from it.  Regarding all the scenarios the Department is painting out, how much extra revenue does Mr. McCarthy feel can be derived from this fund?  I am not asking him to go into the setting of policy but obviously he will present a number of scenarios and look at what is coming in in the first instance and not coming in in other areas.  Can he tell me how much additional income the Department is aiming to bring in from the LPT?  Is it a significant additional amount, based on the analysis of property price increases over the last five years?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#Q01300","speaker":"1218"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":255,"content":"<p>I will say two things about the LPT.  The LPT review that has been announced and which is under way is being led by the Department of Finance.  As for what it aims to achieve through that review and the terms of reference that have been set out, the Department expects the review to conclude by the end of August.  The Minister for Finance's statement refers to trying to achieve relative stability in the LPT payments of those liable for the tax and to provide clear direction on the likely payments faced by households in 2020.  Obviously, a number of issues are live regarding the LPT.  As it is based on valuations as of the autumn of 2013, from my recollection, properties completed since then are not within the LPT net at the moment and obviously, valuations to the extent that they may have changed since 2013 will also be relevant.  From the Minister for Finance's point of view, there is no predetermined outcome regarding the LPT review.  There is a separate issue which is of more concern - or certainly of as much concern - to us, which is, whatever pot of LPT proceeds is available, the manner in which that is distributed between local authorities.  I think at this point there is a recognition of this, and we have been looking at this internally and with the Minister.  I think there is a recognition that this distribution mechanism also needs to be looked at in parallel with the broader LPT.  I am not in a position to say anything more about that second piece at the moment, but the Minister will make an announcement on it very shortly.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#Q01400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":256,"content":"<p>I want to touch on this because the Taoiseach touched on it also and set out his personal views on the matter.  I appreciate that the Department of Finance is considering this in the first instance but it will surely liaise with Mr. McCarthy and all the chief benefactors of the fund.  Let us look at the scenarios without any predetermined outcome.  I note that when writing a piece on this issue, Dr. Brian Keegan of Chartered Accountants Ireland, referred to how the revaluation is due next year, by which time most residential properties could well have seen an uplift in value of 50% or more.  The tax is calculated on a percentage of the rounded value, so if the only change made is a higher property valuation, people will see their LPT bills increase substantially.  This is coming down the road very quickly for every homeowner in this State.<\/p><p>This also coincides with the phasing out of mortgage interest relief.  At the same time as losing mortgage interest relief that is benefitting households by &euro;1,500 to &euro;2,000 a year, people are facing a revaluation of the tax they pay on their property.  Leaving aside any possible predetermined outcome, I want to ask a simple question.  What is the Department's view on protecting people from the inevitable spikes in the bill they are to face if that is the outcome?  Is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government liaising with the Department of Finance to suggest that it does not want people pay double what they are paying at the moment, that it wants to protect homeowners and keep the amount of income at the same level and in order to do so if there is a revaluation the charge would have to drop?  Is the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government painting that scenario for the Department of Finance?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#Q01500","speaker":"1218","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":258,"content":"<p>Our engagement with the Department of Finance as part of this exercise will be within the context of what has been laid down by the Minister for Finance.

Obviously, the rate that is applied to that valuation is also relevant.  Needless to say there are other factors at play as well.

I have heard on my local radio station a county manager from a neighbouring county appealing on public airwaves for councillors not to do it because it would reduce the authority's income.

The power to both increase and decrease is very relevant in that context because while I would have heard some of the types of calls in media from some local authorities not to decrease the rate on the basis of how it would affect income, at the same time that can also become a driver of efficiency depending on what decisions people may wish to take.

As things stand at the moment the Exchequer is making a contribution to that pot.  In future - these are conversations we have regularly with local authorities - if the pot remains as it is and some local authorities are to gain through an exercise of redistribution, inevitably that means that other local authorities would actually lose.

The Chairman is trying to collate everyone in the room, which is why I am running out of time because there are so many people to ask questions.  If everyone is working in silos and we are just putting the money into the Central Fund and no one is really addressing how it is coming in, or if there are decreases in income, then we have a serious issue for local government.<\/p> <p>  Guess who picks up the problem when there are problems with decreases across the board in income from other areas?  The figure comes from central Government, which is what we are dealing with today.  Councillors will row forever and a day about the fact that they are left without income to run the services properly that they are now expected to run, not just across the normal areas of roads and hosing but also, because of the urbanised areas that we have created, on social issues, arts issues, parks and so forth.  They are the issues that communities now expect local government to resolve.  How is that shortfall made up?  It is made up by commercial rates.<\/p><p>The Chairman mentioned at the outset we are dealing here with &euro;2.2 billion of an overall spend by local government of &euro;6 billion, which is just over one third of what is spent.  Let us be honest that local business, not central Government, is the primary source of income for local government in Ireland, providing &euro;1.5 billion in that respect, which works out at 36%.  Income from commercial rates increased by &euro;137 million or 10% between 2008 and 2015 during a period of little or no inflation.  That reliance on commercial rates has increased from 26% to 37% during that period.  Nobody is addressing this issue.<\/p><p> When Mr. Lemass was here a number of weeks ago, we discussed the revaluation process that is causing such distress for so many business around Ireland.  When I asked the Valuation Office about it, it was not its officials' problem.  They were only doing what they were asked.  It was the Department.  When I asked the Department about it, it was not its officials' problem, it was the Minister.  The only people paying the bill here are the businesses of Ireland.  I want to address that here today.  Councillors will end up increasing commercial rates because they need funding to run the services and it is the SMEs which will pay it.<\/p><p> By the way, today we praised everybody for their response to Storm Emma in the past week, and rightly so.  One would have found that most businesses were closed for those three or four days.  They had no income coming into their shops.  They do not get a rates rebate for the four days that they were shut.  Interestingly, it was reported in the media that there was a bonanza in online sales during those four days.  It was as busy in Christmas for them.  People were stuck at home so they started buying online.  However, the poor people who are running a shop, who are dependent on the door opening and who keep our town centres alive, vibrant and contributing, got hit and got no rates rebate.  I think of a friend in Navan who runs a small bakery and has an additional premises up here near these buildings who pays a six figure sum on rates on them.  At the end of the year, if Meath County Council is short of money, he is the guy who gets hit.  When he thinks of growing his business on those tight margins and maybe employing a second person or whatever, he cannot do so because he does not have the certainty, which Mr. McCarthy rightly spoke about providing to houseowners over a five-year period on how much is due on their LPT.  Business owners in this country do not have that certainty when it comes to the commercial rates bill that they will be hit with because they do not know if councillors will be forced to increase commercial rates come the budget at the end of the year.

I, too, would like to add my voice to those who commended the efforts that we saw over the past week.  Some areas did it on tight resources.  When the review occurs, in the case of some of those resources it will be beneficial to look at where those deficiencies are so that the effort can be even better in the future.  I will highlight a little of that.<\/p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General talked about a highly complex picture.  His language is benign in relation to local government.  In some of the funding, particularly in the local government fund, the word \"opaque\" does not even go there.  I note that from last year the transfer of motor tax from the local government fund to the central Exchequer may make it a little clearer.  Until now, the motor tax was paying for water and the local property tax was paying for roads, which seems an Irish way of doing it.<\/p> <p>  I am pleased that there will be a review of the distribution and I will explore some of that particular aspect.  The baselines are an area that would be of significant concern.  They predate the local property tax and have their origins in the needs and resources model from 2000.  There were data collected right up to 2005, but from then on that has been the base.  There have been changes in functions, such as Irish Water, and there has been a pension change recently, but probably what will bring this into sharp focus is the fact that people will want to know where their local property tax is going.  It is fine saying that the local authority can retain 80%, but there is a limited amount of discretion within that.  In fact, some of the self-fund aspect of it is really a replacement for what might be central Government grants to local authorities.<\/p> <p>  There are some areas that are particularly badly affected.  I will describe the staffing as a case in point because that would have been captured as a need that had to be resourced in that model.

I put some tables together to look at the trend.  The trend is that in the case of County Wicklow, for example, which the Department uses as a case in point in its table for demonstration, there is total expenditure of &euro;91 million, while in County Mayo there is a total spend of &euro;125 million when everything is counted, although County Wicklow has a bigger population.  It is the same in the case of County Tipperary and County Galway.  County Tipperary has a smaller population than County Galway, it has a spend of &euro;135 million as opposed to &euro;104 million in County Galway.  There is the same trend if one matches Limerick city and county against Fingal.  In the Fingal County Council area there was a 43% increase in population in the 20 years from 1996 to 2016, but it is one of the biggest contributors to the local government fund.  In Limerick city and county there are nearly 100,000 fewer people, but the area has a greater expenditure amount from all sources.  It is not a question of saying one county has plenty of commercial rates income, while another receives a greater amount from other facilities and services.  It is looking at the total spend.  The common denominator is that one county is disadvantaged dramatically if its population is growing.  There are places that did not exist in 2000.  They could not be modelled, but they are now subject to this baseline.  What is being examined in the review of baselines?

There was a big pitch that they would see improvements in their areas, whereas there was a diminution of the fund from the point of view of motor tax and local property tax became the exclusive part of the local government fund.  On the idea that 80% is retained and the self-funding aspect, is it likely to feature in any review and will there be a requirement to self-fund things such as housing and roads projects?  This row takes place every year.  It happens more in Dublin City Council, for example, where &euro;106 million is collected nationally in the self-funding area and &euro;85 million is accounted for by the four Dublin local authorities.  One hears the argument that money is being taken from initiatives to deal with homelessness, whereas that would not be a feature for the bulk of local authorities throughout the country.

It might be helpful to move this issue on if Mr. McCarthy could write a note for the committee.  I ask specifically when the equalisation process came in, where the funding went to and what counties benefited.  I would also like a breakdown of the <i>per capita<\/i>spend for each of those local authorities.  That is where we will see whether those local authorities are getting the support they need or whether they are still being disadvantaged.  If the witness could come back to us with a note on that, perhaps we could follow up.<\/p><p>I want to make a broader point on the disjointed nature of funding.  The reason I spoke to the three chief executive officers, Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Doyle is to get a sense of whether we are empowering local government to develop towns and cities.  I am from Waterford.  Many of the big developments that took place in Waterford recently were actually driven by local authorities.  However, all of the chief executive officers I spoke to said local government funding mechanisms can frustrate and hold back reaching the potential that cities have and making decisions that have to be made in real time.  It can take two or three years, for example, from applying for funding to actually getting it.  <\/p><p>Some local authority chief executives have to take risks.  Sometimes, they spend money on the basis that they might or might not get money.  Mr. Doyle will be familiar with the example of the Waterford Greenway.  Everybody now says it is a fantastic project, which it is, and everybody wants to take credit for it.  However, Waterford City and County Councils was left holding the baby with the cost.  It invested in the Greenway at significant risk to the Council.  It was left with a significant shortfall between the cost of the Greenway and what it got from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government because in the end the level of funding the Council hoped for did not materialise.  <\/p><p>Similar examples could be given.  I am not sure if Mr. McCarthy is aware of the Carrickphierish project in Waterford.  A new neighbourhood is being developed.  The chief executive officer told me the difficulty and frustration he had having go to all of the various different Departments and agencies.  They were all working in silos, and not to the project he was working to.  They ended up with a neighbourhood without a library and without proper services because of the disjointed nature of the funding.  <\/p><p>Mr. McCarthy raised issues from an accounting perspective in respect of trying to understand how it all works.  It has an impact on the ability of local authorities to deliver projects.  Sometimes initiatives have to be taken in real time.  If they are not, then opportunities are lost.  I would like Mr. Doyle to answer the question in respect of the Waterford Greenway, because it is still a sore point for those in the local authority who took a risk.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to address the example I gave of the Carrickphierish project in Waterford, but also more generally because the convoluted system of funding can and does impede, hamper and hold back vision in local government.  I will leave it there and come back later.  I know that was a long contribution but I felt it needed to be made.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#W02300","speaker":"1258"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":367,"content":"<p>On the issue of the Waterford Greenway funding, the Department puts out calls to local authorities across the country at certain junctures when funding is becoming available to invest in greenways.

On the review of the management and maintenance of local authority housing, more specifically, the purpose of the report was to identify best practice and roll it out across the local authority housing system.  We were particularly concerned about the extent to which there was a need to intervene with central government funding to bring long-standing vacant properties back into use.  This is now designed to be a platform which we will need to take forward to ensure that ongoing planned management and maintenance by local authorities gets us to a point where we should not really need to provide significant capital funding.

That house has been empty for almost two years and I pass it regularly.  I have checked and been told that it is allocated but not occupied.  We are into the language of Kafka as to the reasons it might be empty.  One finds it is not really empty in that it has been allocated but one then realises it is not occupied.  At any given time in Galway, we have 70 empty houses.  We have an oversight body looking at how to improve things, but at any given time we have 70 empty houses.  Some of that is due to major refurbishment, but most of them are empty for no good reason.  I am trying to relate the practice on the ground to the theory.  No house should be empty for longer than three or four weeks before it is turned over and allocated.  This is an example from a major city during a major housing crisis.

There were a few things happening at that time.  The starting point would have been the general purpose grants, GPG, as they stood at that point in time.  The water related costs were stripped out of the general purpose grants on the basis that these costs were being transferred across to Irish Water.  That left a figure of the net GPG minus the water costs for each local authority.  When it came to deciding how the proceeds of the local property tax would be distributed, one of the key planks of the policy decision that was made at the time was that no local authority should be worse off under the new regime than under the previous one.<\/p><p> LPT was collected in many local authority areas.  Some authorities would have been worse off compared to the previous regime and others would have been better off.  One of the key planks of the policy decision was that nobody should be worse off.  The decision taken was that 80% of LPT in a local authority area would be retained in that area, while the balance of 20% would go into an equalisation fund.  That 20% was then used to bring up the local authorities that would have been worse off, bringing them back to where they would have been if they system had not changed.  A supplementary contribution from the Exchequer was also needed to make sure that this could be done.  From memory, that brought 19 or 20 local authorities back to an equivalent position to what they would have been in if the system had not changed.  Then there was a balance of 10 or 11 local authorities that were in a surplus situation.  The policy decision that was made, taking account of the constrained financial circumstances of the State at the time, was that to the extent that any local authority had a surplus of that kind, it could retain an amount equivalent to 20% of the yield in its area for its own purposes and the balance of 80% would, in effect, be used to replace Exchequer funding, primarily for housing but also with a certain amount for roads.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#MM00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":509,"content":"<p>I am not sure Mr. McCarthy is getting my question.

They might hear about it in local newspapers or announcements.  Why can a process not be put in place so the CEOs in the councils can be directly informed of funding that comes from other State agencies?  It would make sense.  They could then plan and they would know what is happening in their areas, which is not the case if they are not informed.  Could this be examined to improve communications?

There is a sense that there is a culture of breaking up the funding to make many small announcements because it is great for Ministers to be able to make such announcements.

This link has always been there in the public mind, especially in rural areas.  People who pay their motor tax expect some payback for it in terms of the roads.  I want to read a paragraph from Mr. John McCarthy's opening statement in which he indicated:<\/p><blockquote>As the committee is aware, from January 2018, responsibility for motor tax transferred to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, with consequential implications for the local government fund.  In particular, motor tax proceeds are now paid directly into the Exchequer rather than into the fund ...<\/blockquote><p>The link people believe is there was firmly broken and discontinued as of 1 January.  Since that date, motor tax goes straight into general Exchequer funding.  I want to put this on the public record.  It is no secret, but it will be a shock to most people because they have always felt that there is a link between their motor tax and the maintenance of roads.  Since 1 January last, however, it is part of general taxation and it goes directly to the Exchequer.  I know people will say that money can come back in the other direction to make up for it, but the direct link people perceived existed has been broken.  That will come as a bit of a surprise but I wanted to say it.<br\/><br\/>I want to make a few points on the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It pays special grants to local authorities for local roads.  I do not want the witnesses to go into too much detail.  There is a mechanism for national, primary and secondary routes, but where is funding obtained for a regional road to be improved?  If a town wants an inner relief road that is not part of the national plan how does it work through the system?  Is it based on submissions from each local authority?  What type of ranking system does the Department have nationally?  I would like a brief word on this.

Unfortunately, the recommendation has not been implemented.  In 2016 a budget was provided for the new office, but it remains unexpended.  The relevant legislation has been delayed repeatedly and is before the Seanad.  I appreciate the Department's involvement in a range of areas in recent years, whether housing, water services or dealing with planning issues such as lapsed planning applications and applications for planning extensions, which has probably taken up its time in terms of dealing with the legislative process.  However, given that the Mahon report was published in 2012, although it only became formally available in 2013, it is disappointing that a planning regulator has still not been appointed.  I say this as a Deputy who has supported the Government since 2011.  The findings of the tribunal relate primarily to matters in my constituency and former politicians in it.

The issue is as follows and it relates to the current mortgage-to-rent scheme.  A pilot scheme was being looked at after the last mortgage-to-rent scheme was up and running.  At the end of the pilot scheme, they will do a handful and in another year they might roll out some more.  Ms Murray has answered the question.  She said the matter is between the lender and the homeowner.  The lenders still reserve the right to come after the renter for the negative equity.  That has never been stated by the Department.  The Department always says it is not matter for the Department.  It is between the lender and the borrower and the Department does not interfere with that.  If one looks at the agreements as I have, they reserve the right to contact the renter who has given up the title to the house at any stage in the future to discuss that matter.  Officialdom is blind to that as it is not a matter for them; it is between the borrower and the lender.  That has put a lot of people off.  Under the new arrangements and the pilot scheme being looked at now, I understand the new companies coming into this field have agreed not to pursue the negative equity and to make it absolutely clear when they do the deal with the voluntary approved housing body that it is the end of the matter.  Those companies will take the write-down whereas previously lenders were not giving that absolute commitment.  I have encountered those cases.  It might not be the answer for it all, but it is certainly an answer for some of them.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#XX00300","speaker":"1216"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":784,"content":"<p>It is a part of it but in terms of the approved housing bodies - the seven agencies - are they operating efficiently in relation to their component of the transaction?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#XX00400","speaker":"1369"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":785,"content":"<p>They are purchasing individual units on a single acquisition transaction basis which, in itself, is cumbersome.

I saw very little building during my time on the local authority.  We now have a scheme approved by the Department in my town, where there are about 5,000 people on the housing waiting list.  The scheme is for 42 units and delivery is coming in at a cost of &euro;11.1 million, which works out at around &euro;280,000 per home.  That is the cost of it.  That was approved.  The Minister of State with responsibility for housing represents my constituency.  I spoke to Mr. McCarthy about this site this time last year, I think, when he was before the committee about Farganstown.  This is just one example.  In that big town with 5,000 people on a waiting list, that is what we are getting: &euro;11.1 million, which is a lot of money, to deliver 42 homes.  The Department is tackling this problem across a number of areas but, from the point of view of empowering the county councils, the Department faces a big challenge to make sure they step up to the mark.  I would love to know what they are telling the Department.  I would love to know what all the city and county managers are saying.  They are all in the room together.  I see them on the television.

This flows to some extent from the Oireachtas special committee report that was done in 2016 which referred to 50,000 as the level of ambition.

The intention is to nail down the target setting process because there is no point in having part of the target delivery being reliant on direct build when access to land is a problem.  We are trying to match those up.  In some places it is quite a different picture.  Some local authority areas have very decent landbanks in the right locations and other areas do not.  In some cases, where local authorities do not have land where they want it, they have partnered with private developers who have planning permission to build but have not been able to access finance.  We have put those together to get social housing built through the public funding programme that is available.  We have a delivery team in place in the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, which visits all the local authorities to go through all these issues.  I believe the team has been to 22 of the 31 local authorities at this stage.

The second priority we have pursued, which I have already mentioned, is other lands that are not in public ownership, but with planning permissions or a developer with capacity to build other than for lack of finance.  We put the public finance and the land together because significant prices are being paid for land at the moment and I am not sure it is the healthiest thing for local authorities to get in to land bidding wars and put up prices even further.  This is why we have tried to max out the potential from the existing landbank, or through the associated landbank of developers.

Some of those are units that are boarded up for very short periods.  In terms of estate management, as soon as a unit is vacated, the local authorities very often will need to go in and secure the unit to avoid antisocial behaviour or otherwise.  It can actually be boarded up for short periods.<\/p> <p>  Fundamentally going back a number of years ago when we introduced this significantly increased voids programme, the situation we faced was that we were still in a very resource-constrained environment, as were local authorities, and yet we were seeing increasing numbers of vacant units.  In terms of addressing the housing situation we face, the first step has to be if we have a specific number of vacant units, we need to get those back into stock so that we can get families into them.  That was why even in the resource-constrained times we found ourselves in, we siphoned off a line of funding to support local authorities to bring those back into use because otherwise they would have just continued to lie idle.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#DDD00400","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":977,"content":"<p>As it is 5.52 p.m., I will try to be helpful.

There is a reality.  It would not be evenly spread across the country but in large measure, pretty much most local authorities found themselves in a situation where they had a build-up of void properties.  According as the downturn hit, it was not only central government's financial position that was seriously compromised.  The reality was that the local government system's financial capacity was also significantly compromised.  Most local authorities saw a build up of units that were vacant in those circumstances for long periods of time that required significant investment and they just did not have it.  As I was saying earlier, the situation that we had to get to grips with four years ago was we had a serious housing problem which we still have, we were faced with a situation of limited capital resources - significantly less than we have now available - and at the same time we were seeing this build up of empty units, and we had to take a slice of the available capital resource and for much less money than what it would cost to build new units, put that in to getting the vacant units back into use quickly.  It was, with lesser cost, to get them delivered more quickly.  Obviously, according as the capital profile has increased so much over the last number of years, we are moving much more further back into direct build activity, both by local authorities and AHBs.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#EEE01000","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":1026,"content":"<p>I suppose my point is if one has a local authority where there are proactive politicians who see something in front of them and they decide to take action, such as D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council did in 2004, changes can be made.

There is sometimes a concern as to whether we are getting value for the HAP scheme.  How does one control whether we are getting value?  Maybe somebody could elaborate on that.<\/p> <p>  With big public sector construction projects, there is often concern about overruns, that the start price is not the finish price.  Has the Department provisions in place to mitigate against overruns?  Has Mr. McCarthy any examples of what sort of percentages of overruns the Department is looking at currently?  What is happening at the minute?  What are considered acceptable overruns due to unforeseen circumstances?  Has Mr. McCarthy a list of what he would consider to be acceptable?<\/p> <p>  Finally, because we all want to get home, I imagine there are often issues around the public appointment process.  It is a lengthy process and, I suppose, compared to the private sector, sometimes by the time people have gone through it they may not want the job anymore.  One hears anecdotal evidence of that.  Is there provision in place where the Department can bring people in on a short-term basis for a year and perhaps circumvent the lengthy process that may not yield people?<\/p><p>Could architects, quantity surveyors, site managers and so on be recruited on a short-term basis to help circumvent the lengthy process?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#EEE01100","speaker":"1297","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>On the question regarding the housing assistance payment, HAP, in terms of value for money there are rent limits in place for each local authority area and there is discretion to go beyond those rent limits and these provide an important benchmark against which progress can be measured.  As part of the annual budgetary process, all Departments work with the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, which is based in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, to identify a number of programmes for review.  The HAP scheme was the subject of one of those exercises last year, which concluded that the rents being paid were below average price levels in the market.  While it was concluded that we needed to keep rent limits under review, there are no plans at this stage to change them.<\/p> <p>  On construction projects, I made the point earlier to Deputy Burke that one of the most important mechanisms that we put in place to try to manage the cost of social housing construction projects is the four-stage approval process.  It allows us to move to the tender process, that is, from stage 3 into stage 4, with as good an understanding as possible of a site such that we have a realistic budgeted cost for the project.  Under the new contract arrangements that are in place, such projects are not affected by inflation.  Obviously, if exceptions arise - and they do - those need to be taken into account.  As the construction programme is still at an early stage of ramping back up, there is only a limited sample available for review in terms of projects that have completed.  To the extent that we have done so, on average approximately 3% to 4% have gone beyond the agreed budget.  <\/p> <p>  On staffing, I am always loath to use the word \"circumvent\" when before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Local authorities can choose to take on staff directly or, in some cases, to take on professional expertise through contractual arrangements.  In many cases, it is a mixture of both.  They can bring in people on temporary contracts but they must do so through a recruitment process.  Since 2015, the Department has approved more than 700 staffing requests for local authorities, specifically in the housing-related area.  Yesterday, we issued the local authorities with a circular on how they can avail of supports through the capital programme to cover some of the staff costs associated with building projects, whether those costs are for contracted expertise in terms of a private firm or for staff they take on, permanently or on contract.  As I said, we leave judgment in this regard to the local authorities.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#FFF00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. John McCarthy"},{"type":"speech","time":1520499600,"counter":1029,"content":"<p>Who pays the bill in that regard?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ACC2018030800002#FFF00300","speaker":"1297"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1520499600,"counter":1030,"content":"<p>The Department makes a contribution towards staff recruitment.

In respect of the meeting today with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, we are here since 10.30 a.m. and nobody has mentioned the issue of homelessness.  It is a sad reflection on the witnesses' side of the table and this side of the table that we have gone from morning to 6.30 p.m. without that word being mentioned once.  It was not mentioned in an opening statement.  I know there is a lot of nitty-gritty detail to be dealt with but I found it a bit depressing.  That word is written in front of me all day.  I have waited to hear it until now.  We have got through a full meeting without it being mentioned.  I am not pointing at the witnesses but it is remiss on the part of everybody here that we could go through what is effectively a full day meeting the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Environment without anyone mentioning the issue of homelessness.  There is a lesson to be learned from that, and I will let people take whatever lesson they want from it, but the fact that the matter was not mentioned speaks volumes.
