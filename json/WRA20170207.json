The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of\u00a0the NBP\u00a0as a matter of priority.  This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises\u00a0in Ireland can\u00a0get high speed broadband of\u00a0a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging\u00a0investment by the telecoms sector, which is\u00a0continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at<i>www.broadband.gov.ie <\/i>shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:\u00a0 <\/p><p>-  The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,<\/p><p>-  The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will\u00a0have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network\u00a0rolled out.\u00a0 <\/p><p>Of the 186 premises in Ballinora, County Cork, 160 are within the Blue area that will be served by commercial operators. <\/p><p>In the case of\u00a0Tullyallen, Co. Louth,\u00a086% of the premises in the townland identified, including the individual\u00a0address mentioned,\u00a0fall within the Blue area, with the remainder to be covered by the NBP State Intervention.<\/p><p>The map indicates that the townlands of\u00a0Piercetown, Toberultan\u00a0and Garistown in Co Meath are within the AMBER area and\u00a0will therefore, be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP.\u00a0<\/p><p>There are c. 82,000 premises in County Meath, of which approximately 31,000 (38%) are located in the Amber area on the Map, and will benefit from the NBP&rsquo;s State Intervention.\u00a0 The remaining 51,000 (62%) premises are located in the commercial blue area and\u00a0will be served by commercial operators. <\/p><p>Approximately 41,000 (49%) of the\u00a0circa 84,000 premises in County Tipperary are located in the Amber area with the remaining 43,000 (51%) to be served by commercial operators.<\/p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by\u00a0accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>My Department is actively monitoring commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all\u00a0households and businesses can get access to the services.\u00a0 My Department is also actively monitoring developments of commercial operators that might impact the Intervention Area.\u00a0 This is being done in accordance with procedures set out by my Department in December 2015. <\/p><p>I should add, however, that the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is\u00a0a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).\u00a0 I do not have a statutory authority to require\u00a0commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map\u00a0to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years. Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.\u00a0 A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. <\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July,\u00a0I\u00a0established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague\u00a0Minister Humphreys\u00a0to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  The Taskforce report which was published in December, is available on my Department's website.\u00a0<\/p><p>I have\u00a0signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with\u00a0the allocation of\u00a0spectrum in the 3.6GHz band, in early 2017.

In contemplation of the 2017 fishing year, three scientific assessments of the salmon stock status on the river Slaney were undertaken based on recent fish counter data, rod catch data, and catchment-wide electro-fishing data.  All three assessments indicate that the Slaney is not meeting conservation limits for both one sea winter or multi sea winter salmon stocks.  Commercial fishing is only permitted where a surplus off salmon has been identified.<\/p>  <p>  I am also advised by IFI that, in relation to potential restocking of salmon, there are significant genetic and ecological concerns when the progeny of wild salmon reared in a hatchery environment are released back into the wild.<\/p>  <p>  As regards eels, Ireland&rsquo;s Eel Management Plan (EMP) under EU Regulation 1100\/2007, which included a closure of commercial fishing, was approved by the European Commission in 2009.

The Agreement is designed to meet this objective through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)\u00a0submitted by all parties to the agreement.  In this regard, the European Union submitted an NDC committing to a reduction of at least 40% in EU-wide emissions by 2030 compared with 1990 levels, which will be met through reductions of 43% in the Emission Trading System (ETS)\u00a0and 30% in the non-ETS sector compared with 2005 levels.<\/p>  <p>  A proposal on the non-ETS targets for individual Member States, the Effort Sharing Regulation (ESR),\u00a0was\u00a0published\u00a0by the European Commission in\u00a0July 2016. \u00a0Targets have been proposed for Member States based on GDP per capita, which have then been adjusted to reflect cost-effectiveness.  In the case of\u00a0Ireland a target of 39% has been proposed, which has been adjusted downwards to 30% to reflect cost-effectiveness. <\/p>  <p>  The most recent projections published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in March 2016 provide an updated assessment of Ireland's progress towards achieving its emissions reduction target set out under the current EU Effort Sharing Decision for the years 2013 to 2020.  Ireland's 2020 target is to achieve a 20% reduction of non-ETS sector emissions on 2005 levels, with annual binding limits set for each year over the period 2013 to 2020.  The Agency published projected emissions for 2020 which indicate that Ireland's emissions at that stage could be in the range of 6% to 11% below 2005 levels, with the likely outcome at the lower end of that range (i.e. 6%).\u00a0Our reduced investment capacity over the last decade is a contributing factor in the shortfall against the 2020 target, but the primary reason for the shortfall is that the target was simply inappropriate, and very significantly above what it would have been cost-effective for Ireland to contribute to the overall EU 2020 ambition.<\/p>  <p>  Returning to the\u00a0Commission's 2030 ESR\u00a0Proposal, it also allows for the mitigation potential of\u00a0Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF). \u00a0Eligible measures which could be included in this regard are predicated on substantial investment by the relevant Member States, including Ireland.  The proposal incentivises the promotion of measures to increase forest cover, enhance soil carbon pools and strengthen research relating to\u00a0agriculture and land use.\u00a0 The Commission proposal also offers\u00a0the potential for\u00a0a\u00a0one-off transfer of allowances from the ETS to the non-ETS sector. This also involves a cost to the eligible Member States in terms of foregone auctioning revenue.  The Commission's \u00a0proposal continues to be negotiated at EU\u00a0level.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The Government is, of course,\u00a0keenly aware of the extent of the\u00a0challenge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with Ireland's EU and international commitments and, in this regard,\u00a0Ireland's National Policy Position on Climate Action and Low Carbon Development, published in April 2014, and Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, provide the high-level policy direction and statutory authority for the adoption and implementation by Government of plans to enable the State to move to a low-carbon economy by 2050.\u00a0 This must be done in a way that is technically feasible, cost-effective and fair.

I am ensuring that a whole-of-Government response to Brexit is being developed, including through a Brexit Cabinet Committee which I established following the referendum result, which I chair and which will involve all Ministers as required.  Decisions relating to EU\/UK negotiations on Brexit will be taken at European Council meetings which I attend as Head of Government.<\/p><p>I have also restructured my Department to ensure that Brexit is treated as a crucial cross-cutting issue, including my creating an amalgamated International, EU and Northern Ireland Division, under a Second Secretary General.

In many cases, the persons are Irish citizens or EU nationals subject to Free Movement and once this is established they are not subject to any further immigration requirements.

As the name suggests, an EROC is largely about reception and orientation for those who are to be subsequently resettled.  The accommodation of persons in EROCs for a period of time is considered to be good practice as it allows for a period of acclimatisation, de-stressing and on-site processing.  It is also a process that is supported by the UNHCR as best practice.<\/p>  <p>  Under the provisions of the EU relocation programme for asylum seekers, persons considered for relocation must be from countries with a EU-wide recognition rate for international protection of at least 75%.  Accordingly, given their country of origin the expectation is that a large proportion of relocated persons will qualify for status within a very short time.  The International Protection Office generally provide a decision on status within an 8-12 week time frame for this cohort. Programme refugees from Lebanon already have refugee status upon their arrival in Ireland.  Typically the length of stay in an EROC is only as long as is necessary to provide for reception and orientation needs prior to resettlement elsewhere in Ireland and this period is anywhere from four to six months.<\/p>  <p>  Programme refugees are accommodated in two EROCs located in Clonea Strand, Co Waterford, and Monasterevin, Co. Kildare.  Persons who arrived from Greece in 2016 under the relocation strand of the IRPP are being temporarily accommodated in Mosney Accommodation Centre, a portion of which has been temporarily designated as an EROC as it provides self-contained accommodation for the incoming cohort.  There are currently 228 persons residing in Mosney, 131 of whom only arrived in Ireland in mid-December 2016.  The overwhelming majority  are Syrian.

The details supplied relate to ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.<\/p><p>Ireland signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007 and since then, successive Governments have emphasised Ireland&rsquo;s strong commitment to proceed to ratification as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are met.  This Government remains committed to ratification of the Convention.<\/p><p>It is essential that the State is in a position to meet the obligations it assumes under the terms of an international agreement from the moment of its entry into force for Ireland. Before the State can ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, enactment of new legislation and amendment of existing legislation is required to ensure obligations will be met upon entry into force for Ireland.  Ratification of a Convention before we have amended domestic legislation that contradicts it makes no sense and does nothing to ensure compliance or to actually protect the people for whose benefit the Convention exists.  The previous Government published a Roadmap in October 2015, which sets out the legislative measures needed to meet those requirements, along with declarations and reservations to be entered by Ireland on ratification.<\/p><p>Considerable progress has already been made to overcome the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland's ratification of the Convention.  The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 was signed into law on 30 December 2015 and is a comprehensive reform of the law on decision-making capacity.  The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 completed Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il in December 2016 and is currently at Report Stage.  When enacted, the Bill will reform Section 5 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 to facilitate the full participation in family life of persons with intellectual disabilities and the full expression of their human rights.  Achieving the necessary balance between those rights and ensuring appropriate protection is crucial.<\/p><p>The Disability (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2016 was published immediately prior to Christmas and commenced Second Stage on 31 January 2017.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to address the remaining legislative barriers to Ireland&rsquo;s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).  Work is ongoing on all the other issues set out in the previous Government&rsquo;s Roadmap for Ratification published in October 2015 and these will be progressed as Committee Stage amendments.  The Bill will be progressed to enactment at an early date to facilitate ratification of the UN Convention as soon as possible. <\/p><p>  The precise timing of ratification now depends on how long it takes for the Bill to progress through the enactment process and on issues in relation to commencement of the Deprivation of Liberty provisions, which will be included in the Committee Stage amendments, and of the the Assisted Decision Making (Capacity) Act 2015.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700060#WRD04100","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Courts Staff","counter":187,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700060#WRD04200"},{"type":"question","counter":188,"qnumday":110,"qnumall":"[5652\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700060#WRD04300","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"if she will address the urgent need to introduce stricter regulations regarding associated State offices, such as county registrars and sheriffs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1347","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":189,"content":"<p>County Registrars are officers of the court and are independent in the exercise of their functions and duties under statute and rules of court.

This will bring An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, currently with 14% civilians, more into line with international norms and ensure that trained Garda&iacute; are not engaging in administrative and technical duties which could be done by suitably qualified civilian staff.  I have requested the Garda Commissioner, in conjunction with the Policing Authority, to  prepare a 5 year plan to achieve this 20% target by way of a twin-track approach (i) a civilian by default policy  and (ii) the redeployment of Garda&iacute; to operational policing posts and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary.<\/p>  <p>  The \"civilian by default\" policy refers to a policy where all new posts, other than operational policing posts, and non-operational policing posts that become vacant, are to be filled by suitably qualified civilian staff. In relation to the redeployment policy, I have requested the Commissioner, in conjunction with the Authority to identify posts suitable for redeployment having regard to the indicative figure of 1,500 posts identified by the Garda Inspectorate in its report \"Changing Policing in Ireland\".  These policies are designed to ensure that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, trained police men and women, are available for and utilised in operational areas.  The Authority, in view of its statutory functions in relation to approving the number of civilian staff in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and appointing or approving the appointment of such staff has an important role to play in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  The recruitment and appointment of up to 500 civilians provided for in this year's budget will facilitate the Commissioner in addressing capacity and critical skills gaps across the organisation including in corporate supports, change management, human resources and financial management at the national, regional and Divisional level and also to begin the phased redeployment of Garda&iacute; to front-line policing roles.  These additional resources will make an important contribution to the delivery of the ambitious reform agenda set out in the Commissioner's Modernisation and Renewal Programme 2016-2021 and will facilitate deeper civilianisation in the coming years.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, and again having regard to Garda Inspectorate report I have already mentioned, the Commissioner has commenced the roll-out on a pilot basis of a Divisional model of policing to replace the current District model.  The benefit of the Divisional model is that responsibilities will be allocated on a functional rather than geographical basis which will facilitate greater flexibility in the deployment of resources in response to policing needs.  It also will have the benefit of reducing duplicate administrative tasks currently done at both the District and Divisional level.  In this regard, the Commissioner has estimated that 10 Garda&iacute; will be freed up for front-line duties in each Division once the model is fully rolled out.  The roll-out will be done on a phased basis and in such a manner as to ensure that the close relationship between Garda&iacute; and local communities is maintained.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700060#WRD06000","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Data","counter":206,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700060#WRD06100"},{"type":"question","counter":207,"qnumday":117,"qnumall":"[5480\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700060#WRD06200","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of garda&iacute; that retired from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for each of the years 2011 to 2015; the number of Garda recruits attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2016; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1298","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":208,"content":"<p>This Government is committed to ensuring visible, effective and responsive policing throughout the country in order to strengthen community engagement, provide reassurance to citizens and prevent crime.

To make this a reality for all, the Government has in place a plan to achieve an overall Garda workforce of 21,000 personnel by 2021 comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Reserve members and 4,000 civilians.  This year, funding has been provided for the recruitment of 800 Garda recruits and up to 500 civilians to support the wide ranging reform plan in train in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. Appointments will also be made to the Garda Reserve of approximately 300.<\/p>  <p>  I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that since the reopening of the Garda College in September 2014,  838 recruits have attested as members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and have been assigned to mainstream duties nationwide.  I am also informed by the Commissioner that another 750 trainee Garda are scheduled to attest this year which will see Garda numbers, taking account of projected retirements, increase to around the 13,500 mark by year end.<\/p>  <p>  This focus on investment in personnel is critical.  The moratorium on recruitment introduced in 2010 resulted in a significant reduction in the strength of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We are now rebuilding the organisation and providing the Commissioner with the resources she needs to allow her to deploy increasing numbers of Garda&iacute; across all Garda Divisions, including the DMR North Division. <\/p>  <p>  This investment in personnel is complemented by substantial investment in resources across the board for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware of the significant resources that have been made available to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na under the Government's Capital Plan 2016 - 2021.  In particular, some &euro;205 million in additional funding for Garda ICT and &euro;46 million for new Garda vehicles has been allocated over the lifetime of the plan.  This investment will facilitate the provision of more effective policing services and I have no doubt that these new resources now coming on stream will benefit all areas of Garda activity.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700061#WRE02300","answer":true,"speaker":"1214"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":246,"content":"<p>Question No. 132 answered with Question No. 99.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Visa Data","counter":247,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700061#WRE02450"},{"type":"question","counter":248,"qnumday":133,"qnumall":"[5882\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700061#WRE02500","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of visas granted in 2016 to citizens of Syria, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia and Sudan; the number of persons from each of these countries that were refused leave to land; the number that returned to the country of origin or another third country; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1366","askee":"1214"},{"type":"question","counter":249,"qnumday":140,"qnumall":"[6011\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700061#WRE02600","dept":"Department of Justice and Equality","minister":"Minister for Justice and Equality","question":"the number of Libyans, Syrians, Iranians, Iraqis, Yemenis, Sudanese and Somalis that have been issued with visas to Ireland in the past two years.","asker":"1238","askee":"1214"},{"type":"speech","counter":250,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 140 together.<\/p><p>The number of visas approved for 2015 to 2016 is set out in the table:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Number<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2004<\/td><td>2<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2005<\/td><td>14<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>92<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>88<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>80<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>94<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>102<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>101<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>110<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>132<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>170<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>174<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>188<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Total<\/td><td>1347<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>I am also advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) of my Department that the number of persons refused leave to land in 2016 at approved ports of entry to the State from the nationalities referred to by the Deputy were as follows:- Iran 46; Iraq 26; Libya 10; Somalia 53; Sudan 47; Syria 37; and Yemen 7.

Responsibility for the regulation of the electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), which is an independent statutory body. <\/p>  <p>  However, my Department does monitor and advise on all developments that can impact on the economy, including oil price movements.  By January of this year, the price of Brent crude oil had increased by around 24 per cent in euro terms (17 per cent in US dollar terms) since September 2016, when the macroeconomic projections that underpin Budget 2017 were finalised.  I should note that oil prices were expected to increase this year and, indeed, this was highlighted as a risk in the Economic and Fiscal Outlook published with Budget 2017.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland is a net energy importer and, as such, increases in oil prices have a negative impact on real economic activity in Ireland.  Higher energy costs increase firms' input costs, thereby reducing profitability.  At the household level, higher energy prices are likely to lead to a fall in real disposable incomes\u00a0through higher inflation. <\/p>  <p>  However, the recent increase in oil prices has to be considered in a longer term context; January's oil prices were still around 34 per cent lower in euro terms (almost 50 per cent in US dollar terms), compared to where they were in January 2014.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  Also, in recent years consumer price inflation has been near zero in Ireland reflecting inter alia the impact from falling oil prices.  A more prolonged period of low inflation would therefore not be welcome as this could potentially lead to a deflationary spiral which would hurt our longer term growth prospects.  As a result, the economic impact from recent increases in oil prices is likely to be modest.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will update its inflation forecasts with the publication of the Stability Programme Update in April of this year, which will incorporate the impact of the moderate rise in oil prices seen over recent months.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700062#WRF02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":321,"content":"<p>Question No. 158 answered with Question No. 147.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Help-To-Buy Scheme Data","counter":322,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700062#WRF02950"},{"type":"question","counter":323,"qnumday":159,"qnumall":"[5368\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700062#WRF03000","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications to date for the help-to-buy scheme as announced in budget 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":324,"qnumday":160,"qnumall":"[5369\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700062#WRF03100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of applications for the hel- to-buy scheme that have been deemed valid to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":325,"qnumday":161,"qnumall":"[5370\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700062#WRF03200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the number of successful or pending applications for the help-to-buy scheme in categories (details supplied); and the total potential cost of the scheme in each category.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":326,"qnumday":162,"qnumall":"[5371\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700062#WRF03300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"the total anticipated cost of the help-to-buy scheme based on the applications to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1288","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":327,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 to 162, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The Deputy may be aware that a two-stage process is employed for the Help to Buy incentive, under which individuals submit an application for the incentive to receive an indication of the level of tax relief that may be available to them, and subsequently submit a claim for a tax refund.

The 2012 Act\u00a0was the first credit union specific legislation introduced in 15 years and was implemented in a coherent manner over three years to enable credit unions embed the changes into their day to day business.  Following\u00a0commencement of the legislation, the Central Bank introduced\u00a0the Credit Union Act 1997 (Regulatory Requirements) Regulations 2016,\u00a0regarding a number of\u00a0areas including savings, borrowing, lending, investments and liquidity. <\/p>  <p>  The investment regulations made\u00a0specific reference to section 43 of the Act and to\u00a0further classes of investments in which a credit union may invest its funds which may include investments in projects of a public nature.  The regulations provide that investments in projects of a public nature include, but are not limited to, investments in social housing projects.  The Central Bank will review the investment regulations for credit unions, including a public consultation, in 2017.  Notwithstanding any potential changes that may be made to the regulations, the legislative requirement for credit unions to ensure investments do not involve undue risk to members' savings will remain the overriding factor which must inform all credit union investment decisions.<\/p>  <p>  There are a number of areas\u00a0which some credit unions consider restrict lending. Under section 35(2) of the Credit Union Act 1997 (1997 Act) a credit union can only lend to its members.  Under section 17 of the 1997 Act all members must hold the common bond as set out in the rules of the credit union.  Under section 6 of the 1997 Act one of the objects of\u00a0a credit union is the creation of sources of credit for the mutual benefit of its members at a fair and reasonable rate of interest. <\/p>  <p>  In\u00a0its recent report\u00a0the Credit Union Advisory Committee (CUAC) made\u00a0recommendations under seven specific headings.  One of those recommendations\u00a0is to carry out a full review of lending limits and concentration limits under section 35, including the basis of the calculation of the limits together with the liquidity requirements attaching to same.  In relation to the common bond, the Commission on Credit Unions in its 2012 Review\u00a0surveyed credit unions - 54% of credit unions considered that the common bond should remain unchanged, 20% considered that it should be relaxed and 26% believed that membership of a credit union\u00a0should be open to all.  The Commission subsequently did not recommend any fundamental changes to the common bond.  However, CUAC has recommended that\u00a0three policy papers be developed by end September 2017,\u00a0including\u00a0a policy paper\u00a0on the common bond.<\/p>  <p>  CUAC has been working\u00a0for a number of months\u00a0devising an implementation plan in advance of the first meeting of the\u00a0Implementation Group on 20 February 2017.

The Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 was enacted in July 2015 and is designed to protect borrowers in this situation.  Under the Act, purchasers of loan books must either be regulated by the Central Bank themselves or else\u00a0the loans must be serviced by a credit servicing firm who is regulated by the Central Bank.<\/p><p>Under the \u00a0Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act 2015 relevant borrowers, whose loans are sold to third parties, maintain the same regulatory protections they had prior to the sale, including under the various statutory codes (such as the Consumer Protection Code, Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears) issued by the Central Bank of Ireland and the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 (Section 48) (Lending to Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises) Regulations 2015 which came into operation on 1 July 2016.<\/p><p>The sale of a loan from one entity to another does not change the terms of the contract or the borrower's rights and obligations under the original contract.  My Department will continue to keep all relevant legislation under review in order to ensure that borrowers whose loans have been sold are properly protected and do not lose any protections which they previously enjoyed.  In addition, the Department of Finance expect that the Central Bank as regulator of credit servicing firms, will be vigilant in this area and raise any specific instances where they have found consumers have not had their protections upheld or that their positions have been disadvantaged.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware non-performing loans (NPL's) remain at an elevated level across the European banking system and addressing this issue is one of the key priorities for the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM).  In Ireland significant progress has been made across the banking sector in reducing the level of NPLs since the financial crisis.  Despite this progress, the level of NPLs in the Irish banking sector remains well\u00a0above the European average.  Hence the SSM has tasked the management and board of each institution with developing and implementing a strategy to address this challenge.  This challenge will have to be met whether or not the State has a shareholding in the bank concerned.<\/p><p>As the Deputy is aware, the relationship between the Minister for Finance and the banks in which the State is a shareholder\u00a0are governed by a number of\u00a0Relationship Framework Agreements, which in the case of AIB can be found here: .  The Relationship Framework Agreements define the 'arms-length' nature of this relationship,\u00a0allowing for oversight\u00a0of\u00a0significant actions taken\u00a0while fully preserving the commercial independence of each bank, and the fiduciary responsibilities of their management and Board.  The disposal of a loan or portfolio of loans is a\u00a0commercial decision, and therefore a decision for the management and Board of each individual institution.  Such a disposal\u00a0is not subject to Ministerial consent but, if the value is greater than &euro;100m in the case of AIB, is subject to Ministerial consultation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700062#WRF04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"State Banking Sector","counter":339,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700062#WRF04250"},{"type":"question","counter":340,"qnumday":167,"qnumall":"[5385\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700062#WRF04300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if a decision to approve the sale of any shares owned by the Government in a bank (details supplied) will be put to a vote of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

In line with its mandate to ensure that the best interests of consumers are protected, the Central Bank's immediate focus is to ensure that lenders prioritise the identification of impacted customers and stop the harm.<\/p>  <p>  The Examination is a key priority for the Central Bank and it is working to ensure that the Examination is completed as soon as possible.  However, it is also critical that each lender carries out a thorough, comprehensive and robust review, which achieves a fair outcome for all customers.  While significant progress has been made, the Central Bank advises that due to the scale and complexity of the review, it will take some further time to complete.<\/p>  <p>  Specific timelines have been set for all lenders to complete their internal reviews, and some lenders will have their internal reviews completed sooner than others depending on the size of their mortgage books and the complexities associated with them completing the Examination.  Some lenders depending on progress have commenced rate rectification, redress and compensation, as appropriate.<\/p>  <p>  Based on current progress,\u00a0the Central Bank\u00a0expects that all relevant lenders will have identified and commenced engagement with most impacted customers by mid-2017.  Payment of redress and compensation, processing and consideration of any customer appeals and the Central Bank's own assurance work will continue beyond this point for some lenders. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank has set down a robust framework whereby lenders' internal reviews will be overseen by independent third parties.\u00a0  As part of the Examination, the Central Bank has made very clear what it expects of lenders in terms of redress and compensation to impacted customers, namely:<\/p>  <p>  - Lenders will ensure that harm is stopped at the earliest possible time after each group of impacted customers is identified;<\/p>  <p>  - Interest rates applied to impacted customers' accounts are to revert to the appropriate tracker interest rate or impacted customers are to be given the opportunity to revert to such a rate where relevant;<\/p>  <p>  - Redress should ensure that impacted customers are returned to the position they would have been in had lenders' failure not occurred;<\/p>  <p>  - Compensation, that reflects the detriment suffered by the individual customer, is to be provided by lenders; and<\/p>  <p>  - An additional payment is to be provided to impacted customers to enable them to take independent professional advice regarding the redress and compensation offers made to them.<\/p>  <p>  The Examination framework also requires lenders to establish an independent appeals process to deal with customers who are dissatisfied with any aspect of the redress package that they receive from lenders in respect of these matters.  While\u00a0the Central Bank\u00a0expects the lenders' reviews to deliver fair outcomes for customers, the Bank believes that the appeals process is a very important part of the overall framework to ensure that there is an independent and transparent process in place for any impacted customer who feels that their particular circumstances were not appropriately considered. <\/p>  <p>  The Central Bank will consider appropriate supervisory action, up to and including enforcement action, where necessary.  All possible angles, including potential individual culpability, will be thoroughly investigated and analysed in the context of the legal framework.  Enforcement measures will be deployed as appropriate, including investigating issues and taking cases under the Central Bank's Administrative Sanctions Procedure together with the use of\u00a0its fitness and probity powers.<\/p>  <p>  One enforcement action has already concluded, in which the Central Bank fined Springboard Mortgages &euro;4.5m, the largest fine ever collected by the Central Bank.

No. 116 of 2005 European Communities (International Financial Reporting Standards and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2005.<\/p>  <p>  An IFRS adopted in the EU must result in the presentation of a true and fair view of the financial position.  Recital 9 of the Regulation states \"To adopt an international accounting standard for application in the Community, it is necessary firstly that it meets the basic requirement of the aforementioned Council Directives, that is to say that its application results in a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of an enterprise this principle being considered in the light of the said Council Directives without implying a strict conformity with each and every provision of those Directives; secondly that, in accordance with the conclusions of the Council of 17 July 2000, it is conducive to the European public good and lastly that it meets basic criteria as to the quality of information required for financial statements to be useful to users.\"<\/p>  <p>  Article 3(2) of the Regulation and paragraph 17 of IAS 1 (adopted for use in EU) states that for financial statements to be fairly presented they must be relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable.  IAS 1 paragraph 19 references the 2001 Framework (as opposed to the Conceptual Framework) which includes a section on prudence.  The Framework states that \"uncertainties are recognised by the disclosure of their nature and extent and by the exercise of prudence in the preparation of the financial statements.  Prudence is the inclusion of a degree of caution in the exercise of the judgements needed in making the estimates required under conditions of uncertainty, such that assets or income are not overstated and liabilities or expenses are not understated.\"<\/p>  <p>  IAS 39 (adopted for use in EU) requires loans to be measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.  It also requires the use of an incurred loss approach for the calculation of impairment provisions on loans resulting in impairment provisions being recognised only when losses are incurred and not before then.  Under the incurred loss approach an entity assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a loan or group of loans is impaired.  IAS 39 states that a loan is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if there is \"objective evidence\" of impairment as a result of one or more events that occurred after the exposure was created (\"the loss event\") and that the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the loans and these cash flows can be reliably estimated.<\/p>  <p>  In April 2009, the G20 leaders called on \"the accounting standard setters to work urgently with supervisors and regulators to improve standards on valuation and provisioning and achieve a single set of high-quality global accounting standards\". \u00a0In this regard the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) issued a new accounting standard for Financial Instruments, IFRS 9, which will replace IAS 39.

The Revenue Commissioners were informed of the proposed structure in 2010 and raised no objection to it. <\/p><p>It is important to note that\u00a0NAMA's use of Section 110 structures is not new information. \u00a0NAMA has repeatedly and publicly disclosed its utilisation of SPVs, which include Section 110 structures\u00a0in its Annual Reports. \u00a0The C&amp;amp;AG has also been aware of NAMA's use of Section 110\u00a0company structures since NAMA's inception. \u00a0In October 2010, the C&amp;amp;AG published its Special Report entitled\u00a0&quot;National Asset Management Agency - Acquisition of Bank Assets.&quot; \u00a0Appendix E within this report\u00a0outlines\u00a0in detail\u00a0NAMA's Group Structure and its use of Section 110 Companies. \u00a0It also contains a detailed description of the principal tax benefits that accrue to a qualifying Section 110 company. \u00a0This report is publically available at: .<\/p><p>NAMA's accounts have been audited, since inception,\u00a0by the C&amp;amp;AG and filed with Revenue and reflect activity by NAMA that is, and has been, operating in full compliance with the tax code. \u00a0Following\u00a0the change that\u00a0we, as a legislature, made\u00a0to the tax law governing Section 110 companies last year, NAMA paid &euro;158 million to the Revenue Commissioners as a preliminary tax payment to reflect its expected tax obligations under this new tax regime.  Thus, NAMA has always and continues to act\u00a0in accordance with tax law. \u00a0Through this payment, NAMA\u00a0is now simply moving,\u00a0as would be expected, to operate\u00a0in line with the recent\u00a0change\u00a0to tax legislation.  Under Section 214 of the NAMA Act, NAMA,\u00a0the Agency - which owns 49% of the NAMA Group companies, is exempt from income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax. \u00a0NAMA Group companies, which contain all of the assets, liabilities and activities\u00a0of NAMA, do not benefit from such an exemption and are\u00a0tax-equivalent to any other market operator.<\/p><p>The tax\u00a0exemption of the NAMA Agency does not adversely affect the Exchequer given that any surplus generated by the NAMA Group companies will accrue to the NAMA\u00a0Agency and will vest in the\u00a0State on a tax neutral basis.<\/p><p>The purpose of utilising Section 110 companies was\u00a0to ensure that there was no unnecessary cash leakage from within the NAMA Group.  This is no different to any other\u00a0market operator.\u00a0 In NAMA's case, this was particularly important given the need to redeem guaranteed senior debt expeditiously and also the need to apply available cashflow to fund development projects ultimately intended to preserve and enhance the State's return from acquired assets, as required by Section 10 of the NAMA Act.  Under an\u00a0alternative tax regime, the amounts applied by NAMA towards debt redemption and development funding may well\u00a0have been different.  However, I do not think that it is useful to engage in hypothetical speculation on what may have happened if a different tax regime had been in place prior to 2016.\u00a0 Finally, I would also remind the Deputy that all\u00a0NAMA\u00a0proceeds, whether through tax payments\u00a0or the return of NAMA's\u00a0surplus at dissolution, are\u00a0transferred to the State.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700063#WRG04900","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":405,"qnumday":193,"qnumall":"[6047\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700063#WRG05100","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if his attention has been drawn to whether any other State bodies or agencies, apart from NAMA, under his Department's remit have been using the section 110 tax structure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1223","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":406,"content":"<p>Having consulted with the eighteen bodies under the\u00a0aegis of the Department of Finance, I have been advised\u00a0that in addition to NAMA, the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) and IBRC (in Special Liquidation)\u00a0are\u00a0the only other bodies\u00a0which have\u00a0been using the section 110 tax structure.

There may also be new research opportunities for Ireland as a remaining member of the EU and participant in the Horizon 2020 programme to build new collaborations with industry.  These opportunities will be maximised.  The Government will work constructively to maintain the greatest possible links and co-operation between the EU and the UK in access to EU programmes.<\/p>  <p>  As regards international students, the ongoing consultation process and the planning work by my Department has identified risks and opportunities around this area. \u00a0In addition to our ongoing stakeholder consultations on Brexit, the Government's new International Education Strategy, Irish Educated, Globally Connected, 2016-2020 was published last October.  The High level group on International education (HLG), which comprises all stakeholders has been tasked with monitoring the overall implementation of the actions in the strategy.  The HLG will also review any opportunities or threats that emerge during the Brexit negotiations and propose any actions that need to be taken in response to these threats or opportunities.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700063#WRG05900","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Tourism Data","counter":414,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700063#WRG06000"},{"type":"question","counter":415,"qnumday":196,"qnumall":"[5436\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700063#WRG06100","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions allocated in the Cork south west constituency in 2015 and 2016;

There are no plans to re-establish a dedicated training organisation for the sector, but rather to deliver the required education and training through the mainstream higher and further education and training sectors, in line with provision for other sectors.<\/p><p>The Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGSFN) carried out a study on the future skills needs of the sector and the report of the study was published in November 2015. The objective was to assess demand arising within the sector in Ireland including hotels, restaurants, bars, canteens and catering over the period to 2020. The aim was to ensure that there will be the right supply of skills to help drive domestic hospitality sector business and employment growth. The report provides a clear and coherent framework for the development of talent in the hospitality sector in the years ahead to help drive both hospitality business and employment growth which is one the key goals of the Government&rsquo;s Tourism Policy Statement &ndash; People, Place and Policy-Growing Tourism to 2025. <\/p><p>The Study assesses skills demand at all NFQ levels, with a particular focus on career progression opportunities for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings. The report provides a set of recommendations designed to address the skills requirements of the sector over the period to 2020.  A key recommendation in the report was the need to set up of a National Oversight and Advisory Group comprising all the key hospitality stakeholders.  <\/p><p>Following on this recommendation, the Hospitality Skills Oversight Group was established early last year, chaired by SOLAS for the first year.  To date the group has held seven meetings.<\/p><p>Membership of the Group includes the Restaurant Association of Ireland, the Irish Hotel Federation, Irish Hospitality Institute, Licenced Vintners Association, Vintners Federation of Ireland, F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Department of Education and Skills, Department of Social Protection, Higher Education Authority, Skillnets, SOLAS, ETBs, IoTs, DIT and Quality and Qualifications Ireland. <\/p><p>The role of the Group is to monitor progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the EGFSN and to provide a forum for on-going collaboration in addressing the skills needs of the sector and to identify and progress actions to overcome barriers on its implementation.  <\/p><p>The Group plan to publish a progress report later this year.  To date work has been undertaken on careers promotion via a range of fora, the launch of the <i>Tourism Insight<\/i>online programme &ndash;aimed at promoting careers in tourism and hospitality with particular reference to transition year and Youthreach participants.  Audits of both higher and further education facilities and courses are underway as well as the establishment of a Restaurant and Hospitality Skillnet which aims to address key skills requirements of restaurants and catering companies to help drive the domestic hospitality sector, employment growth, talent attraction and retention. <\/p><p>Funded through the National Training Fund by my Department, the network plans to design tailored programmes covering all aspects of the restaurant, food and beverage industry to SMEs nationally, with a particular focus on career progression for those at lower skilled levels to help fill anticipated job openings and increase retention levels within the sector and is well placed to address key recommendations of the EGFSN 2015 Report on the Future Skills.<\/p><p>Last week, I launched the 2016-2020 Action Plan to expand Apprenticeship and Traineeship in Ireland, setting out how state agencies, education and training providers and employers will work together to deliver on the Programme for Government commitments on the expansion of apprenticeship and traineeship in the period to 2020. The Plan sets out how we will manage the pipeline of new apprenticeships already established through the first call for proposals in 2015 and also commits to a new call for apprenticeship proposals later this year, to provide for the needs of all sectors, including hospitality and tourism.Over the lifetime of the Action Plan, 50,000 people will be registered on apprenticeship and traineeship programmes representing a doubling of current activity. <\/p><p>Work is progressing on the development of a new Commis Chef Apprenticeship led by the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland working with Kerry Education and Training Board. It is planned that this programme will commence later this year.  The Apprenticeship Council also recently approved development funding for a separate proposal to develop a Chef de Partie Apprenticeship.  The Apprenticeship Council will continue to work with the proposers of these new programmes to develop them into sustainable apprenticeships that can be delivered on a nationwide basis. The funding for planned and forecast expansion in 2017 will see an additional &euro;20 million provided.  <\/p><p>In 2015 a new Career Traineeship initiative was begun by SOLAS in collaboration with ETBs and enterprise to develop a more effective model of work-based learning, primarily at NFQ levels 4 and 5, incorporating best national and international research and practice. Networks of Employers have been created to facilitate partnerships between ETBs and employers in identifying training needs, designing the training programmes, recruitment of learners and delivery of the training on and off the job. The Career Traineeship model of work-based learning is currently being piloted with the Hospitality and Engineering sectors, with the involvement of seven ETBs.<\/p><p>Given the breadth and range of programmes within the Further Education and Training (FET) sector, it is not possible to provide details of funding and places on a county by county basis across specific sectoral provision. However, one way in which Solas classify FET provision is by the career areas which it serves. The attached table on provision in the FET sector, shows the total number of beneficiaries in the career areas of Food and Beverage and Tourism in each of the sixteen Education and Training Boards for 2015 along with that planned for 2016. As yet, final 2016 figures are not available. <\/p><p>While it is not possible to give details of expenditure at the level of career areas, the scale of total investment in FET and the numbers served on both a full and part time basis are also included in the table.  <\/p><p>In relation to the number of tourism and hospitality skills training positions within the higher education sector in 2015 and 2016 and the amount of funding allocated for tourism and hospitality skills training in the same years, it is not possible to give a breakdown by county as students can apply for courses throughout the country, through the CAO application process.  However the attached table on provision in the higher education sector gives a breakdown outlining the number of training positions and the total estimated funding allocated which is categorised by each individual Institute.<\/p><p>In 2015 the total number of student in higher education courses in this sector was 8,220 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;47.4million and in 2016 the total number of student  for the sector was 8,033 with estimated funding allocated of approx. &euro;48.4m.  The funding detailed in this response includes an estimation of grants allocated to these courses, student contribution and free fees. The student numbers are calculated as full time equivalents (FTE) which includes part time and full time student counts.  <\/p><p>This analysis of the higher education sector includes all courses within the following categories:  <\/p><p>-  Tourism\/Hotel\/Leisure\/Event<\/p><p>-  Hospitality &amp;amp; Culinary<\/p><p>-  Heritage &amp;amp; Cultural <\/p><p><b><font color=\"#1F497D\"> <\/font><\/b>I also<font color=\"#1F497D\"> <\/font>understand that a limited amount of complementary tourism-related business development and training supports are provided by F&aacute;ilte Ireland, the agency responsible for encouraging, promoting and supporting tourism as a leading indigenous component of the Irish economy.

Of these 3,484 are attending primary ASD classes and 1,118 are attending post primary ASD classes. <\/p>  <p>  In 2011 there were 548 special classes, of which 224 were primary ASD classes, 72 were post primary ASD classes and 34 were early intervention classes.  The remaining 218 were special classes service children with mild to moderate\/severe general learning difficulties and specific learning difficulties including speech and language difficulties. <\/p>  <p>  There are currently 1,153 special classes,\u00a0which is an increase of over 100% on the number available in 2011.\u00a0 Of these, 127 are ASD early intervention classes, 525 are primary ASD classes and 237 are post-primary ASD classes.  The remainder are non ASD special classes. <\/p>  <p>  With regard to County Donegal, there are currently 36 ASD special classes, of these, 21 are in primary schools and 15 are post-primary ASD classes, including 3 new post-primary classes which opened in September 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The NCSE, in consultation with the relevant education partners, must take into account the present and future potential need, location and sustainability in looking to establish special classes in certain areas. \u00a0In this regard the\u00a0NCSE has advised that they are continuing to engage with schools, and in particular the school referred\u00a0to by the Deputy, in opening special classes\u00a0where there is an identified need for special class provision.<\/p>  <p>  The continued growth in post primary special class numbers is a natural consequence of the earlier growth in primary special class numbers.  However, it should not be assumed that the same levels of growth in post primary class numbers should apply.

I am also working to ensure that housing is delivered much more quickly from key strategic sites in both public and private ownership, particularly off State lands.<\/p><p>In addition, local authorities, through the City and County Management Association are engaging directly with the Department of An Taoiseach and my Department in relation to the impact and implications of Brexit.<\/p><p>With regard to ensuring sufficient supply is coming on-stream in Dublin, my Department works closely with the four Dublin local authorities, through the governance arrangements under <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>and more specifically, through the Dublin Housing Supply Coordination Taskforce, which was established to address supply-related issues to the delivery of homes in the Dublin region.  The Taskforce comprises representatives from my Department, the Chief Executives of the four Dublin local authorities (Dublin City, Fingal County, South Dublin County and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils), NAMA and other agencies.  Its remit includes monitoring relevant housing data on the supply of viable and market-ready approved developments.<\/p><p>In that regard, in its report for Quarter 3 2016, the Taskforce reports that there are some 5,500 homes under construction in Dublin, with permissions in place for a further 23,700 homes on which construction has not yet commenced.  The full report can be accessed on my Department&rsquo;s website at the following link: .<\/p><p>A suite of actions is being implemented under <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>, building on actions already underway, to make residential property delivery viable, at a far greater scale and at more generally affordable prices and rents.  A copy of <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>can be accessed at the following link:  <i><font color=\"#0000FF\"> <\/font><\/i><\/p><p>.<\/p><p>Under Pillar 3 of <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>, &ldquo;Build More Homes&rdquo;, I have identified twenty three Major Urban Housing Development Sites with the potential to deliver up to 30,000 additional homes, 20,000 of which will be in Dublin, on existing zoned lands and close to the key areas of demand, over the next three to four years.  These sites will be highlighted as exemplars for the co-ordination and delivery of plan-led housing development and active land management.<\/p><p>Full details of these sites can be accessed at the following link: .<\/p><p>In order to get these and other key sites activated quickly, a &euro;200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) has been established.  Twenty-one local authorities, including the Dublin local authorities, working in conjunction with housing providers, submitted proposals for funding which are currently being evaluated. Successful bid proposals will be announced shortly. <\/p><p>Separately, the NTMA and ISIF are currently exploring opportunities to support the delivery of housing-related on-site enabling infrastructure in large-scale priority development areas with a view to kick starting the development process.<\/p><p>Providing affordable, quality and accessible housing is a top priority for the Government.  Under the aegis of the Cabinet Committee on Housing, chaired by An Taoiseach, the Government and I will be keeping the implementation of <i>Rebuilding Ireland<\/i>under careful review.  The <i>First Quarterly Progress Report,<\/i>for Quarter 3 2016, was published in November 2016, and is available to view and download at: .  The Second Quarterly Progress Report, for Quarter 4 2016, will be published shortly.<\/p><p>While we were working from a low base, with only 12,666 housing completions in 2015, the output trends are positive and upward, with completions reaching circa 15,000 homes for 2016.  All stakeholders now need to build on these early gains to further accelerate output to meet the target of at least 25,000 homes per annum by 2021, in order to achieve moderated rents and house prices, with the consequential benefits a sustainable housing system will bring for any FDI opportunities that may arise post-Brexit.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700066#WRK01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Rent Pressure Zones","counter":551,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700066#WRK01850"},{"type":"question","counter":552,"qnumday":261,"qnumall":"[5398\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700066#WRK01900","dept":"Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government","question":"if he will publish the data used to determine which LEAs were eligible for designation as rent pressure zones; and if he will publish the advice and the report given to him by the Housing Agency on designations.

Subsection 2(c) provides for the presiding officer to put certain questions to a person applying for a ballot paper, or to administer an oath or affirmation, by the person, to confirm that they are the person on the register of electors.<\/p>  <p>  The Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2014 (S.I. 321 of 2014) specify, in regulation 2(b), the identification documents that are acceptable for this purpose.

The presiding officer is instructed that the persons selected at random should constitute at least 25% (1 in 4) of persons coming to vote at the polling station and that they should be particularly vigilant at rush hours because it is then that personation is most likely to be attempted.

Its main aim was to help unemployed jobseekers to break the vicious cycle of &lsquo;no experience no job, but no job no experience&rsquo;.  Since then over 19,000 Host Organisations have offered work placement opportunities to over 48,000 participants.<\/p><p>The findings of the recent external evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon Economic Consultants show that the scheme has been very effective in improving the employment outcomes of jobseekers.  It indicates that 79% of participants &ndash; about 38,000 people &ndash; have had some period of employment since completing their placement, with over 64% still in employment. Jobseekers who participated in JobBridge improved their employment outcomes by 32% when compared with non-participants.  By any measure this is a significant uplift and shows that placements with a direct link to an employer deliver higher employment outcomes than other options.<\/p><p>Most importantly, the scheme is viewed positively by participants.  A majority of over the 10,000 respondents to a survey rated the scheme positively on 18 out of 20 aspects.  For example, 70% of participants felt that the placement provided them with a quality work experience and gave them new skills. <\/p><p>The complete Indecon evaluation can be found at: .  <b><\/b><\/p><p>While acknowledging that success, it is clear that we can do better.  For example, jobseekers feel that the payment could be improved, and employers indicated a willingness to contribute to the cost of the scheme.  As a &lsquo;catch-all&rsquo; type of programme, there are some deadweight and displacement costs associated with it that can be tackled.<\/p><p>So, having considered the evidence and suggestions put forward by Indecon and the Labour Market Council, I announced my intention to replace JobBridge with a new work experience programme that is better suited to the much-improved labour market and addresses criticisms of the scheme. <\/p><p>In taking this path, I am conscious that any new scheme needs the support, trust and confidence of employers, jobseekers and the public.  That is why I instructed my officials to consult with key stakeholders on the design principles that should underpin any new work experience programme. <\/p><p>I closed JobBridge to new applications from October 2016 to facilitate this consultation and an orderly wind-down of the existing scheme.  These consultations are well underway and I expect my officials to report back to me on the outcome shortly.

Its main aim was to help unemployed jobseekers to break the vicious cycle of &lsquo;no experience no job, but no job no experience&rsquo;.  Since then over 19,000 Host Organisations have offered work placement opportunities to over 48,000 participants. <\/p><p>The findings of the recent external evaluation of JobBridge by Indecon Economic Consultants show that the scheme has been very effective in improving the employment outcomes of jobseekers.  It indicates that 79% of participants &ndash; about 38,000 people &ndash; have had some period of employment since completing their placement, with over 64% still in employment.  Jobseekers who participated in JobBridge improved their employment outcomes by 32% when compared with non-participants. By any measure this is a significant uplift and shows that placements with a direct link to an employer deliver higher employment outcomes than other options.<\/p><p>Most importantly, the scheme is viewed positively by participants.  A majority of over the 10,000 respondents to a survey rated the scheme positively on 18 out of 20 aspects.  For example, 70% of participants felt that the placement provided them with a quality work experience and gave them new skills. <\/p><p>The complete Indecon evaluation can be found at: .<\/p><p>Over 1,500 jobseekers in Kerry have participated in JobBridge since 2011 2011.

Since the referendum in June, my Ministerial colleagues and I have discussed the status of Irish citizens on numerous occasions with our UK counterparts.  Most recently, my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, visited London last week and met with the UK Secretary of State for Work and Pensions as well as with Irish community groups.<\/p>  <p>  A key factor in achieving this objective will be the continuation of the Common Travel Area (CTA) arrangements between Ireland and the UK.  At their meeting in Dublin last week, at which I participated, the Taoiseach and Prime Minister May reaffirmed their joint commitment to maintaining the CTA and to continuing the two Governments&rsquo; work in this regard.<\/p>  <p>  For her part, Prime Minister May has listed the CTA as one of her priorities for the exit process.  On 2 February the UK Government published its White Paper on Brexit, in which the special status afforded to Irish citizens in the UK in the Ireland Act 1949 was noted, as was the mutual desire of the UK and Irish Governments to protect the reciprocal treatment of each other&rsquo;s citizens.<\/p>  <p>  In the particular case of the CTA, and as with other specific-Irish related issues, it is clearly important that we secure the understanding and support of the EU institutions and Member States regarding this long-standing and important bilateral arrangement.  Accordingly, the Government continues to engage very actively at both the political and official\/diplomatic levels in setting out our key priorities to various EU interlocutors.  As part of this work, I had a very positive meeting yesterday with my new Italian colleague, Foreign Minister Alfano, and will be visiting both Brussels and Helsinki later this week.<\/p>  <p>  It is important and welcome that Ireland&rsquo;s concerns have been explicitly and publicly recognised by the chief negotiators of both the Commission and the European Parliament, Michel Barnier and Guy Verhofstadt respectively.<\/p>  <p>  Therefore, while formal negotiations have not yet begun, and as we await the triggering of the Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union by the United Kingdom, important groundwork has been done with both the UK government and with our EU partners. <\/p>  <p>  In tandem with these efforts, the Government, my Department, and our diplomatic missions in the UK will continue their close contact with the Irish community as the exit process continues.  Since before the referendum, the Government has been engaging closely with the Irish community about practical issues which might arise from the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU.  On 19 and 20 January Minister of State McHugh visited London where he had a series of engagements with representatives and members of the Irish community there, and I will also meet with them during my next visit.  The Irish Embassy in London and our Consulate in Edinburgh continue to provide support to the Irish community in a variety of ways, including through the Government&rsquo;s Emigrant Support Programme. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700069#WRN01100","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":750,"qnumday":331,"qnumall":"[5343\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700069#WRN01300","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if English will continue to be one of the working languages of the European institutions post-Brexit.","asker":"1311","askee":"1233"},{"type":"question","counter":751,"qnumday":335,"qnumall":"[5865\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700069#WRN01400","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"if English will remain an official language of the European Union after Brexit; and the discussions taking place in this regard.","asker":"1361","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":752,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 331 and 335 together.<\/p>  <p>  The status of the English language as an official and working language of the EU institutions will not be altered as a result of the UK leaving the EU.

The interlocking political institutions of the Good Friday Agreement are at the heart of the Agreement, and are the delivery vehicle for many of its commitments.  Within this framework, the devolved power-sharing institutions are vital - both for effective government in Northern Ireland and for the overall functioning of the Agreement.  For instance, without the devolved institutions, the North South Ministerial Council cannot be convened and North-South cooperation on a wide range of matters is compromised.  This has tangible and serious impacts on all people across this island. <\/p>  <p>  It is therefore of vital importance that the institutions of the Agreement return quickly to full operation after the current election.  In this regard, the relevant legislation provides a narrow window of three weeks from the date of election to when a new First and deputy First Minister must be nominated.<\/p>  <p>  It will therefore fall to the parties to form a power-sharing Executive and this will require them to find a way forward on issues which contributed to the calling of the election.

The US cannot suspend its obligations under the Geneva Convention by means of this Executive Order.  I have noted the clarification issued by the Embassy of the United States in Dublin on 31 January, 2017, to the effect that the Executive Order in question does not restrict the travel of dual nationals to the United States, so long as they hold the passport of an unrestricted country and possess a valid US visa, if required.  In recent days, the US courts have intervened and imposed a temporary suspension on the implementation of the Executive Order.<\/p>  <p>  Issues regarding the recent Executive Order and immigration reform were high on the agenda for my visit to Washington DC from 31 January to 2 February.  I had a number of engagements with the Administration and Congressional leaders, including the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, the House majority leader and the House minority leader, among others.<\/p>  <p>  In my meetings with Congressional leaders, as well as with the US National Security Advisor, General Flynn, I expressed Ireland&rsquo;s deep concerns with regard to the nature and impact of the recent Executive Order.  In response, General Flynn outlined to me the rationale - in terms of US immigration policy - for these temporary measures, while I pointed out their damaging consequences in humanitarian terms, as well as for the international reputation of the United States.<\/p>  <p>  In regard to immigration reform, achieving relief for the undocumented Irish citizens in the United States and securing a legal pathway for migration to the United States remain key objectives for the Government.  These priorities featured in all of my meetings in Washington, DC &ndash; including with General Flynn in the White House, with Speaker Ryan and other Congressional leaders.<\/p>  <p>  Both the Administration and members of Congress are fully aware of the importance of this issue for Ireland and appreciate our strong continuing interest in securing immigration reform.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s forthcoming visit to Washington DC for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day will provide a key opportunity to raise the issue of immigration reform &ndash; especially the plight of our undocumented &ndash; directly with President Trump.<\/p>  <p>  During my visit, I also met with members of the Irish community in Washington, DC and re-assured them of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to immigration reform.  I emphasised that, while the political context in Washington may have changed, the Government&rsquo;s objectives remain constant: relief for the undocumented and finding some legislative pathway for legal immigration.  I noted that we can only advance these objectives if we engage and build relationships with the key decision makers in the Administration and Congress.<\/p>  <p>  In addressing these immigration issues, the Embassy of Ireland in Washington and our Consulates across the United States continue to work with Irish Immigration Centres on a daily basis in providing support to Irish citizens in the United States.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland&rsquo;s Ambassador to the United States, Ms Anne Anderson, held a workshop with key immigration stake-holders, in the Irish community, from across the United States at the Embassy on 12 January last.

Where a pregnancy related illness is serious it will also be covered by the CIP.  One of the criteria for awarding of CIP more generally is 2 consecutive weeks of hospitalisation, however, this requirement is reduced to 2 days for pregnancy related illness in accordance with Labour Court recommendation (ref: LCR 20667).<\/p><p>(iv) Pregnancy related illnesses are also discounted for consideration of promotion and higher duty allowances.<\/p><p>In these ways, the Public Service Management (Sick Leave) Regulations, S.I. 124 of 2014 recognise the distinct position of the pregnant worker and make provision for the protection of the health and welfare of such workers.

This Group examined a number of issues, including the number and spatial distribution of post offices, branch modernisation, the streamlining of products and services, postmaster payments and contracts, and training and qualifications for post office employees.

The NCPE determined, following an evaluation of the economic dossier, that the manufacturer failed to demonstrate cost-effectiveness or value for money from using the drug.  The NCPE have confirmed that all relevant costs were included in the analysis. In line with the HSE's assessment process, the HSE Drugs Committee considered the NCPE recommendation, the manufacturers submissions and commercial offer and other information.  Following this consideration the Drugs Committee did not recommend reimbursement at the current price.  The HSE Directorate considered the Drugs Committee&rsquo;s recommendation in December and the Directorate took the decision not to reimburse at the current price offered by the company. <\/p><p>The HSE has since re-entered into negotiations with Vertex, the manufacturer of Orkambi, with a view to significantly reducing the cost of Orkambi.

Monitoring is carried out in a number of ways including review and evaluation of suspected adverse reaction reports, published literature, epidemiological studies and additional clinical trial results.  The HPRA continually assesses new and emerging safety data as it becomes available and undertakes regulatory action as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  The HPRA encourages healthcare professionals and medicine users to report suspected adverse reactions to medicines.  Such reports are essential for the HPRA to ensure that regulatory action\/proposals take account of all available data.  There are several options in place for reporting suspected adverse reactions to the HPRA including online reporting options and the traditional &ldquo;yellow card&rdquo; which can be completed and forwarded to HPRA utilising &lsquo;free post&rsquo;. <\/p>  <p>  On Monday 19th September 2016 the HPRA&rsquo;s first public information campaign went live across national radio, digital and print media.  The aim of the 6 week advertising campaign was to create awareness of the importance and benefits of taking medicines safely.  It encouraged the public to take three minutes to always read the information leaflet with their medicine and to make sure that they know the correct dose and instructions for use.<\/p>  <p>  Pharmacists also have an important role to play in ensuring the safe use of medicines.<\/p>  <p>  Under the Code of Conduct for Pharmacists and Regulation 9 and 10 of the Regulation of Retail Pharmacy Businesses Regulations 2008, pharmacists have a professional and legal responsibility to ensure that prescription-only medicines and non-prescription medicines are supplied safely to patients and members of the public, with sufficient information for their appropriate and rational use.  As a recognised expert in the use of medicines, the pharmacist has a unique opportunity and duty to discharge that responsibility in their interaction with patients.

This cooperation occurs both within the framework of our common EU membership and on a bilateral basis.  The primary concern of the Department of Health in addressing the implications of Brexit is to ensure continuity of health services and to avoid any changes to the current situation that would have a negative impact on human health.  This will be pursued on both a bilateral and EU-wide basis as appropriate. <\/p>  <p>  An extensive programme of engagement is underway at political and official level regarding the implications of Brexit in the area of health.  I discussed this matter with my Northern Ireland Minister of Health counterpart, Michelle O&rsquo;Neill MLA, at the NSMC health sectoral meeting on 9 November.  We noted the fact that work is ongoing in each jurisdiction to deepen analysis and that this is challenging when it is not yet known what new arrangements may emerge as regards the UK&rsquo;s future relationship with the EU.  We will keep this matter under review at future NSMC health sector and plenary meetings.  I have discussed the issue of Brexit with the UK Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for Health, David Prior, and the UK Secretary of State for Health, Jeremy Hunt.  I also held bilateral meetings with the European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety on 3 October 2016 and on 6 February, at which we discussed the implications of Brexit in the health sphere.<\/p>  <p>  In addition to the above, there is ongoing engagement between senior officials from my Department and their counterparts in the UK and Northern Ireland in relation to Brexit.  The Secretary General and Management Board of the Department of Health met with the Permanent Secretary of the Northern Irish Department of Health and his Management Team on 12 January and explored issues relating to Brexit as part of this engagement.  It has been agreed to hold a further meeting in six months&rsquo; time.  The Secretary General also met with the UK Permanent Secretary of the Department of Health on 17 January. Engagement will continue with the UK and Northern Executive at political and official level, particularly as positions crystallise on areas of shared interest relating to the health sector in a post-Brexit context. Of course, Ireland will be part of the EU 27 team and looks forward to working with our fellow Member States in delivering the best possible result for Ireland and for the EU. In line with the agreement at EU level, there have been and will be no negotiations with the UK until Article 50 has been triggered. <\/p>  <p>  My Department is building on initial work completed to deepen its analysis of the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies arising over the longer term as a result of the UK's decision to leave the EU, including in the area of cross-border health co-operation.  A Department of Health Management Board Subcommittee on Brexit was established in advance of the UK referendum to examine the implications of a decision to leave the EU on healthcare in Ireland and for Irish citizens.  The Subcommittee is chaired at senior level and made up of representatives from across the Department, as well as from the HSE at National Director level.  This sub-committee has met four times, with each division within my Department providing support and analysis.  My Department has not yet sought a specific meeting of the All Island Dialogue on Brexit.  However, the Department has tasked the HSE and its other agencies with conducting further analysis on the impact of Brexit, which is ongoing, and is currently considering the issue of a wider stakeholder consultation.<\/p>  <p>  The issue of access to health services in the UK and other EU member states is being considered as part of wider contingency planning being undertaken to address the implications of Brexit in the area of health.  The HSE operates a Treatment Abroad Scheme (TAS), for persons entitled to treatment in another EU\/EEA Member State or Switzerland under EU Regulation 883\/04, as per the procedures set out in EU Regulation 987\/09, and in accordance with Department of Health Guidelines. Patients apply to the HSE TAS seeking access to public healthcare outside the State through model form E112.  The application requires the patient's Irish-based public referring hospital consultant, following clinical assessment, to certify, among other things, that the treatment is medically necessary and will meet the patient&rsquo;s needs.  The treatment must not be available within the State or not available within a time normally necessary for obtaining it.  Irish patients who had planned to travel to the UK under the Treatment Abroad Scheme may continue to do so as planned.  This scheme will continue to apply to the remaining 27 EU Member States following the departure of the UK, as will initiatives such as the Cross-Border Healthcare Directive for people entitled to public patient healthcare in Ireland who want to avail of that healthcare in another EU\/EEA member state.  I wish to assure the Deputy that there are no immediate changes in the area of health as a consequence of the UK's decision to leave the EU.  It is important to be clear that until the UK formally withdraws from the Union, it remains a full member, with all of its existing rights and obligations. <\/p>  <p>  Assessing and managing the risks related to the UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU will be an iterative process as issues emerge and recede in the coming weeks and months.  Dealing with the implications of Brexit in the area of health will remain a priority over the period ahead. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700072#WRQ04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"question","counter":1005,"qnumday":421,"qnumall":"[5670\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700072#WRQ04600","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the number of meetings that have taken place by his Department&rsquo;s Brexit committee; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1229","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1006,"content":"<p>My Department is building on initial work completed to deepen its analysis of the possible impacts, risks, opportunities and contingencies arising over the longer term as a result of the UK's decision to leave the EU, including in the area of cross-border health co-operation.

In an attempt to address the increasing need for mental health services, a \"Mini Mojo\" starter programme has been introduced.

A toolkit has also been designed to guide and inform potential new Mojo groups.<\/p>  <p>  Much of the success of the programme to date has been the immense investment in building and engaging key stakeholders in the community and it is vital that the ethos and structure of the programme is not diminished by a rapid expansion plan.

Recognising that there is no single simple answer, the Bill includes a range of measures designed to collectively have a positive impact on the health and well-being of Irish people.<\/p>  <p>  The Department considered the specific retail environment at airports when drafting the Bill.  A full exemption from the Minimum Unit Price provisions was provided to all alcohol products sold in tax-free shops to travellers departing the State.  A further exemption was provided to airports in relation to the separation and visibility of alcohol products.  These exemptions were provided to allow Irish airports to retain their competitive advantage i.e. Irish Duty Free and Travel Retail premises can maintain their tax exemption and compete with other international airports that employ similar exemptions.  Similarly, given the unique retail environment, alcohol products can continue to be sold from more than one location in airports.<\/p>  <p>   My Department considers that the suite of measures contained in the Bill are a proportionate response to address the harms caused by the misuse of alcohol and bring about a cultural shift in our attitude to alcohol.  The principle of the labelling provision is to provide consumers with information about the alcohol product and to provide health warnings.  On this basis, the Department is not providing an exemption from the labelling provisions in the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.  The labelling provisions will apply to all retailers.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill provides a 3 year lead in time for the introduction of the labelling provisions.  This time frame was adopted following a consultation with the industry and is considered to give sufficient time for manufacturers and retailers to prepare for these new provisions.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS01800","answer":true,"speaker":"1339"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Hospital Appointments Delays","counter":1129,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS01900"},{"type":"question","counter":1130,"qnumday":465,"qnumall":"[6006\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS02000","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the reason a person (details supplied) has not received an update or an appointment for their child.","asker":"1271","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1131,"content":"<p>As this question relates to service matters, I have arranged for the question to be referred to the Health Service Executive (HSE) for direct reply.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1251"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"General Medical Services Scheme","counter":1132,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS02200"},{"type":"question","counter":1133,"qnumday":466,"qnumall":"[6007\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS02300","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"the position regarding the charging for the taking of bloods by general practitioners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1348","askee":"1251"},{"type":"speech","counter":1134,"content":"<p>There is no provision under the GP GMS contract for persons who hold a medical card or GP visit card to be charged for routine phlebotomy services provided by their GP, or the Practice Nurse on behalf of the GP, which are required to either assist in the diagnosis of illness or the treatment of a condition.

Brexit may have very serious implications for the Irish thoroughbred racing and breeding industry and the concerns of the sector will need to be taken into account in any discussions\/negotiations on the matter.  To a large extent the horse racing and breeding industries of the UK and Ireland operate as one with horses, trainers, riders regularly moving between both jurisdictions.<\/p>  <p>  The situation is further complicated by the fact that horse racing and thoroughbred breeding has always been operated on an all island basis in Ireland.  All trainers in Northern Ireland are licensed by the Irish Turf Club and races there are run under the Turf Club's Rules of Racing.  90% of runners at these fixtures are trained in the Republic with horses moving on a daily basis, so the return to a hard border would seriously disrupt this movement.<\/p>  <p>  The two countries operate a single entity for stud book purposes (i.e. British and Irish foals are both registered in the one stud book) and together with France, have historically had a tripartite agreement between the respective Departments of Agriculture to facilitate free movement of thoroughbred horses between the three countries.  It is vital that this is retained.<\/p>  <p>  Ireland exports of thoroughbreds to Britain are worth approx. &euro;225 million each year, which may be at risk due to reduced trade flows following the vote in favour of Brexit.  Any exchange rate volatility which might occur as a result of Brexit could also make Irish exports more expensive.<\/p>  <p>  The introduction of tariffs or regulations has the potential to increase the cost of business and reduce the free movement of labour and horses.<\/p>  <p>  The Government has adopted an initial Contingency Framework to map out the key issues that will be most important to Ireland in the coming weeks and months.  This will be an iterative process as issues emerge and recede in the course of negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that the Board of Horse Racing Ireland are greatly concerned about the threat created by Brexit and have set up an industry wide group to examine the issues of concern and to ensure that the concerns are clearly known and addressed.  The Board and officials from my Department are working closely together to highlight these issues.<\/p>  <p>  My Department is engaging with EU institutions, other member states, stakeholders and with our counterparts in Northern Ireland and Great Britain and feeding into the overall Government Brexit response, which is being co-ordinated by the Department of the Taoiseach.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS06900","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Imports Data","counter":1180,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS07000"},{"type":"question","counter":1181,"qnumday":481,"qnumall":"[5362\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS07100","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the tonnage of ware potatoes imported here which, by country of origin, were the produce of the state of Israel and-or the Palestinian territories, in each of the years 2014 to 2016.","asker":"1259","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1182,"qnumday":482,"qnumall":"[5363\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS07200","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the estimated financial value of ware potatoes imported here which, by country of origin, were the produce of the state of Israel and-or the Palestinian territories, in each of the years 2014 to 2016.","asker":"1259","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1183,"qnumday":483,"qnumall":"[5364\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS07300","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the location, by district council area, of those companies based here that required importation permissions or phytosanitary certificates authorising them to import ware potatoes which, by country of origin, were the produce of the state of Israel and-or the Palestinian territories, in each of the years 2014 to 2016.","asker":"1259","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1184,"qnumday":484,"qnumall":"[5365\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS07400","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the number of companies based here with importation permissions or phytosanitary certificates or which have indicated to his Department or any of its agencies that they will be applying for same authorising them to import ware potatoes in 2017 which, by country of origin, are the produce of the state of Israel and-or the Palestinian territories.","asker":"1259","askee":"1285"},{"type":"question","counter":1185,"qnumday":485,"qnumall":"[5366\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700074#WRS07500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the location, by district council area, of those companies based here with importation permissions or phytosanitary certificates or which have indicated to his Department or any of its agencies that they will be applying for same authorising them to import ware potatoes in 2017 which, by country of origin, are the produce of the state of Israel and-or the Palestinian territories.","asker":"1259","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1186,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 481 to 485, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The table sets out the volume and value of ware potatoes imported from Israel since 2014:<table><tr><th>Year<\/th><th>Tonnes<\/th><th>Value<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>3467<\/td><td>&euro;1,206,516<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>2160<\/td><td>&euro;751,680<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2016<\/td><td>2181<\/td><td>&euro;758,988<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>My Department has no recorded importations of product (or any imports labelled as such) from the Palestinian Territories.<\/p><p>In relation to the issue of importation procedures, there are a significant number of importers registered with my Department and they are authorised to import a range of commodities of plants and plant products directly from Third Countries into Ireland.

The BDGP builds on the substantial investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years and will continue to drive further developments and improvements in this area.  I have recently introduced a Sheep Welfare Scheme which provides targeted support for breeding ewes which concentrates on areas which can make a positive contribution to the welfare of sheep flocks.  Many of these welfare actions will also have a positive consequence on the productivity and efficiency of these flocks.<\/p>  <p>  The BDGP and the Sheep Welfare Scheme were agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan (2014-2020) alongside a number of other schemes such as ANCs, GLAS and TAMS, which also benefit suckler farmers.  I am very conscious of the positive effect that the BDGP programme is having on the Irish suckler herd and the positive effect the Sheep Welfare Scheme will have on the national breeding flock.  Both schemes will help to improve productivity and profitability in these enterprises. <\/p>  <p>  I am of course conscious of the challenges faced by suckler and sheep farmers currently and am strongly of the view that the BDGP and the Sheep Welfare Scheme are the most appropriate means of providing targeted support to these farmers. <\/p>  <p>  The current model of funding for farmers in both these sectors provides support to enable farmers to improve\u00a0efficiency and profitability by improving the overall genetic merit of their beef herd as well as improve the welfare of breeding flocks in Ireland.  I firmly believe that these schemes will deliver tangible long-term and cumulative positive effects for both farmers participating in these schemes, and for farmers who buy the progeny of farmers in these schemes be that weanlings or store cattle for further finishing or store lambs for further feeding also.  These schemes will also make a significant contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s well-established reputation as a producer of sustainable, high-quality beef and sheep meat. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to any possible reopening of the BDGP, this is currently being considered in the context of an assessment of budgetary priorities, the operation of the Rural Development Programme and the potential impact both upon the scheme itself and other schemes.

This was very well attended by stakeholders from across the industry and gave a clear insight into the real dangers that Brexit\u00a0poses, and involved an examination of\u00a0the worst case scenario of \u00a0a 'hard' Brexit for sea fisheries.<\/p>  <p>  Fish stocks are a shared resource managed under the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union.\u00a0 Nearly all of the main commercial stocks upon which the Irish fisheries sector is reliant are shared to some degree with the UK.\u00a0 In addition, many of our traditional fishing grounds lie within UK waters.\u00a0 Any change to the existing situation could have very serious negative consequences for our fleets.  Loss of access to fishing grounds and possible reductions in existing quotas were clearly identified at the event last week\u00a0as the main threats facing the industry.<\/p>  <p>  I will be\u00a0unequivocal in\u00a0opposing\u00a0any dilution of our existing EU quota shares, including protecting the benefit to Ireland of the Hague Preferences, and any\u00a0limitations\u00a0on our existing rights of access.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My Department, together with its agencies and stakeholders, has been considering\u00a0all of the potential impacts, looking at the areas where the greatest risks will arise and on which we will need to focus when the negotiations begin.\u00a0 Ensuring that our fishing interests are reflected in the overall EU negotiating position will be a key priority. <\/p>  <p>  I have established a dedicated Brexit unit in my Department, and a consultative committee of stakeholders has been convened in order to ensure a full exchange of information as negotiations proceed.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  My officials are in constant contact with their counterparts in the European Commission and\u00a0have recently met with the Director General of Fisheries to impress upon him Ireland&rsquo;s key interests in the upcoming negotiations.<\/p>  <p>  I will remain in close contact with fisheries stakeholders as the issues develop and work with them and my fellow fisheries Ministers in the EU to ensure that we are all fully prepared for what are likely to be extremely complex negotiations.\u00a0\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  For the sake of clarity, I would just note that these negotiations will \u00a0not be a renegotiation of the Common Fisheries Policy.  The CFP remains in place and will be up for review from 2019\u00a0with the\u00a0review and any agreed changes due to be concluded by 2022. \u00a0By the time that process begins, the UK will, in all probability, have left the EU and so will not be party to the negotiations on a new CFP.<\/p>  <p>  At this time we do not know the\u00a0kind of relationship that  the UK want with the EU in terms of fisheries post -exit.  When we know what the UK is seeking, we will, as I have said work closely with our EU partners with a view to seeking \u00a0a new relationship with the UK. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland is fully committed to managing stocks sustainably and\u00a0achieving fishing mortality at Maximum Sustainable Yield by 2020 at the latest.

This would\u00a0necessitate a linear cut across payment to all BPS beneficiaries. The estimated annual \u00a0cost of such a measure would exceed &euro;200 million. <\/p>  <p>  Ireland has supported the greater market orientation of the CAP over recent reforms, including\u00a0the decoupling of payments from production.  This has\u00a0provided farmers a measure of income stability from the Basic Payments Scheme while allowing them\u00a0 to adjust production in response to\u00a0 market demand.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to funding under Pillar II of the CAP, the Beef Data and Genomics Programme is the current main support for the suckler sector and provides farmers with some &euro;300 million of funding over the next\u00a0six \u00a0years.  The BDGP builds on the substantial investment in data recording and genomics which has been made in recent years and will continue to drive further developments and improvements in this area. <\/p>  <p>  The BDGP was agreed with the European Commission as part of Ireland&rsquo;s Rural Development Plan (2014-2020) alongside a number of other schemes such as ANCs, GLAS and TAMS, which also benefit suckler farmers.  I am very conscious of the positive effect that the programme is having on the Irish suckler herd. It will help to improve productivity, profitability and carbon efficiency in the national herd. <\/p>  <p>  The BDGP provides support to enable suckler farmers to improve\u00a0efficiency and profitability by improving the overall genetic merit of their beef herd.  I firmly believe that the scheme will deliver tangible long-term and cumulative positive effects for both suckler farmers participating in the scheme, and for farmers who buy the progeny of suckler cows for further finishing.  It is also a significant contributor to Ireland&rsquo;s well-established reputation as a producer of sustainable, high-quality beef. <\/p>  <p>  In relation to any possible reopening of the scheme, this is currently being considered in the context of an assessment of budgetary priorities, the operation of the Rural Development Programme and the potential impact both upon the scheme itself and other schemes.  Increasing the BDGP payment to &euro;200 per animal, even just for existing applicants, would require a doubling of the Budget under the BDGP, with at least &euro;350m additional expenditure required over the lifetime of the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  \u00a0It should also be noted that support under RDP schemes can only be provided on the basis of costs incurred or income foregone. Even if it were possible to reallocate resources from within the RDP, any increase in the level of payment to participants\u00a0in the BDGP would require\u00a0the Department to submit an amendment of the RDP to the EU Commission, and an evaluation and approval by the relevant Directorates General.  Even if a revised scheme were approved,\u00a0any increase in the level of payment would inevitably result in additional actions being required\u00a0to be carried out by farmers. <\/p>  <p>  The Department will, of course continue to keep expenditure under the Rural Development Programme under review on an ongoing basis.  As with all such programmes, there are inevitably issues of timing around the scheduling of payments. Savings in one year do not necessarily imply savings over the lifetime of the programme. <\/p>  <p>  The suckler sector is a vital component of Ireland&rsquo;s rural economy and the\u00a0provision of support for the suckler sector is critically important. The range of supports as currently\u00a0\u00a0configured represents a balance between direct income support for the sector and rural development measures designed to improve its competitiveness and sustainability.  I believe that it is entirely appropriate to maintain this balance of developmental and income supports into the future.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700077#WRV01600","answer":true,"speaker":"1285"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Forestry Grants","counter":1350,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700077#WRV01650"},{"type":"question","counter":1351,"qnumday":544,"qnumall":"[5921\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700077#WRV01700","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the total funding provided for forestry in 2016 and 2017; the level of funding provided for each programme; if any of this expenditure is sourced from the European Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1270","askee":"1285"},{"type":"speech","counter":1352,"content":"<p>The current Afforestation Scheme provides a range of grants that cover the full cost of establishment of the plantation and payment of annual premiums to both incentivise planting and to compensate for the loss of agricultural activity on the land that is planted.

Pay As You Go meters are offered free of charge to energy consumers experiencing financial difficulty.  Since their introduction in 2011, more than 180,000 electricity and gas PAYG meters have been distributed.

Additionally, they advise that the level of customer complaints they receive is low but that they are working with energy suppliers to investigate and address persistent problems.  They are also working to mitigate the problem through proactive support of those retailers who aren&rsquo;t engaging in the practice.  They do this through the provision of promotional material that can encourage customers to use retailers who do not apply surcharges and in the case of repeat offenders, payment providers have the ability to withdraw a payment terminal. <\/p>  <p>  The CER has also been working to address this problem by engaging with energy suppliers and has written to suppliers to remind them of their obligations to prevent this practice.  My officials have requested that the aforementioned NGO's keep the Department appraised of any growth in the practice of surcharging.

The Programme for Government commits to the delivery of the NBP as a matter of priority.\u00a0 This is being achieved through a combination of commercial investment by the telecommunications sector and a State intervention in those areas where commercial investment has not been fully demonstrated.\u00a0 <\/p><p>A key principle of the NBP is to support and stimulate commercial investment through policy and regulatory measures.  Commercial investment since the publication of the NBP has considerably exceeded expectations.  To date, the commercial telecommunications sector has invested over &euro;2.5bn in upgrading and modernising networks which support the provision of high speed broadband and mobile telecoms services.\u00a0 <\/p><p>There has been significant progress in relation to broadband rollout so that today, approximately 1.4m or 61% of premises in Ireland can get high speed broadband of a minimum of 30 Megabits per second.  The NBP has been a catalyst in encouraging investment by the telecoms sector, which is continuing to expand this footprint. <\/p><p>The High Speed Broadband Map, which is available at www.broadband.gov.ie shows the current extent of the State Intervention area:\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The areas marked BLUE represent those areas where commercial telecommunications providers are either currently delivering or have previously indicated plans to deliver high speed broadband services,\u00a0 <\/p><p>- The areas marked AMBER on the High Speed Broadband Map represent the target areas for the State Intervention, which are the subject of the current procurement process.  It is intended that premises within this area will have access to services of at least 30 megabits per second when the procurement process is completed and the network rolled out.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><p>There are circa 88,000 premises in County Kildare, approximately 20,000 (23%) of which are located in the Amber area on the Map, and will benefit from the NBP&rsquo;s State Intervention.\u00a0 The remaining c.68,000 (77%) premises are located in the commercial blue area and will be served by commercial operators. <\/p><p>The map indicates that the townlands of Beltichburne in County Louth, Castletown in\u00a0Navan,County Meath, Addinstown in County Westmeath and the Templemartin area in County Cork are all within the AMBER area and will therefore, be included in the State Intervention procurement process under the NBP. <\/p><p>Individuals can check whether their premises is in a BLUE or an AMBER area by accessing the High Speed Broadband Map and entering their Eircode.<\/p><p>My Department is actively monitoring commercial deployment plans in the BLUE areas to ensure that all households and businesses can get access to the services.  My Department is also actively monitoring developments of commercial operators that might impact the Intervention Area.\u00a0 This is being done in accordance with procedures set out by my Department in December 2015. <\/p><p>I should add, however, that the provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter for the service providers concerned who operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).\u00a0 I do not have a statutory authority to require commercial companies to rollout services to particular locations.<\/p><p>A formal procurement process is in train to select a company or companies who will roll-out a new high speed broadband network within the State Intervention Area.  My Department will shortly update the High Speed Broadband map to finalise the Intervention Area for the Procurement process, taking into account industry investments that have not materialised in Blue areas, together with new industry investments within the proposed State Intervention Area, along with concrete and credible commitments by industry for further new investments within the Intervention Area.<\/p><p>The procurement process is being intensively managed, to ensure an outcome that delivers a future-proofed network that serves homes and businesses across Ireland, for at least 25 years.  Intensive dialogue with bidders is continuing and the three bidders have indicated that they are proposing a predominantly fibre-to-the-home solution.  This provides for a future proofed solution for the 25 years of the contract and beyond.\u00a0 A fibre-to-the-home solution means that householders and businesses may get speeds not just of 30 Megabits per second but much higher, potentially up to 1000 Megabits per second.\u00a0 <\/p><p>The timeframe for the procurement continues to be dependent on a range of factors including the complexities that may be encountered by the procurement team and bidders, during the procurement process.  During the Department's extensive stakeholder consultations in 2015, telecommunications service providers indicated a 3-5 year timeline to rollout a network of the scale envisaged under the NBP. <\/p><p>As part of the competitive process, the Department will engage with winning bidder(s) on the best rollout strategy, in order to target areas of particularly poor service, business needs and\/or high demand.  This will need to be balanced with the most efficient network rollout plan.  A prioritisation programme will be put in place in this regard, in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  A detailed rollout plan for the network will be published once contract(s) are in place. <\/p><p>The Programme for Government also commits to measures to assist in the rollout of the network once a contract is awarded.  In this regard, Minister Humphreys is leading on the establishment of two regional action groups, working with Local Authorities, Local Enterprise Offices and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build in rural Ireland, once a contract(s) has been awarded.<\/p><p>In a further positive initiative, last July, I established a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce with my colleague Minister Humphreys to address immediate issues in relation to the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage.  The Taskforce report which was published in December, is available at the following link:.  The report of the Taskforce contains 40 actions that will alleviate some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland, and the Implementation Programme on Mobile Phone and Broadband Access\u00a0identifies 19 of these 40 actions as areas where immediate and direct action by Government Departments and State Agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.  Each of the actions contained in the Report and Implementation Programme has its own timeframe for delivery, which is set out in the Report. In order to maintain the momentum created by the Taskforce, an Implementation Group is being established to drive and monitor the implementation of the actions.\u00a0 <\/p><p>I have signed Regulations allowing ComReg to proceed with the allocation of spectrum in the 3.6GHz band, in early 2017.

At least one operator now has in excess of 90% 4G population coverage.  The rate of demand for data services has however increased by 500% in the last four years and this presents a continuing challenge for mobile operators, regulators and policy makers both in Ireland and internationally. <\/p>  <p>  I specifically included in the Programme for Government a commitment to a Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce.  In July 2016, I established the Taskforce, together with Minister Humphreys, which has identified immediate solutions to broadband and mobile phone coverage deficits and investigating how better services could be provided to consumers prior to full build and rollout of the network planned under the National Broadband Plan State intervention (NBP).  The\u00a0report was published in December and\u00a0is available on both our Departments' websites. <\/p>  <p>  In producing this report, the Taskforce worked with Government Departments, Local Authorities,\u00a0ComReg, State Agencies, the telecoms industry and other key stakeholders.  The Taskforce also took into consideration practices in existence outside of\u00a0Ireland, including the French National Broadband Plan and the UK Regulator's consumer coverage map.<\/p>  <p>  The report contains 40 actions that will alleviate\u00a0some of the telecommunications deficits across Ireland and the Implementation Programme on Mobile Phone and Broadband Access identifies 19 of these\u00a040 actions as areas where immediate and direct action by government Departments and State Agencies can ensure accelerated benefits to consumers.

The 700 MHz band is particularly suited to rural environments where the signal can travel long distances.\u00a0 <\/p>  <p>  These initiatives should assist in enhancing the quality of mobile phone and data services across Ireland, and particularly in rural Ireland. <\/p>  <p>  In parallel, the National Broadband Plan aims to deliver high speed services to every city, town, village and individual premises in Ireland, through private investment and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment have not been fully demonstrated. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700078#WRW02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1432,"content":"<p>Question No. 573 answered with Question No. 569.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1433,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 574 and 575 answered with Question No. 41.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1434,"content":"<p>Question No. 576 answered with Question No. 48.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1435,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 577  to 579, inclusive, answered with Question No. 569.<\/p>"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Renewable Energy Generation","counter":1436,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700078#WRW03550"},{"type":"question","counter":1437,"qnumday":580,"qnumall":"[6060\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700078#WRW03700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"his plans to attain the various targets in respect of climate change such as reduction in dependancy on fossil fuels, carbon reduction and encouragement of the alternative energy sector; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1438,"qnumday":582,"qnumall":"[6063\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700078#WRW03800","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which alternative non-fossil fuel resources continue to be developed in line with the need to meet EU and international targets; if it is expected to achieve the levels required; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"question","counter":1439,"qnumday":583,"qnumall":"[6064\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700078#WRW03900","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the extent to which natural energy resources continue to be developed and made available to the public; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1440,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 580, 582 and 583 together.<\/p>  <p>  The overarching objective of the Government's energy policy is to ensure secure and sustainable supplies of competitively priced electricity to all consumers.  The Energy White Paper, published in December 2015, sets out a high-level \u00a0framework for Ireland's energy transition to a low carbon economy and society and identifies a range of measures and actions to support this aim.<\/p>  <p>  The 2009 EU Renewable Energy Directive sets Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable sources by 2020.  Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat and 10% of transport from renewable sources of energy, with the latter\u00a0target also being legally binding.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) has calculated that 25.3% of electricity, 6.5% of heat and 5.7% of transport energy requirements were met from renewable sources at end 2015.  Overall,\u00a0SEAI analysis\u00a0shows that 9.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s\u00a0energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources and that this avoided &euro;286 million of fossil fuel imports.  Provisional data for 2016 from\u00a0SEAI shows\u00a0that 27.3% of electricity demand was\u00a0met\u00a0from renewable sources. <\/p>  <p>  The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy and although good progress towards the target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.  My Department is currently developing a proposed new Renewable Electricity Support Scheme (RESS) and a new Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI)\u00a0Scheme, designed to assist in\u00a0meeting our RES-E and RES-H targets.  The introduction of any new scheme - including the overall costs and technologies to be supported - will be subject to Government approval and State Aid clearance from the European Commission. <\/p>  <p>  In the transport sector, Ireland aims to meet its renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles also making a small contribution.\u00a0 Further increases to the obligation rate in the Biofuels Obligation Scheme\u00a0took effect from 1 January 2017 when the rate\u00a0increased to 8% by volume.<\/p>  <p>  Budget 2017 has provided over &euro;100 million to support energy projects.\u00a0 This funding will be split between the existing energy efficiency programmes and rolling out a series of new initiatives and pilots that can lay the foundation for increased investment in future years, which will also support employment in the sector. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700078#WRW04000","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1441,"content":"<p>Question No. 581 answered with Question No. 572.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":1442,"content":"<p>Questions Nos. 582  and 583 answered with Question No. 580.<\/p>"},{"type":"question","counter":1444,"qnumday":584,"qnumall":"[6065\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700078#WRW04500","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the amount of electricity now being generated from oil, gas, wind, biomass or other alternatives including those likely to become available expressed as a percentage of daily electricity requirements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1445,"content":"<p>Details in regard to the sources of electricity generation in 2015\u00a0(latest data) are publicly available in the report\u00a0entitled <i>Energy in Ireland 1990-2015<\/i>,\u00a0published by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI)\u00a0in November 2016 and\u00a0available on the SEAI website at www.seai.ie.<\/p><p>The data shows\u00a0that 27.3% of electricity demand in 2015 was\u00a0met\u00a0from renewable sources. <table><tr><th>Electricity Outputs (GWh)<\/th><th>2015<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Coal<\/td><td>16.9%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Peat<\/td><td>8.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Oil<\/td><td>1.4%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Natural Gas<\/td><td>43.0%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Renewables<\/td><td>27.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Of which:<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Hydro<\/td><td>2.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Wind<\/td><td>22.8%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Landfill gas, biogas, biomass and renewable wastes<\/td><td>1.7%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Non-Renewable Wastes<\/td><td>0.3%<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Net Imports<\/td><td>2.3%<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p>Overall,\u00a0SEAI analysis\u00a0shows that 9.1% of Ireland&rsquo;s\u00a0energy requirements in 2015 were met from renewable sources and that this avoided &euro;286 million of fossil fuel imports. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700078#WRW04600","answer":true,"speaker":"1234"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Exploration Licences Data","counter":1446,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700078#WRW04650"},{"type":"question","counter":1447,"qnumday":585,"qnumall":"[6066\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700078#WRW04700","dept":"Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","minister":"Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources","question":"the uptake of exploration licences in each year from 2008 to 2016 and to date in 2017; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1234"},{"type":"speech","counter":1448,"content":"<p>Under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960 and the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999, I am required to lay before the\u00a0Houses of the Oireachtas half yearly reports detailing all petroleum and mineral exploration and development authorisations granted during the period of the report.

","asker":"1253","askee":"1213"},{"type":"speech","counter":1492,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 588 to 623, inclusive, and 626 together. <\/p>  <p>  Firstly, I strongly disagree with the policy recently announced by President Trump to temporarily ban travel to the US by nationals of certain countries.  As you know, there is currently a suspension in place for this Executive Order, which is the subject of an appeal at a US Federal Appeals Court and we await the outcome of that appeal.<\/p>  <p>  Notwithstanding this, my officials have already been in contact with the US authorities and have conveyed our concerns about President Trump's Executive Order and its implications for US Preclearance services at Shannon and Dublin Airports.<\/p>  <p>  A meeting of the Preclearance Consultative Group had been arranged for 1 March 2017.  In light of recent events, my officials\u00a0have\u00a0requested that this meeting be brought forward.  This is a mechanism outlined in the Preclearance Agreement which allows for representatives from both parties to meet and review any operational issues arising related to the Agreement.  This meeting has now been set for Thursday, 23 February.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  Arising from the clarification issued by the US Embassy in Dublin late last week, Irish citizens travelling to the United States on Irish passports under the ban should not have encountered any\u00a0difficulties in this regard, as long as they\u00a0followed the relevant procedures governing the US Visa Waiver Programme.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  US Preclearance\u00a0in Ireland is\u00a0a service whereby passengers\u00a0can avail of the option to be precleared (undertaking all immigration, customs, agriculture and other border control inspections) in Dublin and Shannon Airports for entry into the United States.  The Preclearance service is available to all travellers on a voluntary and non-discriminatory basis.  The terms and conditions of the Preclearance arrangements with the US are covered by an International Agreement and by domestic legislation, the Aviation (Preclearance) Act 2009.\u00a0<\/p>  <p>  The preclearance facility is within Irish jurisdiction and the laws of Ireland apply at all times, enforced by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is expressly confirmed at Article II(5) of the Preclearance Agreement.  Given the fact that US law does not apply, provision is made at Article II(6) of the Agreement to confirm that passengers who wish to avail of preclearance do so on condition that they recognise and consent to the right of the US to grant or refuse preclearance in accordance with its laws.<\/p>  <p>  If someone is refused permission to fly to the US at preclearance in either Dublin or Shannon Airports, the passenger then becomes the responsibility of An Garda Sioch&aacute;na who deal with them, in line with Irish law and in accordance with\u00a0the full human rights protections that apply.  A refusal at US Preclearance has no impact on the rights available to refugees or persons wishing to seek asylum in Ireland.  If they apply for asylum they will be dealt with in the normal way or if they wish to return to their point of origin they will be facilitated.  These are issues for Irish Immigration authorities and US officials have no role in relation to them.  It should also be noted that my Department does not have responsibility for policy in relation to international refugees.<\/p>  <p>  The operation of the Ireland-US Preclearance Agreement does not conflict with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, nor does it give rise to any breach of obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  The Agreement expressly provides that\u00a0nothing in the Agreement diminishes the rights enjoyed by individuals under the Constitution and laws of Ireland or the US.  While the right to travel is recognised under the Irish Constitution, there is no right under the Irish Constitution whereby Ireland could require another sovereign State to allow an individual entry to that State.  The right of a passenger to enter the US is a matter for US law.<\/p>  <p>  The Ireland-US Preclearance Agreement may be terminated at any time by either party, by giving one year's written notice to the other party.  There is no provision in the Agreement for suspension.  Therefore, Ireland has an obligation, under International law, to adhere to the terms of the Agreement unless it is terminated in accordance with the procedure laid down.  However, it is important to point out that the US Preclearance facility is\u00a0a very valuable arrangement for Ireland, as well as being of benefit to the United States, and having discussed the matter last week,\u00a0the Cabinet was\u00a0in favour of retaining our Preclearance facilities.<\/p>  <p>  In light of recent events, An Taoiseach has requested that a review of US Preclearance in Ireland be undertaken by the relevant Departments - Justice and Equality, Foreign Affairs and Trade and my own Department.\u00a0 A report will be made to An Taoiseach this week.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700079#WRX03900","answer":true,"speaker":"1213"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Road Network","counter":1494,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700080#WRY00200"},{"type":"question","counter":1495,"qnumday":624,"qnumall":"[5361\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700080#WRY00300","dept":"Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport","minister":"Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport","question":"if his Department has received an application from the local authority for the construction of a new pedestrian footbridge to span the Clady river at An Bun Beag in County Donegal,\u00a0adjacent to the R527 road route;

This represents a 9.6% increase over the Department&rsquo;s allocation secured in the 2016 Revised Estimates Volume.<\/p>  <p>  The additional funding is in recognition of the need to accelerate regional jobs development and to maintain our supports for research, development and innovation.

This is an increase of 22%.  This will enable the IDA to continue to compete in the intensively competitive global market for mobile investment to win new investments to Ireland.  This significantly increased funding will also be used by the IDA to maintain and further grow employment across their existing clients in Ireland who now employ 199,877 people in Ireland, the highest level ever in the IDA&rsquo;s history.<\/p>  <p>  Enterprise Ireland is being provided with a total capital allocation of &euro;185 million in 2017 through my Department&rsquo;s Vote.  This is an increase of &euro;11.6 million, up 6.6% on its 2016 allocation of &euro;173.4 million.  This will enable Enterprise Ireland continue its enterprise and innovation supports across its client cohort who now directly employ over 201,000 people in Ireland.

The statement indicated an intention to continue with preparations in Parliament to allow the UK to ratify the Agreement in coming months.  Assuming that the UK ratifies the UPC Agreement while still a member of the EU, this should pave the way for the UPC to come into effect.

A receiver is a person who is appointed on behalf of a secured creditor to sell the particular company asset which has been charged in favour of that creditor.  A receiver is appointed under a) the terms of the debenture for stated reasons or b) by court order.  Most debentures today provide for the appointment of a receiver where a \"default event\" occurs.  As the receiver is appointed under the terms of a debenture, it goes without saying that she or he will act as the creditor&rsquo;s agent.<\/p>  <p>  Section 433 of the Companies Act 2014 sets out the categories of persons who are disqualified to act as the receiver of a company e.g. an undischarged bankrupt; an employee or an officer of the company concerned or a person who was such within the period of 12 months\u00a0before the date of the commencement of the receivership;\u00a0certain specified family members of an officer of the company concerned.<\/p>  <p>  Receivership is a remedy that derives from the courts of equity and indeed the relevant law in relation to receivership is largely made up of rules which the courts have developed by applying general contract law and equitable principles.  Under the Companies Act 2014 the receiver has specific statutory duties under section 439 which provides that:<\/p>  <p>(i) receivers must achieve the best\u00a0 price reasonably obtainable at the time of sale; and<\/p>  <p>(ii)\u00a0the receiver must not sell by private contract a non-cash asset of a company to a person who is or who, within three years prior to the date of appointment of the receiver, has been, an officer of the company unless the Receiver has given 14 days&rsquo; notice of his or her intention to do so to all creditors of the company who are known to him or her or who have been intimated to him or her.<\/p>  <p>  These statutory duties make it imperative that the receiver obtains expert legal and valuation advice in relation to the sale of property, consistent with the duty &ldquo;to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable&rdquo;.  Breach of a receiver&rsquo;s statutory duties may result in the receiver being held personally liable for any loss incurred.\u00a0 Conferring statutory powers on receivers in the Companies Act 2014 was intended to alleviate many of the problems which may arise from poorly drafted debentures.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted that receivers also have a statutory duty to provide certain information to the Registrar of Companies and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700082#WRAA04200","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Ministerial Correspondence","counter":1669,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700082#WRAA04250"},{"type":"question","counter":1670,"qnumday":689,"qnumall":"[5706\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700082#WRAA04300","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if she will respond to correspondence dated 1 November 2016 which was sent to her office via email on 10 November 2017 and co-signed by this Deputy.","asker":"1238","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1671,"content":"<p>A response\u00a0was issued to the Deputy\u00a0on\u00a03 February 2017.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700082#WRAA04400","answer":true,"speaker":"1247"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Health and Safety Regulations","counter":1672,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700082#WRAA04450"},{"type":"question","counter":1673,"qnumday":690,"qnumall":"[5746\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700082#WRAA04500","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"if her attention has been drawn to the fact that crane drivers are being hired without having completed proper training and that employment agencies are supplying letters to approved training centres stating that six months of training has been completed by persons, although this is not the case; if the Health and Safety Authority has been made aware of this issue; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1258","askee":"1247"},{"type":"speech","counter":1674,"content":"<p>Under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013 (S.I.

This commitment aligns closely with work on the design and development of a new Single Affordable Childcare Scheme and is currently being progressed in that context.  As part of this, Department officials are reviewing previous published research and analysis on the cost of childcare provision, are assessing available data sources and are scoping the precise requirements for the independent review.  This review will feed into future policy development, including in relation to levels of payments to services.<\/p>  <p>  In relation to wage rates, my Department is not the employer to childcare workers.  Nevertheless I do acknowledge the reality that the ECCE scheme provides the majority of income for many childcare providers, and I am aware that the sector is under cost pressure.  To go some way towards addressing this, I have secured significant additional funding in Budget 2017, including some &euro;10m which will enable ECCE providers to be paid for a 39th week and part of a 40th week (7 ECCE days in total or 1.4 ECCE weeks) where they will have no children present and they will be able to pay staff to concentrate on administrative workload.  Services themselves can decide how to use the payment when it is received.  For the average ECCE service with 25 children, this will mean an additional annual payment of approximately &euro;2,400 per annum.  Additional funding will also be given to CCS and TEC providers on a pro-rata basis also to acknowledge their administrative burden.  The Affordable Childcare Scheme when introduced will replace CCS and TEC and will have recognition of non-contact time built into its cost base.  In addition, under Budget 2017 a provision was made for a fund of &euro;1m to assist in the investigation of sustainability issues being faced by childcare providers, and to develop a policy to guide any future interventions. <\/p>  <p>  My Department will continue to monitor the situation with regard to staffing and service closures in the childcare sector- in 2016 capital funding was provided to more than 50 childcare services in the Fingal area to increase capacity.  I hope to announce a similar scheme for 2017 shortly. If parents are experiencing difficulty sourcing childcare in Fingal, I would urge them to contact the Fingal County Childcare Committee.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700083#WRBB01500","answer":true,"speaker":"1358"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Garda Vetting Applications","counter":1693,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700083#WRBB01600"},{"type":"question","counter":1694,"qnumday":698,"qnumall":"[5828\/17]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2017020700083#WRBB01700","dept":"Department of Children and Youth Affairs","minister":"Minister for Children and Youth Affairs","question":"if Tusla currently applies for Garda vetting for its employees; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1228","askee":"1358"},{"type":"speech","counter":1695,"content":"<p>The HSE currently undertakes vetting on behalf of Tusla.

Under the Child Care Regulations, 1995 a care plan for each child who is received into care is required which provide, inter alia, for the welfare of the child, the care practices, care records, accommodation and safety precautions.  A key consideration for the social worker is to consult with the child, family members and other people involved with the child to ensure that his or her needs are being met by the agreed care plan.  The regulations stipulate that all care plans are to be reviewed and updated on a regular basis and sets out the frequency for these reviews to take place. <\/p>  <p>  A child is placed in a residential setting only when they have an identified need that can be met by this service or for an intensive assessment or provision of specialist services.  Residential care is usually for older children, where their needs may not be met in foster care or where this is their preferred placement.  In general, these centres are based in domestic style homes in the community, catering for 2 or 3 older children and staffed by social care workers to attend to the needs of the child.  Some of the young people in residential care will have come into care recently, while others may have experienced the breakdown of other care placements, including foster care.
