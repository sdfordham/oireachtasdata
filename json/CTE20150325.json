During our sessions this week we are hearing from a number of witnesses on the role of the media during the property boom in the lead into the banking crisis 2002-07 and any changes in approach after the crisis.  At our first session this morning we will hear from Dr. Julien Mercille, lecturer at UCD's school of geography, planning and environmental policy.  I welcome Dr. Mercille before the inquiry.<\/p><p>Dr. Mercille holds a PhD from UCLA and an MA from the University of Kentucky.  His research focuses on global politics, international political economy, US foreign policy, media studies, and the war on drugs, from a critical political economy perspective.  He has published extensively on those subjects in peer reviewed journals, book manuscripts, as well as in the media, and appears on television and radio regularly as an expert in current affairs.  In addition to his academic writing, he is a regular analyst and commentator for publications such as <i>Asia Times<\/i>, <i>openDemocracy<\/i>, <i>Truthout<\/i>, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>and <i>al-Jazeera<\/i>among others.

The statement analyses the role played by the Irish media in the property bubble in the years leading to the banking crisis.  It discusses also media performance in more recent years.  In particular, the statement addresses the following points about which the committee wishes to hear my views: the role in the mainstream media for scepticism about the sustainability of the housing boom or the broader economy; potential conflicts of interest in news content associated with revenues from property sector advertising; consistent promotion of buying over renting in the media; and the prevailing view that there would be a soft landing in the property market.  So much of the information presented in the statement arose in my book, as the Chairman mentioned, <i>The Political Economy and Media Coverage of the European Economic Crisis: The Case of Ireland<\/i>in which more detailed and systematic data may be found.<br\/><br\/>So for the property bubble before the crash, my overarching point is that news organisations largely convey the views of political and economic elites.  It is true that there are many debates taking place in current affairs reporting but they are mostly confined to the range of opinions within the establishment, and thus narrow in relative terms.  Most research on the media focuses on journalists' herd mentality and reporters' lack of training in finance.  However, I use a political economic framework and identify three main factors that account for the nature of coverage of the economic crisis.<\/p><p>The first is the media's links with the corporate and government sectors, the second is advertising pressures, and the third is sourcing.  I will take the three points one after the other.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the links between the media and the corporate and government sectors, both private and State-owned media organisations largely convey corporate and political establishment views, but for somewhat different reasons.  Private media entities are large corporations embedded in a for-profit economic system and are thus part and parcel of the broader market economy.  This has several consequences.  First, in order to start and successfully run a media company with any substantial outreach, significant financial investments are necessary, which means that only wealthy individuals and corporations are able to do so.  Second, media firms are integrated into the market and feel the pressure from bankers, shareholders and directors to generate profits.  Links with the broader corporate sector, including political elites, are created and maintained through boards of directors, as well as general business and social interactions.  Independent News and Media, which is arguably the dominant media conglomerate in Ireland, owns numerous newspapers, magazines, radio stations and websites here and abroad.  Just like other news organisations, its board has included numerous individuals linked with the corporate establishment.  The same goes for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, whose board has included a CEO of Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent, a bank deeply involved in the housing bubble, along with members of IBEC and other businesses.  Third, the media have a close relationship with the Government.  News outlets depend on the State for licences and franchises, and so the Government is in a position to exert some leverage over news coverage.  Also, State-owned media are, by definition, controlled by the Government to a greater or lesser extent through funding and appointments of principal officers.  During the boom years, RTE had as chairman a director of Anglo Irish Bank, which epitomised the excesses of the Celtic tiger and property lending.<br\/><br\/>Thus, because the housing boom was beneficial to key sectors of the Irish corporate and political establishment, it was never seriously challenged.  Rising property prices directly benefited builders and developers, banks, the Government, property firms and, directly, the broader economy thanks to high growth levels.  The Government was able to collect large tax revenues from the property boom through stamp duty, capital-related taxes, income taxes on construction workers and taxes on construction materials.  For example, while total property-related taxes accounted for 4% of Government revenue in 1996, they accounted for over 17% by 2006.<br\/><br\/>My second point concerns advertising.  Advertising revenues are crucial to today's news industry.  They allow newspapers to be sold for a lower price, making them more competitive.  This affects news content, because corporate advertisers tend not to subsidise television programmes or news stories that seriously question or attack their own business or the political and economic system of which they are a part, which would be directly contrary to their interests.  One particularly clear example of the significance of advertising to the Irish media is the large amount of funding from property advertising received during the housing boom years.  The Irish media went even further in benefitting from property advertising money.  They became owners of property websites, acquiring a direct stake in the growing housing bubble.  For example, in 2006, INM bought <i>www.propertynews.com<\/i>and the <i>Property News<\/i>monthly newspaper - the largest Internet property site in Ireland - and, in 2006, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>bought the website <i>www.myhome.ie <\/i>for &euro;50 million, along with the website <i>www.newaddress.ie<\/i>, which aims to make it easier for homeowners to move residences.  Also, most newspapers published weekly supplements about commercial and residential property, glamorising the whole sector, while glowing editorial pieces about a new housing estate were often miraculously accompanied by a large advertisement plugging the same estate, in the words of Deputy Shane Ross, the former <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>business editor.  Ross also stated that unfavourable coverage of developers and auctioneers in other parts of the newspapers was regularly met by implied threats from property interests that advertising could go elsewhere.  Moreover, an Irish reporter stated that journalists were leaned on by their organisations not to talk down the banks and the property market because those organisations were heavily reliant on property advertising.<br\/><br\/>My third point concerns sourcing.  Journalists depend mostly on mainstream institutions for their reports because of limited resources, time constraints and a competitive news environment.  Reporters need to connect those institutions that provide a steady flow of news, which in practice means large organisations that have themselves the resources to produce and release such a stream of material.  The Government and corporations are two such sources, with the result that their points of view are predominant in the media.  They can also deny privileged information to journalists who do not adopt the expected storylines, as happened during the housing bubble in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>As will be seen, during the bubble journalists relied on numerous experts from the real estate and financial sectors for their stories.  The media analysis that follows depends to some extent on whether the bubble could have been identified before it burst and whether the size of the crash could have been reasonably estimated beforehand.  The answer is &quot;Yes&quot; on both counts, although the precision of the analysis is obviously greater in hindsight.<br\/><br\/>There are two main measures to determine whether property prices are in bubble territory: the price-to-earnings ratio and the price-to-income ratio.  <i>The Economist<\/i>magazine used those indicators to warn about property bubbles around the world early on.  In 2002, it stated that the Irish housing market had been &quot;displaying bubble-like symptoms in recent years&quot;, and, in 2003, it calculated that Ireland's property market was overvalued by 42% relative to the average of the previous three decades.  In Ireland, the economists David McWilliams and Morgan Kelly identified the problem and warned about it early on.<br\/><br\/>However, overwhelmingly, the Irish analysts and institutions, including the media, maintained that there was no bubble and that the boom would eventually end in a soft landing.  Indeed, there is a clear discrepancy between coverage of the housing bubble before and after it burst.  Before 2008, the media tended to largely ignore it, and it was only months after it started deflating that reality had to be faced.  Once the housing market collapsed, the media simply could not ignore its downwards trajectory, hence the increased coverage.  I have included two figures showing the number of articles on the housing bubble that appeared in newspapers by year.  On average, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>had 5.5 times more articles on the bubble per year in 2008&ndash;11 than in 1996&ndash;2007.  Similarly, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>and the <i>Sunday Independent <\/i>had on average 12.5 times more such articles in 2008&ndash;11 than in 1999&ndash;2007.  Moreover, the few articles published during the earlier period often denied that there was a bubble.  For example, there were articles in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>entitled &quot;Study refutes any house price 'bubble' &quot; and &quot;House prices 'set for soft landing',&quot; while the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>and <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>had headlines such as &quot;NCB [Stockbrokers] rejects house value threat from burst bubble,&quot; &quot;House prices not about to fall soon, insist auctioneers,&quot; &quot;Price of houses 'not over-valued' says new report,&quot; and &quot;There is no property bubble to burst, despite doomsayers.&quot;  In particular, between 2000 and 2007, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>published more than 40,000 articles about the economy, but only 78 of these were about the property bubble, or 0.2%.  This is small coverage for what was the most important economic story in those years.<br\/><br\/>The residential and commercial property sections and supplements presented articles and glossy pictures encouraging readers to buy as opposed to renting.  Stories described various properties on sale and were virtually indistinguishable from advertisements.  One entitled &quot;There&rsquo;s a billion reasons to buy&quot; introduced new luxury apartments by noting that they &quot;feature quality designer kitchens with integrated AEG appliances [whatever that is] and stone worktops; top notch bathrooms with ceramic tiles, heated towel rails and chrome fittings&quot;.  Potential buyers should waste no time, though, as &quot;numbers are strictly limited &ndash; you&rsquo;d want to stake it fast&quot;.  Articles celebrated Ireland&rsquo;s newly found pride in entrepreneurialism at home and abroad.  One profiled the &quot;ever-bullish Irish property buyer ... looking for the hot new property market&quot;, wherever it is in the world.  Another article stated: &quot;[I]n Victorian times, it was fashionable for the British to suggest that 'the sun never sets on our Empire'.  Now the sun never sets on Ireland&rsquo;s burgeoning property empire&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The media relied on so-called experts from the financial or real estate industry to describe the market, which thus received almost invariably upbeat analysis.  For example, as late as November 2007, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>conducted a survey among &quot;property experts&quot; to predict how the market would evolve in 2008.  The six experts selected all held high-level positions with property firms.  Not surprisingly, their forecast was enthusiastic.  A number of journalists simply acted as cheerleaders for the property sector.  Many even persisted in rejecting the view that the market had been in a bubble months after it started collapsing.  For example, in April 2008, the <i>Sunday Independent <\/i>conveyed the thoughts of a real estate agent who believed that &quot;[T]he time to buy is now.  There is certainly great value in the market at the minute but it doesn&rsquo;t mean people can dilly dally.&quot;  Another journalist wrote a book entitled <i>The Best is Yet to Come<\/i>in 2007 and claimed that &quot;Far from collapsing, our economy and property prices will do more than hold up.&quot;All that was required to protect Ireland against a crisis was not to talk about it, because &quot;unless we talk ourselves into one, an economic storm is not going to happen.&quot;<\/p><p>Television followed the same pattern as the print press.  During the boom, RTE sustained a national obsession with houses by presenting programmes such as &quot;House Hunters in the Sun&quot;, &quot;Showhouse&quot;, &quot;About the House&quot; and &quot;I'm an Adult, Get Me Out of Here&quot;.  Leading current affairs programmes such as &quot;Prime Time&quot; also sustained a housing bubble.  Between 2000 and 2007, 717 shows were aired, of which only ten, approximately 1%, contained a segment concerned with the housing boom.  These shows presented a total of 26 guests or interviewees of whom 11 came from the property or financial sectors, four were politicians from the main political parties, four were journalists, academics or researchers, and three were economic consultants.  With respect to their views on the housing boom, only two interviewees said clearly that there was a bubble and that it would burst while the other 24 remained vague, argued explicitly that the housing market was and would remain strong in the years to come, or stated that a soft landing was to be expected if the boom decelerated at some point.<br\/><br\/>After the crisis, as the property market recovers, especially in Dublin, media coverage has essentially not changed.  By this, I do not mean its content is the same as during the pre-crash years.  The situation is different and we are not faced with a massive national bubble in the market.  Rather, I mean that the media coverage points roughly in the same direction as before 2008.  In general, it is the interests of elites that are mostly reflected in editorials and news stories, while those of ordinary people are often left out.  This is not unexpected, given that the political and economic nature of the media industry outlined above is intact.  News organisations are still corporate or Government-owned entities, advertising still plays a role in generating revenues and journalists still source their stories overwhelmingly from establishment institutions and individuals.  One can find a few articles of a more careful or sceptical nature relative to the ongoing real estate boom in Dublin.  I surmise that the pre-crisis bubble and its negative consequences are still felt strongly, and this may lead to more balanced coverage, although in relative terms this is a minor trend and, overall, a significant amount of critical commentary is not appearing in the media.  The election of a few Deputies with progressive politics has also resulted in more critical coverage when their views are reported.<br\/><br\/>The fact that media coverage still reflects elite interests may be appreciated by considering analysis and commentary on the following key issues in the housing market.  Approximately 90,000 people are on the waiting list for social housing, and there has been a rise in homelessness.  Austerity has reduced State investment in social housing as capital expenditure for social housing was cut by 80% between 2008 and 2013.  Approximately 118,000 mortgage accounts, 15%, remain in arrears and a number of repossession procedures are ongoing.  So-called vulture funds involving mostly foreign investors are buying up large chunks of the property market.  The Government has facilitated this by encouraging the establishment of real estate investment trusts, REITs, via generous tax breaks.  REITs buy, among other things, property portfolios from NAMA.  Vulture funds raise rents to maximise their incomes before they leave the market, after approximately three years, or whenever their real estate assets have increased enough in value in order that they can sell them back to Irish people at a higher price.  NAMA promotes a vision of property as a commodity, not as a social good, given that it needs rental growth and seeks to maximise commercial returns.<br\/><br\/>Media coverage of such issues has reflected elites' views and interests.  Coverage has not been extensive and has not foregrounded analysis and opinion that would reflect ordinary people's interests.  Relatively little attention has been paid to progressive strategies to address the problems, such as significant public spending on a social housing building programme, NAMA playing a role more directed towards providing housing as a social good, rent controls, making unfinished estates safe and attractive places to live, converting vacant properties into rental units, mortgage debt write-downs and dealing with the issue of homelessness through a redistribution of wealth and power in society.  The problem is not that nobody has presented alternatives.  The union, SIPTU, has made the case for establishing a social housing REIT.  The youth advocacy group, We're Not Leaving, produced a report on problems faced by renters, including deposit retention and low standards of quality in rented accommodation.  The Nevin Economic Research Institute has argued for establishing and financing an affordable housing strategy.  However, such organisations have not been included in the media to any significant extent.  Instead, we often hear the views of developers, bankers and real estate agents and companies that call on the Government to ease the cost burden of construction in order that more houses can be built by the private sector to allow the market allegedly to solve the problems.  We also still see stories of buyers telling how they are being outbid when they attempt to buy property.<br\/><br\/>After the crash, the media also presented the Government's crisis resolution policies in a largely favourable manner, again in line with the views of Irish and global elites.  The media enthusiastically endorsed a blanket guarantee and declared it the cheapest bailout in the world.  NAMA was called &quot;bold and imaginative&quot; and the &quot;holy grail&quot;, while <i>The Irish Times<\/i>claimed it was our &quot;best bet&quot;.  However, there were progressive alternatives.  Strong conditions could have been attached to the nationalisation of banks such as firing their top management, cutting the salaries of top officials, requiring that investment decisions be made with socially useful purposes and establishing strict regulations on banks' operations.  A good bank could have been established, as explained in detail by the economist Willem Buiter in the pages of the<i>Financial Times<\/i>.  After some hesitation, the media endorsed the EU-IMF bailout in late 2010.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>argued that:<blockquote>On one level, intervention by the EU and the IMF is no bad thing.  It means that rational decisions on how we can live within our means will now be forced down the throats of the competing interests who have stymied any genuine national response to the crisis.<\/blockquote>The accumulation of sovereign debt in Ireland and Europe gave rise to the possibility of default and restructuring.  However, the media described a potential default as a &quot;cataclysm&quot;,<i><\/i>an &quot;evil day&quot;, an &quot;unmitigated disaster&quot;, &quot;hugely damaging&quot;, a &quot;doomsday scenario&quot; and likely leading to intolerable contagion effects throughout the eurozone.  However, scholarship on sovereign debt restructuring reveals that countries that decide to cancel the repayment of their debts typically suffer only short-term economic costs and that long-term negative consequences are not significant so that, overall, defaulting often yields positive outcomes, for example, in Argentina and Greece.<br\/><br\/>The media has also strongly endorsed austerity since 2008.  At the outset of the crisis, the media called explicitly for a campaign to educate the public about the need for austerity.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>editors complained that members of the public still did not appreciate the possible extent of the economic downturn and the editors asserted that the Government would have &quot;a major job to do in educating public opinion about unpalatable economic realities and the need for civic discipline&quot;.  A study I conducted of more than 900 opinion articles and editorials in the five main newspapers between 2008 and 2013 found the following revealing statistic: only 11% of pieces opposed austerity while 58% supported it and the remainder were neutral.  The articles' authorship was also significant.  More than 200 of the pieces were written by outside writers, not journalists.  Of these, 29% were mainstream economists, 28% worked in the financial or corporate sectors and 20% were political officials in the three main political parties in power during the crisis, including only four from the Labour Party with the bulk from the two dominant right-wing parties.  The overwhelming majority of writers, 77%, came from elite political or economic institutions.  The remainder of authors comprised academics, members of progressive organisations and only 3% were trade union officials.  Thus, a conservative cast of writers expressed their views and interests in the media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Julien Mercille","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Mercille for coming here.

That leads to a series of consequences for their reporting.  There are many reasons for that but I shall deal with ownership first.  It is owned by large corporations so they have specific interests.  We do not have any problem recognising that.  A trade union paper reflects trade union viewpoints because they are owned by the trade unions.

The coverage cannot be analysed in the same way we did before.  There is a spike in Dublin prices but it is not a national issue like before.  The media, in general, is the same, as the structure has not changed.  There is still advertising and it still corporate and government-owned.  There are more articles of a careful nature.  When one sees a boom in Dublin, a journalist does not necessarily jump on it as much as before because of the crash.  Perhaps they are a bit more careful.  I have not looked at it in any systematic way.<br\/><br\/>After the crash, the other issues became more prominent, such as austerity.  When I or others say the media is in favour of government views, it is not something pulled out of nowhere.  The media is very proud about that and says so explicitly.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>indicated in 2008, right at the start, that it needed to educate the public about the virtues of austerity.  There is no secret there and it was very successful in that task.  The media performs extremely well in Ireland if it is judged from that standpoint.  It has been very successful in telling people that austerity is the right way to go.  There are crisis resolution points.<br\/><br\/>One can see reporting about vulture funds and other topics but not to the extent one would see if ordinary people's interests were considered to a greater extent.

It is a good question.  Again, it is impossible to give a clear or precise answer.  I would say that in the case of the housing bubble, people just chose not to talk about it.  The \"Prime Time\" report is a good example.  Not many of the shows that were about the bubble denied that it was happening.  It is just that there were very few shows about it.  The graph I have presented to the committee contains two figures that show the same thing.  I think I have mentioned that a few articles about the bubble appeared before 2008.  The articles in question were not necessarily critical of what was going on or warning about it.  Many of them said \"you may have heard there is a bubble out there, but it is not true - we talked to experts and rest assured it is fine\".  This does not even mean they were talking about it.  In most cases, I would say it is a question of denial.  The same point applies to a lot of things.  When was the last time it was on the front page that the US military has been using Shannon Airport for many years?  It is not as if the media is saying \"no, the US is not there\"; it is just that we do not talk about it.  The same point can be made about deprivation or about the health care system.  We are never told that a great deal of money could be saved by having a public health care system.  Much of it is just not addressed.  When it is, the views of elites are usually taken as a driver.  Again, this does not mean it is wrong or right - it just means this is the viewpoint that is being heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#G01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Julien Mercille"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>In Dr. Mercille's experience and research, would he have spoken to people who offered evidence of journalists being subjected to strong or small interference from corporate types who were saying \"that is not a great way to be going\" or \"actually, we do not want to use that story\"?

The job was done for that, so I did not talk to as many people.  I will give another good example that is more about the passiveness.  A senior RTE journalist who was trying to show me that it was not the media's fault, and that it was the fault of the economists or whoever else, once told me how he works.  He said that when looks at his mobile after he comes back from lunch, he might have received 12 press releases from the banking sector.  He said he just copies them down as his article and that is it.  He argued that this shows he is not guilty, but is merely reporting the views of the banks.  That is a very good example of passive reporting.  It is actually a robot view of a media environment in which journalists do not even think, but just copy what they get on their mobiles.  At one level, one could put the blame on journalists and others and suggest that they should think a bit.  However, it is very rational for media organisations to behave in this way because it saves them a lot of money.  As such organisations operate in a profit-driven system, they might go bankrupt if they do not act in this manner.  There are rational reasons behind their behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#G01800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Julien Mercille"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Mercille.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#G01900","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>The next questioner is Senator Michael D'Arcy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#G02000","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Mercille.

Indeed, Dr. Mercille would have been a major source for this statement were it not that the committee had already heard from him for two hours already.<\/p><p>I will endeavour to mention other researchers whose work I am drawing upon, but I should also note that a fully referenced version of the statement has been furnished to the committee, with a works cited list, and I will also be making a link to that public on social media later today.<br\/><br\/>Print and broadcast media in Ireland played a difficult-to-measure but almost certainly significant role in the inflation of the property bubble and the legitimisation of risky behaviour by the financial services sector in the lead up to the crisis of 2007 and 2008.  It did so partly by ignoring or marginalising scepticism about these phenomena.  I will focus in my statement on the newspaper industry and I will argue that this socially destructive role should be understood not necessarily as a failing of Irish newspapers but, to some extent, as a feature, one that flows predictably from commercial media's structural relationship with the corporate forces that benefitted from the bubble.  While this relationship is of very long standing and continues to some extent to this day, I will further argue there were certain aspects of the development of newspapers in the 1990s and early 2000s, which were particularly acute here in Ireland but also experienced elsewhere in the world, that made them especially vulnerable to domination by those forces and weakened the capacity of journalists to play the critical, adversarial and investigative role that most of them do undoubtedly value.  Within journalism and in research about journalists, that value is often referred to under the rubric of &quot;professionalism,&quot; a term that encompasses a set of principles and performances that supposedly drive journalists to seek the truth impartially and to question the powerful doggedly.  The values are captured in such largely symbolic documents as the National Union of Journalists Code of Conduct and the code of practice of the Press Council of Ireland.  I will not endeavour to romanticise the journalism of an earlier age, which had plenty of its own problems, many of them involving the limits and shortcomings of professionalism itself.  However, over the last 30 years or so, those principles have been widely understood to be increasingly at risk all over the world, with particular features of the media landscape endangering them.  Daniel C. Hallin, a leading American scholar of journalism, has written, &quot;For the most part I don't think journalistic professionalism is breaking down from the inside, by journalists becoming less committed to it; instead [Hallin continues] I think professionalism is being squeezed into increasingly smaller niches within the media field.&quot;<br\/><br\/>It is my contention that in Irish newspapers we can literally see that squeeze occur over the period between about 1990 and 2007, as the physical construction of newspapers changed.  There was an inscription of an unquestioning pro-business ideology, in practice, onto increasingly large advertising-heavy portions of the newspaper - indeed, sections that owed their existence precisely to advertising, including the ever-growing business finance, property, and lifestyle sections, dedicated to the advertising of, respectively, recruitment, real estate, and consumer goods and services.  Even the most scrupulous of newspaper editors, I contend, came to see those sections as a realm of, at best, what one might call &quot;professionalism lite&quot; where soft treatment of the rich and powerful was expected.  Even if one worked in the niches where full-blown professionalism still held sway - the journalists who filled news pages and provided political coverage, for example - it was hard to miss the message that was embedded in that big colourful product about your employer's relationship with financial institutions, property interests and other corporate bodies.  Those supplements were, after all, paying the bills.  When The Irish Times Limited infamously paid &euro;40 million for <i>myhome.ie<\/i>in 2006, it appeared to confirm the company's dedication to what increasingly looked like its core business - the advertising of property sales.<br\/><br\/>There is a piece of research that has already been cited today in which a group of Irish financial journalists, speaking on condition of anonymity to a team of academic researchers who published their findings in 2010, discussed this relationship.  One of them said, in that research by Fahy, O'Brien and Poti:<blockquote>Much of the mainstream media seems to me to be very conflicted because of their reliance on real-estate and recruitment advertising.  That doesn't mean reporters consciously avoid writing bad news stories, but it's hard to run against the tide when everyone is getting rich.<\/blockquote>Another stated explicitly that journalists &quot;were leaned on by their organisations not to talk down the banks [and the] property market because those organisations have a heavy reliance on property advertising&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In 2006 I interviewed dozens of journalists about <i>The Irish Times<\/i>at that time.  One of them, who was retired from that newspaper, said:<blockquote>In the mid-1980s ... we had a series investigating the truth behind buying and selling property.  Can you imagine that now?<\/blockquote>That was in 2006.  Now, the idea that certain parts of the Irish newspaper industry were professionally compromised territory was already in the air as early as the 1980s.  The former business editor from Independent Newspapers, cited in that same research that we have discussed, and to whom one of the Deputies has already referred, recalled a lunch from that period where journalists and stockbrokers gathered to mark the appointment of a new president to the Irish Stock Exchange.  The journalist recalled the event to a researcher many years later.  He stated:  <blockquote>The lunch went well and all the proprieties were observed, until, during the port, the topic of mutual dependence came up in the conversation.  &quot;What do you mean mutual?&quot; a rubicund and slightly tipsy broker ventured.  &quot;The business pages are ours.  We own them.&quot; <\/blockquote>The editor continued his recollection:<blockquote>Trudging back to the office, however, I admit an icy feeling was coursing through my veins.  Maybe, the chap with the English public school accent was right.  He was implying that we [journalists] were lazy, dependent and largely uncritical.  More chillingly still, maybe our employers (who shared the same gentlemen's clubs with the brokers) were happy with such an arrangement. <\/blockquote>That was in the 1980s.  By the time of the Celtic tiger, this compromised turf of business and financial journalism had expanded many times over, both in the volume of pages produced and in the number of journalists employed.  In that research cited earlier, the author summarised the views of several of the Irish financial journalists whom they interviewed, and this is an extensive quote from that research:<blockquote>According to journalist F, because of the need for regular contact with financial sources, &quot;some journalists are reluctant to be critical of companies because they fear they will not get information or access in the future&quot;.  Journalist E ... believed that some journalists had become &quot;far too close to their sources&quot;: They viewed them as friends and allies and essentially became advocates for them.  Their approach was justified editorially because many developers and bankers limited access to such an extent that it became seen to be better to write soft stories about them than to lose access.  Extremely soft stories would also be run to gain access too ... Journalist B criticised daily financial journalism for being &quot;almost entirely press release and stock exchange disclosure based[.]&quot; ...<\/blockquote>The report continues: &quot;... Journalist F noted [that] it was &quot;well known that some PR companies try to bully journalists by cutting off access or excluding journalists from briefings&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The sort of ambivalence that this engenders about telling good tough stories while maintaining source relationships is not unique to financial or property journalism; it is present throughout journalism.  However, as the role and prominence of those sorts of journalism increased in the 1990s and early 2000s, their particular compromises of professionalism played a proportionately bigger role in newspaper coverage of these important areas of the economy and society.  Their growth was not inevitable, nor was it unique to Ireland.  It was part of an international development in the newspaper industry that sought to diversify papers' content and appearance to make them more attractive to advertisers and, to a lesser extent, to readers.  In the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s this came to be known as &quot;total newspapering&quot;, with a de-emphasis on news and - this is the &quot;total&quot; part - an effort to break down the traditional barriers between editorial and commercial considerations.  A study of this phenomenon, also known as &quot;market-led journalism,&quot; in the 1990s carried the cautionary title, &quot;When MBAs rule the newsroom.&quot;  This was already worrying journalists cited in British research during this decade:<blockquote>Among journalists there are fears that the delicate balance between the self-interest of capitalist media owners and the &quot;public interest&quot; motives of journalism has been upset ...  Some journalists have come to believe that the news is being stolen from them.  <\/blockquote>This market orientation does not express itself merely in the growth of financial and property journalism but in the explosion of entertainment, lifestyle and consumer-oriented sections and stories.  As one scholar summarises it - again, I quote this from Hanitzsch:<blockquote>When market orientation is high, journalism gives emphasis to what the audiences want to know at the expense of what they should know ...  Audiences are not addressed in their role as citizens concerned with the social and political issues of the day but in their role as clients and consumers...<\/blockquote>These developments in newspapers did not happen by accident or in isolation.  They were a vital cultural component of the larger global development of politics and economics over the last several decades that we have come to call neoliberalism.  The great historian and student of that phenomenon David Harvey writes: &quot;Neoliberalization required both politically and economically the construction of a neoliberal market-based populist culture of differentiated consumerism and individual libertarianism.&quot;<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that I do not believe we should blame most journalists either individually or collectively for this situation.  Nor have journalists been its obvious beneficiaries.  Even in Ireland, where the booming economy helped newspaper circulation and profitability to remain healthy past 2000, a journalistic culture of increased workloads, casualisation, rapidly changing technological expectations and declining real rates of pay was in place throughout the industry even before the wider bust of 2007-08.  When I did that series of interviews with newspaper journalists in 2006, many of them told me that their capacity to engage in critical scrutiny of Government and business was overwhelmed by the day-to-day pressures of filling ever more space in print and online.<\/p><p>The job of careful consideration and analysis of events was largely left to a small coterie of editors and senior political writers who were generally believed to have risen to those posts through a combination of caution and conservatism.  As research outside Ireland has also suggested, journalists who continued to feel that they should be doing hard-hitting, critical scrutiny of powerful institutions felt disempowered from doing so.  It is not surprising that a reputable transnational &quot;scorecard&quot; of journalism's coverage of the financial crisis found that in Ireland, most stories were episodic and short of analysis.  These conditions have, if anything, deteriorated further in the intervening years of collapsing circulation and desperate digitisation.  <br\/><br\/>Such conditions also provide the context for the increasing power of the public relations industry.  As noted above, the capacity of PR officers to give and withhold the information that hard-pressed journalists require in order to do their work gives them an inevitable influence over content to the benefit of their State and corporate clients.  An even more insidious form of PR influence comes in the form of &quot;flak&quot;, which is the negative attention and pressure that comes upon journalists when they attempt to report on sensitive stories.  In theory, flak can come from any side of a story.  In practice, most of it comes from the sides that can afford to generate it at a volume and with a social standing that catches the ear of editors.  <br\/><br\/>For reasons of space, and because it was not a specific part of the brief, I have not greatly addressed the question of media ownership in this statement, although I am happy to do so hereafter.  The enormously high concentration of media ownership in this State is, of course, a major danger and fundamental public concern.  However, ownership of media cannot tell the whole story about it.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>is owned by a trust but has not been immune to the commercial pressures discussed here.  RTE, which is genuinely dominant media outlet in this State, is owned by the people of Ireland but its role in broadcasting non-news and current affairs based &quot;property porn&quot; in the Celtic tiger years certainly bears scrutiny.  It is worth saying that both RTE and newspapers did break many scandals although they were less likely to raise systematic questions about the state of the economy and the housing market.<br\/><br\/>The committee has asked me to address potential conflicts of interests among media organisations.  Based on much of what I have said here, it is tempting to conclude that there was no real conflict of interest at all but rather a congruence of interests between media organisations and the developers and financiers who were advertising with them cashing in handsomely on a speculative bubble.  While there would be some truth in such a conclusion, it would also be excessively simplistic because journalists and the organisations that employ them do also have an interest in producing strong stories that challenge conventional thinking, afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted.  Indeed, nothing in what I have said here should be interpreted to mean that they do not sometimes do precisely that.  The purpose of this analysis is not moral condemnation but to understand why, in the specific context of Celtic tiger Ireland and also beyond that context, the structural congruence might have been stronger and more influential than the sense of ethical conflict.  While much of the professional practice of journalism is conducted with an acute awareness of &quot;how it should be done&quot;, nonetheless, a host of other influences determine the shape and content of the journalistic product leading to biases in favour of, for example, &quot;talking up&quot; the economy and the market, home ownership, property investment and the soft landing.  How this happens is complex and contingent located where newspapers find themselves - at an intersection of daily events, longer term history, commerce, design, technology, routine, process, pressure and, not least, economic and political power.  This intersection is traversed by the workers in a newspaper on a daily basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I have a few questions.

In the absence of other clear professional markers, a code of conduct - an idea that journalists are truth seekers who try to be impartial and who challenge powerful institutions - defines journalism, at least as far as many journalists are concerned.  In another sense, it could be argued that some of that is also window dressing - a kind of high language that masks the chaotic reality of producing programmes and publications on a daily basis.  In other words, it could be argued that it is a myth or a series of myths that does not necessarily have a lot to do with the day-to-day publishing of a website or magazine.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman suggests, they are in some sense codified.  The National Union of Journalists code of conduct is guidance for its members.  The code of practice of the Press Council of Ireland has somewhat more weight.  It is a voluntary code publications are encouraged to sign up and give their commitment to and encompasses fairness, balance, respect of the rights of the people about whom they write and accuracy.  The Office of the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council were set up primarily by the newspaper industry in some ways to fend off more statutory regulation that was threatened to some extent by these Houses.  They are essentially voluntary codes, although there is some statutory backup for the Press Council.  In effect, this is an element of protection for communications with the Press Council.  They have fairly weak enforcement methods.  Publications are not obliged to sign up to them.  In order to take a complaint to the Office of the Press Ombudsman, people need a certain standing in respect of the story.  They cannot simply complain that a story is inaccurate.  They must complain that it is inaccurate and that its inaccuracy affects them.  Property editorial and journalism that is hard to distinguish from advertising, which were discussed this morning, do not really come up in respect of the Office of the Press Council.  <\/p> <p>  Broadcasting is a very different story.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has real and significant powers in terms of the regulation of RTE and the private broadcasting sector and has a code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs which it is often quite aggressive in enforcing.  Broadcasters are generally quite knowledgeable about the requirements they have under that code.  The code relating to the press is a far less powerful instrument.  <\/p> <p>  My interest is less in these assertions than in structural facts.  Just as light-touch regulation in the economy was not a mistake but was built into the system of breaks and incentives that were established here to attract and reward capital, light-touch journalism to some extent was a predictable feature of the changing face of the industry since the 1980s.  It does not require a conspiracy to undermine the standards codified in some of those documents we have talked about - just a set of institutional changes that made those standards less significant in many areas of journalistic work.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Browne for coming before the committee.

I believe it is fair to say that the majority of journalists working in the property area would not be engaged in anything remotely resembling corrupt practices.

There is not really any need for the showering of gifts, there is a shared interest in property journalism as traditionally understood in the property supplements.  There is a shared interest in the promotion of property sales.  I believe that in some respects, property journalism sometimes gets bashed a little too hard in these discussions.  It is a genre in itself and in some ways can feature some of the most beautiful writing in journalism.  Most readers understand what property journalism is and can see it for what it is.<\/p> <p>  My concern about property supplements is not so much the journalism that was in them, or the relationships that existed between individual journalists and the interests represented there, but the insidious effect their very existence had on larger aspects of newspapers.  For example, it is one thing to have property supplements saying that one should buy a beautiful home in Ballsbridge, but it is another thing to have the business advice column treating homes and houses as just another asset class that people are invited to invest in.

I believe that journalistic professionalism in its purest version would call journalists not only to say, well, what does the Government say or what does the leading expert in the leading Irish university department have to say on this topic.  I would say that real journalism means that one goes and finds the dissident.  One goes and finds the voices of those who are critical of the status quo.<br\/><br\/>The idea of journalism as a challenge to power can only happen if one is seeking out the expertise to challenge that power, and if one is seeking out the voices.  Dr. Mercille has covered some of this ground.  One had <i>The Economist<\/i>not <i>Red Pepper<\/i>saying in 2002 that the Irish economy was clearly overheating and that there was a bubble in property here.  One had, by and large, Irish journalists working in the area choosing not to make that the main topic of conversation on television programmes and in newspaper articles for as long as that bubble was to continue.

We did not have large property developers who owned newspapers.  Anglo Irish Bank, to name one randomly selected institution, was not a major shareholder in any of those companies, which is not to contradict the point I made earlier about the basic structural relationship that arises from the advertising that that sector brought to bear in property and also in recruitment.

The PRs do not hold all the power.<br\/><br\/>There is a very good book about the recent history of American journalism by John Nichols and Robert McChesney called <i>The Death and Life of American Journalism<\/i>, I think, and it has a chart in the back that traces the employment in the PR industry and the employment in journalism from about 1980 to 2008.  In 1980 the two bars are roughly equivalent.  There are just about the same number of PRs working in America as there are journalists.  As one moves through the 1980s and 1990s the PR bar keeps growing, the journalism bar wobbles and starts to shrink and by 2008 there are about three or four times as many PRs as journalists in the United States.  That indicates to me a kind of a change in the ecology of this entire relationship and one in which the capacity of journalists to scrutinise the kind of information that is coming from this vast apparatus of public relations is weakened and the capacity of the PRs to kind of push information on journalists who have more and more that they have to try to deal with, contend with, and publish is strengthened.  So although the Deputy is right in suggesting that the power clearly can work both ways and journalists do have what one might call currency in the transaction, they nonetheless find themselves, I think, increasingly on the less pleasant end of that transaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#W00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Is there not an overlap, or a huge overlap, anecdotally at least, between the PR-type role and the media-type role-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#W00900","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>You are running out of time.

PR is referred to as the enemy and there is talk of going to the dark side when journalists cross over to PR.  It is one of the few acceptable ways within journalism for us to actually say we have this ethics element, we are not PR, we wear this badge called journalism which scrutinises information critically and just does not cut and paste it.  Otherwise, journalists would sound self-righteous but at least we have PR to compare ourselves to.  There is this very closely related industry that is somehow ethically different that we use as a way of flying our own flag.<\/p> <p>  The fact is that the access that PRs can control is very important to journalists.  If one does not have that access and one&rsquo;s rival in another publication does, then one&rsquo;s editor will ask if one offended the PR.

No, it did not.  This goes to the question of how it is that journalists measure what is a valid view to seek out and report.  There has been some discussion here about the extent to which the economics profession called it or did not.  I know economists who still argue about this quite a lot.  I think I said earlier in response to Senator O'Keeffe that there is a duty to go beyond reflecting the views that are extant among the elite voices in society.  I grew up in a liberation theology household in the US.  My father, who had been a priest in New York, was always quoting the Conference of Latin American Bishops of 1968 which said that the Catholic Church should have a preferential option for the poor.  In some respects, journalism should have a preferential option for the poor and in this case, for the marginalised and dissent.  It should be looking for the voice that is challenging the elite perspectives.  It should be seeking not just the educated views of economists, but the direct experience of people.  Again, that is a romantic view of what journalism should be that is distinct from the interests of the institutions that largely sustain journalism.  It is also one that should at least in part be a guide.  In retrospect, it would have meant that Irish newspapers could be holding their heads up a little higher than they are able to do here this afternoon and tomorrow about how well they covered the underlying structural problems in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Were contrarian voices knocking on the doors of the newspapers looking for space and coverage to articulate their views?

I go back to my point that newspapers should be actively seeking contrarian views but I think that the people who could have offered those views probably could have done better.  People sometimes point to the ESRI reviews and say that if one reads them very carefully, one can see that they were calling the bubble.  We should not have had to read them very carefully.

Fundamentally the business of newspapers is selling readers to advertisers and, to a smaller extent, selling newspapers to readers.  In the memoir of a former editor of a national newspaper, he referred to research done in his newspaper and that two thirds of the advertising revenue was property and recruitment which were roughly equally spread.  Recruitment is not to be overlooked and was a source of a vast area of relationships with the financial industry, in the same way that the property sections reflected relationships with estate agents.  The recruitment sections, to a great extent, represented relationships with finance as well as with other industries.<br\/><br\/>For example, in 2001 there was a huge downturn in advertising revenue in newspapers, in particular <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, which was based fundamentally on a fall in recruitment rather than problems in the property market.  If one breaks it down, two thirds plus of revenue in newspapers comes from advertising.  Of that, two thirds comes from recruitment and property together.  One gets a broad picture of the situation.  If one looks at the steady rise of that through the boom and then the collapse since, one gets another sense of how important it has been to newspapers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#Z01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Mr. Browne is very welcome.

What the interviewee suggested - he was not off the record but I will refrain from mentioning his name - that the balance of forces within the newspaper was such that in the mid-1980s when he edited a critical series on property, the commercial side of the house could come in and say, &quot;Don't do that.  Why are you doing that?&quot;, and the editor would say: &quot;This is our area.&quot;  That hard wall is widely seen as having been, to a certain extent, breached in both directions.<br\/><br\/>One of Mr. Gageby's successors writes in his own memoirs that he sometimes regrets that he did not take more of an active role in the management side of the company, as opposed to just the editorial management of the newspaper.  I mentioned the <i>Los Angeles Times<\/i>earlier.  When a new publisher came in there in the 1990s, he said he was going to take a bazooka to blow away the wall between commercial and editorial considerations.  That was a more dramatic view of a kind of an idea that was widespread within the newspaper business at the time that said the editorial side has to think business, the business side has to think editorial and we are all in this together.<br\/><br\/>It was possible for a time in many national newspapers here for senior journalists to do an MBA and get funding from the newspaper to do it.  In some respects, for people outside journalism that might seem perfectly normal.  One is a manager within a company and one's company wants one to get a better qualification in management.  From the point of view of a journalist, it is more problematic because an MBA is training in a certain kind of ideology as well as being a training in the capacity to manage.  That breach was much more widespread by the 1990s and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#Z01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Mr. Browne also states that in 2006 many of the journalists told him that their capacity to engage in critical scrutiny of Government and business was overwhelmed by the day-to-day pressures of filling ever more space in print and online.

So not only can we talk about licence fees to public broadcasters, we can talk about, as already exists in Ireland, lower tax rates for newspapers - VAT on papers is low here for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#BB00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I am going to run out of time.

I support those kinds of things, but on the idea that one would ban this or restrict that, I think I would prefer to see a situation where we are using carrots rather than sticks, where one incentivises non-profit news production, for example, with various kinds of breaks and various kinds of subsidies.

I will deal with the issues I have been asked to address, with specific reference to the Irish Examiner and our editorial policy on the economy and the property boom from 2002 to 2007, as referred to in the invitation from the committee.<br\/><br\/>I would first like to give a brief introduction to the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>.  It is a broad-based mid-market newspaper, publishing six days a week, with an increasingly active online presence across many platforms.  I have been editor since 2001.  While we have a respected national profile, our circulation is significant in Cork and Munster, where we have the largest readership of any daily newspaper.  My role as editor is to lead a great team who make it happen every day.<br\/><br\/>A trusted newspaper must inform honestly and accurately.  It must ask questions and challenge where questions need to be asked and answers found.  It must present a broad range of diverse opinion and it must know and engage with its readers.  If it does all of these things successfully, it generates enough income to pay the wages of its employees, contributors, contractors, suppliers and shareholders.  That income is derived almost exclusively from two revenue streams: the cover price of the newspaper, and advertising.<br\/><br\/>I turn now to the specific area the committee asked me to consider, our editorial policy on the economy and the property boom and the approach to reporting on the property market and the Irish economy.  As far as the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>is concerned, during the period in question we approached reporting on the economy and the property market in the same way that we approach reporting across the broad spectrum of the newspaper.  We endeavoured to ensure our reporting was accurate and reflected the facts.  The newspaper reflected all shades of opinion during these years, including prominent warnings going back to 1999 and throughout the Celtic tiger era that the property boom could not last forever.<\/p><p>What our coverage did at the time was reflect the preoccupation with property in a country experiencing an unprecedented boom.  We reported what was happening and what authoritative institutions such as the Central Bank, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development stated about what was happening.<br\/><br\/>No newspaper lives apart from its readers, and their preoccupation with and enjoyment of the financial benefits of that era were reflected in our columns.  Nobody who lived through that period, proclaimed throughout the world by our political leaders as an economic miracle, was immune from the spirit of the time.  It was the prevailing narrative of the political, banking and property establishment.  At the time, we had little or no reason to believe that key figures in our financial regulatory infrastructure were not functioning as they should have been in the best interest of the State and its citizens, and nor was there a level of transparency around the regulatory process for the banking system that would have allowed us to access information that subsequently emerged after the crash, too late, when the damage was done.  Believe me when I say that had I or any of my colleagues in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>been able to access that critical information about the real state of our financial institutions and their methods of operation in those years and months leading up to the bank guarantee, I would have published it.  It would not have been enough to have been privy to that inside information; I would have had to be able to prove it in a court of a law.  Publishing what one knows to be true does not mean one cannot be successfully sued for libel.  That is a point worth remembering when people question why the media does not publish what the dogs in the street might know.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the property market specifically, aside from reporting property news and commentary in the main newspaper, we introduced a weekend section with a property element in the mid-1980s.  This was a period of deep recession in Ireland and a world away from the property boom, but property editorial was of interest and was important to our readers, just as it is today.  That weekend section also included the usual mix of features, including television highlights and generally softer-focus content suitable for relaxed reading at the weekend.  In the mid-1990s, due to the increasing popularity of the sector and as the economy improved, the property element became a standalone publication, focusing on residential homes, which continues to this day.  In 2001 we introduced a commercial property section for Thursdays.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of the weekend property magazine is to provide readers with factual information on property for sale throughout the country, but primarily in the Munster region.  In essence, it is a mix of properties for sale, with a brief factual description, in addition to larger spreads for more distinctive and striking properties for sale that we think may be of interest to readers.  It also has sections on interior design, home improvements, gardening, antiques, etc.  It has been an important forum for informing readers of the types and costs of properties available for sale, along with additional advertising from furniture and home interior companies, DIY and gardening businesses, etc.<br\/><br\/>Advertising in the property section was an important and valued source of revenue during the Celtic tiger years - as it was before and still is - but it is important to stress that advertisers did not seek to influence the editorial policy of the newspaper, and the fact that such advertising was an important source of revenue certainly did not hinder our warnings over several years about the dangers of a financial crash.  In my entire time as editor of this family-owned company, the owners never once sought to interfere editorially.  The family has been publishing newspapers since the 1800s and I am in the privileged position of being the beneficiary of its strong belief in editorial independence.  That is important in the context of what the committee is seeking to establish with regard to the media during the period in question.<br\/><br\/>During that time, our property-related coverage reported factual information such as rising property prices, ESRI and Central Bank reports, pronouncements of leaders in their fields and Government-related interventions in the property market.  Although many of the articles published during this period mirrored the widely held view of the majority of commentators at the time - in particular, a prediction of a soft landing - it was not all one-way traffic.  Many articles containing opinion contrary to the prevailing view of the property market were also published in our newspaper.  As far back as 1999, we reported on spiralling house prices and warnings from the then Governor of the Central Bank, Maurice O&rsquo;Connell, that banks were &quot;lending too much money too easily&quot;.  A year before Morgan Kelly warned in 2006 of an imminent crash, the historian Ryle Dwyer wrote a column for the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>headlined &quot;Why the housing boom could collapse like a ton of bricks.&quot;  In his article, he wrote &quot;The threat posed ... is patently obvious, yet it is being largely ignored, even though it threatens the social, financial and political fabric of society.&quot;  Warning consistently over many years, he drew parallels with the speculative property boom that caused the economic collapse of Japan.  He further stated &quot;Is anyone so foolish as to think that what happened in Japan couldn't happen here?&quot;.  That was in February 2005, over three and a half years before the State&rsquo;s guarantee of the banks and almost six years before the bailout by the troika.  Between Maurice O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s warning in 1999 and Ryle Dwyer&rsquo;s in 2005, we published many articles, including editorial commentary, which questioned the viability of the boom, and particularly the danger to the economy posed by the property bubble.  In 2004, we asked whether the glowing economic predictions of the time were based on sound financial principles, on the speculation bubble or on overly optimistic aspirations.  I have supplied the committee with some sample editorial coverage of these warnings over the years.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the contribution of the media to public understanding and debate around fiscal budgetary policies and their applications, in addressing this section I wish to restrict my response to the newspaper for which I have responsibility and knowledge rather than presenting a critique of the media generally.  During the period covered here, the investigative eye of the newspaper was trained on those ultimately responsible for the fiscal and budgetary policies of the State, namely the Government.  Critical analyses of the policies of the Government formed part of the opinion editorials of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>during the property boom.  As referred to earlier, the threats of rapidly increasing house prices and a failure to put on the brakes were published in the newspaper as early as 1999 and continued throughout the boom years.  There was no change of editorial policy during those years.  Our approach as a newspaper has been to accurately report the news and comment objectively on the facts as far as they were available to us.  Alongside that, I continued our long-standing tradition of providing a platform to all shades of opinion, including those with which I might have strongly disagreed.<br\/><br\/>Much of the information on the causes of the crash that have subsequently come to light as a result of various reports and the work of this inquiry to date were not only not in the public domain in the lead up to the banking crisis but were inaccessible to us.  Our reporting was influenced by the information available to us.  We had articles, editorials, columnists and commentators who, as the Celtic tiger roared, argued, in effect, that it was out of control and would end in tears.  They argued that there was something fundamentally wrong with the fact that somebody on a &euro;40,000 salary was eligible for a &euro;400,000 loan to buy a house.  Nevertheless, the predominant public sentiment in political, financial and property circles was that at worst the boom was going to end with that oft-quoted soft landing.  That predominant sentiment found its reflection in media coverage of the time in our newspaper and everywhere else.<br\/><br\/>A daily national newspaper such as ours is necessarily general in nature, with a mix of news, sport, business and features between its covers.  We are not a <i>Financial Times<\/i>or a <i>Wall Street Journal<\/i>staffed by a big team of financial forensic experts.  We are reliant on agents of the State to be competent, professional, open, honest and reliable in what they do and say, and then we report on that.  Our reporting on the economy during the period in question was as balanced, diverse and well informed as was possible given the information available to us, which was not all of the information available to various agents of the State.  If we were guilty of anything - and I believe we were - it is that we believed and accepted that institutions such as the financial regulatory authorities were doing their jobs and doing them competently, with due diligence, appropriate compliance policies and proper political and departmental oversight, all of which we believed were designed to ensure the stability of our economy.  From what we know as a result of the Honohan, Regling-Watson and Nyberg reports and the contributions of others to this inquiry, it appears to be obvious that our trust in these various arms and agents of the State was, to say the least, misplaced.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge that there was insufficient critique of the frequent claims that there would be no crash and our so-called economic miracle would continue to be an example to the world.  We should have more rigorously challenged the predictions of analysts and economists, including those who contributed to our newspaper and those who had direct or indirect associations with financial institutions.<\/p><p>While this is an accusation that could be levelled at many editors and publishers throughout the world, much better resourced than my own organisation, it remains a matter of personal regret.  That said, it is with the benefit of hindsight which has been conveniently available to an earlier witness, Dr. Julien Mercille, but not to those of us living and working here at the time.  Even if we had been more questioning of the positive analysis and predictions for the economy and if we had even more contrarian voices to highlight, I doubt very much that it would have gone any meaningful way towards preventing the property bubble or the crash.  We still would have been unable to find out the true state of banks and their own regulation and we would still have been faced with an alignment of authority in the form of the IMF, the ECB, the European Commission, the international credit agencies, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank and the ESRI who were all of the view that our economic fundamentals were sound with the IMF giving Ireland a clean bill of health as late as 2006-2007.  It is difficult to envisage how any media organisation could effectively challenge such a formidable consensus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#HH00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Vaughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Vaughan.

I was the CEO of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>from October 2002 to June 2010 when I was appointed group chief executive of the then holding company of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited.  I was not the CEO of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>for the period from July 2010 until October 2011 at which stage I resumed that role in addition to my other responsibilities.<br\/><br\/>As the committee will be aware, the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>is a daily morning, mid-market newspaper, produced six days per week which circulates in broadsheet format in the Republic of Ireland generally but its core area of circulation is in the Cork and Munster region particularly.  In addition, the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>has an established increasing online presence now but in the period 2002 to 2007 all of this was in its infancy and, as such, was being established.  The <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>had no online property business in that period but had associated companies under the then parent company Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited, called Recruit Ireland Limited, a recruitment support company, and <i>breakingnews.ie<\/i>, an online news publisher and contents indicator to third parties.  Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited also had an online motoring site, called <i>motornet<\/i>.  <br\/><br\/>I wish to address the areas on which the committee has asked me to comment, namely, business model and sources of revenue.  As CEO of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>I have the task and pleasure of leading a great team of people who are responsible for producing, publishing and administering the best possible newspaper we can six days per week, 52 week per year.  I had eight direct senior management reportees at the time for the following role-functions: advertising sales, circulation sales, distribution and administration, editorial, finance, human resources, marketing, and production and IT.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Tim Vaughan has been the editor of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>since 2001 and is a highly regarded and experienced journalist and editor.  Mr. Vaughan has responsibility for all editorial matters pertaining to the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>and his brief is to continue, as his predecessors did, to produce the best possible newspaper he can for our readers.  The brief of the editor and the board continues to be to publish as he views appropriate without fear or favour.  While he must be aware of influencers, given the nature of his role he has to remain steadfastly independent of such influences for purposes of editing the newspaper.  This has been the philosophy of the Crosbie family as handed down from generation to generation and remains the ethos of the newspaper to today.<br\/><br\/>The second item is the importance of property related revenues within the overall revenue mix.  In common with most, if not all, quality newspapers, the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>has two main income streams, the first from circulation sales in the form of cover price and the second from advertising sales.  Circulation revenue is the mainstay of the revenue base but increasingly advertising revenue has become and remains vital, more particularly since 2007 when newspaper circulation volumes declined.  The ratio of advertising to circulation revenue in the period averaged 60:40.  <br\/><br\/>In any newspaper the key advertising sectors are to a greater or lesser extent property, recruitment, classifieds and run of paper.  Run of paper advertising typically is the larger display type advertisements often used by retailers, telecommunications companies and motor dealers <i>et al.<\/i>Increasingly today digital advertising revenues are becoming more important but in the reference period they were insignificant.  The <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>published a commercial section every Thursday within the newspaper for many years, including the period 2002 to 2007.  It also published a residential property section from the mid-1980s, which moved to a stand-alone publication on a Saturday from the mid-1990s, given the high level of home ownership in Ireland, relative to the rest of Europe, and the ever-increasing interest in property, furniture and interiors that the Irish population displays.  Advertising revenue is of vital importance to fund the current 300 jobs in the <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>and the continuing role of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>and the wider industry, so sales from all sectors is a critical success factor for newspapers.<br\/><br\/>Property advertising in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>is in relative terms as important today as it was at the height of the Celtic tiger but so are recruitment revenues, retail sector revenues and all advertising sector sales.  However, in the period 2002 to 2007 property advertising was consistent and strong.  Having said that, it reflected only a small but important percentage of our overall revenues in the period.  While it represented a greater percentage of our advertising revenues, internally we accorded it no greater importance over any of our other advertising sales sectors or over our circulation revenues.  To illustrate the point, we tend to allocate the same headcount and editorial space to property in our publications today in 2015, as we did at the height of the market in 2007.<br\/><br\/>The third point is the engagement in property related commercial activity.  In 2006 the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>moved from Academy Street in Cork to new rented headquarters in Lapp's Quay, Cork.  The Academy Street building housed a 35-year old printing press that was no longer fit for purpose.  This printing press had no commercial utility or value.  It was therefore decided to sell this building, leaving the old printing press <i>in situ <\/i>for economic reasons and to move to a more modern office block in the city.  Printing was then outsourced.  It is also worth remembering that work practices were changing in the industry and, in particular, that it had become increasingly difficult to operate the type of scaled printing and distribution business we had from the premises in the centre of Cork city.  The Academy Street building which was owned by the company for more than 150 years was sold for approximately &euro;40 million.  This transaction was not unique and it followed a similar pattern of other newspapers, both here and abroad, who moved from city centre locations to new locations and-or who outsourced their printing. <br\/><br\/>In a separate property transaction around this time another city centre premises owned by the company, the <i>Irish Examiner, <\/i>which was used in the business as a parking garage and store for newsprint was sold for approximately &euro;2 million.  These are the only property related transactions of any significance that I am aware of that the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>participated in during this period.  I was not involved in any way in these decisions which I understand were based on commercial considerations rather than on speculation in the property market.  These matters were negotiated at a holding company level at Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited at the time. <br\/><br\/>The fourth point is the relationship between the editorial and sales functions.  There is a clear distinction between editorial and the sales functions of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>as referred to in section 1 and as fostered at management level by the management team and myself.  The concept of editorial independence is fostered by everybody in the company and is well understood in our marketplace.  However, editors today must have a commercial sharpness and awareness to ensure the best opportunity for their newspapers which is why they can prosper.  By way of example, this is practised in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>by: the editor ensuring that there is timely and adequate communication, where relevant, to the circulation and advertising managers of his planned editorial activities to ensure there is the best possible opportunity to maximise the sale of newspapers and, where relevant and appropriate, the sale of advertising; and similar communications with the marketing managers so that appropriate in-paper signposting and, where appropriate, advertising slots can be purchased on radio and television.  While the commercial side of the house will never dictate editorial policy we, like most newspapers worldwide, produce commercial supplements and features which are advertising led and are clearly labelled as such to ensure that no confusion arises in relation to their origins.<br\/><br\/>We have also published specifically themed editorial booklets covering topics as divergent as suicide, infertility and eating disorders.  While these are open to sponsorship and advertising, editorial content is sacrosanct and cannot be influenced.  The suicide booklet was produced without advertising or sponsorship at a financial loss but we published it in order to provide a public service as neither the HSE nor any other State agency had published anything like it despite the huge numbers dying by suicide.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy.

I imagine if Mr. Vaughan walks down St. Patrick's Street in Cork tomorrow and he is leisurely, he could meet four people, for example, a reader of the newspaper, a purchaser of the newspaper, an advertiser of the newspaper or, dare I say it, a politician.  If he stopped and spoke to the four of them, I have no doubt that the conversation would inevitably go to something that was in the newspaper that day, that week, that month or whatever.<\/p> <p>  Our view is that we engage.  Cork is rather different place to live and work in than Dublin, for example, in terms of population size and the size of the city.  We interact with people on an ongoing basis.  It is rather difficult to avoid.  I suspect Deputy McGrath knows that himself.  Any one of those people could be an influencer, if that is the correct terminology.<\/p> <p>  For example, I might meet an estate agent.  That person may say to me that he would love to get an iconic property featured in the weekend supplement but cannot.  That is not a complaint or editorial influence in any way.  It is a matter of a person trying to advantage his client in some way.  However, the editor might be of the view that the newspaper covered the next-door property two months previously.  He may have no interest because he may be of the view that there is nothing particularly iconic about the property.  A motor dealer could be in the same situation.  He may say to the editor that he wants to get his new marque reviewed by the newspaper motoring correspondent but that he has be unable to do so.

Based on the testimony of other witnesses and evidence laid before the inquiry, there seems to be a general acceptance that Ireland is a house-purchasing nation.  Before, during and after the crisis, we continued to be a nation in which the most desirable type of accommodation for the majority of people was a purchased home.  During the 2002 to 2007 period we saw massive increases in the cost of homes, with properties that once cost two to three times the average industrial wage going up to eight or nine times that wage.  Property affordability was such that mortgage terms grew from an average of 20 to 35 years and so forth.
