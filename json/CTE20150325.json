During our sessions this week we are hearing from a number of witnesses on the role of the media during the property boom in the lead into the banking crisis 2002-07 and any changes in approach after the crisis.  At our first session this morning we will hear from Dr. Julien Mercille, lecturer at UCD's school of geography, planning and environmental policy.  I welcome Dr. Mercille before the inquiry.<\/p><p>Dr. Mercille holds a PhD from UCLA and an MA from the University of Kentucky.  His research focuses on global politics, international political economy, US foreign policy, media studies, and the war on drugs, from a critical political economy perspective.  He has published extensively on those subjects in peer reviewed journals, book manuscripts, as well as in the media, and appears on television and radio regularly as an expert in current affairs.  In addition to his academic writing, he is a regular analyst and commentator for publications such as <i>Asia Times<\/i>, <i>openDemocracy<\/i>, <i>Truthout<\/i>, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, <i>The Sunday Business Post<\/i>and <i>al-Jazeera<\/i>among others.

The statement analyses the role played by the Irish media in the property bubble in the years leading to the banking crisis.  It discusses also media performance in more recent years.  In particular, the statement addresses the following points about which the committee wishes to hear my views: the role in the mainstream media for scepticism about the sustainability of the housing boom or the broader economy; potential conflicts of interest in news content associated with revenues from property sector advertising; consistent promotion of buying over renting in the media; and the prevailing view that there would be a soft landing in the property market.  So much of the information presented in the statement arose in my book, as the Chairman mentioned, <i>The Political Economy and Media Coverage of the European Economic Crisis: The Case of Ireland<\/i>in which more detailed and systematic data may be found.<br\/><br\/>So for the property bubble before the crash, my overarching point is that news organisations largely convey the views of political and economic elites.  It is true that there are many debates taking place in current affairs reporting but they are mostly confined to the range of opinions within the establishment, and thus narrow in relative terms.  Most research on the media focuses on journalists' herd mentality and reporters' lack of training in finance.  However, I use a political economic framework and identify three main factors that account for the nature of coverage of the economic crisis.<\/p><p>The first is the media's links with the corporate and government sectors, the second is advertising pressures, and the third is sourcing.  I will take the three points one after the other.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the links between the media and the corporate and government sectors, both private and State-owned media organisations largely convey corporate and political establishment views, but for somewhat different reasons.  Private media entities are large corporations embedded in a for-profit economic system and are thus part and parcel of the broader market economy.  This has several consequences.  First, in order to start and successfully run a media company with any substantial outreach, significant financial investments are necessary, which means that only wealthy individuals and corporations are able to do so.  Second, media firms are integrated into the market and feel the pressure from bankers, shareholders and directors to generate profits.  Links with the broader corporate sector, including political elites, are created and maintained through boards of directors, as well as general business and social interactions.  Independent News and Media, which is arguably the dominant media conglomerate in Ireland, owns numerous newspapers, magazines, radio stations and websites here and abroad.  Just like other news organisations, its board has included numerous individuals linked with the corporate establishment.  The same goes for <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, whose board has included a CEO of Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent, a bank deeply involved in the housing bubble, along with members of IBEC and other businesses.  Third, the media have a close relationship with the Government.  News outlets depend on the State for licences and franchises, and so the Government is in a position to exert some leverage over news coverage.  Also, State-owned media are, by definition, controlled by the Government to a greater or lesser extent through funding and appointments of principal officers.  During the boom years, RTE had as chairman a director of Anglo Irish Bank, which epitomised the excesses of the Celtic tiger and property lending.<br\/><br\/>Thus, because the housing boom was beneficial to key sectors of the Irish corporate and political establishment, it was never seriously challenged.  Rising property prices directly benefited builders and developers, banks, the Government, property firms and, directly, the broader economy thanks to high growth levels.  The Government was able to collect large tax revenues from the property boom through stamp duty, capital-related taxes, income taxes on construction workers and taxes on construction materials.  For example, while total property-related taxes accounted for 4% of Government revenue in 1996, they accounted for over 17% by 2006.<br\/><br\/>My second point concerns advertising.  Advertising revenues are crucial to today's news industry.  They allow newspapers to be sold for a lower price, making them more competitive.  This affects news content, because corporate advertisers tend not to subsidise television programmes or news stories that seriously question or attack their own business or the political and economic system of which they are a part, which would be directly contrary to their interests.  One particularly clear example of the significance of advertising to the Irish media is the large amount of funding from property advertising received during the housing boom years.  The Irish media went even further in benefitting from property advertising money.  They became owners of property websites, acquiring a direct stake in the growing housing bubble.  For example, in 2006, INM bought <i>www.propertynews.com<\/i>and the <i>Property News<\/i>monthly newspaper - the largest Internet property site in Ireland - and, in 2006, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>bought the website <i>www.myhome.ie <\/i>for &euro;50 million, along with the website <i>www.newaddress.ie<\/i>, which aims to make it easier for homeowners to move residences.  Also, most newspapers published weekly supplements about commercial and residential property, glamorising the whole sector, while glowing editorial pieces about a new housing estate were often miraculously accompanied by a large advertisement plugging the same estate, in the words of Deputy Shane Ross, the former <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>business editor.  Ross also stated that unfavourable coverage of developers and auctioneers in other parts of the newspapers was regularly met by implied threats from property interests that advertising could go elsewhere.  Moreover, an Irish reporter stated that journalists were leaned on by their organisations not to talk down the banks and the property market because those organisations were heavily reliant on property advertising.<br\/><br\/>My third point concerns sourcing.  Journalists depend mostly on mainstream institutions for their reports because of limited resources, time constraints and a competitive news environment.  Reporters need to connect those institutions that provide a steady flow of news, which in practice means large organisations that have themselves the resources to produce and release such a stream of material.  The Government and corporations are two such sources, with the result that their points of view are predominant in the media.  They can also deny privileged information to journalists who do not adopt the expected storylines, as happened during the housing bubble in Ireland.<br\/><br\/>As will be seen, during the bubble journalists relied on numerous experts from the real estate and financial sectors for their stories.  The media analysis that follows depends to some extent on whether the bubble could have been identified before it burst and whether the size of the crash could have been reasonably estimated beforehand.  The answer is &quot;Yes&quot; on both counts, although the precision of the analysis is obviously greater in hindsight.<br\/><br\/>There are two main measures to determine whether property prices are in bubble territory: the price-to-earnings ratio and the price-to-income ratio.  <i>The Economist<\/i>magazine used those indicators to warn about property bubbles around the world early on.  In 2002, it stated that the Irish housing market had been &quot;displaying bubble-like symptoms in recent years&quot;, and, in 2003, it calculated that Ireland's property market was overvalued by 42% relative to the average of the previous three decades.  In Ireland, the economists David McWilliams and Morgan Kelly identified the problem and warned about it early on.<br\/><br\/>However, overwhelmingly, the Irish analysts and institutions, including the media, maintained that there was no bubble and that the boom would eventually end in a soft landing.  Indeed, there is a clear discrepancy between coverage of the housing bubble before and after it burst.  Before 2008, the media tended to largely ignore it, and it was only months after it started deflating that reality had to be faced.  Once the housing market collapsed, the media simply could not ignore its downwards trajectory, hence the increased coverage.  I have included two figures showing the number of articles on the housing bubble that appeared in newspapers by year.  On average, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>had 5.5 times more articles on the bubble per year in 2008&ndash;11 than in 1996&ndash;2007.  Similarly, the <i>Irish Independent<\/i>and the <i>Sunday Independent <\/i>had on average 12.5 times more such articles in 2008&ndash;11 than in 1999&ndash;2007.  Moreover, the few articles published during the earlier period often denied that there was a bubble.  For example, there were articles in <i>The Irish Times<\/i>entitled &quot;Study refutes any house price 'bubble' &quot; and &quot;House prices 'set for soft landing',&quot; while the <i>Irish Independent <\/i>and <i>Sunday Independent<\/i>had headlines such as &quot;NCB [Stockbrokers] rejects house value threat from burst bubble,&quot; &quot;House prices not about to fall soon, insist auctioneers,&quot; &quot;Price of houses 'not over-valued' says new report,&quot; and &quot;There is no property bubble to burst, despite doomsayers.&quot;  In particular, between 2000 and 2007, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>published more than 40,000 articles about the economy, but only 78 of these were about the property bubble, or 0.2%.  This is small coverage for what was the most important economic story in those years.<br\/><br\/>The residential and commercial property sections and supplements presented articles and glossy pictures encouraging readers to buy as opposed to renting.  Stories described various properties on sale and were virtually indistinguishable from advertisements.  One entitled &quot;There&rsquo;s a billion reasons to buy&quot; introduced new luxury apartments by noting that they &quot;feature quality designer kitchens with integrated AEG appliances [whatever that is] and stone worktops; top notch bathrooms with ceramic tiles, heated towel rails and chrome fittings&quot;.  Potential buyers should waste no time, though, as &quot;numbers are strictly limited &ndash; you&rsquo;d want to stake it fast&quot;.  Articles celebrated Ireland&rsquo;s newly found pride in entrepreneurialism at home and abroad.  One profiled the &quot;ever-bullish Irish property buyer ... looking for the hot new property market&quot;, wherever it is in the world.  Another article stated: &quot;[I]n Victorian times, it was fashionable for the British to suggest that 'the sun never sets on our Empire'.  Now the sun never sets on Ireland&rsquo;s burgeoning property empire&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The media relied on so-called experts from the financial or real estate industry to describe the market, which thus received almost invariably upbeat analysis.  For example, as late as November 2007, <i>The Irish Times<\/i>conducted a survey among &quot;property experts&quot; to predict how the market would evolve in 2008.  The six experts selected all held high-level positions with property firms.  Not surprisingly, their forecast was enthusiastic.  A number of journalists simply acted as cheerleaders for the property sector.  Many even persisted in rejecting the view that the market had been in a bubble months after it started collapsing.  For example, in April 2008, the <i>Sunday Independent <\/i>conveyed the thoughts of a real estate agent who believed that &quot;[T]he time to buy is now.  There is certainly great value in the market at the minute but it doesn&rsquo;t mean people can dilly dally.&quot;  Another journalist wrote a book entitled <i>The Best is Yet to Come<\/i>in 2007 and claimed that &quot;Far from collapsing, our economy and property prices will do more than hold up.&quot;All that was required to protect Ireland against a crisis was not to talk about it, because &quot;unless we talk ourselves into one, an economic storm is not going to happen.&quot;<\/p><p>Television followed the same pattern as the print press.  During the boom, RTE sustained a national obsession with houses by presenting programmes such as &quot;House Hunters in the Sun&quot;, &quot;Showhouse&quot;, &quot;About the House&quot; and &quot;I'm an Adult, Get Me Out of Here&quot;.  Leading current affairs programmes such as &quot;Prime Time&quot; also sustained a housing bubble.  Between 2000 and 2007, 717 shows were aired, of which only ten, approximately 1%, contained a segment concerned with the housing boom.  These shows presented a total of 26 guests or interviewees of whom 11 came from the property or financial sectors, four were politicians from the main political parties, four were journalists, academics or researchers, and three were economic consultants.  With respect to their views on the housing boom, only two interviewees said clearly that there was a bubble and that it would burst while the other 24 remained vague, argued explicitly that the housing market was and would remain strong in the years to come, or stated that a soft landing was to be expected if the boom decelerated at some point.<br\/><br\/>After the crisis, as the property market recovers, especially in Dublin, media coverage has essentially not changed.  By this, I do not mean its content is the same as during the pre-crash years.  The situation is different and we are not faced with a massive national bubble in the market.  Rather, I mean that the media coverage points roughly in the same direction as before 2008.  In general, it is the interests of elites that are mostly reflected in editorials and news stories, while those of ordinary people are often left out.  This is not unexpected, given that the political and economic nature of the media industry outlined above is intact.  News organisations are still corporate or Government-owned entities, advertising still plays a role in generating revenues and journalists still source their stories overwhelmingly from establishment institutions and individuals.  One can find a few articles of a more careful or sceptical nature relative to the ongoing real estate boom in Dublin.  I surmise that the pre-crisis bubble and its negative consequences are still felt strongly, and this may lead to more balanced coverage, although in relative terms this is a minor trend and, overall, a significant amount of critical commentary is not appearing in the media.  The election of a few Deputies with progressive politics has also resulted in more critical coverage when their views are reported.<br\/><br\/>The fact that media coverage still reflects elite interests may be appreciated by considering analysis and commentary on the following key issues in the housing market.  Approximately 90,000 people are on the waiting list for social housing, and there has been a rise in homelessness.  Austerity has reduced State investment in social housing as capital expenditure for social housing was cut by 80% between 2008 and 2013.  Approximately 118,000 mortgage accounts, 15%, remain in arrears and a number of repossession procedures are ongoing.  So-called vulture funds involving mostly foreign investors are buying up large chunks of the property market.  The Government has facilitated this by encouraging the establishment of real estate investment trusts, REITs, via generous tax breaks.  REITs buy, among other things, property portfolios from NAMA.  Vulture funds raise rents to maximise their incomes before they leave the market, after approximately three years, or whenever their real estate assets have increased enough in value in order that they can sell them back to Irish people at a higher price.  NAMA promotes a vision of property as a commodity, not as a social good, given that it needs rental growth and seeks to maximise commercial returns.<br\/><br\/>Media coverage of such issues has reflected elites' views and interests.  Coverage has not been extensive and has not foregrounded analysis and opinion that would reflect ordinary people's interests.  Relatively little attention has been paid to progressive strategies to address the problems, such as significant public spending on a social housing building programme, NAMA playing a role more directed towards providing housing as a social good, rent controls, making unfinished estates safe and attractive places to live, converting vacant properties into rental units, mortgage debt write-downs and dealing with the issue of homelessness through a redistribution of wealth and power in society.  The problem is not that nobody has presented alternatives.  The union, SIPTU, has made the case for establishing a social housing REIT.  The youth advocacy group, We're Not Leaving, produced a report on problems faced by renters, including deposit retention and low standards of quality in rented accommodation.  The Nevin Economic Research Institute has argued for establishing and financing an affordable housing strategy.  However, such organisations have not been included in the media to any significant extent.  Instead, we often hear the views of developers, bankers and real estate agents and companies that call on the Government to ease the cost burden of construction in order that more houses can be built by the private sector to allow the market allegedly to solve the problems.  We also still see stories of buyers telling how they are being outbid when they attempt to buy property.<br\/><br\/>After the crash, the media also presented the Government's crisis resolution policies in a largely favourable manner, again in line with the views of Irish and global elites.  The media enthusiastically endorsed a blanket guarantee and declared it the cheapest bailout in the world.  NAMA was called &quot;bold and imaginative&quot; and the &quot;holy grail&quot;, while <i>The Irish Times<\/i>claimed it was our &quot;best bet&quot;.  However, there were progressive alternatives.  Strong conditions could have been attached to the nationalisation of banks such as firing their top management, cutting the salaries of top officials, requiring that investment decisions be made with socially useful purposes and establishing strict regulations on banks' operations.  A good bank could have been established, as explained in detail by the economist Willem Buiter in the pages of the<i>Financial Times<\/i>.  After some hesitation, the media endorsed the EU-IMF bailout in late 2010.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>argued that:<blockquote>On one level, intervention by the EU and the IMF is no bad thing.  It means that rational decisions on how we can live within our means will now be forced down the throats of the competing interests who have stymied any genuine national response to the crisis.<\/blockquote>The accumulation of sovereign debt in Ireland and Europe gave rise to the possibility of default and restructuring.  However, the media described a potential default as a &quot;cataclysm&quot;,<i><\/i>an &quot;evil day&quot;, an &quot;unmitigated disaster&quot;, &quot;hugely damaging&quot;, a &quot;doomsday scenario&quot; and likely leading to intolerable contagion effects throughout the eurozone.  However, scholarship on sovereign debt restructuring reveals that countries that decide to cancel the repayment of their debts typically suffer only short-term economic costs and that long-term negative consequences are not significant so that, overall, defaulting often yields positive outcomes, for example, in Argentina and Greece.<br\/><br\/>The media has also strongly endorsed austerity since 2008.  At the outset of the crisis, the media called explicitly for a campaign to educate the public about the need for austerity.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>editors complained that members of the public still did not appreciate the possible extent of the economic downturn and the editors asserted that the Government would have &quot;a major job to do in educating public opinion about unpalatable economic realities and the need for civic discipline&quot;.  A study I conducted of more than 900 opinion articles and editorials in the five main newspapers between 2008 and 2013 found the following revealing statistic: only 11% of pieces opposed austerity while 58% supported it and the remainder were neutral.  The articles' authorship was also significant.  More than 200 of the pieces were written by outside writers, not journalists.  Of these, 29% were mainstream economists, 28% worked in the financial or corporate sectors and 20% were political officials in the three main political parties in power during the crisis, including only four from the Labour Party with the bulk from the two dominant right-wing parties.  The overwhelming majority of writers, 77%, came from elite political or economic institutions.  The remainder of authors comprised academics, members of progressive organisations and only 3% were trade union officials.  Thus, a conservative cast of writers expressed their views and interests in the media.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#A00400","nonspeaker":"Dr. Julien Mercille","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":10,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Mercille for coming here.

That leads to a series of consequences for their reporting.  There are many reasons for that but I shall deal with ownership first.  It is owned by large corporations so they have specific interests.  We do not have any problem recognising that.  A trade union paper reflects trade union viewpoints because they are owned by the trade unions.

The coverage cannot be analysed in the same way we did before.  There is a spike in Dublin prices but it is not a national issue like before.  The media, in general, is the same, as the structure has not changed.  There is still advertising and it still corporate and government-owned.  There are more articles of a careful nature.  When one sees a boom in Dublin, a journalist does not necessarily jump on it as much as before because of the crash.  Perhaps they are a bit more careful.  I have not looked at it in any systematic way.<br\/><br\/>After the crash, the other issues became more prominent, such as austerity.  When I or others say the media is in favour of government views, it is not something pulled out of nowhere.  The media is very proud about that and says so explicitly.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>indicated in 2008, right at the start, that it needed to educate the public about the virtues of austerity.  There is no secret there and it was very successful in that task.  The media performs extremely well in Ireland if it is judged from that standpoint.  It has been very successful in telling people that austerity is the right way to go.  There are crisis resolution points.<br\/><br\/>One can see reporting about vulture funds and other topics but not to the extent one would see if ordinary people's interests were considered to a greater extent.

It is a good question.  Again, it is impossible to give a clear or precise answer.  I would say that in the case of the housing bubble, people just chose not to talk about it.  The \"Prime Time\" report is a good example.  Not many of the shows that were about the bubble denied that it was happening.  It is just that there were very few shows about it.  The graph I have presented to the committee contains two figures that show the same thing.  I think I have mentioned that a few articles about the bubble appeared before 2008.  The articles in question were not necessarily critical of what was going on or warning about it.  Many of them said \"you may have heard there is a bubble out there, but it is not true - we talked to experts and rest assured it is fine\".  This does not even mean they were talking about it.  In most cases, I would say it is a question of denial.  The same point applies to a lot of things.  When was the last time it was on the front page that the US military has been using Shannon Airport for many years?  It is not as if the media is saying \"no, the US is not there\"; it is just that we do not talk about it.  The same point can be made about deprivation or about the health care system.  We are never told that a great deal of money could be saved by having a public health care system.  Much of it is just not addressed.  When it is, the views of elites are usually taken as a driver.  Again, this does not mean it is wrong or right - it just means this is the viewpoint that is being heard.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#G01600","nonspeaker":"Dr. Julien Mercille"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":107,"content":"<p>In Dr. Mercille's experience and research, would he have spoken to people who offered evidence of journalists being subjected to strong or small interference from corporate types who were saying \"that is not a great way to be going\" or \"actually, we do not want to use that story\"?

The job was done for that, so I did not talk to as many people.  I will give another good example that is more about the passiveness.  A senior RTE journalist who was trying to show me that it was not the media's fault, and that it was the fault of the economists or whoever else, once told me how he works.  He said that when looks at his mobile after he comes back from lunch, he might have received 12 press releases from the banking sector.  He said he just copies them down as his article and that is it.  He argued that this shows he is not guilty, but is merely reporting the views of the banks.  That is a very good example of passive reporting.  It is actually a robot view of a media environment in which journalists do not even think, but just copy what they get on their mobiles.  At one level, one could put the blame on journalists and others and suggest that they should think a bit.  However, it is very rational for media organisations to behave in this way because it saves them a lot of money.  As such organisations operate in a profit-driven system, they might go bankrupt if they do not act in this manner.  There are rational reasons behind their behaviour.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#G01800","nonspeaker":"Dr. Julien Mercille"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":109,"content":"<p>I thank Dr. Mercille.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#G01900","speaker":"1129"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":110,"content":"<p>The next questioner is Senator Michael D'Arcy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#G02000","speaker":"990"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":111,"content":"<p>I welcome Dr. Mercille.

Indeed, Dr. Mercille would have been a major source for this statement were it not that the committee had already heard from him for two hours already.<\/p><p>I will endeavour to mention other researchers whose work I am drawing upon, but I should also note that a fully referenced version of the statement has been furnished to the committee, with a works cited list, and I will also be making a link to that public on social media later today.<br\/><br\/>Print and broadcast media in Ireland played a difficult-to-measure but almost certainly significant role in the inflation of the property bubble and the legitimisation of risky behaviour by the financial services sector in the lead up to the crisis of 2007 and 2008.  It did so partly by ignoring or marginalising scepticism about these phenomena.  I will focus in my statement on the newspaper industry and I will argue that this socially destructive role should be understood not necessarily as a failing of Irish newspapers but, to some extent, as a feature, one that flows predictably from commercial media's structural relationship with the corporate forces that benefitted from the bubble.  While this relationship is of very long standing and continues to some extent to this day, I will further argue there were certain aspects of the development of newspapers in the 1990s and early 2000s, which were particularly acute here in Ireland but also experienced elsewhere in the world, that made them especially vulnerable to domination by those forces and weakened the capacity of journalists to play the critical, adversarial and investigative role that most of them do undoubtedly value.  Within journalism and in research about journalists, that value is often referred to under the rubric of &quot;professionalism,&quot; a term that encompasses a set of principles and performances that supposedly drive journalists to seek the truth impartially and to question the powerful doggedly.  The values are captured in such largely symbolic documents as the National Union of Journalists Code of Conduct and the code of practice of the Press Council of Ireland.  I will not endeavour to romanticise the journalism of an earlier age, which had plenty of its own problems, many of them involving the limits and shortcomings of professionalism itself.  However, over the last 30 years or so, those principles have been widely understood to be increasingly at risk all over the world, with particular features of the media landscape endangering them.  Daniel C. Hallin, a leading American scholar of journalism, has written, &quot;For the most part I don't think journalistic professionalism is breaking down from the inside, by journalists becoming less committed to it; instead [Hallin continues] I think professionalism is being squeezed into increasingly smaller niches within the media field.&quot;<br\/><br\/>It is my contention that in Irish newspapers we can literally see that squeeze occur over the period between about 1990 and 2007, as the physical construction of newspapers changed.  There was an inscription of an unquestioning pro-business ideology, in practice, onto increasingly large advertising-heavy portions of the newspaper - indeed, sections that owed their existence precisely to advertising, including the ever-growing business finance, property, and lifestyle sections, dedicated to the advertising of, respectively, recruitment, real estate, and consumer goods and services.  Even the most scrupulous of newspaper editors, I contend, came to see those sections as a realm of, at best, what one might call &quot;professionalism lite&quot; where soft treatment of the rich and powerful was expected.  Even if one worked in the niches where full-blown professionalism still held sway - the journalists who filled news pages and provided political coverage, for example - it was hard to miss the message that was embedded in that big colourful product about your employer's relationship with financial institutions, property interests and other corporate bodies.  Those supplements were, after all, paying the bills.  When The Irish Times Limited infamously paid &euro;40 million for <i>myhome.ie<\/i>in 2006, it appeared to confirm the company's dedication to what increasingly looked like its core business - the advertising of property sales.<br\/><br\/>There is a piece of research that has already been cited today in which a group of Irish financial journalists, speaking on condition of anonymity to a team of academic researchers who published their findings in 2010, discussed this relationship.  One of them said, in that research by Fahy, O'Brien and Poti:<blockquote>Much of the mainstream media seems to me to be very conflicted because of their reliance on real-estate and recruitment advertising.  That doesn't mean reporters consciously avoid writing bad news stories, but it's hard to run against the tide when everyone is getting rich.<\/blockquote>Another stated explicitly that journalists &quot;were leaned on by their organisations not to talk down the banks [and the] property market because those organisations have a heavy reliance on property advertising&quot;.<br\/><br\/>In 2006 I interviewed dozens of journalists about <i>The Irish Times<\/i>at that time.  One of them, who was retired from that newspaper, said:<blockquote>In the mid-1980s ... we had a series investigating the truth behind buying and selling property.  Can you imagine that now?<\/blockquote>That was in 2006.  Now, the idea that certain parts of the Irish newspaper industry were professionally compromised territory was already in the air as early as the 1980s.  The former business editor from Independent Newspapers, cited in that same research that we have discussed, and to whom one of the Deputies has already referred, recalled a lunch from that period where journalists and stockbrokers gathered to mark the appointment of a new president to the Irish Stock Exchange.  The journalist recalled the event to a researcher many years later.  He stated:  <blockquote>The lunch went well and all the proprieties were observed, until, during the port, the topic of mutual dependence came up in the conversation.  &quot;What do you mean mutual?&quot; a rubicund and slightly tipsy broker ventured.  &quot;The business pages are ours.  We own them.&quot; <\/blockquote>The editor continued his recollection:<blockquote>Trudging back to the office, however, I admit an icy feeling was coursing through my veins.  Maybe, the chap with the English public school accent was right.  He was implying that we [journalists] were lazy, dependent and largely uncritical.  More chillingly still, maybe our employers (who shared the same gentlemen's clubs with the brokers) were happy with such an arrangement. <\/blockquote>That was in the 1980s.  By the time of the Celtic tiger, this compromised turf of business and financial journalism had expanded many times over, both in the volume of pages produced and in the number of journalists employed.  In that research cited earlier, the author summarised the views of several of the Irish financial journalists whom they interviewed, and this is an extensive quote from that research:<blockquote>According to journalist F, because of the need for regular contact with financial sources, &quot;some journalists are reluctant to be critical of companies because they fear they will not get information or access in the future&quot;.  Journalist E ... believed that some journalists had become &quot;far too close to their sources&quot;: They viewed them as friends and allies and essentially became advocates for them.  Their approach was justified editorially because many developers and bankers limited access to such an extent that it became seen to be better to write soft stories about them than to lose access.  Extremely soft stories would also be run to gain access too ... Journalist B criticised daily financial journalism for being &quot;almost entirely press release and stock exchange disclosure based[.]&quot; ...<\/blockquote>The report continues: &quot;... Journalist F noted [that] it was &quot;well known that some PR companies try to bully journalists by cutting off access or excluding journalists from briefings&quot;.<br\/><br\/>The sort of ambivalence that this engenders about telling good tough stories while maintaining source relationships is not unique to financial or property journalism; it is present throughout journalism.  However, as the role and prominence of those sorts of journalism increased in the 1990s and early 2000s, their particular compromises of professionalism played a proportionately bigger role in newspaper coverage of these important areas of the economy and society.  Their growth was not inevitable, nor was it unique to Ireland.  It was part of an international development in the newspaper industry that sought to diversify papers' content and appearance to make them more attractive to advertisers and, to a lesser extent, to readers.  In the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s this came to be known as &quot;total newspapering&quot;, with a de-emphasis on news and - this is the &quot;total&quot; part - an effort to break down the traditional barriers between editorial and commercial considerations.  A study of this phenomenon, also known as &quot;market-led journalism,&quot; in the 1990s carried the cautionary title, &quot;When MBAs rule the newsroom.&quot;  This was already worrying journalists cited in British research during this decade:<blockquote>Among journalists there are fears that the delicate balance between the self-interest of capitalist media owners and the &quot;public interest&quot; motives of journalism has been upset ...  Some journalists have come to believe that the news is being stolen from them.  <\/blockquote>This market orientation does not express itself merely in the growth of financial and property journalism but in the explosion of entertainment, lifestyle and consumer-oriented sections and stories.  As one scholar summarises it - again, I quote this from Hanitzsch:<blockquote>When market orientation is high, journalism gives emphasis to what the audiences want to know at the expense of what they should know ...  Audiences are not addressed in their role as citizens concerned with the social and political issues of the day but in their role as clients and consumers...<\/blockquote>These developments in newspapers did not happen by accident or in isolation.  They were a vital cultural component of the larger global development of politics and economics over the last several decades that we have come to call neoliberalism.  The great historian and student of that phenomenon David Harvey writes: &quot;Neoliberalization required both politically and economically the construction of a neoliberal market-based populist culture of differentiated consumerism and individual libertarianism.&quot;<br\/><br\/>It is important to note that I do not believe we should blame most journalists either individually or collectively for this situation.  Nor have journalists been its obvious beneficiaries.  Even in Ireland, where the booming economy helped newspaper circulation and profitability to remain healthy past 2000, a journalistic culture of increased workloads, casualisation, rapidly changing technological expectations and declining real rates of pay was in place throughout the industry even before the wider bust of 2007-08.  When I did that series of interviews with newspaper journalists in 2006, many of them told me that their capacity to engage in critical scrutiny of Government and business was overwhelmed by the day-to-day pressures of filling ever more space in print and online.<\/p><p>The job of careful consideration and analysis of events was largely left to a small coterie of editors and senior political writers who were generally believed to have risen to those posts through a combination of caution and conservatism.  As research outside Ireland has also suggested, journalists who continued to feel that they should be doing hard-hitting, critical scrutiny of powerful institutions felt disempowered from doing so.  It is not surprising that a reputable transnational &quot;scorecard&quot; of journalism's coverage of the financial crisis found that in Ireland, most stories were episodic and short of analysis.  These conditions have, if anything, deteriorated further in the intervening years of collapsing circulation and desperate digitisation.  <br\/><br\/>Such conditions also provide the context for the increasing power of the public relations industry.  As noted above, the capacity of PR officers to give and withhold the information that hard-pressed journalists require in order to do their work gives them an inevitable influence over content to the benefit of their State and corporate clients.  An even more insidious form of PR influence comes in the form of &quot;flak&quot;, which is the negative attention and pressure that comes upon journalists when they attempt to report on sensitive stories.  In theory, flak can come from any side of a story.  In practice, most of it comes from the sides that can afford to generate it at a volume and with a social standing that catches the ear of editors.  <br\/><br\/>For reasons of space, and because it was not a specific part of the brief, I have not greatly addressed the question of media ownership in this statement, although I am happy to do so hereafter.  The enormously high concentration of media ownership in this State is, of course, a major danger and fundamental public concern.  However, ownership of media cannot tell the whole story about it.  <i>The Irish Times<\/i>is owned by a trust but has not been immune to the commercial pressures discussed here.  RTE, which is genuinely dominant media outlet in this State, is owned by the people of Ireland but its role in broadcasting non-news and current affairs based &quot;property porn&quot; in the Celtic tiger years certainly bears scrutiny.  It is worth saying that both RTE and newspapers did break many scandals although they were less likely to raise systematic questions about the state of the economy and the housing market.<br\/><br\/>The committee has asked me to address potential conflicts of interests among media organisations.  Based on much of what I have said here, it is tempting to conclude that there was no real conflict of interest at all but rather a congruence of interests between media organisations and the developers and financiers who were advertising with them cashing in handsomely on a speculative bubble.  While there would be some truth in such a conclusion, it would also be excessively simplistic because journalists and the organisations that employ them do also have an interest in producing strong stories that challenge conventional thinking, afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted.  Indeed, nothing in what I have said here should be interpreted to mean that they do not sometimes do precisely that.  The purpose of this analysis is not moral condemnation but to understand why, in the specific context of Celtic tiger Ireland and also beyond that context, the structural congruence might have been stronger and more influential than the sense of ethical conflict.  While much of the professional practice of journalism is conducted with an acute awareness of &quot;how it should be done&quot;, nonetheless, a host of other influences determine the shape and content of the journalistic product leading to biases in favour of, for example, &quot;talking up&quot; the economy and the market, home ownership, property investment and the soft landing.  How this happens is complex and contingent located where newspapers find themselves - at an intersection of daily events, longer term history, commerce, design, technology, routine, process, pressure and, not least, economic and political power.  This intersection is traversed by the workers in a newspaper on a daily basis. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#Q00200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":340,"content":"<p>I have a few questions.

In the absence of other clear professional markers, a code of conduct - an idea that journalists are truth seekers who try to be impartial and who challenge powerful institutions - defines journalism, at least as far as many journalists are concerned.  In another sense, it could be argued that some of that is also window dressing - a kind of high language that masks the chaotic reality of producing programmes and publications on a daily basis.  In other words, it could be argued that it is a myth or a series of myths that does not necessarily have a lot to do with the day-to-day publishing of a website or magazine.<\/p> <p>  As the Chairman suggests, they are in some sense codified.  The National Union of Journalists code of conduct is guidance for its members.  The code of practice of the Press Council of Ireland has somewhat more weight.  It is a voluntary code publications are encouraged to sign up and give their commitment to and encompasses fairness, balance, respect of the rights of the people about whom they write and accuracy.  The Office of the Press Ombudsman and the Press Council were set up primarily by the newspaper industry in some ways to fend off more statutory regulation that was threatened to some extent by these Houses.  They are essentially voluntary codes, although there is some statutory backup for the Press Council.  In effect, this is an element of protection for communications with the Press Council.  They have fairly weak enforcement methods.  Publications are not obliged to sign up to them.  In order to take a complaint to the Office of the Press Ombudsman, people need a certain standing in respect of the story.  They cannot simply complain that a story is inaccurate.  They must complain that it is inaccurate and that its inaccuracy affects them.  Property editorial and journalism that is hard to distinguish from advertising, which were discussed this morning, do not really come up in respect of the Office of the Press Council.  <\/p> <p>  Broadcasting is a very different story.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, has real and significant powers in terms of the regulation of RTE and the private broadcasting sector and has a code of fairness, objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs which it is often quite aggressive in enforcing.  Broadcasters are generally quite knowledgeable about the requirements they have under that code.  The code relating to the press is a far less powerful instrument.  <\/p> <p>  My interest is less in these assertions than in structural facts.  Just as light-touch regulation in the economy was not a mistake but was built into the system of breaks and incentives that were established here to attract and reward capital, light-touch journalism to some extent was a predictable feature of the changing face of the industry since the 1980s.  It does not require a conspiracy to undermine the standards codified in some of those documents we have talked about - just a set of institutional changes that made those standards less significant in many areas of journalistic work.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#S00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":344,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Browne for coming before the committee.

I believe it is fair to say that the majority of journalists working in the property area would not be engaged in anything remotely resembling corrupt practices.

There is not really any need for the showering of gifts, there is a shared interest in property journalism as traditionally understood in the property supplements.  There is a shared interest in the promotion of property sales.  I believe that in some respects, property journalism sometimes gets bashed a little too hard in these discussions.  It is a genre in itself and in some ways can feature some of the most beautiful writing in journalism.  Most readers understand what property journalism is and can see it for what it is.<\/p> <p>  My concern about property supplements is not so much the journalism that was in them, or the relationships that existed between individual journalists and the interests represented there, but the insidious effect their very existence had on larger aspects of newspapers.  For example, it is one thing to have property supplements saying that one should buy a beautiful home in Ballsbridge, but it is another thing to have the business advice column treating homes and houses as just another asset class that people are invited to invest in.

I believe that journalistic professionalism in its purest version would call journalists not only to say, well, what does the Government say or what does the leading expert in the leading Irish university department have to say on this topic.  I would say that real journalism means that one goes and finds the dissident.  One goes and finds the voices of those who are critical of the status quo.<br\/><br\/>The idea of journalism as a challenge to power can only happen if one is seeking out the expertise to challenge that power, and if one is seeking out the voices.  Dr. Mercille has covered some of this ground.  One had <i>The Economist<\/i>not <i>Red Pepper<\/i>saying in 2002 that the Irish economy was clearly overheating and that there was a bubble in property here.  One had, by and large, Irish journalists working in the area choosing not to make that the main topic of conversation on television programmes and in newspaper articles for as long as that bubble was to continue.

We did not have large property developers who owned newspapers.  Anglo Irish Bank, to name one randomly selected institution, was not a major shareholder in any of those companies, which is not to contradict the point I made earlier about the basic structural relationship that arises from the advertising that that sector brought to bear in property and also in recruitment.

The PRs do not hold all the power.<br\/><br\/>There is a very good book about the recent history of American journalism by John Nichols and Robert McChesney called <i>The Death and Life of American Journalism<\/i>, I think, and it has a chart in the back that traces the employment in the PR industry and the employment in journalism from about 1980 to 2008.  In 1980 the two bars are roughly equivalent.  There are just about the same number of PRs working in America as there are journalists.  As one moves through the 1980s and 1990s the PR bar keeps growing, the journalism bar wobbles and starts to shrink and by 2008 there are about three or four times as many PRs as journalists in the United States.  That indicates to me a kind of a change in the ecology of this entire relationship and one in which the capacity of journalists to scrutinise the kind of information that is coming from this vast apparatus of public relations is weakened and the capacity of the PRs to kind of push information on journalists who have more and more that they have to try to deal with, contend with, and publish is strengthened.  So although the Deputy is right in suggesting that the power clearly can work both ways and journalists do have what one might call currency in the transaction, they nonetheless find themselves, I think, increasingly on the less pleasant end of that transaction.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#W00800","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":433,"content":"<p>Is there not an overlap, or a huge overlap, anecdotally at least, between the PR-type role and the media-type role-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#W00900","speaker":"966"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":434,"content":"<p>You are running out of time.

PR is referred to as the enemy and there is talk of going to the dark side when journalists cross over to PR.  It is one of the few acceptable ways within journalism for us to actually say we have this ethics element, we are not PR, we wear this badge called journalism which scrutinises information critically and just does not cut and paste it.  Otherwise, journalists would sound self-righteous but at least we have PR to compare ourselves to.  There is this very closely related industry that is somehow ethically different that we use as a way of flying our own flag.<\/p> <p>  The fact is that the access that PRs can control is very important to journalists.  If one does not have that access and one&rsquo;s rival in another publication does, then one&rsquo;s editor will ask if one offended the PR.

No, it did not.  This goes to the question of how it is that journalists measure what is a valid view to seek out and report.  There has been some discussion here about the extent to which the economics profession called it or did not.  I know economists who still argue about this quite a lot.  I think I said earlier in response to Senator O'Keeffe that there is a duty to go beyond reflecting the views that are extant among the elite voices in society.  I grew up in a liberation theology household in the US.  My father, who had been a priest in New York, was always quoting the Conference of Latin American Bishops of 1968 which said that the Catholic Church should have a preferential option for the poor.  In some respects, journalism should have a preferential option for the poor and in this case, for the marginalised and dissent.  It should be looking for the voice that is challenging the elite perspectives.  It should be seeking not just the educated views of economists, but the direct experience of people.  Again, that is a romantic view of what journalism should be that is distinct from the interests of the institutions that largely sustain journalism.  It is also one that should at least in part be a guide.  In retrospect, it would have meant that Irish newspapers could be holding their heads up a little higher than they are able to do here this afternoon and tomorrow about how well they covered the underlying structural problems in the economy.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#Y00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":465,"content":"<p>Were contrarian voices knocking on the doors of the newspapers looking for space and coverage to articulate their views?

I go back to my point that newspapers should be actively seeking contrarian views but I think that the people who could have offered those views probably could have done better.  People sometimes point to the ESRI reviews and say that if one reads them very carefully, one can see that they were calling the bubble.  We should not have had to read them very carefully.

Fundamentally the business of newspapers is selling readers to advertisers and, to a smaller extent, selling newspapers to readers.  In the memoir of a former editor of a national newspaper, he referred to research done in his newspaper and that two thirds of the advertising revenue was property and recruitment which were roughly equally spread.  Recruitment is not to be overlooked and was a source of a vast area of relationships with the financial industry, in the same way that the property sections reflected relationships with estate agents.  The recruitment sections, to a great extent, represented relationships with finance as well as with other industries.<br\/><br\/>For example, in 2001 there was a huge downturn in advertising revenue in newspapers, in particular <i>The Irish Times<\/i>, which was based fundamentally on a fall in recruitment rather than problems in the property market.  If one breaks it down, two thirds plus of revenue in newspapers comes from advertising.  Of that, two thirds comes from recruitment and property together.  One gets a broad picture of the situation.  If one looks at the steady rise of that through the boom and then the collapse since, one gets another sense of how important it has been to newspapers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#Z01200","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":491,"content":"<p>Mr. Browne is very welcome.

What the interviewee suggested - he was not off the record but I will refrain from mentioning his name - that the balance of forces within the newspaper was such that in the mid-1980s when he edited a critical series on property, the commercial side of the house could come in and say, &quot;Don't do that.  Why are you doing that?&quot;, and the editor would say: &quot;This is our area.&quot;  That hard wall is widely seen as having been, to a certain extent, breached in both directions.<br\/><br\/>One of Mr. Gageby's successors writes in his own memoirs that he sometimes regrets that he did not take more of an active role in the management side of the company, as opposed to just the editorial management of the newspaper.  I mentioned the <i>Los Angeles Times<\/i>earlier.  When a new publisher came in there in the 1990s, he said he was going to take a bazooka to blow away the wall between commercial and editorial considerations.  That was a more dramatic view of a kind of an idea that was widespread within the newspaper business at the time that said the editorial side has to think business, the business side has to think editorial and we are all in this together.<br\/><br\/>It was possible for a time in many national newspapers here for senior journalists to do an MBA and get funding from the newspaper to do it.  In some respects, for people outside journalism that might seem perfectly normal.  One is a manager within a company and one's company wants one to get a better qualification in management.  From the point of view of a journalist, it is more problematic because an MBA is training in a certain kind of ideology as well as being a training in the capacity to manage.  That breach was much more widespread by the 1990s and beyond.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#Z01900","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":498,"content":"<p>Mr. Browne also states that in 2006 many of the journalists told him that their capacity to engage in critical scrutiny of Government and business was overwhelmed by the day-to-day pressures of filling ever more space in print and online.

So not only can we talk about licence fees to public broadcasters, we can talk about, as already exists in Ireland, lower tax rates for newspapers - VAT on papers is low here for example.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#BB00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Harry Browne"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":536,"content":"<p>I am going to run out of time.

I support those kinds of things, but on the idea that one would ban this or restrict that, I think I would prefer to see a situation where we are using carrots rather than sticks, where one incentivises non-profit news production, for example, with various kinds of breaks and various kinds of subsidies.

I will deal with the issues I have been asked to address, with specific reference to the Irish Examiner and our editorial policy on the economy and the property boom from 2002 to 2007, as referred to in the invitation from the committee.<br\/><br\/>I would first like to give a brief introduction to the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>.  It is a broad-based mid-market newspaper, publishing six days a week, with an increasingly active online presence across many platforms.  I have been editor since 2001.  While we have a respected national profile, our circulation is significant in Cork and Munster, where we have the largest readership of any daily newspaper.  My role as editor is to lead a great team who make it happen every day.<br\/><br\/>A trusted newspaper must inform honestly and accurately.  It must ask questions and challenge where questions need to be asked and answers found.  It must present a broad range of diverse opinion and it must know and engage with its readers.  If it does all of these things successfully, it generates enough income to pay the wages of its employees, contributors, contractors, suppliers and shareholders.  That income is derived almost exclusively from two revenue streams: the cover price of the newspaper, and advertising.<br\/><br\/>I turn now to the specific area the committee asked me to consider, our editorial policy on the economy and the property boom and the approach to reporting on the property market and the Irish economy.  As far as the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>is concerned, during the period in question we approached reporting on the economy and the property market in the same way that we approach reporting across the broad spectrum of the newspaper.  We endeavoured to ensure our reporting was accurate and reflected the facts.  The newspaper reflected all shades of opinion during these years, including prominent warnings going back to 1999 and throughout the Celtic tiger era that the property boom could not last forever.<\/p><p>What our coverage did at the time was reflect the preoccupation with property in a country experiencing an unprecedented boom.  We reported what was happening and what authoritative institutions such as the Central Bank, the Economic and Social Research Institute, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development stated about what was happening.<br\/><br\/>No newspaper lives apart from its readers, and their preoccupation with and enjoyment of the financial benefits of that era were reflected in our columns.  Nobody who lived through that period, proclaimed throughout the world by our political leaders as an economic miracle, was immune from the spirit of the time.  It was the prevailing narrative of the political, banking and property establishment.  At the time, we had little or no reason to believe that key figures in our financial regulatory infrastructure were not functioning as they should have been in the best interest of the State and its citizens, and nor was there a level of transparency around the regulatory process for the banking system that would have allowed us to access information that subsequently emerged after the crash, too late, when the damage was done.  Believe me when I say that had I or any of my colleagues in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>been able to access that critical information about the real state of our financial institutions and their methods of operation in those years and months leading up to the bank guarantee, I would have published it.  It would not have been enough to have been privy to that inside information; I would have had to be able to prove it in a court of a law.  Publishing what one knows to be true does not mean one cannot be successfully sued for libel.  That is a point worth remembering when people question why the media does not publish what the dogs in the street might know.<br\/><br\/>Turning to the property market specifically, aside from reporting property news and commentary in the main newspaper, we introduced a weekend section with a property element in the mid-1980s.  This was a period of deep recession in Ireland and a world away from the property boom, but property editorial was of interest and was important to our readers, just as it is today.  That weekend section also included the usual mix of features, including television highlights and generally softer-focus content suitable for relaxed reading at the weekend.  In the mid-1990s, due to the increasing popularity of the sector and as the economy improved, the property element became a standalone publication, focusing on residential homes, which continues to this day.  In 2001 we introduced a commercial property section for Thursdays.<br\/><br\/>The purpose of the weekend property magazine is to provide readers with factual information on property for sale throughout the country, but primarily in the Munster region.  In essence, it is a mix of properties for sale, with a brief factual description, in addition to larger spreads for more distinctive and striking properties for sale that we think may be of interest to readers.  It also has sections on interior design, home improvements, gardening, antiques, etc.  It has been an important forum for informing readers of the types and costs of properties available for sale, along with additional advertising from furniture and home interior companies, DIY and gardening businesses, etc.<br\/><br\/>Advertising in the property section was an important and valued source of revenue during the Celtic tiger years - as it was before and still is - but it is important to stress that advertisers did not seek to influence the editorial policy of the newspaper, and the fact that such advertising was an important source of revenue certainly did not hinder our warnings over several years about the dangers of a financial crash.  In my entire time as editor of this family-owned company, the owners never once sought to interfere editorially.  The family has been publishing newspapers since the 1800s and I am in the privileged position of being the beneficiary of its strong belief in editorial independence.  That is important in the context of what the committee is seeking to establish with regard to the media during the period in question.<br\/><br\/>During that time, our property-related coverage reported factual information such as rising property prices, ESRI and Central Bank reports, pronouncements of leaders in their fields and Government-related interventions in the property market.  Although many of the articles published during this period mirrored the widely held view of the majority of commentators at the time - in particular, a prediction of a soft landing - it was not all one-way traffic.  Many articles containing opinion contrary to the prevailing view of the property market were also published in our newspaper.  As far back as 1999, we reported on spiralling house prices and warnings from the then Governor of the Central Bank, Maurice O&rsquo;Connell, that banks were &quot;lending too much money too easily&quot;.  A year before Morgan Kelly warned in 2006 of an imminent crash, the historian Ryle Dwyer wrote a column for the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>headlined &quot;Why the housing boom could collapse like a ton of bricks.&quot;  In his article, he wrote &quot;The threat posed ... is patently obvious, yet it is being largely ignored, even though it threatens the social, financial and political fabric of society.&quot;  Warning consistently over many years, he drew parallels with the speculative property boom that caused the economic collapse of Japan.  He further stated &quot;Is anyone so foolish as to think that what happened in Japan couldn't happen here?&quot;.  That was in February 2005, over three and a half years before the State&rsquo;s guarantee of the banks and almost six years before the bailout by the troika.  Between Maurice O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s warning in 1999 and Ryle Dwyer&rsquo;s in 2005, we published many articles, including editorial commentary, which questioned the viability of the boom, and particularly the danger to the economy posed by the property bubble.  In 2004, we asked whether the glowing economic predictions of the time were based on sound financial principles, on the speculation bubble or on overly optimistic aspirations.  I have supplied the committee with some sample editorial coverage of these warnings over the years.<br\/><br\/>With regard to the contribution of the media to public understanding and debate around fiscal budgetary policies and their applications, in addressing this section I wish to restrict my response to the newspaper for which I have responsibility and knowledge rather than presenting a critique of the media generally.  During the period covered here, the investigative eye of the newspaper was trained on those ultimately responsible for the fiscal and budgetary policies of the State, namely the Government.  Critical analyses of the policies of the Government formed part of the opinion editorials of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>during the property boom.  As referred to earlier, the threats of rapidly increasing house prices and a failure to put on the brakes were published in the newspaper as early as 1999 and continued throughout the boom years.  There was no change of editorial policy during those years.  Our approach as a newspaper has been to accurately report the news and comment objectively on the facts as far as they were available to us.  Alongside that, I continued our long-standing tradition of providing a platform to all shades of opinion, including those with which I might have strongly disagreed.<br\/><br\/>Much of the information on the causes of the crash that have subsequently come to light as a result of various reports and the work of this inquiry to date were not only not in the public domain in the lead up to the banking crisis but were inaccessible to us.  Our reporting was influenced by the information available to us.  We had articles, editorials, columnists and commentators who, as the Celtic tiger roared, argued, in effect, that it was out of control and would end in tears.  They argued that there was something fundamentally wrong with the fact that somebody on a &euro;40,000 salary was eligible for a &euro;400,000 loan to buy a house.  Nevertheless, the predominant public sentiment in political, financial and property circles was that at worst the boom was going to end with that oft-quoted soft landing.  That predominant sentiment found its reflection in media coverage of the time in our newspaper and everywhere else.<br\/><br\/>A daily national newspaper such as ours is necessarily general in nature, with a mix of news, sport, business and features between its covers.  We are not a <i>Financial Times<\/i>or a <i>Wall Street Journal<\/i>staffed by a big team of financial forensic experts.  We are reliant on agents of the State to be competent, professional, open, honest and reliable in what they do and say, and then we report on that.  Our reporting on the economy during the period in question was as balanced, diverse and well informed as was possible given the information available to us, which was not all of the information available to various agents of the State.  If we were guilty of anything - and I believe we were - it is that we believed and accepted that institutions such as the financial regulatory authorities were doing their jobs and doing them competently, with due diligence, appropriate compliance policies and proper political and departmental oversight, all of which we believed were designed to ensure the stability of our economy.  From what we know as a result of the Honohan, Regling-Watson and Nyberg reports and the contributions of others to this inquiry, it appears to be obvious that our trust in these various arms and agents of the State was, to say the least, misplaced.<br\/><br\/>I acknowledge that there was insufficient critique of the frequent claims that there would be no crash and our so-called economic miracle would continue to be an example to the world.  We should have more rigorously challenged the predictions of analysts and economists, including those who contributed to our newspaper and those who had direct or indirect associations with financial institutions.<\/p><p>While this is an accusation that could be levelled at many editors and publishers throughout the world, much better resourced than my own organisation, it remains a matter of personal regret.  That said, it is with the benefit of hindsight which has been conveniently available to an earlier witness, Dr. Julien Mercille, but not to those of us living and working here at the time.  Even if we had been more questioning of the positive analysis and predictions for the economy and if we had even more contrarian voices to highlight, I doubt very much that it would have gone any meaningful way towards preventing the property bubble or the crash.  We still would have been unable to find out the true state of banks and their own regulation and we would still have been faced with an alignment of authority in the form of the IMF, the ECB, the European Commission, the international credit agencies, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance, the Central Bank and the ESRI who were all of the view that our economic fundamentals were sound with the IMF giving Ireland a clean bill of health as late as 2006-2007.  It is difficult to envisage how any media organisation could effectively challenge such a formidable consensus.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#HH00500","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tim Vaughan","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":572,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Vaughan.

I was the CEO of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>from October 2002 to June 2010 when I was appointed group chief executive of the then holding company of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>, Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited.  I was not the CEO of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>for the period from July 2010 until October 2011 at which stage I resumed that role in addition to my other responsibilities.<br\/><br\/>As the committee will be aware, the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>is a daily morning, mid-market newspaper, produced six days per week which circulates in broadsheet format in the Republic of Ireland generally but its core area of circulation is in the Cork and Munster region particularly.  In addition, the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>has an established increasing online presence now but in the period 2002 to 2007 all of this was in its infancy and, as such, was being established.  The <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>had no online property business in that period but had associated companies under the then parent company Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited, called Recruit Ireland Limited, a recruitment support company, and <i>breakingnews.ie<\/i>, an online news publisher and contents indicator to third parties.  Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited also had an online motoring site, called <i>motornet<\/i>.  <br\/><br\/>I wish to address the areas on which the committee has asked me to comment, namely, business model and sources of revenue.  As CEO of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>I have the task and pleasure of leading a great team of people who are responsible for producing, publishing and administering the best possible newspaper we can six days per week, 52 week per year.  I had eight direct senior management reportees at the time for the following role-functions: advertising sales, circulation sales, distribution and administration, editorial, finance, human resources, marketing, and production and IT.<br\/><br\/>Mr. Tim Vaughan has been the editor of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>since 2001 and is a highly regarded and experienced journalist and editor.  Mr. Vaughan has responsibility for all editorial matters pertaining to the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>and his brief is to continue, as his predecessors did, to produce the best possible newspaper he can for our readers.  The brief of the editor and the board continues to be to publish as he views appropriate without fear or favour.  While he must be aware of influencers, given the nature of his role he has to remain steadfastly independent of such influences for purposes of editing the newspaper.  This has been the philosophy of the Crosbie family as handed down from generation to generation and remains the ethos of the newspaper to today.<br\/><br\/>The second item is the importance of property related revenues within the overall revenue mix.  In common with most, if not all, quality newspapers, the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>has two main income streams, the first from circulation sales in the form of cover price and the second from advertising sales.  Circulation revenue is the mainstay of the revenue base but increasingly advertising revenue has become and remains vital, more particularly since 2007 when newspaper circulation volumes declined.  The ratio of advertising to circulation revenue in the period averaged 60:40.  <br\/><br\/>In any newspaper the key advertising sectors are to a greater or lesser extent property, recruitment, classifieds and run of paper.  Run of paper advertising typically is the larger display type advertisements often used by retailers, telecommunications companies and motor dealers <i>et al.<\/i>Increasingly today digital advertising revenues are becoming more important but in the reference period they were insignificant.  The <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>published a commercial section every Thursday within the newspaper for many years, including the period 2002 to 2007.  It also published a residential property section from the mid-1980s, which moved to a stand-alone publication on a Saturday from the mid-1990s, given the high level of home ownership in Ireland, relative to the rest of Europe, and the ever-increasing interest in property, furniture and interiors that the Irish population displays.  Advertising revenue is of vital importance to fund the current 300 jobs in the <i>Irish Examiner <\/i>and the continuing role of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>and the wider industry, so sales from all sectors is a critical success factor for newspapers.<br\/><br\/>Property advertising in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>is in relative terms as important today as it was at the height of the Celtic tiger but so are recruitment revenues, retail sector revenues and all advertising sector sales.  However, in the period 2002 to 2007 property advertising was consistent and strong.  Having said that, it reflected only a small but important percentage of our overall revenues in the period.  While it represented a greater percentage of our advertising revenues, internally we accorded it no greater importance over any of our other advertising sales sectors or over our circulation revenues.  To illustrate the point, we tend to allocate the same headcount and editorial space to property in our publications today in 2015, as we did at the height of the market in 2007.<br\/><br\/>The third point is the engagement in property related commercial activity.  In 2006 the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>moved from Academy Street in Cork to new rented headquarters in Lapp's Quay, Cork.  The Academy Street building housed a 35-year old printing press that was no longer fit for purpose.  This printing press had no commercial utility or value.  It was therefore decided to sell this building, leaving the old printing press <i>in situ <\/i>for economic reasons and to move to a more modern office block in the city.  Printing was then outsourced.  It is also worth remembering that work practices were changing in the industry and, in particular, that it had become increasingly difficult to operate the type of scaled printing and distribution business we had from the premises in the centre of Cork city.  The Academy Street building which was owned by the company for more than 150 years was sold for approximately &euro;40 million.  This transaction was not unique and it followed a similar pattern of other newspapers, both here and abroad, who moved from city centre locations to new locations and-or who outsourced their printing. <br\/><br\/>In a separate property transaction around this time another city centre premises owned by the company, the <i>Irish Examiner, <\/i>which was used in the business as a parking garage and store for newsprint was sold for approximately &euro;2 million.  These are the only property related transactions of any significance that I am aware of that the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>participated in during this period.  I was not involved in any way in these decisions which I understand were based on commercial considerations rather than on speculation in the property market.  These matters were negotiated at a holding company level at Thomas Crosbie Holdings Limited at the time. <br\/><br\/>The fourth point is the relationship between the editorial and sales functions.  There is a clear distinction between editorial and the sales functions of the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>as referred to in section 1 and as fostered at management level by the management team and myself.  The concept of editorial independence is fostered by everybody in the company and is well understood in our marketplace.  However, editors today must have a commercial sharpness and awareness to ensure the best opportunity for their newspapers which is why they can prosper.  By way of example, this is practised in the <i>Irish Examiner<\/i>by: the editor ensuring that there is timely and adequate communication, where relevant, to the circulation and advertising managers of his planned editorial activities to ensure there is the best possible opportunity to maximise the sale of newspapers and, where relevant and appropriate, the sale of advertising; and similar communications with the marketing managers so that appropriate in-paper signposting and, where appropriate, advertising slots can be purchased on radio and television.  While the commercial side of the house will never dictate editorial policy we, like most newspapers worldwide, produce commercial supplements and features which are advertising led and are clearly labelled as such to ensure that no confusion arises in relation to their origins.<br\/><br\/>We have also published specifically themed editorial booklets covering topics as divergent as suicide, infertility and eating disorders.  While these are open to sponsorship and advertising, editorial content is sacrosanct and cannot be influenced.  The suicide booklet was produced without advertising or sponsorship at a financial loss but we published it in order to provide a public service as neither the HSE nor any other State agency had published anything like it despite the huge numbers dying by suicide.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/BIJ2015032500002#KK00300","nonspeaker":"Mr. Tom Murphy"},{"type":"speech","time":1427241600,"counter":574,"content":"<p>I thank Mr. Murphy.

I imagine if Mr. Vaughan walks down St. Patrick's Street in Cork tomorrow and he is leisurely, he could meet four people, for example, a reader of the newspaper, a purchaser of the newspaper, an advertiser of the newspaper or, dare I say it, a politician.  If he stopped and spoke to the four of them, I have no doubt that the conversation would inevitably go to something that was in the newspaper that day, that week, that month or whatever.<\/p> <p>  Our view is that we engage.  Cork is rather different place to live and work in than Dublin, for example, in terms of population size and the size of the city.  We interact with people on an ongoing basis.  It is rather difficult to avoid.  I suspect Deputy McGrath knows that himself.  Any one of those people could be an influencer, if that is the correct terminology.<\/p> <p>  For example, I might meet an estate agent.  That person may say to me that he would love to get an iconic property featured in the weekend supplement but cannot.  That is not a complaint or editorial influence in any way.  It is a matter of a person trying to advantage his client in some way.  However, the editor might be of the view that the newspaper covered the next-door property two months previously.  He may have no interest because he may be of the view that there is nothing particularly iconic about the property.  A motor dealer could be in the same situation.  He may say to the editor that he wants to get his new marque reviewed by the newspaper motoring correspondent but that he has be unable to do so.

Based on the testimony of other witnesses and evidence laid before the inquiry, there seems to be a general acceptance that Ireland is a house-purchasing nation.  Before, during and after the crisis, we continued to be a nation in which the most desirable type of accommodation for the majority of people was a purchased home.  During the 2002 to 2007 period we saw massive increases in the cost of homes, with properties that once cost two to three times the average industrial wage going up to eight or nine times that wage.  Property affordability was such that mortgage terms grew from an average of 20 to 35 years and so forth.

The reason I considered it important to insert the provision in this section or to generate a debate on it was that while it might be in conflict with the Bill it certainly is not in conflict with the Labour Women in 2012, when this was originally going through.  The National Women's Council of Ireland, NWCI, had an amendment at its conference stating that seven years of age was too young and the social welfare Bill should not provide for that.  I will quote from what the Labour Women said:<blockquote><br \/><br \/>I want to start by saying that seven is too young for any child to be left alone without the supervision of his or her parent or another responsible adult.  I commend Frances Byrne and OPEN for their campaign which has highlighted the reduction in age limit of the youngest child of families in receipt of the one-parent family payment and the effect this could have on single parent families, the majority of whom are headed by women and 40% of whom are at risk of poverty.  OPEN's campaign has rightly focused on the lack of affordable after-school child care available to families in Ireland, and the provision of which would allow more parents to work, as most have expressed a wish to do.<\/blockquote>The statement finished by saying:<blockquote>I believe that working together with the Minister towards something on which we are all agreed in principle is more likely to succeed than calling for removal of the section of the Act that is already going ahead.  I know that OPEN and the NWCI have expressed concerns regarding the practicality of introducing adequate child care provisions in such a short timeframe.  Of course, the flip side to demanding the provisions is to hold the Minister to her promise not to proceed with the cuts if the provisions are not in place.  I believe we should support this approach as the NWCI does...<\/blockquote>That was from the Labour Women, and 15 women signed it.<\/p><p>While the amendment is in conflict with the Bill, the provision should not be in the Bill.  We should not cut one-parent family payments when children reach the age of seven.  The Labour Party members should hang their heads in shame.  This is what they issued at the time.  It was a smokescreen to get what they wanted in 2013.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#B00700","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":884,"content":"<p>Amendment No. 1, which Deputy Collins mentioned, proposes that the provisions pertaining to sections 4, 5 and 6 would not proceed without the introduction of adequate affordable child care provision and would be reviewed within six months of the enactment of the Bill.

The amendment seeks to change section 1.  It represents a final plea to the Minister.  We have been through the impact on working lone parents ad nauseam.  The changes that will start in May have no impact on non-working lone parents, but they will have an impact on working lone parents.  This appears to fly directly in the face of the Minister's stated intention to encourage lone parents to work.  The family income supplement, FIS, scheme encourages people to take up low paid employment because it makes them financially better off, but what is happening here will make working lone parents financially less well off.  It is no coincidence that the number of lone parents participating in the workforce has diminished considerably on the Minister's watch.<\/p> <p>  We have raised all of those issues with the Minister.  The nearest thing to an answer I can recall receiving is that people would be much better off because they can take up more work and qualify for the family income supplement, for which they would not have qualified up to now.  That presupposes that there is more work available or that they are in a position to take up more work with their child care responsibilities.<\/p> <p>  In conclusion, the Minister stated unequivocally in the D&aacute;il that she would not trigger this change until such time as we had a Scandinavian type system of child care in this country.

Perhaps one of the reasons there is a problem in recruiting additional staff is they are faced with a backlog and, therefore, a significant workload.  It is obvious that there are not enough posts, given the huge backlog of medical assessments in the case of all social welfare benefits, not just carer's allowance and disability allowance.  Some of the assessments are questionable, given that many of them have been overturned on appeal.  This also raises a question.<\/p><p>I do not oppose recruiting people on a contract basis to deal with a backlog.  Previously, there was a substantial backlog, for instance, in the social welfare appeals office and a number of social welfare inspectors were taken on using a specific contract to deal with the issue.  When the Department goes beyond this, however, and begins to use agency staff, it is adding a cost because most agencies charge a premium of between 15% and 20% on top of the remuneration of the recruits.  The experience in Britain of medical assessors is scary in the extreme.  Atos was a company investigated by the BBC &quot;Panorama&quot; programme a number of years ago.  The company set targets for medical assessors to drive down the number of people who could qualify for sickness and disability benefit.  At the time <i>The Guardian<\/i>reported that 32 people were dying every week as a result of being declared fit for work in the medium term.  People were being put under pressure to return to work or to at least sign off so as not to receive their disability or employment support payments.<\/p><p>I am not saying such a thing would happen here but it is a concern where profit is the motive, as is the case when one involves employment agencies.  This is a highly skilled job and anyone who has dealt with social welfare applications or appeals will understand the complexity of the system.  It can be very difficult for a person who sits behind a desk without seeing an applicant, but that sometimes happens.  Not all medical assessors see the individual applicant but have to rely on scribbles from a consultant, which no one can make head nor tail of, and not all the medical records are available to the assessor.  If there are vacancies, they should be filled through a public process in order that they are full-time positions.  They should be re-advertised unless they are for short-term, specific contracts to deal with a backlog in dealing with applications for social welfare payments or appeals.  I would, at the very least, delete two of the references to employment agencies in amendment No. 3.  I will bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to give effect to that if the Minister of State's amendment is accepted today.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#D01000","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":903,"content":"<p>I am against this amendment because if we need people to make medical assessments, they should be employed full-time.  We do not need agency people.  The reason we have a backlog is the moratorium.  Many Departments have massive backlogs because we are understaffed and that is having a detrimental effect on people who are awaiting decisions.  It is also having a detrimental effect on the quality of the decisions made because they are made on the basis of ticking a box and without any real concern for the human beings involved.  The way to deal with this is to recognise that we do not have enough staff in these areas and to take people on full-time and pay them properly, rather than using agency workers.<\/p> <p>  There is another aspect to this which concerns me.  I do not understand why amendments in the same sort of area, and to which we will come in a minute, have been ruled out of order.  They concern the basis on which we make adjudications where medical opinion is required.  If, as is often the case, a GP says a person is in need of full-time care or is not able to work, why do we have people second-guessing him or her?  The ultimate decisions are made by deciding officers who do not have any medical qualifications whatsoever and that is completely unacceptable.  The Government could save the cost of taking on agency people if it accepted the word of a GP.  If a GP says a person is in need of full-time care or is not able to work, that should be it - case closed.  The decisions could be made on that basis, but instead we have a huge backlog and people who are not qualified to make decisions are second-guessing medical professionals.  I assume they do so on the basis of looking to refuse people benefits to which medical professionals say they are entitled.  It is unacceptable that people should have to jump through hoops when they have medical testimony from their own GP to the effect that they should be entitled to medical benefits or supports.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#E00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":904,"content":"<p>I am opposed to this section and agree with the sentiments expressed so far.

Yesterday we heard about zero-hours contracts for Dunnes Stores workers, whose jobs have been eroded in the past 20 years.  If the people are there, why are they working in agencies and not going directly through public procurement to get jobs?  Will the Minister of State indicate the wages these medical assessors are earning?  Are they low paid or paid in line with average pay rates?  Rather than medical assessors waiting for work through an agency and having between 15% and 20% of their wages taken from them, surely they would be better getting permanent full-time work with a public administrator.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#E00300","speaker":"1193"},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":905,"content":"<p>Deputy Boyd Barrett said the onus should be put back onto the doctor, but if I was in a practice I would not like the onus put on me solely.

This would not be, I hope, an option for a person working on contract for the State.  I understand the need for short term contracts to get us over the hump of the current backlog in the system but I do not understand the State long term investing time and effort in training people who when their contracts have expired move on to other employment.  I know there is no guarantee that a person who receives this training and takes up a job will not at some point move on to more lucrative employment but one at least has some inkling that they have an interest in staying on for the longer term.

The Minister of State should consider that if he takes the point.

Surely it would be better to have one or two at the front line to explain to people when they come in to make a claim what exactly is needed for that claim.  I am not suggesting the Department should tell people to go to a GP and tell the GP what they need to hear.  I do not believe GPs put down what people ask them.

In fact I am dealing with several cases at the moment where the doctor has said unequivocally that the person needs full-time care and attention and that the person will never work again.

In more than 50% of the cases these people will succeed.  It is a terrible process.

We will deal with this issue when discussing the section because we will still be able to argue these points then.  My point is setting aside the moral arguments we could make when dealing with the section.  Applying to amendment No. 5 the same logic applied to amendment No. 4 is preposterous.  How could it possibly represent an additional charge on the State if the legislation states one must comply and given that we do not second-guess diagnoses, as the Minister just said?  One either fits the medical criteria or one does not.  It is on that basis that people are deemed to be eligible.  Therefore, how on earth could the making of the decision on eligibility by a general practitioner, rather than a deciding officer, involve an extra charge on the State?  Either one fits the criteria or one does not.

I have considerable sympathy for Deputies who take the time and make an effort to put amendments together that are then ruled out of order.  I have challenged such rulings and asked at the Constitutional Convention that the section in the Constitution used to prevent us from making progressive proposals be removed.  If this were done, we could make positive proposals in the future.<\/p> <p>  There are problems with the section.  Deputy Joan Collins&rsquo;s amendment sought to remove lines 15 to 17, inclusive.  There is a reference to full-time care for 12 months, but there are times when somebody does not need it for 12 months.  Let me give an example.  A friend of mine is awaiting a hip operation.  Since he has been waiting so long, he is now confined to a wheelchair.  He was told his operation would be carried out in six months.  One could get on with this, but six months can become one year and possibly be two years by the time one is seen.  As the second hip is now affected, the man in question is confined to a wheelchair.  His bathroom and bedroom are upstairs and he lives alone.  He has no access to a carer and this legislation will prevent him from having one for a short period.  We need to think about this.  I am not suggesting the measure be ruled out, but there are times when care might be needed for less than 12 months.<\/p><p>It will probably cost the State more if that person's mental and physical health deteriorates because he or she does not have care.  The person in need of care may have relatives, neighbours or friends but they may not be available 24 hours a day.  This has caused problems in that instance and in other instances.  That is why I would be concerned if it is confined to 12 consecutive months.  We need to reflect the fact that other occasions arise.<\/p><p> I have a second point about this section.  I refer to the proposal from FLAC that the section of the Bill in its entirety should be deleted.  In the view of FLAC, the section is changing the original intention of the Bill by providing that the presumption is that the applicant is ineligible rather than the presumption that the applicant is eligible, as was the case previously.  It has gone from a positive to a negative.  The Department's reading of this section is that it is a negative and I do not think this was the intention.  It was presented to the committee as if it was a clarification to ensure that the decisions on carers in particular had a full standing in law.  <\/p><p> The Minister may have read the submission from FLAC and the Northside Community Law and Mediation Service which co-sponsored the FLAC proposal.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#H03100","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":959,"content":"<p>I take the point about the time period.

I was in touch with the Department only yesterday regarding a case of a carer's allowance application which went through the initial process and the review.  Both were unsuccessful and ultimately succeeded on appeal.  I was attempting to ascertain from the Department to whom we should send a cheque because the unfortunate person being cared for has died in the meantime.<\/p> <p>  This section provides that for the first time in law - in so far as I am aware - it introduces a presumption.  It presumes that somebody who applies for a carer's allowance is not eligible for it, unless he or she proves otherwise.  I refer to the wording of the section 3(2) on page 5 which states, \"For the purpose of the definition of \"relevant person\", a person shall not be regarded as requiring full-time care and attention unless\".  It introduces for the first time a presumption and it puts that presumption firmly on the shoulders of the unfortunate applicant who has enough to do in many cases looking after the sick relative or whoever it is.  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh.  While I would like to think this was not intentional, I would like to think that nothing in the legislation would make it any more difficult to claim carer's allowance.  In so far as I can make out from the remainder of the section, the basic conditions are not altered but for some reason which is a mystery to me, this presumption is introduced.  We can argue about legalities and presumptions on one side or the other, but the only possible effect of this provision will be to make what is already a very difficult process, even more difficult.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#J00200","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":960,"content":"<p>I submitted these two amendments and I will revert to them on Report Stage because there is no doubt in my mind that this section involves a deliberate subtle or not so subtle attempt to tighten eligibility and entitlement for carers.  That is unacceptable.  What it is doing essentially is to retrospectively legislate for what has been happening in practice, which is a tightening up of decisions to grant - or to refuse, should I say - where there has been a sort of default position of refusing people who are then forced to go through even more hoops and appeals in order to get what they are seeking.  I can only assume this is in the hope that a significant portion of applicants would just give up and go away.  Up to now, the legislation was ambiguous and that ambiguity allowed deciding officers to refuse people who really should not have been refused.  However, this provision is shifting the balance towards the deciding officer to make it easier for the deciding officer to refuse people.  That is what is happening, it is to restrict the eligibility in terms of the 12 months.<\/p> <p>  What happens if a person gets cancer and he or she is undergoing a very intense treatment of chemotherapy and is not already in the best shape?  That person will need care for a temporary period that may not continue indefinitely if the treatment works.  This is not an unusual situation.  It may not be the case that this person will require care indefinitely beyond 12 months.  This may or may not be the case but most definitely full-time care will be required for six or eight months during treatment.  This provision will rule out such people.  Similarly, if people suffer a particular injury when they are old and infirm, generally, this would mean they would require full-time care for a particular period but maybe not for an indefinite period.  These people will be excluded.  That is wrong.<\/p> <p>  It is also wrong that we are shifting the balance away from medical professionals onto non-medical people with regard to the issue of making decisions about medical eligibility.  I refer to the statement in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill that the provision is to clarify that eligibility for these schemes is determined by a deciding officer on the basis of all information provided to support the applicant's claim, including all relevant medical evidence.  The deciding officer is making the decision.  Why would a deciding officer, a non-medical person, have any say at all on medical matters?  If the deciding officer is to have a say on other eligibility criteria, for example, other eligibility criteria such as means testing, that is fair enough because deciding officers may be qualified to do that.  However, that distinction has to be made.  There should be absolutely no question of non-medical people second guessing medical diagnosis.  Anything that does not clarify this is unacceptable and is allowing an ambiguity which ultimately translates into hardship and unfairness for people who have medical need.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#J00300","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":961,"content":"<p>The contributions are revisiting much of the same territory.

First, I ask the Minister of State  to consider the points made by some of he Deputies here on the 12 months issue because I can envisage situations arising where somebody would require full-time care for fewer than 12 months.  If there is a possibility to consider a measure, or to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage, which would allow for some flexibility in this regard, I ask the Minister of State to consider that.<\/p> <p>  Second, section 3, at the top of page 6, states that \"unless the person has such a disability that he or she requires ... (a) requires from another person ... (i) continual supervision and frequent assistance\".  When I first read that I thought I saw the word \"continuous\" but on re-reading it I saw the word \"continual\".  A dictionary definition of \"continual\" states that it means regular or frequent as opposed to continuous, which is uninterrupted in time or whatever.  I ask the Minister of State or his officials to indicate their intention in this regard because I can see a situation arising where deciding officers might read this and think \"continuous\" even though the legislation states \"continual\".

I believe that is the reference she asked about but I will check that further for the Deputy.<\/p> <p>  Deputy O'Dea said the situation is getting more difficult and referred to the number of people involved and so on.  The number in receipt of the carer's allowance payment in 2014 was 57,000.  In February 2015, the figure was approximately 60,000, which represents an increase of approximately 5.3%.  With respect to the long-term comparisons, the number of claims received in 2010 was 18,000, of which 8,700 were awarded, and the number of claims received in 2014 was 17,700, of which 12,500 were awarded.  The facts and the figures refute what the Deputy has said.

We have seen an increase of 21% from 2014 to 2016 in the number of people awarded the carer's benefit payment.  On the figures the Deputy requested, a substantial number of additional people were awarded benefit in 2014 over the number awarded benefit in 2010.  I do not what the percentage increase was but nearly 4,000 more applicants were awarded benefit in 2014 compared to 2010.  The Deputy may have individual examples but what he said does not stand up with regard to the figures.<\/p> <p>  In addition, there appears to be a misconception that this provision in some ways shifted the burden of proof from the Department to the claimant.  I think it was Deputy Boyd Barrett who made that point.  It has always been the case that the onus has been on the claimant, whether it be for the carer's allowance or any other social welfare payment, to provide the necessary information in support of his or her application in order to prove eligibility.  There has been no change in that regard.  That point has been raised in the House on numerous occasions, but there is a misconception in that respect.  There has been no change.<\/p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh also raised the issue in regard to his friend, and Deputy Ryan raised this use as well, with respect to the short-term carer's allowance.  The carer's allowance was never intended to provide temporary short-term care, it was always an allowance provided for long-term care.  That was the reason it was introduced.  Carer's allowance is intended to provide income support to full-time carer's on low incomes to maintain people in the community and to recognise the support and value of the role of carers.  The recipient of the care must be likely to require full-time care and attention for a period of 12 months.  That was always the case.  However, Deputies &Oacute; Snodaigh and Ryan have raised a good point, but that has been the design with regard to the carer's allowance.  I take on board what they have said and their experience in this respect.  I would have to reflect on that but it would not be part of this Bill because the carer's allowance has always been provided for long-term care, not for short-term care.  As to whether the latter would be dealt with under the HSE or within other areas of social protection, there may be some items covering that, and I will consider it further.  I would be interested in it, although I have not come across examples of that, but with regard to the examples the Deputies have given, I will consider this further.<\/p> <p>  With regard to the words \"continuous\" and \"continual\", the current wording is unchanged with respect to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act.

Unusually, the Department has built-in flexibility which ensures a person can work five days yet still receive a part payment or payment of jobseeker's allowance.  However, anomalies exist, particularly in regard to the one-parent family payment.  Let me explain by giving an example.  A constituent of mine receives the one-parent family payment.  When she got a job as a special needs assistant she received a payment of &euro;1,300 but &euro;600 was deducted from her one-payment family payment and the Revenue Commissioners took another &euro;600.  The net benefit she received for working as a special needs assistant was &euro;100 into her hand.  She eventually got her &euro;600 back from Revenue.  The difficulty is that most people cannot survive such a situation.  I refer to trying to survive on fresh air until their money is refunded.<\/p> <p>  Anomalies have been built into the system that have not been resolved and I shall give another example.  A standard deduction is made per day but if someone is offered work where their remuneration is less than the standard deduction they cannot avail of the offer.  In particular, people in receipt of the one-parent family payment only have the flexibility to go out to work during the middle of the day when their child is at school.  If a person gets the opportunity of an hour's work, which will  hopefully extend into something else, he or she cannot take the hour because he or she will be worse off financially.  <\/p> <p>  Specific barriers have been built into the system for casual work.  It is not just in regard to the one-parent family payment because the same problem arises with jobseeker's allowance.  I gave the example in the House during the Second Stage debate of an employer who wanted to employ someone for five days a week.  He or she could not do so on a part-time basis even though she was eminently qualified and hoped it would progress into a full-time job.  I hope it will do so in the next couple of months.  As the job was over five days the person would not take it but the employer has since been able to alter the hours but flexible employment is not always available.

We need to bend over backwards to facilitate people regardless of whether they are in receipt of one parent family payment or jobseeker's allowance.  There are stupid rules in the system that create barriers and that need to be taken out.<\/p> <p>  I will give another example.  A constituent in Boyle in County Roscommon was put on a training course in the local jobs club through the social welfare office.  There are 15 people on the course.  He did not go in on Thursday to sign for his jobseeker's allowance.  His payment was delayed for two days because he did not leave the course, go across the road, wait for whatever length of time he needed to wait and sign on.  Consider the disruption that would have been caused in the class if every one of the 15 people on that course went across the road.  There is no focus here on the education support if 15 people are going to cross the road to sign on the live register when it should be automatic.  If someone is attending the course, they should not have to sign on.  That type of link-up is not happening, which is discouraging people from actively participating in that course.  Any teacher will ask how they are to teach a class if there are 15 disruptions in it per week.  If some of those 15 people do not want to be there in the first place, it makes it even more difficult.  We have silly rules, we are not using technology and linking up with the various agencies and we are creating false barriers against people accessing and maximising training or accessing part-time work that would hopefully develop into full-time and long-term work. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#M00700","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":1028,"content":"<p>The Deputy gave an excellent example.

This will mean that lone parents providing full-time care to an adult will be treated in the same manner as lone parents caring for a child in respect of those for whom domiciliary care allowance is being paid.  It will also allow people who become lone parents for the first time and whose youngest child is between seven and 15 years of age to qualify for one parent family payment where they are also eligible for carer's allowance.

It is similar to the previous amendment in that it seeks to broaden the criteria for entitlement to the back-to-work family dividend to include those that cease to claim or be entitled to carer's allowance.  That is currently not provided for in the Bill and it has the potential to impose a charge on the Exchequer.  Therefore, the amendment must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 1563.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 11 in the name of Deputy O'Dea has been ruled out of order as a potential charge on the Exchequer.  Again, it is on the basis that it seeks to broaden the eligibility criteria for entitlement to the back-to-work family dividend to allow persons taking up work on a partial basis or those working in low-paid employment currently in receipt of jobseeker's benefit or jobseeker's allowance to benefit from the back-to-work family dividend incentive without losing access to their allowances.  The amendment has the potential to impose a charge on the Exchequer and therefore it must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 1563.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 12 in the name of Deputy O'Dea similarly has been ruled out of order on the basis that it is a potential charge on the Exchequer.  Again, it provides for the removal of the requirement that in any continuous period of unemployment a person must have been in receipt of jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance or a qualifying payment for not less than 312 days of unemployment.  Removing this requirement broadens the criteria for entitlement to the back-to-work family dividend and has the potential to impose a charge on the Exchequer and therefore the amendment must also be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 1563.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 13 in the name of Deputy O'Dea has also been ruled out of order as a potential charge on the Exchequer.  That is because it provides that a person would be entitled to the back-to-work family dividend even where that person's spouse, civil partner or cohabitant is in receipt of a range of social welfare benefits.  Removal of those conditions has the potential to impose a charge on the Exchequer and therefore the amendment must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 1563.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 14 has also been ruled out of order as a potential charge on the Exchequer because it provides for the extension of the maximum duration of two years for claiming the back-to-work family dividend for up to three years.  The amendment has the potential to impose a charge on the Exchequer and therefore the amendment must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 1563.<\/p> <p>  Amendments Nos. 15 and 16 have both been ruled out of order as a potential charge on the Exchequer.  The Bill currently provides that the rate of back-to-work family dividend payment would reduce by half after the first year of receipt.  The amendments seek to maintain the original rate of the dividend for a second year.  The amendments have the potential to impose a charge on the Exchequer and therefore the amendments must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 1563.<\/p> <p>  Amendment No. 17 has been ruled out of order as a potential charge on the Exchequer because it seeks to provide that children in receipt of social welfare payment in their own right would still be eligible for inclusion in the calculation of the dividend payment to their parents.  The amendment has the potential to impose a charge on the Exchequer and therefore the amendment must be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Order 1563.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#N02100","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427288700,"counter":1056,"content":"<p>Amendments Nos 10 to 17, inclusive, not moved.<\/p>"},{"type":"unspoken","time":1427288700,"counter":1057,"content":"<p>Question proposed: \"That section 6 stand part of the Bill\".<\/p>"},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":1058,"content":"<p>I have one contribution to make on the section.  It relates to a point I made earlier but I will not repeat it, which you also raised, Chairman, namely, what safety nets are being put in place to ensure that people do not fall through the cracks while in the transition from one set of payments to the other.  The family income supplement is of concern to me.  The Minister of State is aware that it can take anything up to three months to process a family income supplement, FIS, application.  By the time an individual is called for a meeting in an Intreo office, the options are outlined and he or she applies for the FIS, standard run-of-the-mill cases will go beyond the specified date in July.  However, bearing in mind that here will be an influx of cases to the FIS system on foot of the change, are the resources being put in place to ensure applications are addressed in a prompt manner?  What safety net will be put in place?  I refer to people moving from the one-parent family payment to the jobseeker's allowance in transition, as you mentioned previously, Chairman, or someone moving to the FIS.  Could the Minister of State give me an assurance that no one will be allowed to fall through the cracks in that regard?<\/p><p> This will cause hardship.  The difficulty is that once people are working they will not be eligible for supplementary welfare allowance.  This emergency safety net will not be there for them.  All of a sudden, they will have increased child care costs during the summer and a drop in their income.  For many people dependent on social welfare a delay of two or three days can cause huge hardship, never mind losing out on a payment for a number of weeks when they do not have the safety net of the supplementary welfare allowance.  Will the Minister of State at least ensure that at the very minimum anyone transitioning from the one-parent family payment will have an automatic entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance pending the resolution of the situation so people do not fall through the cracks?  If the Department does its job right the numbers involved should be very small and there should not be a huge cost to the Exchequer, but if it gets it wrong it will cause huge financial hardship for many families and many children who may be in very vulnerable households from a financial perspective.  Will the Minister of State give an assurance by stating that in these exceptional circumstances supplementary welfare allowance will be made available to rectify the situation even if a person is over the threshold?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#N02400","speaker":"1177","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":1060,"content":"<p>A significant amount of work and engagement has been done on this.

The tax situation of someone who transitions from one-parent family payment to the back-to-work dividend might improve because it is not a taxable payment whereas the one-parent family payment is taxable.

The loss of income percentages are fairly dramatic, at 18%, 14% and 11% for these three categories.

People are being asked to do something which should not really be required of them, particularly when one realises that An Post is, in some instances, the preferred service provider for the delivery of payments.

Apparently the law was changed to state that when the overpayment by the Department was the result of fraud, then the money involved could not be used for offsetting purposes.  It appears the legislation has been somewhat refined and that an offset can be refused when an overpayment is the result of fraud, as determined by a deciding officer or an appeals officer.  I do not carry a brief for those who commit fraud and I am of the view that those who defraud the social welfare system should be pursued to the ends of the earth.  Under the Bill before the House, a deciding officer is going to be able to decide whether somebody has committed fraud.  The latter is, of course, a serious criminal offence and I would imagine that determining whether fraud has been committed should be a matter for judge and jury.  In this instance, there will be a finding of fraud against someone if a deciding officer or an appeals officer consider that the overpayment relating to him or her was the result of fraud.<\/p> <p>  In many cases, where people have been deemed in the opinion of the Department to have committed fraud, they are not made aware of this.  They will receive letters stating that they have been overpaid and the various sections, etc. of Bills under which this has been determined will be listed.  However, such letters do not mention the fact that they are deemed to have committed fraud.  I am of the view that, from a constitutional point of view, this is very dangerous.  In the context of a person's ability to repay money he or she owes to the Department or his or her ability to clear a debt, that this should depend on the opinion of a single official, without any recourse for those involved and in circumstances where, in many instances, these people will not know what has actually been determined, is wrong.  As a result, I am of the view that the entire section should be revisited.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#P02800","speaker":"1059"},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":1102,"content":"<p>I support Deputy O'Dea in opposing the section and for the reasons he outlined  Those reasons were also highlighted by the Free Legal Advice Centres, which has been quite meticulous in terms of explaining why the section in the principal Act should be repealed.<\/p><p>It was wrong to introduce a provision in 2012 whereby a deduction of 15% may be taken from a person's social welfare payment without consent in order to make recovery of an overpayment.

That is why I tabled my amendment on this issue.

First, Deputy O'Dea, whether he realises it or not, has opened up a can of worms.  There is a case currently before the appeals office on the specific issue he raised.  When the Department official in that case was asked to explain at oral hearing why the office had found against the client, this person was unable to give an answer.  Deputy O'Dea spoke about reasons not being given in writing but, in this case, the official could not even give an answer orally.  The Deputy is 100% correct that this is not only illegal but probably unconstitutional.  I hope the Minister will confirm that sections 8 and 9 have no bearing on the case to which I referred that is currently before the appeals office.  I am very concerned that we should not be amending legislation before there is a determination in respect of that case.  These provisions should deal only with lump sum compensation payments.<\/p> <p>  Second, section 8 relates to circumstances where false or misleading statements have been given or there has been a wilful concealment of facts, in which case there is a liability on the individual concerned.  I am in possession of a letter issued by the State pension non-contributory section of the social welfare office in Sligo which contains false and misleading information.  Will the Minister ensure this letter, which was sent to old age pensioners, is withdrawn forthwith?  The false information it contains is the advice that it would be to the greater convenience of pensioners to switch their payment from the post office to a bank.  Such a move will, the letter states, provide them with easier access to their money, greater personal security and a time saving.<\/p> <p>  I do not know what planet people in the Department are living on, but the reality is that the banks in this country do not want personal customers to deal in cash.  While post offices are open and dealing in cash six days per week, one particular bank will only issue cash to customers on the Monday after the second Sunday of every second month.  There are no longer any tellers in many bank branches.  It is misleading for departmental officials to say there is greater convenience for an old age pensioner in having his or her money paid into a bank versus a post office.  The banks do not want these types of customers and are, in fact, actively discouraging them.  Even when a branch is open, there are certain days on which it will not issue cash to customers.  Departmental correspondence should clearly state that banks will only handle cash on certain days rather than telling people it would be more convenient for them to switch their payment from the post office to the bank.  Will the Minister give me an assurance today that this misleading letter will be withdrawn and everyone who has received it will now receive another letter clearly explaining that if they wish to continue to deal in cash, they should not have their State pension payment, contributory or non-contributory, made through a bank?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#Q00200","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":1105,"content":"<p>This is the third change over a series of Bills relating to arrangements for the repayment of moneys supposedly owed in respect of cases of fraud arising from the provision of misleading information or the concealment of facts.  FLAC has, once again, outlined the dangers associated with these provisions in its submission on the Bill.  What we must bear in mind is that an allegation is not fact.  If someone is involved in fraud, he or she should be charged with fraud.  I am dealing with a case where a woman is waiting for the Department to charge her with fraud.  In fact, she has asked to be charged in order that she can disprove the allegation that she misled the Department for the past 12 years.  This person has documentation from the Department which clearly shows it was, in fact, the other way around.  She is eager to be charged in order that she can clear her name.  In the meantime, her social welfare payment has been discontinued and she has been told she must repay the amount of the supposed fraud.  She does not, however, have the wherewithal or means to do so.<\/p> <p>  This is a woman who is adamant she has been upfront all along in her dealings with the Department and is determined to see the matter dealt with in court.  She took the time and effort to obtain her files under the freedom of information regime.  Strange things are evident in those files but not from her end.  They seem to have arisen for a very particular reason within the Department and go back ten years.  By contrast, where a person wishes to recover overpaid taxes, it is not possible to go back more than four years.  Even though the State has often wrongly withheld taxes from people, whether through an administrative error or otherwise, taxpayers are obliged to seek repayment within a four-year period or it is hard luck.  In the case of the Department of Social Protection, on the other hand, it is going back up to 30 years in some cases for repayments of often small amounts.  In one case I have seen, a woman was told in writing that she owed &euro;19.20 since February 2005 and was asked to pay it back at &euro;2 per week.  She said there was no problem about it and she would bring in the coins.  That did not happen in the end.  There must be fair procedure and some common sense in these matters.  The question arises as to whether a statute of limitations is applicable in such cases.  If one makes an allegation of fraud against someone, I presume there is a period within which that allegation must be put directly to the person concerned.  Will the Minister comment on that?<\/p> <p>  Since the recent change in the maximum applicable deduction for overpayment from &euro;2 per week to 15% of the payment, issues have arisen in respect of how that percentage is calculated.  In the case, for instance, of a separated woman who has an order for the payment of &euro;65 per week in maintenance from her former partner and who is making a 15% repayment, there is a significant difference in how much money she will end up with in her pocket every week depending on how the 15% deduction is calculated.  If it is calculated after the &euro;65 payment is subtracted from &euro;188, then she will come out with &euro;105, 15% of &euro;123 - what she receives once the maintenance payment is taken out - being &euro;18.  If, on the other hand, the 15% deduction is calculated on the full &euro;188 instead of &euro;123 and then the &euro;65 payment is taken out, she will end up with &euro;95.  In other words, she will be &euro;10 worse off.  No woman who is making a full declaration of maintenance should suffer a consequence based on the way the Department calculates these matters.  Such deductions should never be calculated in a penal way.  It should always be about leaving the person, who is in distressed circumstances, with as much money as possible.<\/p><p>The Department will still get its 15%-----<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#Q00300","speaker":"1028","continuing":true},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":1107,"content":"<p>The Deputy is providing too much detail that is not relevant to the section.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#R00200","speaker":"1010"},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":1108,"content":"<p>Believe it or not, it is relevant to the section because this section was introduced to recover at a level over the &euro;2 to 15%.

If the Deputy wishes to point out those specific glitches with individuals, I would be very happy to sit down with him and listen to those.<\/p> <p>  Section 342A was introduced in 2011 to deal with revised decisions which were made on the basis that the claimant made false or misleading statements or representations or wilfully concealed the facts.  It provides that where a revised decision is made and that decision results in an overpayment arising from the fraudulent claim of a social welfare payment, the person cannot be given the benefit of any alternative social welfare payment to which they may have been entitled during the period of the fraudulent overpayment.  Each claimant has the right to a review or appeal when the decisions are made by the Department.  In making a revised decision, the deciding officer must demonstrate how he or she arrived at that decision and what evidence was taken into account in coming to that decision.  Guidelines on the conditions that must be satisfied in the various schemes are published and are widely available to the public.  The purpose of section 8 is to clarify the operation of section 342A.<\/p> <p>  Section 8 provides that for the purposes of section 342A, an overpayment can relate to periods during which a social welfare payment has been made following a fraudulent claim or whether that period occurred before 29 June 2011, the date of enactment of section 342A, or after that date.  It is important that where a claimant has been overpaid, they know they have a responsibility to repay and the Department will take appropriate steps to obtain recovery.  A person who has been overpaid has a liability to refund the overpayment as that person has received money to which he or she is not entitled.<\/p> <p>  Like Deputy Willie O'Dea, no one in this room encourages or supports fraudulent social welfare claims.

There have been a handful of cases where there has been gross negligence on behalf of the HSE in relation to vulnerable children.  Previously, I have brought this issue up, both publicly and privately, with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and to date it is falling on deaf ears.<\/p> <p>  There are sensitivities in this regard.  If a child or someone who has just come of age falls into a substantial amount of money and there has been public discussions regarding a particular community in a particular part of the country, it is easy in a rural area to put two and two together and get four.  I refer to a small number of cases.  In these cases, if the abuse had happened in a State institution, there would not be any issue in relation to it but, because it happens with State neglect in the community, it has to be disclosed to the Department, it is known by the local social welfare inspectors and known in the local community, and it makes it much more difficult for that particular individual to move on and cope with the trauma.  Not only had they the abuse and the associated media controversy to deal with and cope with, but on top of that they must make this declaration to the Department and other agents of the State are now aware of it purely because the State neglected to act in an appropriate manner to protect that particular child in the first instance.  As I say, there are only a handful of persons involved here.  Surely there can be an amendment put into the Social Welfare Acts that where the HSE makes compensation payments in relation to its gross negligence regarding the protection of children who ended up in abusive situations, that, too, would be exempt the calculation.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/ED22015032500002#S00800","speaker":"1177"},{"type":"speech","time":1427288700,"counter":1140,"content":"<p>I will stop Deputy Naughten there, as he has raised the issue.

My presentation will focus in particular on the situation in Sierra Leone and Liberia where the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has the embassy in Freetown and a sub-office in Monrovia.  Committee members will be aware that since the onset of the outbreaks last year Ireland has been centrally engaged in providing support to the Ebola response.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, was the first European Minister - he was even the first politician - to visit Sierra Leone during the Ebola crisis.  When he met with President, Dr. Ernest Bai Koroma, the president remarked on his gesture of solidarity between Ireland and Sierra Leone.<\/p> <p>  To provide some context, just under 25,000 confirmed cases of Ebola have been reported globally.  The vast majority of the infections have been in Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia.  To date, a total of 10, 311 people have died.  Even more tragically, 505 of the deaths were of health workers.  I take the opportunity to pay tribute to those individuals today.  In many cases, local health professionals who have been at the front line of the crisis have lost their lives in trying to save the lives of others.<\/p> <p>  In terms of an update, Liberia is now close to eradicating Ebola, although the confirmed case from last Friday is definitely a setback and we are waiting to see to what extent that confirmed case has spread.  Even with Liberia being very close to the end of the outbreak, the situation in Sierra Leone and Guinea is still very serious.  We still have quite a high transmission rate in Sierra Leone.  We had a good drop at the beginning of this year, but in the past two months we have had a plateau.  We still have very serious challenges, although last week's numbers, which came out yesterday, were encouraging.  The key priority at this time is to ensure that the high level of resources that was finally built up - human, technical and material resources -are kept up in all three countries until the number of cases reaches zero.<\/p> <p>  Since the beginning of the Ebola outbreak, Ireland has provided more than &euro;18.5 million to the affected countries in west Africa, both directly and through NGOs.  We provided funding of more than &euro;6 million to assist with the construction of Ebola treatment facilities in both Sierra Leone and Liberia, as well as funding for activities such as contact tracing and social mobilisation.  This figure of &euro;6 million includes 42 tonnes of humanitarian stocks which were air-lifted to Sierra Leone and distributed to Ebola-affected households.  It also includes a contribution of &euro;1 million to the UN Ebola trust fund established by the UN Secretary General in September.<\/p> <p>  What I really want to stress here this morning is that Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the Ebola response is not only financial.  Ireland is one of only three EU member states with an embassy and aid programme in Sierra Leone.  We opened an Irish Aid office in 2005, and the office was upgraded to a full embassy in January of last year.  One could safely call that a baptism of fire.  Since the outbreak began in Sierra Leone in late May, the Irish embassy has played a key role in policy and co-ordination of the response.  As committee members will know, this outbreak was entirely unprecedented in global terms.  Frankly, for the first several weeks the governments and the international community had no idea what to do, but we hung in there, as Ireland, and we helped to try to figure it out in those very uncertain times in June, July and August.  In doing that we worked really closely with our colleagues both at headquarters and in missions such as Geneva, New York and Brussels to raise awareness of the enormous need for global support.<\/p> <p>  In our work on the ground, Ireland is leading on some key elements of the response, such as fleet management for ambulances, food supply and emergency nutrition.  I take this opportunity today to thank my colleagues in the embassy in Freetown, some of whom committee members have met, and also in the sub-office in Monrovia for making an enormous contribution during these difficult times.  The Government's team working on Ebola in west Africa is not just within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, we have been extremely fortunate since November to have 11 members of the Defence Forces in Sierra Leone, six individuals at various times who have worked within the embassy and five medical personnel working with the UK joint task force on Ebola.  It is my first experience of working closely with Defence Forces personnel and it is an amazing example of what a cross-governmental contribution on Ebola can achieve in a crisis situation.  I also thank the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence for that excellent collaboration.  One of the tasks of the Defence Forces personnel is to provide technical support to Concern and Goal.  I wish to highlight those organisations for the huge contribution they are making through running treatment centres and organising safe burials.  In combatting Ebola, they have really stepped up and entered into new areas where they previously had little expertise.<\/p><p>I am very proud of the way that these Irish organisations have managed to make a contribution under those circumstances.  They are joined by many other organisations with offices in Ireland such as Tr&oacute;caire, M&eacute;decins San Fronti&egrave;res, MSF, World Vision, Red Cross, Plan, Oxfam, Christian Aid and so on, all of which are making important contributions to the response.  The Irish team working on fighting Ebola in West Africa includes many individuals, some from the HSE and some from other organisations who have gone to volunteer for different organisations during the crisis.  While so many lives have been and continue to be lost through Ebola, we must remember that many lives have also been saved.  This is in no small park thanks to the perseverance of many individuals and I am very proud to say that a disproportionate number of these individuals have been Irish.  Through our people, as well as through our funds, we are helping to defeat the Ebola virus.<\/p><p> I would like to say a few words about the crucial role the Europe Union has played in mobilising &euro;1.2 billion in financial aid from member states and from the Commission and also in terms of political commitment and human resources.  Committee members may recall that at the outset of the crisis we had a huge challenge in mobilising international health personnel  because we did not have a medical evacuation facility.  The EU set up such a facility for international health workers and this went a long way to allay concerns of prospective volunteers and helped us to mobilise these resources.<\/p><p> The final point I would make is that the Ebola crisis is only one of the killers in these West African countries this year.  In Sierra Leone, for example, recent statistics predict that there will be a 20% increase in infant mortality due to Ebola.  It is not that 20% more children are dying from Ebola but they are dying because they cannot access the regular health care system due to Ebola and the impact it has had on health care system.  This is a 20% increase in infant mortality in a country where already one in five children dies before the age of five.  This is a crisis in itself, the secondary crisis that has been caused by Ebola.  The restoration and rehabilitation of the normal health systems is daunting but it is an absolutely urgent task.<\/p><p> In 2014  Ireland donated &euro;10 million to our annual development programmes in our partner countries and the primary focus of those programmes is health and nutrition and health systems strengthening.  I would also add that the secondary crisis in these countries goes far beyond the health system.  Colleagues will be aware that children have lost a whole year of school; farmers' incomes have plummeted perhaps by 50%; hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost, 180,000 in Sierra Leone, for example; and the economies the sub-region have taken a huge hit.  Irish Aid programming in both countries through 2015 will continue to focus on the response but also very much on these secondary impacts in areas such as food security, gender and health.  <\/p><p> Lessons will need to be drawn from the Ebola crisis to inform the ongoing development programming because key weaknesses have been exposed.  Importantly, the Ebola crisis has exposed significant governance challenges, including corruption, gaps in decentralisation processes, and now is the time for the governments of Sierra Leone and Liberia to make real progress on those issues and not go back to business as usual.  The good news from my perspective is that Ireland is committed to continuing to work in Sierra Leone and Liberia and will support those two countries in tackling those difficult systemic issues.  It will also continue to help with vital services in the short term in areas such as health and nutrition and in helping those countries to defeat the Ebola virus.<\/p><p> I thank the members very much for the opportunity to come in here this morning.  As the Chairman said, the media have moved on from coverage of the crisis but it has not ended.  I appreciate the members giving of their time this morning and I would be pleased to take any questions they may have.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015032500002#B00500","nonspeaker":"H.E.

The publication of the report was very timely because it reminds us that this has now been going on for a year, which is incredible.  The one point I would made with regard to the national governments is that I do not think we could ever have expected any national government, and certainly not governments as challenged in other areas provertywise as Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, to come up with any kind of robust response to this crisis.<\/p> <p> Even at the time last summer when this was all starting off we knew that an urban Ebola crisis at this scale has never happened before, so let us not have very high expectations that individual governments can respond in a robust way.  This is why in our lobbying we always focused very much on the international community gearing up, coming in and accompanying those countries in a very significant way, and we did not see that.  I think MSF is right.  It was right when it tried to raise the alarm about this last spring.  I know the WHO had an executive board meeting in January at which it asked what did this mean for it and one of the initiatives it has agreed is to do an independent evaluation, with no holes barred, and examine what it could do within its system.  We need to stick on this point because when the crisis is over and we start focusing on other things, it will be very easy to let these lessons slip.  Many of these lessons came up previously after the bird 'flu pandemic and we would say now that it is a pity we did not do anything about them then.

I am under terrible pressure as I have another meeting at 10.30 a.m.  It would be remiss of me not to welcome the ambassador and to thank her for her contribution.  For those of us who had travelled to Sierra Leone before the Ebola outbreak, it was clear it was a devastated country, the infrastructure was pathetic, it has emerged from a vicious and terrible war and it was a very difficult posting for any ambassador.  I know that Dr. Walsh was not ambassador at that time but we upgraded our representation.  The conditions at that time were deplorable.  We visited the hospitals and the feeding stations.  We would have an understanding of the culture where people are very closely knit, the very close relationship between mothers and babies and where in death it would be very difficult to hold back from expressing one's emotions.<\/p> <p>  The ambassador has made us as parliamentarians extremely proud.  It is proper that she mentioned the brave visit by the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, who went out there in the middle of the Ebola crisis.  The ambassador mentioned the Defence Forces, our voluntary agencies and the value of the work of Irish Aid.  I want to congratulate the ambassador on her role because of the importance of her presence in Sierra Leone and her dynamism, which we have seen as we have seen her in action.  I want her to pass on our best wishes to her staff.  I do not know the number of additional staff she now has but at that time this project was run by three women headed by ambassador.  For those who have not visited it, it is the most unbelievably difficult posting.  I hope her good services, as administered out there, will spread into the psyche of the two adjoining countries, Guinea and Liberia.<\/p><p>In view of the ambassador's praise for all of the agencies involved, it would be remiss of us not to applaud the excellent leadership she has shown on behalf of Ireland.

People were extremely complimentary about the work they are involved in there.  It is so unfortunate that Ebola struck just when matters were beginning to move in the right direction in the aftermath of the conflict.<\/p> <p>  I cannot but recall two of the visits we made while in Sierra Leone.  The first was to Sr. Mary, who works at a school which caters deaf children and those with special needs.  Of course, we were particularly struck by the effect of the threat of Ebola on the children involved.  The second visit was to a hospital where the little babies we saw all had wristbands which showed details of how their nutrition is improving.  Irish Aid must continue to provide assistance to projects of this nature and the money relating to them cannot be diverted to the fight against Ebola.  Any funding provided in respect of the latter must be additional in nature.<\/p> <p>  I am of the view that a class issue arises in the context of Ebola.  Certain classes of people in Sierra Leone were much more affected by the disease than others.  A number of particular traditions had an impact in terms of how the disease was originally tackled when the outbreak began.  We know this as a result of the work of the Liberia Solidarity Group.  If there had been more use of community organisations that understand the issues on the ground, the traditions surrounding the burial of the dead, etc., in both countries, then this could have prevented some of the deaths which occurred.  It was terrible that aid workers and so on from the West contracted Ebola as a result of what they were doing.  However, the level of care and assistance afforded to those one or two individuals when they were returned home was something else.  I completely agree that this is what should have been done but we cannot forget that thousands of people in Sierra Leone and Liberia were dying at the same time.  More people died than should have been the case, particularly if a more proactive and engaged response had been forthcoming in the context of getting protective gear and other emergency medical supplies to the region quickly.<\/p> <p>  Dr. Walsh referred to the other effects, including the fact that social engagement among people was brought to a halt.  People could not touch, kiss or hug one another.  It is these and other little things that are so important in the context of social engagement.<\/p> <p>  There is a view that some of the holding centres that were set up were designed as management centres for death rather than as treatment centres and that people did not believe it might be possible to recover from the disease.  The outbreak stopped when it reached Mali, Nigeria and Senegal.  Will Dr. Walsh indicate why this is the case?  What level of funding did the Governments of Sierra Leone and Liberia invest in tackling the crisis relating to Ebola?<\/p> <p>  Some weeks ago the Association of European Parliamentarians for Africa, AWEPA, had a meeting with the Chinese ambassador and he outlined the extent of China's involvement in assisting with the crisis.  China did not attract much publicity or acknowledgement in respect of its intervention and neither did Cuba in terms of its efforts in Sierra Leone or other countries in Africa.  As we acknowledge the Irish effort, we should also applaud those of China and Cuba because to date there has been no recognition of the work of either.  The Irish citizens who remained in both countries to continue their work are extremely brave.  I wish to acknowledge the fact that it must have been extremely difficult for them choose to stay.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015032500002#D00300","speaker":"1005"},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427277600,"counter":1179,"content":"<p>One does not necessarily want to single out individuals but I am very glad that Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned Sr. Mary Sweeney.  If there is any individual who deserves to be singled out, it is Sr. Mary because her work is absolutely extraordinary.<\/p> <p>  I wish to assure the committee that we received additional money in 2014 and again for this year just in respect of the fight against Ebola.  None of the money relating to the emergency nutrition and other programmes members saw in action in 2012 is less needed now than it was then.  If fact, it is required even more at this stage.  Fortunately, the Government has been able to provide additional funds.  Despite the challenges the economy continues to face, it was able to provide a rare and fairly significant increase in the budget relating to Sierra Leone and Liberia.  This did not happen in the context of countries to which we provide aid.  The additional funding in question was very much allocated in respect of the fight against Ebola.  Our annual budget for 2015 is &euro;13.5 million, up from &euro;9.8 million in 2014.<\/p> <p>  I really want to agree with the point in respect of community engagement.  I remain of the view that we are still not doing this enough in Sierra Leone.  It is one of the lessons to be learned from our work in Liberia but we are struggling to see how we might implement what we have learned in Sierra Leone.  Of course, we should have done it better from the very beginning.  Oxfam is pushing this point very hard.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and I attended an EU conference in Brussels a couple of weeks ago, Oxfam, the International Rescue Committee, IRC, and other organisations really highlighted the need for such engagement.  Looking back, and as already stated, this is one of the areas in respect of which we should have done a much better job.<\/p> <p>  On the holding centres, I believe we have turned the corner since December.  Everybody who contracts Ebola in Sierra Leone and Liberia receives the best quality care that is available.  We no longer have the type of holding centres to which Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan referred.  There are now high-quality treatment centres.  In the past, if people were unlucky they ended up on the original holding centres.  Fortunately, the enormous human rights implications relating to the latter are now behind us.  As already stated, Ireland is contributing to the maintenance of the newer type holding centres.<\/p> <p>  In the context of why the outbreaks in Mali and Senegal were contained, I return to the point I made earlier in reply to what the Chairman stated.  They were contained because there was a huge international response and this came about in a timely manner.  The latter was not the case in respect of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.  They were also contained because the health systems in Mali and Senegal are stronger and more developed.  These were in a position to absorb the international support on offer and move quite quickly to fight the disease.  I return to the fact that it is a question of what the international community needs to learn in order to ensure that this never happens again.<\/p> <p>  I completely agree with what Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said in respect of China and Cuba.  We must also give huge credit to the UK for its work in Sierra Leone and the US in the context of its efforts in Liberia.  The level of resources the UK and the US - as the two lead donors - have allocated in respect of those two countries is really extraordinary.  It has been a very good team effort and it has involved contributions from those countries to which the Deputy referred and which one might not necessarily think had access to so many supplementary resources.  The lead donors have also done a huge amount.<\/p> <p>  I hope I have covered all of the Deputy's points.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015032500002#D00400","nonspeaker":"H.E.

We know that they did not have a huge amount of such optional expenditure with which to play but they definitely made reallocations that made a difference.  The salaries of the additional health workers that were required, etc., were covered by government expenditure.  That is still happening.  Again, however, these are countries whose entire annual budgets are between &euro;500 million and &euro;700 million.  They can, therefore, only stretch their resources so far.

What can we do or what have we been doing?<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015032500002#D00700","speaker":"1026","continuing":true},{"type":"speechnospeaker","time":1427277600,"counter":1184,"content":"<p>I think we will probably understand the death rate much better in retrospect.  There have been death rates of up to 70%, as I mentioned.  We had that in July and August in Sierra Leone, particularly in Kenema, and much of it was because we did not have proper treatment centres.  We know there is no cure for ebola.  The important thing is hydration but, of course, it is very difficult to do that and do it quickly enough and so it goes back a lot to the logistics.  How quickly can an ambulance get to someone and how quickly can they get a bed?  I think that since December we have enough staffed beds and enough ambulances in Sierra Leone.  In Liberia we were at that stage, I would say, in late October.  As a result then we saw the death rate go down a lot.  We still do not really understand why we have some differences in death rates between the three countries.  Sierra Leone's death rate is actually quite good at the moment.  I think chances of survival are something like 63% at the moment which is very good but we do not really know why.  There are various factors.  At least we can say from the international side that on the clinical side we have enough labs, beds, and ambulances.  Now the challenge comes back to, as Deputy O'Sullivan said, community engagement and stopping the spread.  I think once we have someone we can give them the best, nationally possible, chance of survival so now it is about getting them in early enough because one of the biggest things leading to the high death rate is people just coming in too late.  I visited the Goal treatment centre in Port Loko in north Sierra Leone a couple of weeks ago and they said that that was their biggest problem.  They see people come in and they know it is already too late.<\/p> <p>     We have seen no mutation that we know of so far but time will tell.  We have read a lot, particularly in the international media, about mutation.  I think it is quite a popular topic.  At the moment the WHO are saying there is no evidence of that.  <\/p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's second question about women and children, yes, this is huge.  I think mortality rates for ebola are more or less equal.  Again, there are small differences between men and women.  Ebola mostly kills the most productive age group, as HIV often does, which, of course, has its own issues.  So children actually have a better chance of survival from ebola.  Under-30s have a better chance of survival from ebola.  Where we are losing so many children is in the secondary impact, the fact that people either do not have a health clinic to go to any more because maybe the health worker has died or they do have a health clinic but do not trust it because so many people have gone and caught ebola in the health system.  These are the challenges.  We know that Sierra Leone, before ebola, had the highest infant and maternal mortality rates in the world.  Ebola is making that even worse.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of what we are doing, I think Ireland's focus in Sierra Leone when it comes to the issue of child mortality is within the nutrition programme and this was long before ebola.  We are the main donor working on the nutrition of severely malnourished children and moderately malnourished children to prevent them from becoming severely malnourished.  We are working very closely with the government on the national nutrition programme.  That is the main thing we do on that.  <\/p> <p>  In terms of women, the Deputy referred to the protection agenda.  Our main focus on women's rights in both Sierra Leone and Liberia is on sexual and gender based violence.  Anecdotally we think we are seeing an increase of that during ebola.  We do not know why.  Maybe it is because people are not working or children are not in school.  We are certainly seeing an increase in teenage pregnancy.  We fund the only sexual assault response centres in the country.  There are three of those in Sierra Leone.  We have been the funder of those for the past 10 years.  Their numbers have gone up.  We are trying to figure out why and we are trying to give them more resources so that they can cope with the increased numbers. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/FOJ2015032500002#E00200","nonspeaker":"H.E.

The figures she has quoted for deaths and confirmed cases are alarming but the death of 505 healthcare workers must have had a devastating impact on the efforts to contain the disease.  How was that coped with and how were those people replaced?  It must have been particularly challenging.<\/p> <p>  On an optimistic note, the Ambassador mentioned the fact that Liberia is almost clear of ebola and that recent figures for Sierra Leone and Guinea were going in the right direction.

That was pre-ebola.  There were only 120 doctors in Sierra Leona of which 10% have died so that figure is lower again.  Many more nurses than doctors have died, partly because there were so few doctors around the country.  The situation was critical before and is now even more critical.  In terms of what we have done about it, frankly we have not resolved this and we will not be able to resolve it in the short-term because it will require a huge and long-term investment in training and systems, as it did pre-ebola.<\/p><p>It already required a huge and long-term investment in training and also in systems because one can send all sorts of Sierra Leoneans and Liberians for training courses, but then why would they not stay in Ireland, the UK and the US? This is what we find and that is human nature.  How then do we build up capacity for people to be trained in-country and also to work with within systems that function?  When someone is being trained they are very enthusiastic, then they come back and go to work and say \"I have all this training but I have no drugs, no equipment, no electricity and no water supply in my clinic.\"  So it comes back again to the longer term agenda of health system strengthening.  In Liberia for example we have a health sector fund.  This puts the Liberian government in the driving seat for these long-term system strengthening programmes.  Ireland is the lead donor to that fund.  That is the avenue we are using for Liberia to try and work with all the international partners to make the long-term plan.  Although our role is specifically about nutrition, for Sierra Leone we are very much trying to contribute to the new plans around this issue of human resources but also the broader issues around the system.<\/p><p> The committee asks how confident I am on this issue.  We still have lots of challenges in Sierra Leone but I believe it is on the right track.  Last week's numbers were encouraging, but I am still worried about Guinea.  We are not as involved there.  Its response is led by the French government and other international actors, but just the other day I believe that Guinea commemorated one year of having Ebola and it does not look like it is going away.  The numbers in Guinea never get as dramatic as those in Sierra Leone and Liberia, but its numbers never go down either.  That is a really big concern. <\/p><p> It is too early to tell how serious the governments are around these systemic issues.  We have had really good discussions with the governments in both countries, particularly in the lead-up to the Brussels EU conference.  One of the challenges is that we are really trying to focus, with the governments in Sierra Leone and Liberia, on  first of all getting to zero cases of Ebola - before we get too much into long-term recovery planning.  This is very difficult because that is urgent also.  But if we do not really nail Ebola then the countries will never be able to move further ahead.  The conversations are still at fairly early stages and it is too early to see the kinds of decisions and prioritisation the governments will make.  Of course they are very economically challenged.  Sierra Leone and Liberia have a lot of difficult decisions to make and we understand that.  We have said this, and Minister, Deputy Sherlock said it to President Koroma and President Sirleaf in Brussels in the plenary session and also in a bilateral meeting with President Koroma.  We are really looking at these issues of corruption in centralisation.  We say \"We are willing to support you, but we need to see your commitment\".

That is a very interesting question and it does not have a straight answer.  Ebola started in the remote rural areas because Ebola appears to be a disease that comes from interaction between humans and the natural environment in ways that, in the past, we have not been used to.  There are a lot of important issues around how we manage natural resources and forests.  Ebola in Congo, Uganda, Sierra Leone and Liberia really did come from that interaction of humans with forests in ways they did not previously have to interact - maybe people now are pushed into needing different resources due to other challenges, economic and otherwise.  That is one of the long-term issues we need to pay attention to.  Ebola started in the rural areas.  In some ways rural areas are very difficult to deal with because of the remoteness.  It is very hard to get social mobilisation and ambulances out to people.  The urban areas ended up being affected worse in some ways because of population density and the spread within the households.  That has been really challenging.  In both countries a lot of the big numbers were in Monrovia and Freetown because of the slum communities.  Ebola is all about two things: isolating people and burying people safely.  It is impossible to try to isolate someone where eight people live in a room in a slum in Freetown.  That leads us back to the response - \"Can we get an ambulance there within four hours rather than within 48 hours.\"  It is an interesting question.<\/p><p>I do not know if anybody has yet done any analysis of the numbers and whether urban or rural populations have been more disproportionately affected.  We will probably get all those details later.

We are sitting as the joint sub-committee on petitions.  We will record the decisions of the committee.  The committee has received a total of 134 petitions to date since the launch of the petitions system.  The secretariat has been examining them to establish admissibility of the petitions and to decide how best to progress a petition for consideration by the joint sub-committee.  Some 115 of the petitions received have been brought before the committee on at least one occasion.<\/p> <p>  Today we are considering five petitions, the first petition is No. P00024\/13, in respect of the recruitment policy in RTE.  The petitioner, Mr. Kevin Sharkey, is of the opinion that there is a policy in RTE, where the station employs only white people.  He states that in the past 20 years he is the only non-white person to successful gain employment as a television presenter with the station.  He would like to see a more diverse staff in RTE with the station hiring people for what they can do and not on the colour of their skin.  This petition came before the committee in February and March 2014 and the committee agreed to write to RTE for clarification and in turn to forward its reply to the petitioner for response.  The petition would have come before the committee again last year but we were awaiting the petitioner's response, which we received on 27 February 2015.<\/p> <p>  I will open the discussion to members for their comments.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015032500002#H00100","speaker":"1045"},{"type":"speech","time":1427299800,"counter":1203,"content":"<p>It is a fair observation and it is reasonable to say that we do not see many of the faces of the new communities and minorities in Irish society represented in RTE.  If the station is to be truly reflective of Irish society, we would want to see the situation improve.  I take the point made by RTE that it complies with equality legislation and tries to recruit people based on merit.  What springs to mind is the issue of gender quotas, although one wants to improve gender balance on the other hand, one wants to recruit on the basis of merit.  That is a reasonable response.  It is positive that the petitioner has said that since the petition was submitted and the committee has engaged with RTE, some improvement has been detected.  RTE seems to be saying that it will bear in mind the concerns of the petitioner and we could ask it to make a little extra effort and reach out more to the new communities by advertising posts in some of the newspapers that the new communities read, such as Metro or the Polish newspaper.  People in the new communities might not be aware of the post beings advertised and could be made aware of the jobs if they were advertised in the media they read.<\/p> <p>  I hope that RTE will bear in mind the general consideration.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/committeetakes\/NVJ2015032500002#H00200","speaker":"1003"},{"type":"speech","time":1427299800,"counter":1204,"content":"<p>We could ask RTE to include diversity and ethnic mixes in the next public service statement as that would ensure that RTE would put it into its corporate and  public service programmes as an objective.<\/p> <p>  Is that agreed?

The petitioner, Mr. Jim Connolly, is calling for an independent inquiry into the appointment of two senior planning inspectors to the board of An Bord Pleanala in January 2012.  He is claiming there was collusion by the chairman of An Bord Plean&aacute;la, senior officials of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, ICTU, IMPACT and a Government Minister to allow the appointments be made in the first place.  He is questioning how the appointments can be justified under the requirements of section 106 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 regarding appointments to the board.  He is of the opinion that the two officials could not have met the requirements of this section of the Act as planning and farming are poles apart.  He also notes other legal factors relevant to the appointment process, including the setting of precedents, which would allow the board to be entirely made up of its own employees.  This issue was discussed in 2008 by the Joint Committee on Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht with the Irish Rural Dwellers Association and the then Minister.  The Minister outlined the nominating and appointments process and stated that these had only recently been endorsed by the Oireachtas.
