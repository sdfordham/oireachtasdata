","asker":"1259","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":10,"content":"<p>JobBridge was introduced in July 2011 as a rapid response to the sharp increase in unemployment resulting from the unprecedented collapse in the economy.  Since then over 18,500 Host Organisations have provided internship opportunities to over 46,500 unemployed jobseekers.  Independent research indicates that circa 60% of jobseekers who participated in JobBridge progressed into paid employment within a short period (5 months) of completing the internship.<\/p>  <p>  The Department makes every effort to ensure that the positive impact of JobBridge is not diminished by any exploitation of the scheme.  There are a number of measures to minimise this risk and to respond to breaches of scheme conditionality.<\/p>  <p>  Potential Host Organisations must meet strict terms and conditions in order to participate in the scheme.  All applications are screened on receipt and those that fail to meet the requirements are rejected.<\/p>  <p>  A Standard Agreement outlining the key duties and hours of the internship placement along with the associated skills, knowledge and learning development to be acquired by the intern forms the kernel of the whole internship placement.  This must be agreed and signed by both the Host Organisation and intern at the outset of the internship, and should be available for inspection by Department staff.  Monthly compliance reports\/checks must be completed by the Host Organisation and submitted to the Department.<\/p>  <p>  To ensure that Host Organisations are abiding by the terms the scheme, the Department has a very robust monitoring regime.  This involves the regular review of monthly compliance reports and random monitoring visits to facilitate discussions with both parties to the internship. Over 12,500 monitoring visits have been conducted and 98% of these have been satisfactory.  In addition, the Department takes all complaints by interns extremely seriously and fully investigates them. Remedial action is always taken in cases of non-compliance.<\/p>  <p>  Investigations by Department staff found that the overwhelming majority of internships offered under JobBridge comply with the terms and conditions of the scheme.  In a small number of cases (86) the Department was of the view that non-compliance by certain organisations warranted a decision to debar them from further participation in the scheme, or to suspend them participation for varying durations depending on the nature of the transgression.  This represents less than 0.5% of Host Organisations participating in the scheme.<\/p>  <p>  As the scheme is voluntary (there is no obligation on a jobseeker to take up or remain in an Internship and there is no penalty for leaving an internship) and as the host organisations received no remuneration for their participation in the scheme the decisions were taken on an administrative basis by individual inspectors and the Host Organisations concerned had no recourse to challenge the decision or to seek a review by a central authority.  In such circumstances as the decisions to bar host organisations related to failure to comply with administrative rather than legal requirements and given that publication of a finding of non-compliance could have wider adverse consequences for a host organisation it was not intended that the names of the host organisations concerned would be published.<\/p>  <p>  A ruling from the Information Commissioner issued on 2nd of October 2015 (Ref. 150104) upheld the Department&rsquo;s decision not to disclose the names of the organisations concerned.  The Commissioner, inter alia, accepted the Department&rsquo;s position that as the decisions were taken on an administrative basis without recourse to notice or review or notice, and that as publication could result in adverse consequences for the organisations concerned (who did not have an opportunity to challenge the decision) it would be it would be improper to release the names.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has, however, since implemented revised procedures to place decisions to disbar host organisation on a more formal footing.  Key changes are that decisions are now made by a Compliance Officer in the central JobBridge Unit, rather than by individual inspectors in the field and communicated to all of the parties concerned.  This will ensure greater consistency and transparency in the decision-making process and will facilitate publication of host organisations names in cases where host organisations are barred from use of the scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600031#WRA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Departmental Schemes","counter":11,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600031#WRA00750"},{"type":"question","counter":12,"qnumday":3,"qnumall":"[8478\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600031#WRA00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the financial cost of restoring the telephone allowance, based on changed demographics and age profile.","asker":"1304","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":13,"content":"<p>The overall concern of Government in its Budgets has been to protect the primary social welfare rates.  Expenditure on pensions at approx. &euro;6.974 billion is the largest block of expenditure in the Department in the Estimate for 2016, representing approx. 35.5% of overall expenditure.  Because of demographic changes, the Department&rsquo;s spending on older people is increasing year on year.  The Department had to make provision for an additional &euro;84 million in 2016 for the increasing number of pensioners.  Maintaining the rate of the State pension and other core payments is critical in protecting people from poverty.<\/p>  <p>  The decision to discontinue the telephone allowance was estimated to provide annual savings of &euro;48 million.  These savings meant that the Department was able to retain the other valuable elements of the household benefits package such as the electricity and gas allowance and the television licence.  The Department will spend approximately &euro;227 million this year on these elements of the household benefits package for over 416,000 customers.<\/p>  <p>  The cost of the telephone allowance scheme had risen each year with the number of eligible customers also increasing significantly. In 2007 there were some 316,000 people receiving the telephone allowance compared to almost 396,000 at the end of September 2013, an increase of 25%, or an average increase of nearly 4% per annum.  Each year almost 10,000 extra customers became eligible for the allowance because of the increased number of pension recipients.<\/p>  <p>  I am keenly aware of the impact of Budget decisions on the Department&rsquo;s clients, and I have sought to ensure that the money available is targeted in the most effective way.  In Budget 2016, I was able to announce the first increase in the basic rate of the State pension in seven years, by &euro;3 per week.  This will increase the personal rate of the non-contributory pension to &euro;222, and that of the contributory pension to &euro;233.30.  I was also pleased to announce a &euro;2.50 increase in the rate of the Fuel Allowance, from &euro;20 to &euro;22.50 per week.  I believe that, taken together with other changes, such as increasing the Christmas Bonus to 75% of weekly rate, the impact of the last Budget has been very positive for older people.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600031#WRA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Free Travel Scheme Eligibility","counter":14,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600031#WRA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":15,"qnumday":4,"qnumall":"[8001\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600031#WRA01000","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to change the ruling where there is no entitlement to a companion pass under the carer's allowance scheme and the free travel scheme to allow the carer to travel free of charge with the caree in certain instances, especially where the caree is severely disabled, has a primary medical certificate and needs to attend hospital appointments in Dublin; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

","asker":"1254","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":37,"content":"<p>The State pension (contributory) is one of the State pension schemes, and its rate of payment is related to contributions made over years into the Social Insurance Fund.  As such, those with a stronger attachment to the workforce, who have paid more into that fund, are more likely to be paid under that scheme.  There are a number of criteria which must be satisfied in order to qualify for a State pension contributory.  These include that the person must be aged 66 or over, and that they have at least 520 paid contributions at class A, E, F, G, H, N or S, i.e., a minimum of 10 years of paid contributions.<\/p>  <p>  People with Class J contributions do not pay any contributions themselves, and their employer will generally make a contribution at a rate of 0.5%, essentially to cover occupational injuries benefit.  Class J normally relates to people with reckonable pay of less than &euro;38 per week (from all employments).  However, a small number of employees are insurable at Class J, no matter how much they earn, such as employees aged 66 or over or people in subsidiary employment.  This does not provide coverage for most contributory benefits, such as the State pension (contributory).  If a person who is now liable to pay PRSI Class J was previously eligible for or satisfies the criteria for credits then he\/she will receive those credits, and they may be of benefit in calculating the yearly average of that person when they reach pension age.  These contributions will not, however, count as paid contributions, of which a contributory pensioner requires a minimum of 520.<\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated people to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, those who qualify under the homemaker&rsquo;s scheme still need to fulfil the eligibility requirements for the pension, and have paid at least 520 contributions over the course of their working lives.<\/p>  <p>  It should be noted  where people do not qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600031#WRA02500","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Carer's Allowance Applications","counter":38,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600031#WRA02550"},{"type":"question","counter":39,"qnumday":12,"qnumall":"[8094\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600031#WRA02600","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of the review of the case of a person (details supplied) in County Kildare; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":40,"content":"<p>Carer's allowance (CA) is a means-tested social assistance payment, made to persons who are providing full-time care and attention to a person who has a disability such that they require that level of care.<\/p>  <p>  I confirm that the department received three applications for CA from the person concerned on 7 September 2015, 17 September 2015 and 4 November 2015 in respect of three care recipients.

The main purpose of the scheme is to provide immediate and flexible assistance for those in need who do not qualify for payment under other State schemes. SWA can consist of a basic primary weekly payment and\/or a weekly\/monthly supplement in respect of certain expenses a person may not be able to meet, including rent supplement.  It can also consist of a once-off payment to help with the cost of any exceptional needs.  <\/p>  <p>  Basic weekly SWA may be payable to anyone in the State who satisfies a habitual residence condition and a means test, has registered for employment, unless they have a physical or mental disability, and can prove unemployment, or anyone who is awaiting the outcome of a claim or an appeal for a primary social welfare payment.  The Government has provided some &euro;80 million for the basic SWA scheme in 2016.<\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The Government has provided &euro;267 million for rent supplement in 2016.  Under the new Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), the responsibility for the provision of rental assistance to those with a social housing need transfers from this Department to the local authorities.  HAP is being rolled out on an incremental basis and is currently available in 19 local authorities across the country. <\/p>  <p>  Where HAP is not in operation, in order to qualify for a rent supplement a person must have been residing in private rented accommodation or accommodation for homeless persons or an institution (or any combination of these) for a period of 183 days within the preceding 12 months of the date of claim for rent supplement.  A person may also qualify for rent supplement where an assessment of housing need has been carried out within the 12 months preceding the date of claim and the person is deemed by a local authority to be eligible for and in need of social housing support.  In all other cases, a new applicant who wishes to apply for rent supplement is referred, in the first instance, for an assessment of eligibility for social housing support by a housing authority.  Only when the person has been assessed as being eligible for and in need of social housing support, does the person become eligible for consideration for rent supplement.  Policy in relation to the assessment of housing need, including where a person&rsquo;s name remains on a mortgage, is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.<\/p>  <p>  Where a person&rsquo;s safety and well-being are at risk due to domestic violence, Department officials operating the rent supplement scheme have discretionary powers to expedite the award of a payment to the person in question.  <\/p>  <p>  This Department may also make a single exceptional needs payment (ENP) to help meet essential, once-off and unforeseen expenditure.  It is expected that the expenditure on the ENP scheme in 2016 will be in excess of &euro;30 million.  ENP&rsquo;s are payable at the discretion of the officers administering the scheme taking into account the requirements of the legislation and all the relevant circumstances of the case, including those in a domestic violence situation, in order to ensure that the payments target those most in need of assistance.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600032#WRB03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1033"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Pension Provisions","counter":83,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600033#WRC00200"},{"type":"question","counter":84,"qnumday":29,"qnumall":"[8193\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600033#WRC00300","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"to support a matter (details supplied) regarding pensions; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1359","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":85,"content":"<p><b><\/b>I am very aware of the issues arising and very negative consequences caused by the problems in the Irish Airlines (General Employees) Superannuation Scheme (IASS) for all active, deferred and pensioner members and appreciate the difficulties presented to all stakeholders in addressing the significant deficit in this scheme.

Since then over 18,500 Host Organisations have provided internship opportunities to over 46,500 unemployed jobseekers.<\/p><p>The aim of the scheme was to help unemployed people break the cycle whereby they could not get a job without experience but could not get experience without a job. It caters for a wide variety of jobseekers &ndash; those with no previous work experience and unemployed workers who might want to change career direction. Departmental records show that over 15,000 interns (36%) progressed <i>directly<\/i>into paid employment immediately following an internship and independent research indicates that this rises to circa 60% within a short period (5 months) of completing an internship.  This compares very favourably with similar schemes across the EU where the average rate is 34%.  The independent research also indicated that just 10% of participants rated the scheme negatively and that over two thirds of participants would recommend the scheme to a friend or family member.  <\/p><p>Potential Host Organisations are required to meet specified terms and conditions in order to participate in the scheme.  All applications are screened on receipt and those that fail to meet the requirements are rejected.  Reasons include ineligibility (e.g.  displacement, &ldquo;cooling-off&rdquo; period in place, requiring candidates to have experience, failure to meet the minimum number of paid employees required to be present or exceeding the quota permitted for the size of the organisation) or failure to supply all of the information (including in relation to the specific learning outcomes intended).<\/p><p>A total of 21,796 applications were rejected since 2012, as detailed in Table 1.  The Department does not have details of rejections prior to 2012 as these were issued via FAS.<\/p><p>JobBridge is entirely voluntary for both Host Organisations and participants and, as such, must appeal to both. In order to attract potential interns, host organisations must therefore provide opportunities that appeal to jobseekers. Jobseekers are not under any obligation to participate in JobBridge and those that commence an internship can finish their internship for any reason at any time with no penalty of any type.<\/p><p>JobBridge internships last for 6 or 9 months. Just under half (20,796) of all JobBridge internships finished early, almost half  of these (45%) to take up paid employment. A further 7% went on to further education, training or another internship. Circa 30% of participants left for a variety of personal, domestic or health reasons. Approximately 11%left early because they did not find the internship suitable. Given the nature of the scheme as a first chance opportunity for many people to experience employment the figure is not surprising. The Department continues to work with such jobseekers to support them with a range of alternative pathways to work.<\/p><p>The requirement for monitoring was introduced in January 2012.  A total of 12,711 monitoring visits were undertaken from 2012 to end 2015, as per Table 2.  98% of internships are found to be fully compliant with the terms and conditions of the scheme.<\/p><p>The Department takes all complaints about JobBridge very seriously and fully investigates any allegation of abuse or misuse of the scheme. A total of 672 complaints have been received since the scheme commenced, representing circa 1.4% of all internships. The Department does not distinguish between complaints made by interns and by others.  <\/p><p>As the scheme is voluntary (there is no obligation on a jobseeker to take up or remain in an Internship and there is no penalty for leaving an internship)  and as the host organisations received no remuneration for their participation in the scheme decisions to bar\/suspend  host organisations on the foot of complaints or inspection visits were  taken on an administrative basis by individual inspectors and the Host Organisations concerned had no recourse to challenge the decision or to seek a review by a central authority. In such circumstances as the decisions to bar host organisations related to failure to comply with administrative rather than legal requirements and given that publication of a finding of non-compliance could have wider adverse consequences for a host organisation it was not intended that the names of the host organisations concerned would be published. <\/p><p>A ruling from the Information Commissioner issued on 2nd of October 2015 (Ref. 150104) upheld the Department&rsquo;s decision not to disclose the names of the organisations concerned. The Commissioner, inter alia, accepted the Department&rsquo;s position that as the decisions were taken on an administrative basis without recourse to notice or review or notice, and that as publication could  result in adverse consequences for the organisations concerned (who did not have an opportunity to challenge the decision) it would be it would be improper to release the names.  <\/p><p>The Department has however, since implemented revised procedures to  place decisions to disbar host organisation on a more formal footing. Key changes are that decisions are now made by a Compliance Officer in the central JobBridge Unit, rather than by individual inspectors in the field and communicated to all of the parties concerned.

","asker":"1291","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":190,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 to 74, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The purpose of the redundancy payments scheme is to compensate workers for the loss of their jobs by reason of redundancy, as provided for under the Redundancy Payments Acts, Compensation is based on the worker&rsquo;s length of reckonable service and reckonable weekly remuneration, subject to a ceiling of &euro;600 per week.<\/p><p>It is the responsibility of the employer to pay statutory redundancy to its eligible employees.  Where an employer can prove to the satisfaction of the Department that it is unable to pay the statutory redundancy to its eligible employees, the Department will make lump sum payments directly to the eligible employees from the Social Insurance Fund (SIF).  Amounts paid under such circumstances are sought back from employers.  In addition where employers become insolvent, certain other outstanding statutory entitlements (arrears of wages, holiday pay etc.) may be paid from the SIF.  The Minister for Social Protection becomes a preferential creditor in the winding-up of companies in respect of monies paid from the SIF.<\/p><p>Under the provisions of Section 24(4) of the Social Welfare Act 1990 all moneys standing to the credit of the Redundancy and Employers&rsquo; Insolvency Fund on 30 April 1990 were transferred to the SIF on 1 May 1990.<\/p><p>The SIF was established by the Social Welfare Act 1952 (as amended) and operates under the terms of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act (SWCA) 2005.  Under section 9 of that Act the SIF comprises of a current account which is managed and controlled by the Minister for Social Protection and an investment account which is managed and controlled by the Minister for Finance.  The annual statutory accounts of the SIF are prepared in the form and manner approved by the Minister for Finance.  There is a separate account prepared for the current account and the investment account.  These accounts are audited by the C&amp;amp;AG and are laid on an annual basis before the Houses of the Oireachtas and are subject to PAC examination.<\/p><p>The income of the SIF derives mainly from Pay Related Social Insurance (PRSI) contributions.  In addition to redundancy payment entitlements, social insurance benefits and occupational injury benefits are paid out of the SIF.<\/p><p>SWCA 2005 allows for PRSI to be paid into either the investment account or the current account of the SIF.  It requires surplus funds in the current account not required for expenditure purposes to be transferred to the investment account for investment purposes.  In accordance with  section 9 (9) of SWCA 2005, the SIF has received a state subvention since 2010 in order to bridge the gap between its PRSI income and its social insurance related expenditure.  As at the 31 December 2015 the SIF had no surplus funds on hand. A table is attached which shows the SIF income and expenditure for the period 2006-2015.<\/p><p>Significant and increasing amounts were paid out in redundancy rebates to employers from the SIF during the economic crisis.  While the SIF is constituted primarily from employer contributions, the taxpayers&rsquo; contribution is also significant.  One of the factors which influenced the Government&rsquo;s decision in Budget 2013 to abolish the rebate was the increasing cost of rebates to often profitable companies.  I acknowledge the contribution made by these enterprises in the creation of employment.  However, the cost of making rebates is very significant and any consideration given to the provision of rebates for employers in the future must have regard to the overall budgetary parameters available.<\/p><p><b>SIF Income and Expenditure 2006-2015<\/b><table><tr><th>-<\/th><th>SIF Income<\/th><th>SIF Expenditure<\/th><th>Operating Surplus\/Deficit<\/th><th>Cumulative Surplus at end of year<\/th><th>Exchequer Subvention Requirement<\/th><\/tr><tr><td>Year <\/td><td>&euro;,000<\/td><td>&euro;,000<\/td><td>&euro;,000<\/td><td>&euro;,000<\/td><td>&euro;,000<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2006<\/td><td>6,974,411<\/td><td>6,325,554<\/td><td>648,857<\/td><td>3,049,141<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2007<\/td><td>7,834,147<\/td><td>7,250,990<\/td><td>583,157<\/td><td>3,632,298<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2008<\/td><td>8,144,410<\/td><td>8,399,739<\/td><td>(255,329)<\/td><td>3,376,969<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2009<\/td><td>7,297,601<\/td><td>9,784,225<\/td><td>(2,486,624)<\/td><td>890,345<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2010<\/td><td>6,709,681<\/td><td>9,460,835<\/td><td>(2,751,154)<\/td><td>1,477*<\/td><td>(1,862,286)**<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2011<\/td><td>7,543,883<\/td><td>9,004,245<\/td><td>(1,460,362)<\/td><td>1,477<\/td><td>(1,460,362)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2012<\/td><td>6,785,557<\/td><td>8,869,567<\/td><td>(2,084,010)<\/td><td>1,477<\/td><td>(2,084,010)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2013<\/td><td>7,317,505<\/td><td>8,631,635<\/td><td>(1,314,130)<\/td><td>1,477<\/td><td>(1,314,130)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2014<\/td><td>7,891,344  <\/td><td>8,433,142<\/td><td>(541,798)<\/td><td>1,477<\/td><td>(541,798)<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>2015<\/td><td>8,497,687<\/td><td>8,616,724<\/td><td>(119,037)<\/td><td>1,477<\/td><td>(119,037)***<\/td><\/tr><\/table><\/p><p><i>*The 2010-2015 cumulative surplus represents the book value of the Departments HQ premises vested in the Minister for Social Protection on behalf of the Fund.<\/i><\/p><p><i>** In this period Vote Subvention commenced in mid-2010.<\/i><\/p><p><i>*** The 2015 figures are provisional and are subject to audit by the C&amp;amp;AG.<\/i><\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600035#WRE02800","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Applications","counter":192,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600036#WRF00300"},{"type":"question","counter":193,"qnumday":75,"qnumall":"[8382\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600036#WRF00400","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an application by a person (details supplied) under the disability allowance scheme: and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1319","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":194,"content":"<p>I confirm that, on 21 October 2015, the department received an application from the person concerned for disability allowance (DA).

While the customer is on the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment this support is available and is not limited to the 12 month engagement that applies for other jobseekers from their one to one meeting.  <\/p>  <p>  Through the jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment, lone parents with children aged between 7 and 13 years are provided with a very long transition period of up to seven years within which to engage with the Department&rsquo;s Intreo service.  The aim of this broader support is to improve the individual&rsquo;s employment prospects. <\/p>  <p>  Former one-parent family payment recipients who moved to a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment i.e. those with a youngest child 14 year of age or older, are subject to the standard Intreo activation process.  Former one-parent family payment recipients who are not working and are on a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance payment will be invited to group engagement with a case officer followed by access to further supports in the same manner as all other jobseekers.  <\/p>  <p>  A new Activation Case Management system has recently been implemented across the Department&rsquo;s network of Intreo Centres.  It provides a sophisticated tool to the Department&rsquo;s case officers that supports the full activation process, includes intelligence gathering to inform policy and a suite of reports that allows the Department to analyse progression outcomes for our customers including the ability to track training referrals.  The system also records potential barriers to employment such as access to childcare, health issues etc. with a view to addressing these issues with the customer.  Most importantly for the one-parent family payment reforms, the new system includes processes for the activation of lone parents who are now jobseekers and allows the Department to identify and monitor these customers as a ring-fenced group, while treating each customer as an individual from an activation perspective.  Access to this more detailed information will inform any future developments of effective activation measures for lone parents that are required.<\/p>  <p>  The Department has also taken steps to include details of periods spent on jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment in the Jobseekers Longitudinal Database.  This will include information (where available) on jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment leavers&rsquo; entry to activation programmes, education\/training, and employment.  It will therefore be possible, over time, to report on trends in the destination of jobseeker&rsquo;s transitional payment leavers. <\/p>  <p>  The first indication of the outcome of the reforms has already been seen in the number of former OFP recipients who have become new FIS recipients.  Since the final phase of the reforms took place in July 2015 up to the end of December 2015, approximately 3,000 affected lone parents have become new family income supplement recipients.  This indicates that these customers entered or increased their employment as a result of the reforms.  These new recipients are also eligible for the back to work family dividend and gain an increase in their overall income when they transitioned from the one-parent family payment to the family income supplement and the back to work family dividend.  <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600036#WRF01700","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Education and Training Provision","counter":207,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600036#WRF01800"},{"type":"question","counter":208,"qnumday":80,"qnumall":"[8402\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600036#WRF01900","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"her plans to expand the access to job activation, training and education for jobseekers who do not qualify for the live register due to their spouse's or partner's income.","asker":"1358","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":209,"content":"<p>The key objective of activation policy and labour market initiatives is to offer assistance to those most in need of support in securing work and achieving financial self-sufficiency.

Persons who sign for credits for three months (78 days) of the last six months are eligible to participate in the JobBridge programme.  Persons signing on for credits for 12 months or longer over the previous 18 months are entitled to participate on Momentum courses through Solas, provided that they have been actively seeking work, however they will not receive any payment.  Persons signing for credits for six months or more are entitled to participate on ETB-run VTOS courses subject to availability.  In the case of VTOS courses, participants do not receive a training allowance but may receive travel and lunch allowances.

Therefore, it is important to ensure that those qualifying have made a sustained contribution to the Social Insurance Fund over their working lives.  To ensure that the individual can maximise their entitlement to a State pension, all contributions paid or credited over their working life from when they first enter insurable employment until pension age are taken into account when assessing their entitlement and the level of that entitlement.  Since 1961, when contributory pensions were introduced, the average contributions test has been used in calculating pension entitlement.  Once over 16 years of age, the date a person enters into insurable employment is the date used for averaging purposes. <\/p>  <p>  &ldquo;Developing the National Pensions System &ndash; Final Report of the National Pensions Board&rdquo; published in 1993, recommended that the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a contributory pension should be increased to 520 and the necessary legislation to effect these recommendations was contained in Section 12 of the Social Welfare Act 1997 which provided for their implementation in two stages, with the paid contribution requirement being standardised at 260 from 2002, rising to 520 from April 2012.  <\/p>  <p>  The homemaker&rsquo;s scheme makes qualification for a higher rate of State pension (contributory) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme, which was introduced in and took effect from 1994, allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age (or caring for incapacitated people over that age) to be disregarded when a person&rsquo;s social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes, subject to the standard qualifying conditions for State pension contributory also being satisfied.  This has the effect of increasing the yearly average of the pensioner, which is used to set the rate of their pension.  The scheme does not involve the award of credits.  There are no proposals to backdate the scheme prior to 1994 due to the very significant costs involved which would be expected to increase year on year.  <\/p>  <p>  Work has commenced to replace the &lsquo;yearly average&rsquo; system with a &lsquo;total contributions approach&rsquo; where the number of contributions recorded over a work life will more closely reflect the rate of pension payment received.  It is expected that the total contributions approach to pension qualification will replace the current average contributions test for State pension (contributory) for new pensioners from 2020, although that date is subject to change, as this is a very significant reform with considerable legislative, administrative, and technical aspects to be addressed in its implementation.  When proposals are agreed, legislation will be brought forward to underpin the necessary changes. I believe that it is important that the changes be announced well in advance of introduction, to enable those workers affected to include the new factors into their retirement planning.  This new method will provide greater benefit for some, but not all, future pensioners than they would have had under the current system.  It is not anticipated that the changes will apply to existing pensioners.  Any reforms are required to contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the pensions system and not increase costs. <\/p>  <p>  It is worth noting that the Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund in 2012 confirmed that the Fund provides better value to female rather than male contributors. This is due to the distributive nature of the Fund. For example, those with a yearly average of only 20 contributions (38% of the maximum) may qualify for 85% of the maximum rate. <\/p>  <p>  It should also be noted that, where people cannot qualify for a full rate contributory pension as a result of an intermittent PRSI record, the social protection system provides alternative methods of supporting such people in old age.  For example, if their spouse has a contributory pension, they may qualify for an Increase for a Qualified Adult amounting up to 90% of a full rate pension, which by default is paid directly to them.  Alternatively, they may qualify for a means-tested State Pension (non-contributory), amounting up to 95% of the maximum contributory pension rate.   <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600036#WRF03600","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Eligibility","counter":226,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600036#WRF03700"},{"type":"question","counter":227,"qnumday":87,"qnumall":"[8434\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600036#WRF03800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"why claimants under the disability allowance scheme receive the same rate of payment as claimants under the jobseeker's allowance scheme who are over 25 years of age; if persons on disability allowance have greater difficulties and expenses and her plans to increase the rate of payment under this scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1360","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":228,"content":"<p>Disability allowance (DA) is a means-tested social assistance payment  which is paid to persons aged 16 to 66 who are substantially restricted in undertaking suitable employment arising from a medical condition (subject to satisfying the relevant medical criteria).

According to the <i>Statistical Information on Social Welfare Services 2014<\/i>report, there were almost 13,000 DA claimants under the age of 25 at the end of 2014 (representing 11.5% of all DA claimants).<\/p><p>It should be noted that DA recipients may also be eligible for secondary benefits, which JA recipients may not qualify for, such as:<\/p><p>- All DA recipients are eligible for the Free Travel Pass, which entitles the bearer to free travel on public transport in Ireland (and certain private services);<\/p><p>- depending on the household composition of the DA claimant, he or she may qualify for the Fuel Allowance (&euro;22.50 per week for the duration of the fuel season) and the Household Benefits Package (&euro;35 per month towards the claimant&rsquo;s gas\/electricity costs, and the free television licence worth &euro;160); and<\/p><p>- recipients of DA who are living alone also qualify for the Living Alone Allowance (a &euro;9 per week increase to their weekly payment).<\/p><p>In contrast to this, JA recipients must be unemployed for 15 months in order to be eligible for the Fuel Allowance, and JA is not a qualifying payment for the Household Benefits scheme or the Living Alone Allowance.<\/p><p>Aside from secondary benefits, the means test for the DA scheme is also more generous than the means test for JA two significant ways.  The DA means assessment has a weekly earnings disregard of &euro;120 per week (with a 50% taper for earnings up to &euro;230 per week) in respect of employment of a rehabilitative nature, compared to a &euro;20 per day disregard for JA recipients, (up to maximum of three days) and a 60% taper.  In addition, the DA means test provides for a capital disregard of &euro;50,000, compared to &euro;20,000 for JA.  This results in a person with savings of &euro;50,000 and no other means being assessed with nil means for DA purposes, while this would be calculated as &euro;70 weekly means in the JA means test.<\/p><p>Accordingly, the social welfare system currently provides extra supports for people with disabilities.

However, you will appreciate that the funding difficulties in this scheme are primarily a matter for the Trustees, the companies participating in the scheme, the scheme members and the Pensions Authority and I cannot comment on specific issues arising in a particular scheme or schemes.<\/p>  <p>  Defined benefit pension schemes in Ireland are, in general, set up under trust law.  From a regulatory perspective the Trustees of pension schemes must comply with the provisions in the Pensions Act 1990 which, among other things, sets down certain requirements in relation to scheme funding.  In response to the funding difficulties faced by defined benefit schemes generally, a number of changes have been made to the Pensions Act in recent years to assist employers and trustees respond to the funding difficulties encountered by many schemes.  The Pensions Act was amended in 2009 and again in 2013 to broaden the options available to trustees of pension scheme in the context of a restructure of scheme benefits.  These changes provided for the sharing of the risk of underfunding in a scheme across all scheme members.  The manner in which these options are exercised is a matter for the trustees of a scheme who are required under trust law to act in the best interest of scheme members and beneficiaries. <\/p>  <p>  Should the Pensions Authority become aware that Trustees are not in compliance with the provisions of the Pensions Act, it has the power to investigate the state and conduct of a pension scheme.<\/p>  <p>  I am aware that intense efforts were made over a number of years to resolve the issues arising in the IASS scheme.  The funding solution proposed by the IASS, which the trustee group made clear was considered the solution that was in the best interest of the members as a whole, was approved by the Pensions Authority and was implemented in December 2014.  I am also conscious that the outcome, although not ideal, was preferable to the alternatives, including the wind up of the Scheme.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600037#WRG00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1253"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Disability Allowance Appeals","counter":242,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600037#WRG00750"},{"type":"question","counter":243,"qnumday":92,"qnumall":"[8484\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600037#WRG00800","dept":"Department of Social Protection","minister":"T\u00e1naiste and Minister for Social Protection","question":"the status of an appeal by a person (details supplied) under the disability allowance scheme; and if she will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1322","askee":"1253"},{"type":"speech","counter":244,"content":"<p>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned was registered in that office on 11th   April 2016.

","asker":"1250","askee":"1326"},{"type":"speech","counter":287,"content":"<p>Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs) form part of the suite of flexible options available to individuals in relation to their pension funds at retirement, depending on the circumstances.<\/p>  <p>  Prior to Finance Act 1999, individuals with Defined Contribution (DC) pension savings had no option but to purchase a pension income or annuity with their savings after taking the allowable tax-free retirement lump sum.  Finance Act 1999 introduced flexibility and choice for certain individuals in relation to their pension savings and those flexible options at retirement have since been extended to all benefits from DC retirement benefit schemes and other DC pension savings. These arrangements are therefore of long-standing.<\/p>  <p>  Choices which are now available to individuals (after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum) include the option to purchase an annuity with the remaining pension funds, to receive the balance of the pension funds in cash (subject to marginal rate income tax, as appropriate), to invest in an approved retirement fund (ARF) or an AMRF, subject to certain conditions. <\/p>  <p>  Under the regime, the options to invest in an ARF or receive the balance of the pension fund in cash are subject to conditions. The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed minimum level of pension income (\"specified income\") actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised. The purpose of the specified income requirement is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF or by way of the cash option, that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed pension income throughout the period of their retirement. The specified income requirement is &euro;12,700 per annum and this income requirement can be satisfied, to a significant extent, by the amount of the State pension in payment to an individual in his or her own right (e.g. excluding any payment being received on behalf of a dependent.)<\/p>  <p>  Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a \"set aside\" amount must be invested. The maximum amount of the \"set aside\" is &euro;63,500 or the remaining pension fund amount, if lower, after taking the permissible tax-free retirement lump sum. The funds in an AMRF can be used at any point, in full or in part, to purchase an annuity, including an annuity which, with existing pension income, would be sufficient to meet the minimum specified income requirement after which the AMRF becomes an ARF and any remaining funds therein can be accessed at the owner's discretion, subject to taxation. <\/p>  <p>  The purpose of the AMRF is to ensure that an individual without the minimum guaranteed pension income for life has a pension \"safety-net\" to provide for the latter years of his\/her retirement. Up to Finance Act 2014, the capital invested in an AMRF could not be accessed until the AMRF owner reached age 75 (or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then) at which point the AMRF becomes an ARF with unrestricted access to the funds, subject to taxation. While the capital sum in an AMRF could not be accessed, as set out, any income, profits or gains accrued from the investment of the capital could, until 2015, be withdrawn by the AMRF owner, subject to tax at the marginal rate. <\/p>  <p>  I decided to change the arrangements for AMRFs last year so as to allow AMRF-owners voluntary, tax-liable access to a maximum of 4% of their AMRF assets each year until it becomes an ARF. This change provides AMRF owners with access to a definitive and certain level of income from their AMRF rather than the uncertain level of income which access to the accrued income, profits and gains in the AMRF provided.<\/p>  <p>  Under the previous access arrangements for AMRFs, the extent of any income, profit or gains would depend on the performance of the investment options taken and could, therefore, be highly volatile with the possibility of little or no gains accruing in certain years. In addition, the scale of the capital allowed for in an AMRF, at a maximum of &euro;63,500, would not always permit for investment returns of any significant scale to be made using a prudent investment policy. <\/p>  <p>  The change allowing access to a specified percentage of the capital in an AMRF is primarily aimed at those individuals whose AMRF constitutes a significant part of their retirement funds and who, while not wishing to purchase a pension annuity with those funds, may require access to a portion of these funds to provide a more certain form of supplementary pension income prior to reaching age 75. This facility also ensures that an individual will have some remaining funds in the AMRF at age 75 to provide for their remaining years, assuming the individual has decided not to purchase a pension annuity in the meantime.<\/p>  <p>  The arrangements which I have described provide a variety of options and choices for individuals to access their pension savings, subject to certain safeguards which I consider are reasonable and proportionate in present circumstances.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600038#WRH01000","answer":true,"speaker":"1326"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Mortgage Interest Relief Eligibility","counter":288,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600038#WRH01100"},{"type":"question","counter":289,"qnumday":107,"qnumall":"[8344\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600038#WRH01200","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Revenue Commissioners pay the banks through the tax relief at source scheme, in the event of mortgage holders not paying either some or all of their mortgage payments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1312","askee":"1326"},{"type":"question","counter":290,"qnumday":108,"qnumall":"[8346\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600038#WRH01300","dept":"Department of Finance","minister":"Minister for Finance","question":"if the Financial Regulator, the Revenue Commissioners, the Comptroller and Auditor General or any other State body carry out an audit on the banks to ensure that they fully pass on the tax relief at source to customers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Coastal erosion may threaten human life or infrastructure such as roads and may undermine and cause damage to properties.  However, it can also have beneficial effects such as providing natural nourishment and supply of sediment to adjacent beaches.  Due to the considerable extent and nature of the Irish coastline impacted by erosion and the fact that it is an on-going natural process, it would be uneconomical and impractical for the State to protect all of this coastline.<\/p><p>It is the responsibility of local authorities in the first instance to identify, investigate and address on a prioritised basis problems of coastal erosion in their areas.  The primary objective of The Office of Public Works (OPW) policy on coastal protection is to ensure that, in areas identified as being at greatest risk of damage or loss to assets through coastal erosion or flooding, appropriate and sustainable measures are identified by Local Authorities to protect those assets and, where intervention measures are economically justified and compatible with all required environmental and other statutory requirements, they are implemented subject to the availability of resources.<\/p><p>The Office of Public Works has a scheme in place entitled the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, which was introduced in 2009<font color=\"#6181FF\">.<\/font>The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to undertake minor flood mitigation works or studies to address localised flooding and coastal protection problems within their administrative areas.  The scheme generally applies to relatively straightforward cases where a solution can be readily identified and achieved in a short time frame.  All applications received are considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria, which comprise economic, social and environmental criteria including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.<\/p><p>In some cases a 'do nothing' or &lsquo;no active intervention&rsquo; approach might well be the most appropriate management response to coastal erosion, and international studies have borne this out.  The European Commission Erosion study - Living with Coastal Erosion in Europe &ndash; which was completed in 2004 highlighted some important findings including the fact that some previous interventions, whilst solving erosion problems locally, have exacerbated coastal erosion at other locations or have generated other environmental problems.  This study also highlighted the concept of &lsquo;coastal squeeze&rsquo; which occurs in low-lying and inter-tidal areas which would otherwise naturally adjust to changes in sea level, storms and tides but cannot do so due to the construction of sea walls and other inflexible coastal barriers.  The outcome can often be a gradual loss of amenity beach and habitat.<\/p><p>Because intervention within a coastal area may cause problems further along the coast, any proposed intervention measures are best developed in conjunction with a formal coastal erosion risk management study which has carefully investigated the problem and explored the full range of management options.  Where warranted OPW is prepared to fund such studies under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme, in advance of any proposed erosion management works or measures.<\/p><p>Details on funding approved by the OPW for coastal protection works for each county from 2009 to the present is available on the OPW website under Flood Risk Management\/Minor Works Scheme\/Annual Lists of Minor Works Projects for which Funding has been Approved.

Lanesborough Power Station is an Individual Risk Receptor (IRR) and Cloondara (or Clondra) is an Area for Further Assessment (AFA) in the Shannon River Basin District being assessed under the Shannon CFRAM study. The Programme, which is being undertaken by engineering consultants on behalf of the OPW working in partnership with the local authorities, involves the production of predictive flood mapping for each location, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and the production of flood risk management plans. <\/p>  <p>  Under the Shannon CFRAM Study, draft predictive flood maps have been produced and were the subject of Public Consultation Days in Cloondara on 21st January, 2015 and for Lanesborough Power Station IRR on 25th February, 2015. In addition, a Public Consultation Day was held in Cloondara on 18th November, 2015 to present and discuss preliminary options to manage the significant flood risks in the Cloondara AFA. The draft maps are now being finalised following the conclusion of the national statutory public consultation process on 23rd December, 2015.<\/p>  <p>  Following the finalisation of the flood mapping and the identification of preliminary flood risk management options, the final output from this important project will be integrated Flood Risk Management Plans containing specific measures that can address in a comprehensive and sustainable way the significant flood risks identified in the Shannon River Basin District. The Plans will include a prioritised list of measures, both structural and non-structural, that can address flood risk in an environmentally sustainable and cost effective manner.  Further information on the Programme is available on www.cfram.ie. <\/p>  <p>  The Government recently announced increased levels of investment in the area of flood relief as part of the overall Capital Investment Plan 2016-2021 and this investment programme will allow for consideration of measures arising from the Flood Risk Management Plans. <\/p>  <p>  The Office of Public Works also operates a Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme. This administrative Scheme's eligibility criteria, including a requirement that any measures are cost beneficial, are published on the OPW website, www.opw.ie. It is open to the Longford County Council to submit a funding application under the Scheme. Any application received will be considered in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management. <\/p>  <p>  Two applications under the OPW&rsquo;s Minor Works Scheme have been received in 2016 for Lanesborough, which are not within the AFA.

The Low Pay Commission&rsquo;s main function is to, on an annual basis, examine and make recommendations on the national minimum wage, with a view to securing that the national minimum wage, where adjusted, is adjusted incrementally over time having had regard to changes in earnings, productivity, overall competitiveness and the likely impact any adjustment will have on employment and unemployment levels. The national minimum hourly rate of pay increased to &euro;9.15 per hour on January 1st this year following Government acceptance of the Low Pay Commission recommendation of July 2015 to increase the rate from &euro;8.65 per hour. <\/p>  <p>  In Budget 2016, when the increase in the National Minimum Wage to &euro;9.15 per hour was announced, a number of related measures were introduced in order to ensure that the benefit of this increase was not lost to taxation for the employee and that the effect of the increase in the National Minimum Wage to &euro;9.25 per hour on employer&rsquo;s liability to PRSI was mitigated. <\/p>  <p>  The employer&rsquo;s PRSI threshold, where an employer&rsquo;s liability to PRSI on all of the employee&rsquo;s income increases from 8.5% to 10.75%, was increased by &euro;20 from &euro;356 to &euro;376 in order to keep this threshold above the weekly wage for a full-time worker on the increased minimum wage, thereby mitigating the cost to employers of that increase. Due to the budget changes introduced the employer will pay PRSI at 8.5% and not move to the previously higher rate of 10.75% when paying the additional &euro;1,014 per annum.

I would consider blacklisting of workers for whatever reason as an unacceptable practice &ndash; particularly if it arose in relation to workers exercising their rights to take part in trade union activities.  The Deputy will be aware that there are already legislative protections in place where workers are victimised by an employer for trade union activity. <\/p>  <p>  Section 6(1) of the Unfair Dismissals Act 1977 (as amended) provides that, in general, a dismissal shall be deemed to be unfair unless an employer can prove that there were substantial grounds justifying the dismissal.  In addition, Section 6 also deems certain dismissal situations to be unfair as well as outlining certain criteria on which dismissals may be adjudicated as fair.  One type of dismissal situation deemed to be unfair is referred to in Section 6(2)(a) of the Act which indicates that a dismissal is unfair where it can be shown that the dismissal resulted wholly or mainly from an employee&rsquo;s trade union membership or activities, either where those activities take place outside working hours or at those times during working hours when permitted by the employer.  While, in general, an employee must have been in the same employment for at least a year in order to bring a claim for unfair dismissal under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, one of the exceptions to the one-year service requirement includes dismissals falling under section 6(2)(a) of the Act.  <\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Industrial Relations Act 1990 (Code of Practice on Victimisation) (Declaration) Order 2004 provides that where there is a dispute in an employment where collective bargaining fails to take place and where negotiating arrangements are not in place, no person, be they union representative, individual employee or manager, should be victimised or suffer disadvantage as a consequence of their legitimate actions or affiliation arising from that dispute. A procedure for addressing complaints of victimisation in such cases is set out the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004.  A complaint for breach of this legislation may be presented to the Workplace Relations Commission who can enforce rights breached. That Code of Practice was amended in October last year to include as a form of victimisation the use by employers of inducements (financial or otherwise) designed specifically to have an employee forego collective representation by a trade union.<\/p>  <p>  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 also provides for enhanced protection for individuals who are victimised as a result of invoking the provisions of the 2001\/2004 Industrial Relations Acts through a trade union or for acting as a witness or comparator for those provisions.<\/p>  <p>  If there is evidence that this is a widespread practice &ndash; and to date I do not have such evidence on the matter &ndash; I will be happy to consider the matter further with both sides of industry. <\/p>  <p>  If the Deputy has any information regarding blacklisting of workers in Ireland, he might bring it either to my attention or to the Data Protection Commissioner.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600040#WRK01400","answer":true,"speaker":"1067"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Company Law","counter":381,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600040#WRK01500"},{"type":"question","counter":382,"qnumday":138,"qnumall":"[8379\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600040#WRK01600","dept":"Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","minister":"Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation","question":"the steps he is taking to prevent companies engaging in tactical insolvencies; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

There is an extensive range of statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary bargaining process.  The freedom of association and the right to organise and bargain collectively are also guaranteed in a number of international instruments which the State has ratified and which it is, therefore, bound to uphold under international law. <\/p>  <p>  The previous Programme for Government contains a Commitment to ensure that Irish law on employees&rsquo; right to engage in collective bargaining is consistent with recent judgements of the European Court of Human Rights. Giving effect to this Commitment involved in-depth consultation with stakeholders, including employer and worker representatives, and a review of the experience of the operation of the existing legislative framework as put in place under the Industrial Relations Acts of 2001 and 2004 and the consequences of the litigation that has arisen in the course of the operation of these Acts. <\/p>  <p>  A decision by the Government to legislate for an improved framework in this area resulted in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 which came into effect on 1st August 2015.<\/p>  <p>  The legislation provides a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed in employments where collective bargaining does not take place and brings clarity and certainty for employers in terms of managing their workplaces in this respect.

The report concentrates on the costs that are largely domestically determined such as labour, property, transport, energy, water, waste, communications, credit\/finance and business service. It finds that Ireland&rsquo;s cost base has improved across a range of metrics over the last five years. This has made Irish firms more competitive internationally and made Ireland a more attractive location for firms to base their operations in. However, despite these improvements, internationally comparable data suggest that Ireland remains a relatively high cost location for a range of key business inputs and there is strong upward cost pressure evident in property and in the labour market. The Council warns that Ireland is particularly vulnerable to external shocks beyond our control &ndash; external risks at the moment include in particular the forthcoming UK Referendum on membership of the EU, oil prices and exchange rate movements. To pre-empt such threats we must create a competitive edge.<\/p>  <p>  The report is a timely reminder of the risks of complacency regarding our economic performance. The improved competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s exporting sector has been one of Ireland&rsquo;s greatest strengths in recent years and has been central to economic growth and job creation. Cost competitiveness has been critical to the success of Irish based exporters, allowing them to maximise the opportunities arising from increases in global demand. <\/p>  <p>  I share the Council&rsquo;s view that to protect the gains achieved to date, to further embed and sustain the recovery, and to ultimately spread the benefits of economic growth to all, we must continue to enhance all aspects of our competitiveness.<\/p>  <p>  The Council&rsquo;s report has been noted by Government and enhancing Ireland&rsquo;s international competitiveness performance will remain a key economic cornerstone of economic policy making. <\/p>  <p>  The Council and my Department and its agencies are continually engaged with relevant stakeholders on the particular policy needs required to support cost competitiveness. The stakeholders include other Government Departments, regulatory bodies and public and private bodies. In this regard, there is a role for both the public and private sectors alike to proactively manage their cost base and drive efficiency, thus creating a virtuous circle between the costs of living, wage expectations and cost competitiveness. Measures that ensure open and competitive markets are also essential.<\/p>  <p>  The policy implications of the Costs of Doing Business in Ireland 2016 report&rsquo;s analysis, and associated structural reforms required to address Ireland&rsquo;s cost base, will be included in the Council&rsquo;s annual Competitiveness Challenge report which will be published later this year.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600040#WRK02600","answer":true,"speaker":"1293"},{"type":"unspoken","counter":393,"content":"<p>Question No. 142 answered with Question No. 136.<\/p>"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","counter":395,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600040#WRK02900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Wind Energy Generation","counter":394,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600040#WRK02800"},{"type":"question","counter":395,"qnumday":143,"qnumall":"[8054\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600040#WRK02900","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the name and location, by county, of community benefit schemes in place for wind farms owned or operated by semi-State companies under his remit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1336","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":396,"content":"<p>Coillte Teoranta was established as a private commercial company under the Forestry Act, 1988 and day-to-day operational matters, such as the operation of Community Benefit Schemes associated with wind farm development, are the responsibility of the company.

The current contract for the supply of cattle tags, based on a sole approved supplier, will expire on 31 October 2016.<\/p>  <p>  Following consultation with stakeholders, my Department has made a policy decision to seek a single supplier for provision of the service for the supply of bovine tags. The policy of seeking a single supplier has been endorsed by the main farming organisations (IFA and ICMSA) on the basis that a single supplier, selected on the basis of a competitive tender and benefitting from economies of scale, is likely to make bovine tags available to herd keepers at a competitive price.  In contrast, the ICSA expressed a preference for multiple suppliers on the basis of the competition provided between tag suppliers. The Department view is that a single supplier is the optimum mechanism for ensuring that ear tags are made available to Irish farmers at a competitive price while at the same time meeting the identification requirements of the bovine sector in Ireland for superior quality bovine tags.  As the Deputy is aware, my Department places a strong reliance on tag suitability, security and tamper evidence to support a secure bovine identification and traceability system that plays a key role in underpinning beef and dairy exports in a competitive marketplace.<\/p>  <p>  My Department will shortly be publishing a Request for Tenders (RFT) for the provision of a new contract for a three year term that will commence on 1 November 2016.  The RFT will seek a single supplier for the provision of a service to supply a suite of bovine tags including conventional tags, tissue tags (that provide for tissue sampling for BVD and DNA detection), electronic tags and electronic bolus.   My Department is obliged to be mindful of the requirements of public procurement law and to publish the RFT within a timeframe that will enable it to award a new contract in time to allow the successful tenderer to make arrangements to enable it to supply the required suite of tags to herd keepers with effect from 1 November 2016. This timeframe could not accommodate the request to delay the competition until a new Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture has had an opportunity to consider the merits of a single supplier and a multiple supplier approach.<\/p>  <p>  In December 2015, my Department published a Market Sounding Exercise in line with public procurement legislation in advance of the publication of the RFT. This notification provided the market with advance notice on the suite of bovine tags required by my Department and afforded interested parties with the opportunity of having feedback on tissue tags in advance of publication of the RFT. No plastics expert was used to evaluate the plastics characteristics of tissue tags in the Market Soundings Exercise.  Feedback was provided to all companies who participated in the Market Sounding Exercise.  Feedback on the tags covered two very specific areas only, namely tissue sampling\/testing efficacy and aspects of tag security which included an assessment carried out by a Veterinary Inspector in my Department&rsquo;s Investigation Division with considerable experience of dealing with bovine ear tags. The assessment was done on a without prejudice basis to any future public procurement competition.  It is open to any company to obtain independent expert advice on the findings communicated by my Department.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600041#WRL01300","answer":true,"speaker":"1286"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Agri-Environment Options Scheme Appeals","counter":425,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600041#WRL01400"},{"type":"question","counter":426,"qnumday":155,"qnumall":"[8129\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600041#WRL01500","dept":"Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine","minister":"Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine","question":"the reason reductions in payments were made to a person (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1272","askee":"1286"},{"type":"speech","counter":427,"content":"<p>The person named commenced their AEOS contract on 1 September 2010.

The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services, the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force and available resources. As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment takes place so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels as set out above in accordance with available training capacity.    This approach is underlined by the recently announced General Service recruitment campaign, which was launched on 13 April 2016 with a closing date of 22 May 2016, and envisages an intake of 600 general services recruits in 2016 and a further 850 in 2017. This recruitment will be phased over the 2016 and 2017 period in a manner designed to restore the established strength and plans are being put in place to this end. Most of the new recruits this year will be drawn from the existing General Service panel. A new panel will be established from the current competition. Recruitment from this new panel is expected to commence towards the end of 2016 and will continue through 2017 and into 2018. It is too early at this stage to predict whether and when a 2017 competition may be required, as it will depend on the numbers who are successful in the current competition and are placed on the panel and the level of turnover in the Defence Forces. <\/p>  <p>  The criteria that apply to all applicants for the 2016 General Service Recruitment Competitions require that they must undergo psychometric tests, a fitness test, a competency based interview, a medical examination and undergo Security Clearance.

The Statute Law Revision Act 2007 specifically retained in existence, in Irish Law, the torts and offences of maintenance and champerty. <\/p><p>Under current law,<b><\/b>actions comprising maintenance and\/or champerty in Ireland are considered to be contrary to public policy in that <i>inter alia<\/i>they may assist in the development of a market in legal claims thereby promoting litigation for the benefit of the promoter rather than the litigant and are considered to have the potential to create a substantial injustice to a defendant in an action.  Maintenance and champerty are not permitted as a matter of Irish law regardless of the extent of the control exercised over the conduct of the litigation by the funder.  As I understand these particular matters to be <i>sub judice<\/i>, I will refrain from any further comment. <\/p><p>However, as the Deputy may also be aware, the 2010 Report of the Law Reform Commission on the Consolidation and Reform of the Courts Acts recommended that legislation should make provision for the continuation of the most significant criminal offences and civil wrongs against the administration of justice and that it should also deal with civil liability towards any person who has suffered financial loss arising from perjury, embracery, malicious prosecution, maintenance or champerty.<i><\/i>Additionally, in its Fourth Programme of Law Reform published in November 2013, the Commission has set out its intention to examine the area of contempt of court and other offences and torts involving the administration of justice<i><\/i>which will include an examination of related offences and torts including, <i>inter alia<\/i>, champerty and maintenance.

An aftercare programme is based on assessed need, and an aftercare worker will arrange for various supports, including support for accommodation, and accessing training and education as required.  Aftercare workers are provided both by the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, as well as through commissioned services from community, voluntary and private organisations.  It should be noted that young adults leaving care at 18 years are not obliged to avail of an aftercare service, and those that choose not to engage are encouraged and supported to avail of the services at any stage up to the age of 21 years. Young people eligible for an aftercare service are those aged 16 years or over, who have spent at least 12 months in the care of the State between the ages of 13 and (up to) 18 years old.<\/p><p>Tusla reports that at the end of March, 2015, the vast majority of 18-22 years olds in receipt of an aftercare service were residing in some form of stable accommodation.  In fact, 45% of those care leavers remained living with their foster carers, 23% were living independently, 11% returned home, 4% were living in supported lodgings and 5.5% were living in residential centres.  Only a small minority (11.5%) were living in other types of less stable accommodation.<\/p><p>Each care leaver, as part of their aftercare plan has an individual financial support plan.  This forms part of an assessment of need which takes account of sources of financial support from all Government Departments and statutory agencies. Tusla has introduced a Standardised National Aftercare Allowance for all care leavers engaged in training and education. This allowance is inclusive of educational grants, training allowances, and other state payments bringing the total received by the young person to &euro;300 per week. The introduction of this allowance means that young people who remain living with their previous foster carers and young people who live independently, who are engaged in training, education or employment now receive the same financial support from Tusla.  Many young people in independent living have benefitted from an increase in their allowance as a result of this measure.<\/p><p>Advice, guidance, support and signposting are key elements of the supports available to care leavers.  For those young people who are not in training or education, aftercare services have a key role in providing support to them in liaising with the relevant departments and agencies in accessing financial assistance, employment opportunities, training or supporting them to return to education. Those who are unemployed, and not engaged in training or education, can apply for jobseeker's allowance from the Department of Social Protection. The jobseeker's allowance payable to care leavers is the full rate and not the reduced rate normally payable to those under 25.<\/p><p>At the end of December 2015 there were approximately 1,763 young people aged 18 to 22 years in receipt of an aftercare service, with 58% in full-time education or training.<\/p><p>The numbers of 16 and 17 year old young people in care with an aftercare worker and the numbers of young people discharged from care at 18 years with an aftercare worker are new metrics which were not collected nationally prior to 2015.

The Report proposed that parents will apply for a childcare subsidy if both parents (and one parent in the case of a one-parent family) are either working, studying or on an approved training course with eligibility for a childcare subsidy under the new programme being determined by income only.

With this in mind an Inter-Departmental Group, led by this Department, was established in June 2015 with a brief to bring forward recommendations to address this issue.<\/p><p>The Group concluded its work and its recommendations were fully accepted and funded by Government.  I announced, as part of Budget 2016, the necessary funding to implement a new practical, workable model for meeting the needs of children with a disability.  The model will deliver seven levels of support to enable the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities in the ECCE Programme. These are:-<\/p><p>i. An Inclusive Culture: includes training dedicated <i>Inclusion Co-ordinators<\/i>in pre-schools, and a small capitation increase for particular childcare services to support fully inclusive practice;<\/p><p>ii. Information for Parents and Providers: includes development of a national website and information packs for parents and providers;<\/p><p>iii. A Qualified and Confident Workforce: resourcing formal and informal training for early years practitioners to support more inclusive provision;<\/p><p>iv. Expert Educational Advice &amp;amp; Support: enhancing the <i>Better Start<\/i>Early Years Specialist Service so that practitioners have prompt access to advice and support from experts in early years education for children with disabilities;<\/p><p>v. Equipment, Appliances and Minor Alterations: the provision of specialised equipment, appliances, or capital grants to fund minor building alterations so that children with disabilities can participate in pre-school;<\/p><p>vi. Therapeutic Intervention: additional resources to enable access to HSE therapeutic services, where these are needed to allow a child enrol, and fully participate in, pre-school.<\/p><p>vii. Additional Assistance: where the supports available at levels 1-6 are not sufficient to meet a child&rsquo;s needs, additional capitation can be made available to childcare providers to support the pre-school leader to ensure children&rsquo;s full participation. This could include, for example, buying in additional support, or, in particular circumstances, reducing the staff:child ratio.<\/p><p>Work on the detailed design and implementation of the new model is at an advanced stage.  For example, my Department and the Department of Education &amp;amp; Skills has worked with the Higher Education Authority to develop a new higher education special purpose award for early years practitioners which will see up to 900 early years practitioners graduate each year, qualifying them to perform the new role of Inclusion Co-ordinator in their Early Years Care and Education setting.  The contract for developing and delivering this higher education programme was recently awarded to a consortium led by Mary Immaculate College, Limerick, in partnership with the Froebel Department in the National University of Ireland, Maynooth and Early Childhood Ireland.  The consortium is now planning for the registration of new graduates on a nationwide basis for September 2016. This means that we can expect our first Inclusion Co-ordinator graduates in pre-school settings in September 2017.<\/p><p>Under level 4 of the model, fifty Early Years Specialists are being recruited to deliver the National Access and Inclusion service which will be operational from June 2016.  This will be a significant support to providers and parents in planning for enrolment for children with disabilities.<\/p><p>Work is also well advanced across many other elements of the model  with a view to introducing the initiative from September 2016.  It is intended that service providers and parents will be able to submit applications for supports under the new model from June 2016 onwards to allow them to plan for pre-school enrolment in September 2016 and to ensure that children will begin to benefit from these measures from that point forward.<\/p><p>A dedicated website, hosted by the Department and containing comprehensive information on the new model, will be launched very shortly.<\/p><p>Finally, the Deputy has asked specifically about special needs assistants for pre-school children with disabilities.  The new model does not involve the provision of special needs assistants and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs does not fund such services.  The HSE does, on an ad hoc basis, make some supports available and it is expected that these arrangements will continue until the new model has been established.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600047#WRR00800","answer":true,"speaker":"952"},{"type":"majorheading","content":"Department of Health","counter":681,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600047#WRR00900"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Treatment Abroad Scheme","counter":680,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600047#WRR00850"},{"type":"question","counter":681,"qnumday":243,"qnumall":"[8071\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600047#WRR00900","dept":"Department of Health","minister":"Minister for Health","question":"if, under existing legislation or regulations, any sanctions exist for a doctor, consultant or other health care provider who wrongly informs patients that they do not qualify for treatment abroad under the European Union cross-border health care directive.","asker":"1259","askee":"1236"},{"type":"speech","counter":682,"content":"<p>Directive 2011\/24\/EU on the application of patients&rsquo; rights in cross-border healthcare was adopted by both the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament on 9 March 2011.

As the Deputy may be aware, the tobacco industry has argued that standardised packs would be easier to forge and would lead to growth in illicit trade of tobacco products.  However, the Revenue Commissioners have advised me that they are satisfied that the standardised packaging legislation will not have a significant impact on their work in relation to illicit trade in tobacco products. Revenue relies on the tax stamp as a key means for them to distinguish between legal and illegal products, irrespective of the way in which the cigarettes are packaged. Tax stamps will remain a fixture on tobacco products following the introduction of standardised packaging, and contain all features possible to minimise the risk of counterfeiting.  Combatting the illegal tobacco trade is, and will continue to be, a high priority for the Revenue Commissioners. They have extensive cooperation with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combatting the illicit trade, and in addition, cooperation takes place with other revenue administrations and with the European Anti-Fraud office, OLAF, in the ongoing programmes at international level to tackle the illicit trade. It is anticipated that there will not be a significant impact on illicit trade of tobacco as a result of the introduction of standardised packaging.<\/p>  <p>  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill aims to reduce alcohol consumption in Ireland to 9.1 litres per person per annum by 2020, and to reduce the harms associated with alcohol.  The Public Health (Alcohol) Bill provides for restrictions on the display and advertisement of alcohol products in mixed trade retail outlets.  Under the Bill, mixed trade retailers can only display and advertise alcohol products in a separate area of the shop or closed storage units.  Alcohol may also be sold behind the counter in a closed storage unit.<\/p>  <p>  The general availability of alcohol is an important indicator when assessing alcohol related harm.  Alcohol is not an ordinary consumer product and this is recognised by the State through a licensing system and a specific excise tax.  However, when it comes to mixed trade retailers, e.g supermarkets and convenience stores, alcohol is frequently displayed like a regular grocery item.  The regulation of the way it is displayed for sale, is an important mechanism to highlight the harm it can cause and protect children from overexposure.<\/p>  <p>  Many of the provisions on structural separation are based on existing provisions in the Responsible Retailers of Alcohol Ireland Code.  These provisions will replace Section 9 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 2008 (which was never commenced).

The 2015 progress report on the National Drugs Strategy was recently posted on my Department's website at .  <\/p><p>Prevention and Education programmes constitute a significant part of the Government's response to the drug problem, particularly among young persons.  Substance use education in schools is provided in the context of Social Personal and Health Education. The Department of Education and Skills's Inspectorate continues to monitor the effectiveness of the implementation of substance use policies in schools through the whole-school evaluation process and the inspectorate system. Local and Regional Drug and Alcohol Task Forces operate a range of education and prevention programmes, which aim to promote healthier lifestyle choices among young people and other vulnerable groups at risk of problem drug use. In addition, young people at risk of drug misuse can access diversionary programmes, facilities and services and family support. <\/p><p>There are dedicated staff in my Department and in the Health Service Executive working on social inclusion, health and wellbeing and drugs policy and services.

The HSE also funds a number of voluntary agencies that work in the area of reduction of alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harm among young people. <\/p><p>Finally, my Department has commenced work on the development of a new Strategy for the period after 2016. This process will involve a comprehensive consultation with key stakeholders and the public on the current national drugs policy and future priorities.

The 2014 conflict in Gaza compounded an already serious humanitarian situation, with a high level of civilian casualties and large scale internal displacement. During my visit to Gaza last year, I saw first-hand the appalling destruction, and the particularly difficult impact on children, which has exacerbated already difficult living conditions. As an immediate response to the Gaza crisis, Ireland provided &euro;500,000 in July 2014 to the Emergency Appeal of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) to help provide urgently needed food, shelter and medical aid to thousands of families many of whom had had to flee their homes.  At the International Gaza Reconstruction Conference, which I attended in October 2014, I pledged a further &euro;2.5 million towards urgent immediate needs and long term recovery efforts.  &euro;2 million of this has been provided to UNRWA&rsquo;s Gaza Emergency Appeal.

The focus of activity in recent months has been Turkey, since most migrants and refugees arriving in the EU since early 2015 have travelled via Turkey. However, the European Union&rsquo;s efforts to resolve the migration crisis have gone well beyond Turkey, involving countries in the Middle East, North Africa and the Sahel as well as a number of initiatives designed to address the root causes of migration, and to help the plight of refugees.  Late last year there were two important joint ministerial conferences initiated by the EU focusing on migration: the first in October on the Western Balkans route and the second addressing migration from Africa (Valletta) in November 2015. The Valletta Summit established a Trust Fund for addressing the root causes of migration in Africa, with &euro;1.8bn from the European Development Fund and additional bilateral contributions.  Ireland is contributing &euro;3m to this Trust Fund. <\/p>  <p>  More recently, the EU&rsquo;s High Representative for Foreign Policy Federica Mogherini has been conducting a series of high level dialogues with a number of countries of origin and transit, including Ethiopia, Sudan and Nigeria.

That strategy is based on two key objectives: first, to see this citizen released by the Egyptian authorities so that he can return to his family and his studies in Ireland and, second, to provide consular support for his welfare while he remains in detention. <\/p>  <p>  In furtherance of these objectives, both I and my officials continue to engage intensively with the Egyptian authorities and our international partners, including the EU and third countries who have had experiences of citizens in similar situations. The Taoiseach has raised the case in person on two occasions with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, while I have had several interactions with my Egyptian counterpart and with the Ambassador of Egypt in Dublin. Our Ambassador in Cairo, Damien Cole, is similarly proactive on this citizen&rsquo;s behalf. <\/p>  <p>  I fully understand the distress that is caused to this citizen and his family by his lengthy detention while awaiting a final outcome of the trial. The Egyptian authorities are in no doubt about our keen and sustained interest in the welfare of this citizen and the feedback we receive from all of these contacts is carefully considered and used in constantly reviewing our approach to this case.<\/p>  <p>  Significant resources in Cairo and in Dublin continue to be deployed in the provision of consular assistance to both this citizen and his family.  The most recent consular visit to the citizen was conducted on Sunday 17 April; such visits remain a core element of our ongoing monitoring and support for this citizen&rsquo;s welfare. Close contact is also maintained with the family of this citizen and their legal representatives in Cairo and Dublin.  The most recent meeting between officials of my Department and the family took place on 20 April. <\/p>  <p>  I would also note that the Irish Embassy in Cairo has been present at all trial hearings to date and will continue to monitor the trial process. The next hearing is scheduled for 29 June.<\/p>  <p>  In the context of the two objectives outlined, the Government will continue to make determined efforts to resolve this case in the best interests of this citizen.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600055#WRZ02000","answer":true,"speaker":"1233"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Trade Relations","counter":1041,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600055#WRZ02100"},{"type":"question","counter":1042,"qnumday":365,"qnumall":"[8190\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600055#WRZ02200","dept":"Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade","minister":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade","question":"the status of Ireland's trade relationship with Nigeria.","asker":"1250","askee":"1233"},{"type":"speech","counter":1043,"content":"<p>Nigeria is an important trade partner for Ireland in Africa.

The re-engagement process will allow legacy providers to demonstrate their capacity to provide and maintain, on an ongoing and sustainable basis, the infrastructure required to develop programmes consistent with national standards and to show that they have fit for purpose quality assurance arrangements in place.<\/p>  <p>  The fees to be applied to legacy providers seeking to re-engage with QQI have yet to be determined.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600056#WRAA00700","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Emergency Works Scheme Applications","counter":1076,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600056#WRAA00725"},{"type":"question","counter":1077,"qnumday":377,"qnumall":"[8093\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600056#WRAA00800","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"to provide funding for a wall at a school (details supplied) in County Westmeath.","asker":"1250","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":1078,"content":"<p>The school to which the Deputy refers applied for funding under my Department's Emergency Works Scheme (EWG) for repairs to a boundary wall.<\/p><p>As the scope of works was considered to be outside the terms of this scheme, the application was refused.<\/p><p>It is open to the school to use their Minor Works Grant for the works in question.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600056#WRAA00900","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Special Educational Needs Staff","counter":1079,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600056#WRAA00950"},{"type":"question","counter":1080,"qnumday":378,"qnumall":"[8144\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600056#WRAA01000","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"the reason a school (details supplied) will lose a Special Needs Assistant during 2016; and if the matter will be reviewed immediately and the decision reversed.","asker":"1248","askee":"1325"},{"type":"speech","counter":1081,"content":"<p>I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating a quantum of Special Needs Assistant (SNA) support for each school annually taking into account the assessed care needs of children qualifying for SNA support enrolled in the school.

The measures schools take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan. It is the duty of the Board of Management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students.<\/p>  <p>  Schools at both primary and second level use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able.<\/p>  <p>  The revised primary curriculum recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils. Syllabi and curricula for second-level schools have been designed in such a way to enable teachers cater for the wide range of pupil ability.<\/p>  <p>  Content is outlined in the curricula at both levels and process is also heavily emphasised. Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated. The development of language skills, investigatory and problem-solving skills, higher-order thinking skills and working individually, and as a member of a group, are all encouraged at both levels.<\/p>  <p>  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), in collaboration with its counterparts in Northern Ireland, the Council for Curriculum Examination and Assessment (CCEA), produced guidelines entitled \"Exceptionally Able Students &ndash; Draft Guidelines for Teachers\" which issued to all Primary and Post Primary schools in November 2007 along with a questionnaire for feedback.<\/p>  <p>  The NCCA\/CCEA guidelines are designed to raise awareness of the social, emotional and academic needs of exceptionally able students and to assist teachers in planning their teaching and learning. The guidelines provide advice to schools on identification of gifted children, set out profiles of students, and whole school and classroom strategies and case studies which demonstrate how schools can best meet the needs of such students. The general strategies include differentiated teaching, acceleration and enrichment approaches in the context of participation in mainstream schools.<\/p>  <p>  Finally, I wish to explain that the Special Education Support Service (SESS) is a service under the management of my Department which provides support for teachers to assist them in meeting the needs of all pupils with special educational needs, including those pupils who are exceptionally able.

More information on the range of programmes offered by the SESS is available on www.sess.ie.<\/p>  <p>  In addition, the Professional Development Service for Teachers (PDST), also under the management of my Department, provides training in differentiation, in terms of differentiating for all pupils, whether less able\/more able.

The previous Government decided to reduce the salaries and allowances payable to all new entrants to public service recruitment grades (including teachers) by 10% with effect from 1 January 2011. This decision also required that such new entrants would start on the first point of the applicable salary scale, which in the case of teachers had the effect of reducing their starting pay by a further 4-5%. Later in 2011, the Government placed a cap on the overall level of qualification allowances that could be earned by teachers.<\/p><p>Subsequently in 2012, following the public service-wide review of allowances, the Government withdrew qualification allowances for new teachers altogether. However, the Government partially compensated for this by deciding that new entrant teachers would henceforth commence on a new salary scale which had a starting point higher than the starting point of the old scale. Overall, the removal of qualification allowances had the effect of further reducing the pay of new entrant teachers by between 5 and 7 percent. <\/p><p>The measures above &ndash; which applied to new entrants only and which were in addition to the pay reductions imposed on public servants generally - were implemented at a time of extraordinarily difficult financial and budgetary circumstances for the State. It is estimated that some 6,700 teachers who entered the profession since 2011 have been affected by the measures.<\/p><p>The Haddington Road Agreement re-aligned the pay scale for teachers who entered teaching between 1 January 2011 and 31 January 2012 with that of pre-2011 entrants. An improved pay scale for post-1 February 2012 entrants was also agreed and implemented under the terms of that Agreement. The Lansdowne Road Agreement will begin the process of restoring the reductions to public service pay which were implemented over recent years. The flat-rate increases contained in the Agreement are proportionately more favourable to new entrants to teaching (who are lower on the pay scale) than to longer serving teachers.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600058#WRCC02400","answer":true,"speaker":"1325"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Irish Sign Language","counter":1174,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600058#WRCC02500"},{"type":"question","counter":1175,"qnumday":411,"qnumall":"[8451\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600058#WRCC02600","dept":"Department of Education and Skills","minister":"Minister for Education and Skills","question":"if she will ensure that Irish sign language is taught in post-primary schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

The ban proved very effective in reducing particulate matter and sulphur dioxide levels in Dublin.  As well as bringing air quality levels into compliance with EU standards, the ban also had the effect of significantly improving human health in the capital, with research indicating that the ban in Dublin has resulted in over 350 fewer annual deaths. <\/p>  <p>  In August 2012, following a public consultation process, new solid fuel regulations were introduced with the aim of ensuring that the smoky coal ban remains fit for purpose in safeguarding air quality by limiting harmful emissions of air pollutants arising from the use of certain residential solid fuels.  The ban now applies in 26 urban areas nationwide, including all towns with a population greater than 15,000 people, bringing the ban areas broadly into line with national EPA air quality management zones. <\/p>  <p>  In the meantime, air quality monitoring by the EPA has shown that air quality can be poorer in towns where the smoky coal ban does not apply.  As there is evidence that smaller smoky coal ban areas tend to be less effective, the further extension of the ban to smaller towns on an individual basis may not be the most effective solution to addressing the problem of emissions from residential solid fuel use in these areas.  In addition, having different regulations between urban and rural locations is not ideal as it can result in different levels of environmental protection and clean air benefits for citizens in different locations.<\/p>  <p>  As part of a broad first ever national Clean Air Strategy, I have therefore commenced a process that  aims to extend the benefits of the smoky coal ban nationwide.  This process necessarily involves discussion and consultation with a wide number of stakeholders, including with the European Commission , relevant Departments and agencies of Government, the residential fuel industry as well as the general public.  Preliminary discussions on issues that may arise in connection with the proposed ban have already taken place with some of these stakeholders.  It is proposed to launch a public consultation on the national Clean Air Strategy next month, and I expect that the precise legal mechanism for bringing in new minimum product standards will be informed by this process. <\/p>  <p>  Taking account of these consultations and the conclusions of the recently published North South Study on residential solid fuel use, I am aiming for a nationwide smoky coal ban to be in place for the 2017\/2018 heating season.  This is an ambitious target but I am confident that it is achievable.<\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600059#WRDD02100","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Social and Affordable Housing","counter":1213,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600059#WRDD02150"},{"type":"question","counter":1214,"qnumday":425,"qnumall":"[8045\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600059#WRDD02200","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"when he will allocate funding for an application (details supplied) from Sligo County Council under the housing extension scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

Therefore, the exact amounts spent by housing authorities on homeless services are a matter for those authorities.<\/p><p>Funding under section 10 is provided through my Department to housing authorities on a regional basis. A breakdown of section 10 funding recouped to housing authorities in 2015, on a regional basis, is set out in the following table.<\/p><p><b>2015 funding recouped<\/b><b>under section 10 of the

The other significant income source for the Fund in 2014 was motor tax income.

This equalisation recognises that certain local authorities, whose property bases may not provide a sufficient level of LPT, require extra financial support.  By contrast, some local authorities receive higher levels of funding from the Local Government Fund as a result of local retention of 80% of LPT when compared to the level of funding they previously received from General Purpose Grants.  These local authorities may use this additional income, up to a maximum of 20% of overall LPT receipts for their local authority, for their own discretionary purposes, as part of their normal budgetary process.

In addition, Cosc, the National Office for the Prevention of Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence, which is an executive office of the Department of Justice and Equality, works to ensure the delivery of a coordinated response to issues of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence across Government through the implementation of the <i>National Strategy on Domestic, Sexual and Gender-based Violence 2016-2021<\/i>.<\/p><p>The allocation of social housing support to qualified households is a matter for individual housing authorities in accordance with their allocation schemes made under section 22 of the 2009 Act.  Each housing authority is required to make an allocation scheme specifying, among other things, the manner of, and the order of priority for, the allocation of dwellings to households and classes of households on the waiting list.  Allocation schemes may also contain provisions for exceptional or emergency cases, allowing immediate housing outside of normal waiting list priorities, should circumstances warrant it. <\/p><p>A housing authority may provide short-term emergency housing to persons who are forced to leave their homes because of domestic violence, without having to assess their eligibility for social housing support or include them on the authority&rsquo;s housing waiting list.\u00a0 Such support can be provided where victims of domestic violence meet the homeless definition set out in the Housing Act 1988, which is not prescriptive and in practice will generally include victims of domestic violence.<\/p><p>Where victims of domestic violence need continued State support to meet their housing needs, housing authorities work with all relevant service providers to ensure that a victim&rsquo;s housing eligibility and need is assessed in a timely manner. This assessment is carried out in accordance with section 20 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and associated Social Housing Assessment Regulations 2011.<\/p><p>Under the 2011 Regulations, a household may apply to the housing authority for the functional area where it normally resides, which would include a household residing in rented accommodation, or where it has a local connection. The 2011 Regulations do not refer to or prescribe a &ldquo;Centre of Interest&rdquo; requirement. In addition, applicants are required to provide certain information on their current and previous accommodation, including whether they reside in a refuge or other type of emergency accommodation and the reasons for leaving their previous accommodation. <\/p><p>My Department does not collate day-to-day information on the number of applications made to each local authority nor the specific contents thereof, and does not hold any information pertaining to the number of qualified households which left domestic violence situations or the priority assigned to this cohort.<\/p><p>In determining if a household has a local connection, the 2011 Regulations require a housing authority to have regard to whether a household member <\/p><p>- lived in the area for a continuous 5 year period at any time in the past;<\/p><p>- is employed in the area or within 15 km of the area;<\/p><p>- is in full-time education, or attending specialist medical care in the area;<\/p><p>- has a relative (as defined in the Regulations) living in the area for 2 years or longer.<\/p><p>In addition, a housing authority may decide, at its discretion, to consider an application from a household that does not meet the residence or local connection requirements.<\/p><p>In considering any application for social housing support, a housing authority may determine that a household has a housing need on the basis that their current accommodation is unsuitable, having regard to particular household circumstances or on exceptional medical or compassionate grounds.  This allows a housing authority to consider a victim of domestic violence as having a housing need, and be placed on the housing list, subject to the household meeting all other eligibility criteria.<\/p><p>In the past there may have been difficulties for separated persons in accessing social housing supports where no deed of separation existed and no determination had been made as to future of the family home.  In order to provide more flexibility to housing authorities to deal with cases where the ownership of the family home had not yet been finalised, the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 was amended in 2014 to allow authorities to provide such households with social housing support under the Rental Accommodation Scheme or the Housing Assistance Payment scheme until ownership of the family home is resolved in a formal separation or divorce settlement. <\/p><p>I am satisfied that housing authorities have sufficiently broad discretion, within the current framework, to deal with exceptional cases such as those where normal residence and local connection factors may need to be balanced against the needs of those that are either victims of domestic violence or are living under that threat. <\/p>","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600060#WREE02700","answer":true,"speaker":"1349"},{"type":"minorheading","content":"Private Rented Accommodation Standards","counter":1254,"url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600060#WREE02800"},{"type":"question","counter":1255,"qnumday":440,"qnumall":"[8217\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600060#WREE02900","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on the policy recommended in a report by a company (details supplied) that all rented accommodations should be certified.","asker":"1280","askee":"1349"},{"type":"question","counter":1256,"qnumday":441,"qnumall":"[8218\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600060#WREE03000","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his plans to amend legislation to compel private landlords to be responsible for the certification of compliance for each of their rental properties.","asker":"1280","askee":"1349"},{"type":"question","counter":1257,"qnumday":442,"qnumall":"[8219\/16]","url":"http:\/\/oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie\/debates%20authoring\/debateswebpack.nsf\/takes\/dail2016042600060#WREE03100","dept":"Department of Environment, Community and Local Government","minister":"Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government","question":"his views on the introduction of a policy where landlords would provide a certificate confirming their compliance with rental accommodation standards, before registering with the Private Residencial Tenancies Board; and if he will make a statement on the matter.","asker":"1280","askee":"1349"},{"type":"speech","counter":1258,"content":"<p>I propose to take Questions Nos. 440 to 442, inclusive, together.<\/p><p>The 2014 report from DKM Economic Consultants, <i>The Future of the Private Rented Sector<\/i>(commissioned by the PRTB), put forward a number of options in relation to improving the quality of the rental stock.

Work is well underway on the development of the National Mitigation Plan, the primary objective of which will be to track implementation of measures already underway and identify additional measures in the longer term to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and progress the overall national low carbon transition agenda to 2050. The first iteration of the National Mitigation Plan will place particular focus on putting the necessary measures in place to address the challenge to 2020 but also in terms of planning ahead to ensure that appropriate policies and measures will be in place beyond that.  In this context, key sectors in the low carbon transition process (electricity, transport, built environment and agriculture) are currently developing sectoral mitigation measures in tandem with Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) and Appropriate Assessment (AA) processes during which measures will be further developed and prioritised.<\/p><p>Development of the National Mitigation Plan is being guided by a long-term vision of low carbon transition, as set out in the National Policy Position, based on;<\/p><p>-  an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2<\/sub>) emissions of at least 80% (compared to 1990 levels) by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors; and<\/p><p>-  in parallel, an approach to carbon neutrality in the agriculture and land-use sector, including forestry, which does not compromise capacity for sustainable food production. <\/p><p>The ultimate objective of successive National Mitigation Plans is to incrementally achieve this vision by 2050.
