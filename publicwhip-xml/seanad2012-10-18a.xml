I regret I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator Ó Clochartaigh as the Minister has no responsibility in this matter.  It is a matter for the local authorities.</p></speech>

It had been announced four times already but I am glad it is now in place.  Any additional credit that can go to our SMEs is crucial.  I would add one caveat in that the Government needs to watch very carefully what the banks do with this.  While it has been announced today and is up and running, I would consider it appropriate that, before the end of the year, we would look at how it is being rolled out and what real effect it is having on businesses.  I ask the Leader to consider this.</p><p>We need an urgent debate on home-care packages.  I have been listening over the past couple of days to Government Senators and Deputies wringing their hands and saying it is terrible that the HSE is cutting €8 million between now and Christmas, which is equivalent to approximately 400,000 to 450,000 hours of home care.  I remind Members on the Government side that this is on top of 500,000 hours that have already been cut.  I listened with great interest to a colleague, Senator John Whelan, last night railing against the HSE, saying this is awful and asking how the HSE and the Department of Health can do this.  I remind Government Members that Mr. Ambrose McLoughlin was appointed Secretary General of the Department of Health by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, in April with no public notification of that job.  He is the chairman of the HSE.  Furthermore, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, hand-picked the successor to Mr. Cathal Magee who, as we all remember, was effectively driven out by the Minister, Deputy Reilly.  His successor, Mr. Tony O'Brien-----</p></speech>

One cannot get away from that.  The one solution is to reverse the cut.  I do not think any of us, or any Member on the Government side, wants to see cuts that affect carers or people who are badly incapacitated, such as the people yesterday who made a great effort to come to protest outside Leinster House.  The cut is being made for the sake of €8 million.  If the Government wants to do that then members of Government parties should take responsibility for doing it.  They should not blame Tony O’Brien and Ambrose McLoughlin for the cut.  The Minister decided on the cut.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party decided on the cut.  A total of 950,000 home-care hours have been taken out of the system.  I will table an amendment to the Order of Business this morning that the Minister for Health-----</p></speech>

Page 38 of the programme for Government states that not only would the Government retain existing home-care packages but it would increase them.  The programme for Government was signed up to by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  Members of those parties should not come to the House crying crocodile tears and tell us that they are railing against the HSE because they are an awful bunch of people who have taken 450,000 home-care hours.  I want the Minister to come to the House today.  There is ample time.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, would come to this House and explain to us whether it is Government policy to cut home-care hours and, furthermore, to ask him to reverse the cut.  He has not been too quick to cut consultants’ pay.</p></speech>

Moves are being made by other countries to seek to make an EU bank debt deal prospective, which would be bad for this country.  We must all wish the Government well in seeking to ensure that the commitments made to this country previously are honoured and that a bank debt deal will emerge that will apply retrospectively to countries carrying a legacy of banking debt, thanks to previous Governments such as in this country.  It is very important for the recovery of the economy that the deal would apply retrospectively also, as we have been promised.</p><p>I also welcome the partial loan guarantee scheme to the SME sector which Senator O’Brien mentioned.  There was a sad report this week about O’Brien’s Chophouse in Lismore, a small restaurant which I had the pleasure of visiting many times, which has been forced to close because of a lack of customers during the bad summer.  It is a symbol of the difficulties many small businesses face, in particular outside of big urban centres, especially in the Slow Food movement, an award winning sector in which we have seen an increase in the number of restaurants and small food businesses offering high quality food.  It is a shame that it has had to close.  Any supports to SMEs are very important in this climate so I heartily welcome the partial loan guarantee scheme.</p><p>I call for a debate on sentencing and the need for sentencing guidelines in light of reports this morning about a disturbing sentence handed down in a rape case.  It is another example of the need for sentencing guidelines which have been sought for a long time.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, is conducting an overall review of the criminal justice system and the penal system.  I am sure he will examine the matter in that context but, first, what we need is data on sentencing.  We do not yet have proper, consistent data on sentencing, which is very important.</p><p>Colleagues this week criticised the Marie Stopes clinic in Belfast-----</p></speech>

That clinic has stated clearly that it will operate within the law.  Northern Irish law is different to the law in the Republic.  It does allow abortion on various grounds, albeit still limited grounds.  At least the Marie Stopes clinic is accepting the reality that faces many thousands of Irish women.  Let us not forget that 4,000 Irish women a year still travel to England to avail of abortion or termination of pregnancy services there.  As we heard in this House, some of those women faced dreadfully sad cases of fatal foetal abnormality and yet we have no compassion for those women in terms of being able to offer them the sort of treatment they wish to receive in this country.</p></speech>

I accept things are difficult and tight and the Government is in a difficult position.  I have attended numerous briefings in recent days and what impressed me – I hope somebody will be appointed from Government to look at this – was that so many of the organisations have produced either budget–neutral proposals or ones that will save the Exchequer money.  There is a kind of bureaucratic hold-up in implementing such measures.  We must examine them.  If we can help people in a situation where it does not cost the Exchequer much money we must grab those opportunities with both hands.</p><p>Yesterday, I attended the Family Support Network in which wonderful people are involved.  Some of them are neighbours of mine from the north inner city.  I stood with the late Deputy Tony Gregory – I was in this House and he was in the Dáil.  He was the person who introduced the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, which generated a lot of money from the drugs industry through the operations of the Garda and social services.  I wanted the money to go back into the areas affected by drugs.</p><p>The budget of the Family Support Network is €375,000.  The organisation helps the Exchequer.  It saves money and it does immensely good work.  Will the Leader please ask the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, to meet with the head of the organisation, Ms Sadie Grace?  It is important that we would have this kind of communication.  I accept there is a lot of pressure but such a meeting would be useful.  The kind of thing that is happening is that grandparents who intervene in a situation where there is a substance-abusing mother are cut off from access to State funds because the State then says that there is no crisis anymore.  That is shocking.  It is Kafkaesque.  It is absolute nonsense.  They should be supported as they are saving the State money.  At a time in their lives when they could expect to be able to rest they have to look after their damaged child and their damaged grandchildren.  Again, if the mother is allowed to visit, that is held against them, but it is socially good to maintain that contact and it can only be done with the assistance of the grandparents.</p><p>Yesterday we had another wonderful briefing about bullying.  A woman from Erris in County Mayo told us about the programme in schools there.  We also heard from a man from County Meath, the headmaster of a school who had instituted a programme.  Again, if slight adjustments were made with the support of guidance counsellors it would make an immense difference.  The measures outlined were either budget-neutral or will save money down the line.</p><p>In the context of home care, we will have protesters outside at lunch time.  I am sure many of us will go out and meet them.  Again, for bureaucratic reasons a situation arises whereby the providers of home-care packages will be moved.</p> <p>I will give a little tip to Senator Whelan and the others who are concerned about the issue.  They should talk to the Minister for Health because he controls the HSE.</p></speech>

One cannot get away from that.  The one solution is to reverse the cut.  I do not think any of us, or any Member on the Government side, wants to see cuts that affect carers or people who are badly incapacitated, such as the people yesterday who made a great effort to come to protest outside Leinster House.  The cut is being made for the sake of €8 million.  If the Government wants to do that then members of Government parties should take responsibility for doing it.  They should not blame Tony O’Brien and Ambrose McLoughlin for the cut.  The Minister decided on the cut.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party decided on the cut.  A total of 950,000 home-care hours have been taken out of the system.  I will table an amendment to the Order of Business this morning that the Minister for Health-----</p></speech>

Page 38 of the programme for Government states that not only would the Government retain existing home-care packages but it would increase them.  The programme for Government was signed up to by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  Members of those parties should not come to the House crying crocodile tears and tell us that they are railing against the HSE because they are an awful bunch of people who have taken 450,000 home-care hours.  I want the Minister to come to the House today.  There is ample time.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business, that the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, would come to this House and explain to us whether it is Government policy to cut home-care hours and, furthermore, to ask him to reverse the cut.  He has not been too quick to cut consultants’ pay.</p></speech>

Moves are being made by other countries to seek to make an EU bank debt deal prospective, which would be bad for this country.  We must all wish the Government well in seeking to ensure that the commitments made to this country previously are honoured and that a bank debt deal will emerge that will apply retrospectively to countries carrying a legacy of banking debt, thanks to previous governments, such as in this country.  It is very important for the recovery of the economy that the deal would apply retrospectively also, as we have been promised.</p><p>I also welcome the partial loan guarantee scheme to the SME sector which Senator O’Brien mentioned.  There was a sad report this week about O’Brien’s Chop House in Lismore, a small restaurant which I had the pleasure of visiting many times, which has been forced to close because of a lack of customers during the bad summer.  It is a symbol of the difficulties many small businesses face, in particular outside of big urban centres, especially in the Slow Food movement, an award winning sector in which we have seen an increase in the number of restaurants and small food businesses offering high quality food.  It is a shame that it has had to close.  Any supports to SMEs are very important in this climate so I heartily welcome the partial loan guarantee scheme.</p><p>I call for a debate on sentencing and the need for sentencing guidelines in light of reports this morning about a disturbing sentence handed down in a rape case.  It is another example of the need for sentencing guidelines which have been sought for a long time.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, is conducting an overall review of the criminal justice system and the penal system.  I am sure he will examine the matter in that context but, first, what we need is data on sentencing.  We do not yet have proper, consistent data on sentencing, which is very important.</p><p>Colleagues this week criticised the Marie Stopes clinic in Belfast-----</p></speech>

That clinic has stated clearly that it will operate within the law.  Northern Irish law is different to the law in the Republic.  It does allow abortion on various grounds, albeit still limited grounds.  At least the Marie Stopes clinic is accepting the reality that faces many thousands of Irish women.  Let us not forget that 4,000 Irish women a year still travel to England to avail of abortion or termination of pregnancy services there.  As we heard in this House, some of those women faced dreadfully sad cases of fatal foetal abnormality and yet we have no compassion for those women in terms of being able to offer them the sort of treatment they wish to receive in this country.</p></speech>

So far, two colleagues have signed the motion.  I am sure all will because it is non-contentious and has been passed by other countries.

It underlines the credibility of Ireland as an IT sector given the many employers we have in this area.  More than 200 CEOs from various companies are speaking at the conference.  These include multi-million businesses, Twitter and Skype, as well as start-up entrepreneurs and everything in between.  It is a very important conference.</p><p>What has emerged in the commentary is the need to institute a technology visa, a concept I support because it is very important.  We  currently have approximately 4,000 to 5,000 vacancies in the IT sector because we do not have the graduates or capacity to fill them on our own.  This is a worldwide issue.  As a method of ensuring that Irish employers find employees with software capabilities, a technology visa would be a way of attracting such people to Ireland.  It is not about displacing jobs but about ensuring we can fill these positions and maintain jobs in our own communities.  It is a very important issue and has been raised time and again in such discussions.  Will the Leader bring the issue of a technology visa to the attention of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and ask that it be advanced in the interest of underpinning our strong performance in the technology area?</p></speech>

No answer has been given by the Government in spite of the hand-wringing on television and radio Senator O'Brien referred to, on the part of the Labour Party in particular.</p><p>A very serious matter arises in Brussels, not only for the Taoiseach but for the entire country.  Last June the Taoiseach referred to a &quot;seismic change&quot; in European policy.  The Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Gilmore, referred to a &quot;game changer&quot; for the country.  We were led to believe that the deal on Spanish debt would change things forever for Ireland.  There was peace in our time, such as Mr. Chamberlain brought from Munich.  That is not the first time this happened.  About a year ago, we heard from a 4 a.m. press conference in Brussels that the burden on the Irish people had been lifted.  Unfortunately, nothing has happened.  People do not mind if there is honest effort or if the Taoiseach is in Brussels doing his best.  Everybody knows he is not personally responsible for the situation.  What people do mind is having their expectations lifted but not delivered, and promises and statements made that are not accurate.  For the Taoiseach it is a question of how much of the burden on our people would be lifted, not that it would be lifted.</p><p>Today the Taoiseach is again in Brussels.  As I understand it, all he is looking for is a restatement of what was said in June.  There has been a considerable lack of action by the Government in the intervening period.  Momentum seems to have been lost.  We are watching and waiting and it is not good enough.  There has been tough talk at home, both in this Parliament and throughout the country, but the tough talk needs to take place in Brussels.  Given the Taoiseach is there, we need to have a debate in this House to examine what is going on at European level, what the Government is doing in regard to the burden of bank debt, why the Taoiseach's statements of summer and October 2011 and last June, are not being implemented, what caused the Taoiseach to make those statements, what exactly is happening and what he is looking for now.  What will be the end result for the people?</p></speech>

It follows hundreds of other often violent strikes that have taken place in Greece in the face of the austerity measures in that country.  In Irish media in the recent past there has been nothing short of vilification of public servants in this country and a failure to understand the significant sacrifices our public servants have made since the start of this crisis.</p><p>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to give us the good news of the achievements made under the Croke Park agreement?  He could bring to light the fact that in this country we have not had unrest of the kind that has happened in Greece.  We have a very responsible public sector in this country which has taken significant hits, and not just to overall salaries - the Exchequer pay bill has been reduced by 17.7%, with €3.1 billion saved by the end of 2012.  In addition, our public servants are now facing considerable demands on their services.  Without a shadow of doubt, they are delivering more with less.  For example, 500,000 additional medical cards have been issued and even with increasing student numbers we have introduced a single grant scheme.  We now have annual leave standardised and improved rostering in An Garda Síochána.  There have been significant achievements under the Croke Park agreement.  It is time to sit down and look seriously at those achievements without the type of nonsense that is spoken about our public servants.</p></speech>

That has been lacking in health care throughout the past 15 years.  Let us take nursing homes, for example.  Under the former Taoiseach's jurisdiction there was a massive failure and as a result €485 million had to be refunded to people.  It is a pity that sum is not available now because it would pay for many home-care packages.</p><p>In fairness to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, he is dealing with the issues and doing long-term planning.  Take the drug scheme, for example, which I mentioned earlier this week, whereby we will save €400 million in the coming three years.  Yesterday health insurers agreed to pay out €125 million in advance.  It is about budgeting and ensuring we use the moneys we have effectively.  The Government intends to ensure that the number of people who can avail of home-care packages will grow rather than decrease.  We must deal with existing budgetary constraints but the plan is to grow the number of available packages so that the maximum number of people can remain in their homes rather than be referred to nursing homes.  The Minister will be doing that during the coming three years.  It is about the long-term planning that had not been in place.  That will happen in the lifetime of this Government.</p></speech>

No further business has been ordered for today.  When I asked the Leader to arrange a debate on youth employment, I was advised to use the opportunity of today's meeting with the Minister to discuss the issue.  Given that no other business has been scheduled, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to extend today's business and have a specific debate on youth unemployment with the Minister for Social Protection.  I am concerned this issue would get lost if it was included in this afternoon's wide-ranging debate as Senators wish to raise a large number of pressing issues related to the Minister's portfolio.  I mentioned youth unemployment, an increasingly important issue, to members of the troika yesterday.</p><p>I support the amendment proposed by Fianna Fáil to have representatives of the Department of Health before the House for a discussion on home help hours and home-care packages.  Last night the Government defeated by 78 votes to 49 a Dáil motion tabled by my party seeking to reverse €8 million in cuts to home help services and €1.7 million in cuts to home care packages.  Senators must have an opportunity to express their opinions on the removal of almost 500,000 home help hours and indicate whether they support the cuts or would vote to have them reversed.  </p><p>Will the Leader arrange to have the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, come to the House to discuss the Moore Street campaign?  An important documentary broadcast last night showed that Dublin City Council and a slew of developers had been engaging in smoke and mirrors tactics about this development.

Yesterday evening I received a written reply to a health related matter I had raised.  I guarantee that Senators who were not present for last night's debate would be unable to work out what the motion was about if they read the reply.  Worse still, an official from the Department of Health telephoned me before the discussion requesting that I be specific about the matter I had raised.  I referred to two specific issues related to the manner in which guidelines for medical cards were being interpreted by the primary care reimbursement service.  Neither of the issues I raised was referred to in the reply.  I call on the Leader to arrange a meeting of the Whips on the issue.  It is nonsensical and a waste of time for Senators to receive answers of this nature when they raise specific matters on the Adjournment.</p><p>I have made a proposal to the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, on the proposed cuts to home care services.  If he wants to reduce funding for home help services by €8 million and cut home help hours by 600,000, he should open up the service to community employment schemes.  Home helps are ordinary people, as are those experiencing long-term unemployment.  One could create 30,000 jobs and provide 600,000 home help hours for €750,000.  Under my proposal, the Minister would save €8 million without reducing home help hours.  I call on the Leader to bring this proposal to the attention of the Minister and ask him to give it serious consideration.</p></speech>

It will be one of the most important Bills to come before the House.  More than one in five mortgages are in distress.  I am disturbed that the Government is not providing information on how the Bill was designed.  Following the publication of the draft heads in January, Simon Carswell of <i>The Irish Times</i> submitted a freedom of information request seeking information on the legislation.  When it was refused, he subsequently submitted a new request.  Of 63 records in a schedule, the Department refused to release 52 and only two records were released in full and without redaction.  According to Mr. Carswell's report, the records that were not released included ten relating to contacts with the Department by the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, Ulster Bank, KBC Bank, Start Mortgages and GE Money, while a further five related to contacts made by the banks' representative body, the Irish Banking Federation.  The lobbying campaign by the banks has been intense since the publication of the Bill.  We know they sought to have the cap on mortgage debt that may be eligible for write-downs under the Bill lowered.  More than a dozen records of meetings were also refused, including those with the Department and correspondence between the Departments of Finance and Justice and Equality and the Central Bank.</p><p>  There is no doubt that members of the public would benefit from transparency on the Personal Insolvency Bill.  If implemented properly and without unreasonable banking interference or the exercise of a veto by the banks, the legislation could mark a significant step forward in resolving the current crisis.  Some of the Senators opposite who danced up and down when amendments were made to the Freedom of Information Act by a previous Government have embraced one of the most secretive Governments I have seen in my time.  Having listened to the contributions of Senators Michael D'Arcy and John Kelly, I ask that more Senators speak their minds about what is wrong with the current Administration in order that the problems can be corrected.</p></speech>

Our thoughts must be with those who will lose their jobs.  The announcement was made on the back of good news for the town, including the decision to retain 120 jobs at Stiefel Laboratories.  We must ensure employment becomes available to those who will be made redundant.  I call on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to ensure everything possible is done by IDA Ireland in Sligo and other relevant organisations to ensure those who lose their jobs in the town are redeployed.  I note the redundancies will be voluntary and introduced on a phased basis.  We cannot stand over job losses of this nature.</p></speech>

If the legislation suits the banks, it will not suit citizens or those who owe money to the banks.  One in five mortgages is in distress and a new group of vulnerable people, namely, the middle class, has emerged.  The Minister for Social Protection has made a bizarre call on the banks to offer reasonable mechanisms and help their fellow citizens.  The banks will only help themselves.  Their directors will do nothing other than make profit in order that they can pay themselves large salaries and bonuses.  Calling on the banks to do anything other than make a profit is nothing short of living in cloud-cuckoo-land.</p> <p> The only way the Minister can help people is to regulate the banks in terms of dealing with those in distress because of arrears and the new vulnerable, namely, people who are struggling to pay their mortgages.  They are still paying their mortgages but as we know from the case of the Garda sergeant who had to seek help from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, they barely have enough money to eat.  The Government is calling on the banks to make a decision but it is the Government which must make a decision.  It must legislate for the banks to act because they will not do anything other than make profit.  Expecting anything else from the banks is not living in the real world.  In terms of calling on the banks to do something-----</p></speech>

There have been many discussions in this House and in the other House on the tens of thousands of Irish people who settled in the United States in past decades who are in employment but remain undocumented, illegal migrants.  Many politicians from all parties have travelled to meet politicians in the US and successive US Presidents on this issue but we stand in danger of being accused of hypocrisy if we do not address the problem on our own doorstep of the 30,000 migrant families and their children living undocumented here.  Many of those people have been working in well-paid jobs and are paying their taxes.  They are deeply rooted in the communities in which they live but they are living under great stress and fear.  They are vulnerable to exploitation and excluded from basic services.  Like the Irish in America they are cut off from their families.  That issue must be addressed.</p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange to have a debate in the not too distant future to allow the Minister, Deputy Shatter, come into the House to discuss this issue and how we could introduce an earned regularisation scheme that might work where &quot;illegals&quot; here would earn credits and that over time their position in this country would be regularised.  It involves a significant number of people.  They are making a contribution to the society and to the community and like the Irish in America it is only fair that they be allowed travel to see their relatives without the fear of being excluded from the country in the future.</p></speech>

With the information he has received from the Revenue Commissioners through the Department of Finance, an investment of €6.5 million in 125 additional trained Revenue staff would generate €100 million next year from the targeting of black market activity and increased audit activity.  I heard an interview on a radio programme this morning with a former Revenue Commissioners auditor who said that for what would seem to be a relatively good investment of €6.5 million, 125 extra jobs would be created but the return to the Exchequer would be up to €100 million.  It would be an interesting issue to examine.  We are often criticised for being negative in this House but we are bringing forward a positive proposal which could be examined.</p><p>While the Leader is examining that issue and if he has time over the weekend he might examine the other positive proposals in the Sinn Féin jobs proposals programme.  As I said, we are often criticised for not bringing forward positive ideas but there are many positive ideas in this document, which runs to 60 pages.  We have talked to many stakeholders on the issue.  We will be raising the issues when the Minister, Deputy Bruton, comes into the House to discuss job creation but we are talking about an investment programme of €13 billion creating 156,000 jobs and retaining 15,000 jobs.  The Leader might read that document in advance of any jobs debate to ensure he is aware of it and we will not have to tell him that we have a jobs programme.</p><p>It would be interesting to have a specific debate in the run up to the budget on ways Revenue could bring in more revenue and create jobs at the same time.</p></speech>

This is an opportune day to put back on the agenda the issue I raised with the Taoiseach when he was in the House with members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, namely, United Nations Security Resolution 1325.  I work with Hanna's House in Dublin on sexual violence against women.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have responded positively to that issue because the Government launched a national action plan on United Nations Security Resolution 1325 but when EU resolutions are passed every EU country must ensure that those resolutions are implemented.  The Leader has asked all Members to put various items on the agenda for Private Members' motions.  This is one of my pet motions and I hope the Leader will look favourably on it.</p><p>I commend Senator Norris on raising the issue earlier, particularly on the day when the man who was charged with a violent sexual assault on a 17 year old woman can avoid a jail sentence if he pays €15,000.  There are certain things money cannot buy, and sex is one of them.  We all know it is called prostitution but I do not see the difference.  I want the issue of violence against women to be debated in this House.  I raised it with the Taoiseach and, under the auspices of Resolution 1325, with Hanna's House which is supporting this issue and doing great work on it.  Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Resolution 1670 makes sexual violence against women in armed conflict a war crime.  Unfortunately, many war crimes are committed against women.  It may not be a bullet that is used but we have seen sexual violence perpetrated against women throughout the world.  I want a debate on that issue.  I thank Senator Norris for raising it earlier.

On that occasion relatives of the seven signatories of the Proclamation were in the Visitors Gallery.  They were indicating their support to have Moore Street developed as an historic and tourism attraction.  Following on that debate I arranged a meeting with the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach assembled officials from several Departments and also from the cultural institutions.  In attendance at that meeting were the Moore Street committee and the relatives of the signatories and it was clear that there was goodwill for the prospect of having this work done in time for the centenary of the Rising in 2016.</p><p>Last night I watched a programme on TG4 which made disturbing viewing because one of the road blocks to developing that site, and I know the Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, is committed to it because I walked the site with him, seems to refer to some ownership of that property.  That balanced and well-researched programme discovered certain documents which would raise serious questions about the ownership and the way it was transferred from one company to another.  That has cast a shadow over Moore Street.</p> <p>I call on the Leader to ask the Minister to come in and discuss this with us.  There is a good deal of disturbance.</p><p>I received a letter signed by the relatives of the seven signatories which is in itself a historic letter.  Since 1916 they have never connected themselves with any other campaign.  They have been associated with nothing and have always remained silent.  However, they are keen that we do something to secure what they are looking for in Moore Street and that we arrange a proper commemoration in time for the centenary in 2016.</p></speech>

They sought to block or back track on the solemn agreement made in June that sovereign debt and bank debt should be decoupled.  It was specifically agreed that the vicious circle between the two should be broken and that Ireland's debt should be re-examined with a view to improving its sustainability.  Despite the views of Senator Byrne, we can have confidence that our Taoiseach and his team will ensure that the solemn agreement or commitment is re-affirmed and that we can make progress.</p></speech>

I reassure the House that An Taoiseach is doing absolutely everything to enforce the words of 29 June with regard to the separation of sovereign and private debt in the banks.  To be fair, he is also gathering allies on this issue.  Martin Schulz, President of the European Parliament, was here last week.  He said the agreement must be enforced as well.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, assures us that he is doing absolutely everything to get a deal on the debt.  He has said that without it, it is like driving a car with the handbrake on.  The House can rest assured that we are 100% sincere about this.</p><p>  I am shocked and flabbergasted at the judgment in the sexual assault case reported on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  A man with a previous record of serious harm and whose mother admitted that he had been a victim of sexual abuse as a child, got a suspended four-year sentence after attacking a 17 year old.  As Senator Cáit Keane noted, he was asked to pay &#8364;15,000.  I cannot get over why there was no requirement for him to attend counselling.  The poor 17 year old victim is attending counselling every two weeks to get over it.  This man has-----</p></speech>

I do not imagine there is anyone on this side of the House who would not support the efforts of the Government, led by the Taoiseach, to try to decouple the sovereign from the bank debt.  Ultimately, that is a partial solution to getting us out of our economic woes.  However, criticism has been levelled at the Taoiseach and the Government following the meeting that took place between the three finance Ministers.  There has been government to government contact and given that three quarters of the Cabinet were in Brussels recently it should have afforded an opportunity, at least on a public relations basis, for the Taoiseach to have requested a meeting with the Prime Ministers of the relevant countries.  At the very least there should have been a meeting held with the finance Ministers concerned, who seem to have taken a unilateral decision.  Admittedly, they are very powerful but it raises the point about how successful we can be.</p><p>Unless we are successful, we will have serious difficulties in trying to get rid of our debt.  We can talk about reducing our deficit to 3% of GDP until the cows come home but if we cannot get rid of the unsustainable bank debt and get it removed from the sovereign, then we will be running fast to stand still and into the next generation.  That is why concern is being expressed on this side of the House.  Whether it is a lack of awareness within the Government of the impact this is having on the public, there is a perception that we are not trying hard enough and that perhaps we should be playing hard ball.</p><p>It is obvious to the dogs in the street that Ireland was used as a guinea pig by the European Central Bank in particular.  Mr. Trichet's remarks recently to the effect that the bank went the extra mile to help Ireland were not helpful either.  It is perfectly clear that there is correspondence within the Department of the Taoiseach that forced the former Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, God rest him, to force Ireland into a bailout against the wishes of the Government of the time.  It is time that those responsible in Europe stood up and did what they were supposed to do.</p><p>I fully agree with all the comments made.  Whatever happened at the summit in June and irrespective of the meeting that took place subsequently between certain finance Ministers, the Taoiseach and the Government should stick closely and rigidly to what happened.  Will the Leader entertain the notion that the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs would come to the House to give a post-summit briefing?  That would allow an opportunity for us to tease out these issues.</p></speech>

We must ensure people go to jail when they commit acts of violence against women.</p><p>I call for a debate on the undocumented Irish living in America, on which Senator Michael Mullins commented earlier.  I attended a rally in Washington in 2006 in support of the Kennedy McCain Immigration Bill.  More than 3,000 undocumented Irish people, our citizens, are living and working in America.  They cannot get health insurance or travel back to Ireland for family events such as weddings and funerals.  Many of them have not been back in Ireland in 20 years.  These people want to live legally and want to pay their taxes.  They want to embrace a society in a place they now call home.  Our Government and society have a responsibility to use whatever influence we have in Washington to support the legalisation and to create a path for documentation for these citizens of our country.  We all know undocumented people in America.  They are decent, hard-working people.  They are our citizens.  They fly the Irish flag at every opportunity and I am keen for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to update the House in due course on what exactly is happening to support the undocumented Irish in Washington and in America.</p></speech>

However, it is difficult to listen to members of Fianna Fáil talking about openness and transparency when it comes to the banking sector.  The point that many of the leaders in the banks are missing is that they were saved in order that we could have a functioning banking system.  I reject the idea that they would tell us, now that we own them, how the Personal Insolvency Bill should operate.  That may be putting it too strongly but the idea that they have the clout that they seem to have is a matter of concern.  I urge those in charge in the Government to let the banks know that we run them now and that 97% is not a small shareholding by any stretch of the imagination.</p> <p>The economy cannot function unless the banks come to the realisation that they must work in the times that we are in and they must help those in distressed situations, and although they are in being to make profit, they need to realise that the clout they once had has diminished significantly.</p><p>I also support other colleagues who spoke about sexual violence against women.  I do not wish to speak on any particular case that is being covered in the media, but at the same time the idea that money can buy a person freedom from punishment is serious.  We need to have a debate on the matter in this House and I would welcome other Senators' calls for the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to come in for a meaningful debate on the issue.</p></speech>

I am sure the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, will be quite willing to meet it.  As he will be aware, she is totally consumed with the children's referendum.  It may be after the children's referendum, but I am sure the Minister will be amenable to meeting the Family Support Agency.</p></speech>

I will certainly raise that matter.  The Minister is well aware of that situation.  As I stated, we will have him in on 13 November but I will relay the Senator's concerns in that regard.</p><p>I would hope that Senator Byrne would find it in his heart to support the Taoiseach and the Government in our efforts to get a deal on bank debt in the interests of all the citizens.  That would be the wish of everybody on the summit that will be held this week.</p><p>Senator Hayden raised the achievements of the Croke Park agreement.  There have been many achievements on the Croke Park agreement over the past 18 months.  We will have the Minister for Public Enterprise and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in the House, as has been requested, to debate the Croke Park agreement and, indeed, many other issues in respect of his Department.</p><p>I note Senator Barrett's comments on CIE and bus services for rural areas that have been withdrawn.  We will have the Minister for Transport, Deputy Varadkar, in here, probably for an overall debate encompassing a number of areas on transport, in early course.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke raised the achievements and reform that have taken place in the health service.  The Minister outlined those, in particular, on Second Stage of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2012, and we will have him in again here next week.</p><p>On the issue of national monuments, raised by Senators Reilly and Ó Murchú, I will certainly invite the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, to come in.  I am sure it is a matter that is close to the Taoiseach's heart and, indeed, the Minister's, and perhaps we could have an update on the situation.  I note the points Senator Ó Murchú made on a television programme, which I have not viewed.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister and perhaps we can have him in here fairly soon.</p><p>Senator Kelly raised the question of answers to Adjournment motions and proposals for home help.  I can raise the question of answers for Adjournment motions at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Ceann Comhairle has taken action in the other House.  We will examine the system and see whether we can improve it in any way.  On proposals which Senator Kelly made for home help, if he provides me with a copy of those proposals I will ensure the Minister gets them.</p><p>Senator Walsh commented on the banks.  Indeed, other Senators have mentioned that.  We will take Second Stage of the Personal Insolvency Bill in the House on 21 November and I can assure everybody that they will have ample time to debate that on Second Stage.  We will provide as much time as possible for every Senator, if he or she wishes, to contribute on the Bill.  There will be no time constraints and any points that anybody wishes to raise can be made by them at that stage.</p><p>Senator Comiskey raised the regrettable job losses in Abbott in Sligo.  Hopefully, those jobs will be replaced in early course.</p><p>On Senator Daly's comments on banks, he will have ample time to bring forward amendments to the Personal Insolvency Bill if he is not happy with it.  On the points he raised on the Minister, Deputy Burton, I hope he will stay on to make those points to her when she is here.</p><p>Senators Michael Mullins and Conway raised the undocumented Irish in the United States.  The Government will continue to lobby on this issue.  Senator Mullins also raised the point on the undocumented in this country, which is another matter in need of attention.</p><p>Senator Ó Clochartaigh mentioned the Sinn Féin budget proposals.  As I stated, the Government will examine proposals from all sources but will then make its decisions, obviously based on the proposals.</p><p>Senator Keane raised the matter of sexual violence against women, which I have mentioned.  She mentioned the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 and Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Resolution 1670.  I will try to have a debate on that.  Perhaps we can do so in the context of non-Government motion No. 9 on the Order Paper at a later stage.</p><p>Senators Paul Coghlan and Healy Eames raised progress at the EU summit on bank debt.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, will be in the House next week to discuss developments at the EU summit.  </p><p>Senator Noone mentioned the banks and the insolvency Bill and those items can be discussed on 21 November.  I do not propose to accept the amendment to the Order of Business.  The issue has been covered here by the Minister and he has made the position clear.  Senator Burke has also outlined the situation and has indicated that it is the intention of the Government to develop home-care packages.</p></speech>

Otherwise, my responses today would be very general.</p><p>Now that I see Professor Mirrlees in the Visitors Gallery, I would like to say that in Ireland social welfare plays an enormous stimulus role in terms of demand.  Payments paid in pensions and to carers, jobseekers and almost 250,000 people who receive weekly payments relating to some kind of illness, disability or invalidity are all spent in our domestic economy and, therefore, constitute an important part of the spend in our domestic economy.  The recent work by the Central Statistics Office confirms this and highlights the importance of both the public wage spend and the social welfare spend, particularly in small and large towns throughout the country.  Many Seanad Members are aware of this in their own localities.</p><p>Today, I want to talk about a number of the important considerations being examined, including in the context of the forthcoming budget and the challenge that budget presents.  I would emphasise that I am anxious to see that people, such as pensioners, who rely on a weekly payment for all or the bulk of their income are protected in the budget for 2013 as we did in the budget for 2012.  On Monday in Sligo, the Taoiseach and I jointly opened the first office to facilitate the introduction of the new social welfare configuration.  This will mean that people coming in to receive jobseeker's payment will not only apply for payment, but will be introduced to a pathway back to work.  If they cannot find work in the current climate, they will be facilitated through training and education.  We emphasise this is for all jobseekers, particularly those who are at risk of long-term unemployment and young people.  Throughout the European Union there is a problem with regard to youth unemployment and in the context of the forthcoming Irish Presidency, I hope to be able to focus to some degree not only on employment and getting back to work, but on the supports Europe needs to put in place in the area of youth unemployment.</p><p>To return to the event in Sligo on Monday, the programme for Government gave an undertaking to introduce a better approach as to how the State engages with and supports the unemployed to get back into the workforce.  The challenge set by the Government in Pathways to Work is to ensure that the creation of new jobs results in a reduction in unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, so that individuals do not become permanently disenfranchised within society and to ensure they have financial independence for themselves and their families.</p><p>The aim of the Department with the new service is to engage with every unemployed individual to ensure that their first day out of work is also their first step on the pathway back to work.  Future funding of employment programmes, particularly community employment, CE, will reinforce this objective.  This requires a more focused engagement with people on CE and greater targeting of places and opportunities to further the progression of unemployed people into work.  Community employment is one of a number of employment schemes managed by the Department of Social Protection.  Other smaller programmes similar in many respects to community employment are: the rural social scheme; the community services programme; the jobs initiative; and Tús.  All of these are valuable opportunities for individuals and communities, and communities benefit from the work and services provided through these schemes. </p><p>On several occasions here, we have discussed the issue of community employment.  After community employment was transferred from 1 January 2012 to my Department, I initiated a review.  Last Friday, the CE financial review was laid in the Oireachtas Library.  I will not go into the background of the review, as Members here are familiar with it, but will mention that community employment is the largest single labour market activation employment programme funded by the Department.   The 2012 budget for CE is approximately €340 million.  Labour support measures overall in the social protection budget amount to just under €1 billion.  Therefore, we are spending a significant amount of money on this programme.  In that context, I would welcome the insight of Senators into what expenditure and programmes under this heading they perceive to be particularly valuable and useful and how they feel those programmes could be improved.</p><p>There are 23,300 places in community employment, including places for approximately 1,400 supervisors.  There are an astonishing 1,136 CE schemes providing a wide range of social services to local communities throughout the country. </p> <p>I am happy to say that contrary to much of the scaremongering that went on at the time of last year's budget, there has been no reduction in the number of places available under community employment schemes.  It is important to emphasise that there has been no reduction in the employment of supervisors or in the number of places.  An interesting aspect of the review was that many of those involved in it sent us a great deal of financial information - Members may have local knowledge of this - and highlighted that if more places were available, they would be in a position to do more for people who are unemployed, for their own communities and for the services supported by community employment schemes.</p><p>The community employment programme is mainly targeted at people over the age of 25 who have been unemployed for a long time and are very distant from the labour market.  Those who participate in community employment schemes receive specified social welfare payments for a minimum period of a year.  They include people on the live register, lone parents and people with disabilities.  Participants associated with long-term disadvantage, such as ex-offenders, people with drug dependencies and people from the Traveller community, are included in these categories.  Community employment is a broad and flexible programme that has been used to address many social challenges at individual or societal level, for example, by organising rehabilitative programmes or supporting communities in the provision of services.  To be honest, many people with drug dependencies who enter into rehabilitation programmes are on a journey that will take several years.  That journey might involve getting an opportunity to go back to education before going back to work.  The reality is that the chances of a person on such a programme being able to make rapid progress into employment are not great.  One of the reasons community employment is experiencing such difficulties among economic commentators is that it is pitched as a labour market jobs programme.  When one looks deeply into community employment, however, one notices that it has certain ring-fenced areas in addition to its labour market area.  It helps people with drug issues who are rehabilitating, as I have said.  It plays an important role in providing a training pathway for people interested in personal care services, including child care.  It is important to mention that such pathways take a period of time.</p><p>I want to talk about some of the educational disadvantages experienced by many new entrants to community employment and how community employment has responded to them.  The highest educational achievement of 53% of new entrants to community employment is the junior certificate.  Some 23% of them did not progress beyond primary level education or have no record of educational achievement.  Men tend to have lower educational attainment than women.  Over 37,000 components of learning were completed by community employment participants in 2011.  Almost 17,000 of them were accredited by FETAC under the national framework of qualifications as minor awards.  Those involved in FETAC, including some Senators, will be aware that the aim of its work is to help people to attain level 5 and 6 qualifications, which they can use to get a job.  Lower-level qualifications are great from the perspective of bringing people back into the education sector.  Those who employ people in areas like care services and child care have made the point that level 5 and 6 qualifications are needed in many cases.  The attainment of such qualifications is a great achievement for all involved.  Approximately one quarter of community employment participants are between the ages of 25 and 35 and over half of all participants are over the age of 45.  This programme focuses predominantly on older, low-skilled jobseekers and requires a type of environment that supports and understands the adult learner.</p><p>Community employment has had two main objectives, both of which are absolutely important: helping the long-term unemployed to gain employment; and supporting organisations in providing services to communities.  This dual mandate can lead sponsors to focus too much on service provision, often to the detriment of the progression of the jobseeker.  The review has gone a long way to redress this.  The primary focus of this Department for community employment participants is to assist them in gaining the skills and work experience needed to enable them to enter paid employment, while at the same time supporting the provision of local services.  Some 19% of those who left community employment in 2011 went into employment, including social employment, through the community employment structure, and a further 7% went onto further education.  In the current economic environment, and taking into account the qualifications profile of participants, this can be considered a positive outcome.  It is not as good as I would like, but it is quite positive nonetheless, particularly for the individuals and their families.  The Department of Social Protection assumed responsibility for the budget of the scheme in January of this year.  When I spoke in this House on a previous occasion, I mentioned that the Department is responsible for between 50 and 60 schemes.  Now that we have taken over some other schemes, we are responsible for between 70 and 80 schemes, which means the job just got bigger.</p><p>The 2012 budget made changes to participant allowances and to the materials and training budget.  The subsequent financial review conducted by my Department concluded that considerable savings could be secured, but additional funds would be required in 2012 to maintain the activity, employment and opportunity levels for supervisors and participants.  The materials and training budget was increased by €9.5 million to €20.5 million through the transfer of funds within my Department.  Sponsors were notified of their revised grants in July.  A review mechanism was set up for sponsors who wanted further examination of the costs incurred in running schemes.  To date, no scheme has ceased to operate as a result of the level of funds awarded.  Twelve of the 1,136 schemes have availed of the review mechanism put in place by my Department.  The community employment financial review has delivered on a number of levels.  When I spoke to the House at the time, I gave an undertaking that no scheme would close as a result of these cost-saving measures and that has come to pass.  The financial review gave the Department a greater degree of understanding, insight and learning about the operation of sponsors at a time when new staff were taking managerial responsibility for community employment.  The review identified significant efficiencies that could be achieved.  A key conclusion from the review is that significant savings can be achieved in the areas of insurance, audit and bank fees without affecting the viability of schemes.  The savings that would not have an impact on the viability of schemes are estimated at €3.5 million in a full operational year.  Further savings and economies, in terms of the administration of schemes, have been identified.</p><p>It is obvious that community employment schemes date back to the 1980s, when my ministerial colleague, Deputy Quinn, was instrumental in their establishment.  There is a lot of administration involved in them.  I do not doubt that the review has helped to identify areas where one could achieve as much administration for less money than has been the case up to now.  It was realised that the pooling of some very small community employment schemes in various towns and communities, which is now happening, would lead to better resources for the areas in question.  In other words, different aspects of communities, such as Meals on Wheels, the GAA, other sports clubs and Tidy Towns, are coming together under a single umbrella.  That has the potential to lead to cost savings and increased effectiveness and to give the participants in community employment schemes a better profile in the community as a whole.  It is seen as a positive contribution to the community.  My Department is committed to reforming community employment, for example by examining the effectiveness of the full range of employment support programmes.  The outcome of this review will help to determine future policy with regard to the role and appropriate scale of activation programmes.  My understanding is that the review will be made available and published in the coming weeks.</p><p>The most significant development in the support provided for family and informal carers in the last decade was the publication of the national carers strategy.</p> <p>I made it a priority that carers were protected in the budget, for which the various organisations which address care issues have indicated their satisfaction.  I am aware that, where somebody is caring for an elderly parent or a child with an illness, carers give their families and the person who needs the care a huge amount of service and love but, of course, it also helps society.  We all know that the fact people who have issues around becoming frail in old age, or children who have a recurring consistent condition or illness, can be cared for in the environs of their own home serves to limit admissions, including nursing home institutional admissions, and is of huge value.  I also know how much carers put into caring.  This is why the strategy has been made a priority by Government.</p><p> We have heard from the carer organisations.  They sometimes feel they are unnoticed by their communities and, most of all, by the State, and that their contribution is not acknowledged in the way it should be.  Caring obviously has a huge impact on carers' lives.  I am very conscious of the fact that when people are looking after an elderly parent and that parent dies, the carer, having perhaps given his or her life to looking after the parent for, say, the past three, five or seven years, is left with a huge void when that comes to an end.  It is not just the simple grief of bereavement because the person's whole life has been focused around that.</p><p> The Department is also assisting in terms of carer's allowance.  There are currently approximately 51,000 people in receipt of carer's allowance and, of these, 20,000 are in receipt of half-rate carer's allowance and another social welfare payment.  Two carers who are providing care on a part-time basis in an established pattern can, since 2005, be accommodated on the carer's allowance scheme, which can be of benefit.  Carer's benefit is a payment for people who have made social insurance contributions and who have recently left the workforce or who are looking after somebody in need of full-time care and attention.  Recipients can get carer's benefit for up to two years for each person being cared for.  There are approximately 2,000 people in receipt of carer's benefit.</p><p> For a child up to the age of 17 who requires full-time care, a domiciliary care allowance of &#8364;309.50 per month is available.  Where the care is full time and onerous, the parent or guardian may also qualify for a carer's allowance and approximately 40% of parents do so qualify.  We also pay the respite care grant, which is paid regardless of the carer's means.  People in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit receive the respite care grant each June.  Carers also receive free travel, which is very valuable, as well as access to the household benefits package.</p><p> With regard to training, carers were identified as a priority theme under the economic and social disadvantage category of the dormant accounts allocation for 2007 onwards.  The focus of the carers measure is to provide training to assist carers in undertaking their role.  The Department of Social Protection is the lead Department for this measure and the funding is being channelled through the Department's Vote.  Pobal is administering the measure on behalf of the Department and is responsible for the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the programme.  Applications were assessed by Pobal and 12 groups were approved for funding in December 2008, although the training which commenced in September 2009 is now coming to an end.  The grants range in size from the Carers Association receiving more than &#8364;500,000 and Caring for Carers receiving almost &#8364;250,000, to small projects throughout the country.</p><p> I am very conscious of the needs of carers but there is also a wide range of other groups, such as unemployed people, parents, pensioners and people with disabilities, who depend on the welfare budget for vital support.  I assure the House that the Government, in the context of the very tough budgetary environment, will continue to do its utmost to protect the most vulnerable people in Irish society.  I am very pleased that organisations like the IMF, which we in this country associate with cuts more than anything else, has spoken in the recent staff reports of the significance and importance of the social welfare spend.  I believe the dialogue is bearing some fruit.</p><p> I am anxious to return in a couple of days, having had an opportunity to hear the issues raised by Senators.  We have made enormous progress in regard to further updating IT systems in regard to applications concerning carers, domiciliary care allowance and disability.  I can provide the detail on that in due course as I know it is of particular interest to a number of Members.</p><p> To go back to the launch of the new service, by the end of the year this will have been rolled out in ten different locations.  The first four are in Sligo, Kings Inn Street in the centre of Dublin, Tallaght and Arklow, and there is follow-on in a number of areas around the country, including at locations like Ballymun and Finglas in Dublin and Buncrana in Donegal.  This has meant a huge transformation in the Department of Social Protection.  The Department had approximately 5,500 staff but, exactly one year ago, 1,000 community welfare officers from the HSE were taken into the Department and, subsequently, we took 700 FÁS employees from its employment services into the Department, as well as 1,400 CE supervisors.  We also took in the local employment services through local companies, comprising another couple of hundred staff, and the Department is also handling the citizens advice service and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.</p><p> I advise Senators the Department has recently set up a dedicated phone line based in Dublin to serve people who want advice about their mortgage or financial situation.  In the current economic crisis, we have two particular problems in this country, and I say this as much for the benefit of the troika as for the benefit of the Senators.  First, we have people in their 30s and 40s who went out, did the right thing, got a mortgage to provide a home for their family and now find themselves heavily indebted.  I welcome the comments made by the speakers from the Central Bank and the Department of Finance that the banks have to do more.  Yes, they do have to do more.  They have to cut to the chase and deal with the difficulties people are having because we will get no debt settlement without realistic, sustainable agreement between the debtor and the creditor.  Both sides have to come to the table and reach an agreement.</p><p> Second, we also have a situation in regard to social welfare, where the demands on the social welfare system are growing.  However, we have responded, as I said, by setting up a dedicated phone line through the Citizens Information Board and the very good website <i>keepingyourhome.ie</i>.  If people are in trouble and want advice, they can ring the dedicated phone line.  If they are reaching a deal with a bank and want financial advice, not just mortgage advice, they can arrange an appointment with one of a large panel of qualified accountants throughout the country to talk to them about the deal, so whatever agreement they reach with the bank is sustainable.</p><p> This is very important.  We do not want deals being done with banks which are not sustainable because, six months later, the deal will have fallen apart and the family which made the deal will end up more dispirited and in worse difficulty than if they had not made an agreement at all.</p> <p>I wish to stress to Senators that the service is now available countrywide, at local level.  People can talk to staff experienced in the area as well as go to the MABS services in their locality where that is available in order to build up a sense of what it is they need to do, what they can do and what the financial institution will agree to.  It is in that framework that we will be able to assist people who have difficulties with mortgages.  That is one issue that the Department is addressing in the current crisis.  The other issue is helping people back to work and education if they cannot find a job currently.</p></speech>

She must feel a cold wind around her Department as the budget approaches.  The demands on her Department will not alone be as bad as last year but on the basis of public statements from the Taoiseach down, the budget will be even worse.  I do not envy the Minister her job.</p><p>I could not help but reflect on a statement made in September 2011 to the effect that, for all that we are living through difficult times, we must always maintain a threshold of decency.  That was said by the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, at a pre-Dáil term meeting of the Labour Parliamentary Party.  The Minister made reference to the troika and the banking regulator.  It is somewhat apt that she should do so.  Her Department is primarily responsible for looking after the vulnerable in society, the socially and economically disadvantaged.  Many in society depend on the Department of Social Protection to put food on the table.  Stark statistics emerged in recent days, which even I find hard to grasp, to the effect that 450,000 in this country find it hard to put food on the table.  There was a letter from the wife of a garda who wrote about having ‘cornflakes days’.  What kind of society are we becoming?  It all seems to be because of the imposition of austerity concepts by the troika on this country in recent years and for the immediate future.  It is obvious that there is a growing volume of criticism that austerity alone does not work and that some form of growth policies must also be in place.  The Government has grappled with this particular conundrum since it was first elected last year.  Despite its best efforts, a range of job initiatives and various other policy initiatives, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high.  I referred to 450,000 people, of whom approximately 300,000 are hard-core cases.  What is frightening and of more concern is that the queue of those who are long-term unemployed is lengthening.</p><p>That is the scenario in which the Minister is now going to have to put forward her budget proposals in the coming months.  I appreciate that the money must be found somewhere but the argument is that the money could be found elsewhere rather than through attacking the poor and the vulnerable.  It was interesting to hear the Minister’s impressive outline of various headings, in particular relating to community employment schemes.  I applaud her for the initiatives she has taken in that regard.  Great public concern was evident at the beginning of the year, which was reflected by all parties and by anyone who operates at local level and is aware of the importance of the schemes.  A great deal of uncertainty surrounded the transfer of the schemes to the Department.  The Minister’s promised review has taken the edge off much of the concern.  The facts, as the Minister has outlined them, are impressive and heartening.  I refer specifically to the fact that there has been no reduction in the number of places available on community employment schemes.  That is the bottom line.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.185" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800003#N00400"><p>Speaking as someone who comes from a part of the country that is socially and economically disadvantaged, like many of my colleagues, I am aware that community employment schemes have proven to be a lifeline in particular for single men in isolated areas who have an opportunity through the schemes to live their lives with dignity.  From that point of view there is more than just number-crunching involved in terms of what the schemes bring to the table.  I am sure the troika will have views, as other European institutions did, about the way this country has operated community employment schemes in recent years.  I am particularly pleased from that point of view.</p><p>The Minister outlined details on the national carers’ strategy.  To cut to the chase, a great deal of the discussion in recent weeks has centred on the possibility of child benefit cuts.  A report compiled by an advisory group to the Minister for Social Protection which was leaked to “The Week in Politics” in September created an awful furore in recommending a two-tier child benefit system.  What is forgotten to some degree is that reductions in child benefit have already been implemented in the previous budget and will continue into the next budget.  That is in isolation to any other propositions that might be forthcoming from the Minister.  I accept we are speaking in somewhat of a vacuum because the Minister is putting forward her Estimates and will be doing battle around the Cabinet table in the coming months.  We will have to wait until budget day before we get an indication of what will happen in the Department.</p><p>Fianna Fáil is opposed to the cuts for a number of reasons.  The Minister is very much aware of them.  One or two issues are of particular concern.  The elimination of payments on multiple births ignores the significant costs incurred following the birth of twins, triplets or more children.  I understand that approximately 1,200 families will be affected annually by such a cut.  The Minister must take account of public concern expressed by all of those involved in the area.  It will create a great difficultly for her.  Barnardos has warned that a third cut in a row to child benefit could worsen the situation of 90,000 children living in poverty.  The National Women’s Council said the payment had become an easy target for successive Governments and that any reduction would lead to further hardship.  Early Childhood Ireland, which represents preschools and day care services, said such a proposal would hit poorest families hardest.  The Children’s Rights Alliance said low-income families would have to be compensated in the event of a cut because of the massive impact it would have on them.</p><p>I have had some equivocation and ambiguity in my attitude previously - the same might be true of colleagues on all sides of the House - on whether one would continue with the universal payment or start tampering with it.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, said that a two-tier proposal must be considered at a time when one has to prioritise spending for families who need the most support.  On the one hand one could argue that it is a logical way forward that one would target those most in need.  I have never to been able to grasp why the computers cannot talk to each other in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on the issue.  In this high-tech age I cannot figure out why one cannot take a cut-off of people who are on an income of €150,000 who clearly do not need child benefit, and isolate them.  Perhaps it is not worth it in the overall scheme of things to separate those one assumes do not need child benefit.  The assumptions could be totally incorrect.  We do not know the domestic situation in the most affluent of families.  Perhaps the wife does not receive any money and as a result the money received in child benefit is badly needed for basic essentials for the children.  I am not sure how the Minister will tackle the situation.  On the one hand, logic would dictate that one would target those most in need but on the other hand one must question why successive Governments have shied away from diluting the universal payment concept.  In that sense, I would have to come down on the approach that it is best to leave well enough alone in that regard.</p> <p> I refer to the disability allowance.  The Government suspended its announced cuts to this allowance pending a further review to be undertaken by the chairperson of the Commission on Social Welfare and Taxation.  The most recent statistics published by the CSO last week reveal that consistent poverty experienced by people with disabilities increased from 8.8% in 2009 to 13% in 2010.  The reality, of which I am sure the Minister is well aware, is that young disabled people on disability allowances are excluded from all the activation programmes announced to date from her Department.  A recent survey by the ESRI found that two thirds of this group were willing to work with the correct supports but employment opportunities are limited for people with a disability.  Hence the relationship between disability and a higher risk of poverty.  Approximately 4% of people aged 18 to 34 have a disability.</p><p>I refer again to the programme for Government which states: &quot;We will ensure that the quality of life of people with disabilities is enhanced.  We will also facilitate people with disabilities in achieving a greater level of participation in employment, training and education.&quot;  There is an issue which I do not believe to be in the Minister's mandate; rather it is HSE-related.  When those with a disability or special needs achieve the age of majority at 18 years, they hope to go into adult education programmes.  However, the budget for such programmes has also been cut.  What will happen those young adults who already suffer from a disadvantage and must now try to get into the workforce without having any proper training?  The Minister might comment on how this issue can be addressed.  The programme for Government committed to the enhancement of the quality of life of people with disabilities.</p><p>The Minister was taken to task last week about a comment she made on maintaining core payments.  In this debate it might be useful if she clarified what she means by core payments.</p><p>The eligibility criteria for the disability allowance have changed in the past year and the refusal rate has gone up significantly.  What is the current status of rejection rates by the Department?  I am sure the Minister is not satisfied with these rates.  Why are they so high?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.187" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800003#O00200"><p>The Minister is very welcome.  The purpose of this debate is to discuss items in advance of the budget that might inform the Minister's decision making and it is on that basis I propose to deal with it.  I will cover a broad range of issues.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister's decisions on CE schemes; I say &quot;Yes&quot; to these schemes and their continuation.  I have seen the richness they provide.  I say &quot;Yes&quot; to the carer's allowance arrangements; there are no cuts to it or to the CE schemes.  I say &quot;Yes&quot; to the measures for pensioners and the free travel scheme.  These are all very strong social measures and give a great deal of dignity to the people who benefit thereby.  All these groups are vulnerable.</p><p>  The genesis of the welfare state was based on a system of rights and responsibilities in equal part.  It is a social contract between the citizen and the State.  As the Minister has often observed, it is a hand up rather than a hand out.  I am not sure this is fully understood any more.  In the fullness of time, when the Minister is doing information campaigns, it might be useful if the nature of the welfare state were explained to the public.  She might consider that for the long run.</p><p>  One of our problems is that welfare is being used to service debt.  According to the Central Bank, there are 130,000 mortgages in arrears, of which 83,000 are private residential mortgages that have been in arrears for at least three months.  Some 5,600 mortgages have gone into arrears in the past five months.  We have a deepening mortgage crisis in Ireland, with 70% of household debt being mortgage debt.  This is where the problem lies.  As I see it, the anomaly in our social welfare system is that payments such as FIS, jobseeker's allowance and benefit - not just mortgage income supplement - are being used to service mortgage debt.  This is due to the economic imbalance caused by the property bust and the recession.  It causes a cyclical problem whereby the State increases its own debt to pay out social welfare that is being used to service private debt.  It is creating a welfare system that is under an enormous burden and is not really a properly functioning system.  </p><p>  This is an issue for the Minister.  The Personal Insolvency Bill which is to be debated in this House is understood to give too much clout to the banks.  I read in the article by Kathy Sheridan in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the Minister stated the banks must help middle-income families who, by and large, are crippled with mortgage debt.  The Minister is at the Cabinet table.  How can she influence this issue in such a way that we can have a functioning banking system that will be fair to the citizens?  Let us not have a veto given to banks in the Personal Insolvency Bill.</p><p>  Senator Mooney described austerity as a problem - of course it is.  Yet we all know why we need austerity.  We must grasp every measure that will provide for and give us growth.  I attended an EU meeting last weekend where I learned that if we implemented the EU services directive our country would gain 2.4% in GDP growth.  I will make the same point to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  We need to look at such measures in order to counteract the very bad news in terms of austerity and necessary cuts.</p><p>  As the previous speaker remarked, nobody wants to attack the poor and vulnerable.  If it were only that easy.  When the opposite side was in government it had to take &#8364;5 from blind people.  I am sure it did not want to do that.  </p><p>  Will the Minister address my question?  How will her functioning system address the fact that welfare is being used to service banking debt?  Why is there no family income upper limit for welfare in order to maintain the work incentive?  Rather than means-test, surely there is a way of finding that if there are two parents and one child in a family a certain figure is the maximum welfare that can be earned, while if there is one parent with three children there is a different maximum welfare figure.  That families are living entirely on welfare without incentives to work shows a flaw in the system.  In the social protection committee we have learned that this applies to some 4% of families in the country, in particular families with three or four children.  How is this being addressed?  Children grow up in these families.  We do not want anybody to get a bad lesson from the welfare system.  If 4% of families have a problem let us address it.</p><p>   Are the various allowances such as those for rent and fuel and jobseeker's allowance being taken into account together when they are being calculated or approved?  Is there a reason the aggregate cannot form a method of arriving at an upper limit for welfare?  I have put that question before to the Minister and would like to hear the answer.  </p><p>  My next point comes as a result of walkabouts with feedback coming from constituents.  Why are people not asked to work for their welfare?  It would be purposeful and meaningful work, the people concerned would be out and about and their contribution would be visible.  Now that local councils and agencies are short-staffed and in need there could be a real benefit.  Fr. Sean Healy has put this concept to us before.  Taking into consideration the post a person had before falling out of employment, for example, an architect on &#8364;20 per hour, that person could work at that rate per hour to contribute a number of hours for his or her welfare.  If he or she was receiving &#8364;20 per hour before and is now receiving &#8364;180 per week in welfare he or she would work nine hours.  Has the Minister given any thought to that system?  I am sure Fr. Sean Healy has presented it to her.  I see a lot of merit there.  Fr. Healy costed that scheme at approximately &#8364;150 million because it would create extra work to run.  In addition, there would be a small reward of approximately &#8364;20 to &#8364;30 per week.</p><p>  There is a debate around child benefit on whether to cut or not to cut.  I believe there is good support for the Minister's proposed two-tier system.  I did a walkabout in a middle-class estate.  Let us not forget these are the people who are paying all the charges and facing property tax next year.</p> <p>The average age of children on the estate is under five years.  I spoke to 21 families, all of whom stated it would be fair to cut child benefit by &#8364;40 per month, provided the savings were put to good use.  I was astonished by this response, especially as these are the people who will pay the property tax next year.  They would love the &#8364;40 reduction in child benefit to be put towards their property tax.  This would be a reasonable solution, given that &#8364;40 per month adds up to &#8364;480 in a year and a property tax bill of &#8364;500 would be significant.  Psychologically, people do not mind if money taken from one area is used to ensure they do not have to pay another new bill.  There is a generosity of spirit abroad and people trust that we are doing the right thing.</p><p> Child benefit is a universal tax-free payment made to all families.  Since when did people come into the world equal?  When did incomes become equal?  Universal payments amount to unequal treatment.  The key issue is deciding where would be the dividing line between those who would lose &#8364;40 per month and those who would keep it.  We must bear in mind the squeezed middle and the wife of a Garda sergeant whose letter was cited in <i>The Irish Times</i>yesterday.  It is becoming abundantly obvious that the new poor are those in the middle class who do not receive social welfare payments.  We must set a figure for how much disposable income families should be left with after paying for essential outgoings.  Is the Minister working on this figure?  Has she worked out what can reasonably considered essential outgoings?</p><p> The jobseeker's casual working payment should be calculated by the hour rather than whole days.  The Minister will have heard this argument at a meeting last Friday.  Is she open to the suggestion such a move would facilitate greater part-time employment?  I am very concerned about the level of youth unemployment and I have examined the position in countries such as Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark.  All of these countries use this type of system as it allows for greater flexibility among jobseekers.  Youth unemployment stands at 8.5% in the Netherlands, 14.3% in Denmark and 30% in Ireland.  Under the arrangement I propose, jobseekers would not be unavailable for full days and would be able to do more part-time work.  This system reduces the disincentive to work on certain days which is created by the current social welfare rules. </p><p> The self-employed should have an option to contribute to the social insurance fund to address the possibility that their business will fold.  The Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection heard a good presentation on this issue.  Is the Minister open to this proposal which would provide a much needed safety net for the self-employed?  Self-employed persons should be given this option, even if it is costly.  </p><p> The Minister must not implement the proposal to have employers pay the cost of the first four weeks of sick leave for employees as to do so would force businesses out of this jurisdiction.  We have listened to the views of representatives of ISME, the Small Firms Association and IBEC on this matter.  Employers have informed me they will source employees in the North. </p></speech>

I welcome and thank her for being willing to return to the House to answer Senators' questions.  She has identified many ways by which her vision for reform and change is being implemented.  I commend her for this.  Senators appreciate the opportunity to exchange views with her on the choices she and her Cabinet colleagues will make in the next couple of months about the well-being and protection of citizens and residents and growth in the economy.  As she is well aware and as Senators Paschal Mooney and Fidelma Healy Eames noted, we are hearing many heart-rending stories of how people in the middle and low income brackets are finding it impossible to feed their families nutritiously.  One middle income woman stated: "There are weeks I can't put food on the table."  A man on low income who pleaded guilty to stealing groceries in order that his children could have milk stated: "I couldn't let my children ask for a glass of milk in the morning and not get any."</p><p>There has been a considerable comment about a recent research paper on food poverty published by the Department of Social Protection - I commend the Minister for making the report public - showing that 10% of the population was in food poverty in 2010.  I was so unsettled and upset by this figure that I read the paper in question to ascertain how the term &quot;food poverty&quot; was being defined.  One of the indications of food poverty is &quot;whether during the last fortnight, there is at least one day (i.e. from getting up or going to bed) when a person does not have a substantial meal due to lack of money&quot;.  While I do not know about anyone else in this Chamber, I certainly could not be productive or energetic or learn or relate well if I did not have a substantial meal.  While I know there is a difference in theory between food poverty and income poverty, in practice and in the day-to-day drudgery of not having enough to eat, one would imagine that they feel like the same thing.  Are they not in reality the same? </p><p>These are the stories and questions that weigh heavily on those who govern.  They must motivate all of us, especially the Minister and her colleagues, to reconsider each day the adequacy and correctness of the macroeconomic policies and choices being pursued, as well as the decisions of her own Department.  The Minister, in an interview during the summer - she referred to the relevant remarks when she commenced her speech in the presence of Nobel Laureate, Sir James Mirrlees - indicated that social transfers could be viewed as a kind of Keynesian stimulus to the economy, as well as an effective mechanism for reducing poverty and that it was critical to retain demand in the economy.  While I agree with these sentiments, if one were to apply a similar logic across the broad span of our macro policies which I hope the Minister will do, the Government would decide to make a substantive investment in a growth programme and pay attention to the extensive economic research which demonstrates that austerity policies in advanced countries between 1978 and 2009 were followed by economic contraction and higher unemployment.  How will the circumstances of the people to whom I have referred improve if the economy does not grow?</p><p>Allied to an adequate growth programme, we need to meet our current troika commitments and obligations of fiscal discipline and the Government needs to save €3.5 billion in the next budget.  As Social Justice Ireland points out in its budget proposals, it is not a troika requirement that we increase taxation revenue by €1.25 billion and reduce public expenditure by €2.25 billion through austerity measures.  Instead, we could reverse the ratio of public expenditure reductions to tax increases or at least consider reducing public expenditure by a lesser amount and finding additional measures to increase tax. </p><p>While much current commentary notes the progressivity of the taxation system, a recent publication by the TASC entitled, Tax Injustice: Following the Tax Trail, challenges this message that is not nuanced.  If the Government is committed to fairness and a progressive approach to taxation, the measures it takes should reflect the principle that the more one earns, the more one should pay.  There are still a number of tax breaks or reliefs which reduce the tax bill of high earners.  If we are to have a fair and progressive system, these measures should be eliminated.  It is calculated, for example, that the Government could increase tax revenue by €700 million if the tax break for all pension contributions was at the standard rate in order that high earners would not benefit more.  If the Minister or her Cabinet colleagues were to choose to implement this taxation measure alone, it would follow that she would not have to reduce her Department's budget for the social protection and well-being of the people by the €540 million figure she indicated to the Joint Committee on Social Protection recently. </p> <p>Is that the figure the Minister proposes to extract from the social protection budget or is she considering revising the Estimate downward in light of the potentially devastating consequences for many households if their protection income is reduced any further?</p><p>I have a number of other questions in light of the process of reform the Minister has undertaken in her Department.  I commend her on the establishment of Intreo, the new service she promised and has introduced that will be a single point of contact for jobseekers and employers.  I know it is part of her vision for reform to move from a passive model of income support to one that engages proactively with people dependent on social welfare but given the economic context and the very high unemployment rate, the Minister is aware that many people are taking up part-time and low paid work.  I listened to the Minister talk about some of the changes her Department is undertaking in light of the additional administrative burden but I point out that in respect of those with children taking up part-time and low paid work, the waiting time for family income supplement, FIS, is still approximately four to six months.  A call to the family income supplement section on Tuesday confirmed, by way of a recorded message, that the waiting times for new claims for FIS is 18 weeks and for renewals it is 16 weeks.  That is the official line.  The reality is likely far worse as ongoing queries from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, indicate that it is anywhere between four to six months.  As the Minister knows, the delays in the FIS processing times are real crises for many families.  As the Minister is committed to helping those trying to work I ask her to consider assigning resources to commit to turning around the FIS claims within a maximum period of four weeks as a matter of urgency.</p><p>On the subject of family income supplement, it has also come to my attention that the Department of Social Protection is maintaining an interpretation of the family income supplement rules that is legally incorrect and I have an ethical obligation to raise that matter.  The Minister's Department changed its interpretation of the law governing FIS in 2009 under the previous Minister.  That changed interpretation prevented a person who is maintaining their children from claiming FIS if they are living apart from the child and the other parent.  Two claimants successfully appealed the Department's refusal to pay them FIS.  I have been advised that officials from the Minister's Department have met the Social Welfare Appeals Office on this matter and that representations were made to her following the successful outcome of both appeals yet it appears her Department may be continuing to deny the supplement to those who may be legally entitled to a payment.  Is the Minister in the process of rectifying that matter?</p><p>My last question is on the changes the Minister promised earlier this year regarding the one parent family payment, namely, lowering the age of the youngest child to seven years by 2014 for all lone parents regardless of when they entered the system, after which the one parent family payment ceases.  The Minister indicated that changing the age of the youngest child to ten in 2013 and seven in 2014 would not go ahead unless she got a credible and bankable commitment from the Government on the delivery of a Scandinavian type system of child care by the time of this year's budget.  Can she give us an update on her progress with regard to that promise?</p></speech>

While the main function of the Department of Social Protection is the delivery of income support, it has now moved into the area of tackling unemployment through activation.  It is also proactive in the control of fraud and abuse.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection is responsible for 87 million payments per year at a cost of €20.5 billion, which is 40% of the overall Government spend.  That is a huge responsibility, and being at the helm of this Department is an onerous job for the Minister.  I assure her I would not like to take it on.</p><p>Last Tuesday the members of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection met with officials of the Department and raised all our concerns with them, many of which the Minister will hear on the floor of the House today.  We had an informative meeting with the officials who outlined in detail for us the challenges of delivering a service with limited staff, streamlining the services and making changes that will deliver a more user friendly, informative and activation service to the people.</p><p>The official launch of the Intreo office in Sligo last week is testament to that.  That will be a great service in that people will be able to go into a one stop shop and meet one official who will deal with all their problems.  Until now, if people applied for jobseeker's allowance it would take up to 14 weeks to process in some cases and if people wanted to apply for supplementary welfare in the meantime they would have to complete all the forms again and provide all the documentation to a different person.  The need for that will be eliminated with the establishment of Intreo.  We have been advised by the officials, and I am taking them at their word, that the Department will be able to process applications in four days provided no major problems arise.  That is a great step forward.  The service launched in Sligo is up and running, as the Minister has told us, in a number of areas but it must be rolled out to other areas before the end of the year such as Ballymun, Buncrana, Dundalk, Coolock, Finglas and, I am delighted to say, Killarney.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.199" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Maloney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800003#Q00400"><p>I thank the Minister.  I will hold her to that.</p><p>The Minister says repeatedly that she recognises the important role of employers in getting Ireland back to work, and with this in mind the Department will be actively working with employers in each area on getting feedback from them.  It will also roll out a road show in the coming weeks, starting with Limerick, in conjunction with IBEC, to interact with and encourage employers to work with the Department.  Many employers are not aware of the benefits of taking on an employee who is on the live register, such as Revenue job assist and the PRSI exemption.  When one hires a person with a disability, there are employability services such as the wage subsidy scheme, employment services and employers' supports.</p><p>It has been brought to my attention that a number of employers have advertised jobs and interviewed people.  An employer told me that on one occasion four people were called for interview.  Two turned up and were unsuccessful, one did not bother turning up and one was taken on.  The two people who turned up but did not get the job asked the employer not to forget their letter for the Department of Social Protection.  The person who was taken on remained three days and then left stating it was not worth his while.  We are all saying there are no jobs but that is going on.  Another Senator brought that to my attention this morning and asked me to raise it.  That is going on despite what people say to the contrary.</p><p>As we are discussing employers, if the Minister has not done so already I ask her to take off the agenda any proposals to get employers to pay the first four weeks of illness benefit for their employees.  While that may look good to employees at the outset, my concern is that it will cost jobs in the long run.  Employers are hard-pressed to pay their employees' PRSI contributions let alone their illness benefit.  That might be the proverbial final straw for employers.  I understand the Minister will refer to absenteeism in the workplace and in particular in the public sector but she should treat workers in the public sector the same as those in the private sector and tell them that if they take time off, they must live on social welfare only just as those in the private sector must do.  That might make a difference to the absenteeism rates.</p><p>One of the most widespread complaints is about the waiting time for applications to be processed.  I was delighted to hear on Tuesday that the Department is making progress in the processing time for applications and while there is still much to be done due to the high volume of applications, it is hoped that by the end of the year invalidity pension applications will be up to date.  It is also working vigorously to reduce the waiting times in its other applications offices.  I ask the Minister to keep the pressure on the Department to alleviate the backlog of applications and ensure a speedy response to applicants.  I trust that the Intreo office will have a positive effect on reducing waiting times.</p><p>I welcome also that the social services cards are being issued.  I understand that to date, 35,000 cards have been issued and are continuing to be issued daily to everyone.  It is hoped that will greatly reduce any fraudulent claims.</p><p>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to take this debate.  I very much welcome that she is endeavouring not to cut the core social welfare payments rates.  I hope she will take on board my concerns and those of my colleagues and give them due consideration when it comes to the budget.</p><p>The Minister will be aware that at every opportunity and in committee I raise the issue of the self-employed and the reduced number of benefits for which they can make application.  I ask that the same benefits be afforded to the self-employed as are afforded to PAYE workers.  I am not asking for a free service but that self-employed people be allowed to pay the same contribution rate as PAYE workers and avail of the same benefits.  One of the main benefits they are unable to avail of is family income supplement to help them earn a decent living.  The same is the case with carer's benefit and illness benefit.</p> <p>I know the advisory group that is working on this is preparing a report for the Minister.  I hope that when the report is published, we will have an idea of the suggestions the group is making to help the self-employed.</p><p>When a self-employed person eventually accesses jobseeker's allowance, he or she is not given a credited contribution simply because of his or her self-employed status.  People might think this is a small matter, but I think it is significant because the contribution in question is invaluable in the context of such a person's pension.  This anomaly is not addressed, it will have an adverse effect on the future pension entitlements of the self-employed.</p><p>I welcome the publication of the national carers strategy, which I had always been fighting for.  I respect the commitment of the Minister to the protection of the interests of carers.  In that context, I would like to mention the habitual residency condition that applies to Irish people who return to this country to look after a relative.  The two-year habitual residency clause is preventing such people from receiving carer's allowance.  It is an insult to Irish people who are returning to their own country that they are debarred from it.  I ask the Minister to examine the matter.</p><p>The Minister will be aware that I am constantly lobbying for the establishment of a central means-testing board.  I appreciate that cross-departmental co­operation is needed if this is to happen.  Its introduction would save a lot of money and avoid the duplication of work because information would be available to those considering applications for third level grants, social welfare payments such as the back to school allowance, social housing and medical cards.  All of the work needed to test a person's means should be done in one office.  It would eliminate some of the work of civil servants.</p><p>The briefing we received on the social insurance fund made for stark reading.  The provisional 2011 deficit of €1.5 billion will double to €3 billion in 2019 if no action is taken to tackle the shortfall.  The contributions of self-employed people would help to tackle this shortfall.  Some people are signing for credits without receiving any money.  They are keeping up their contributions merely to retain their pension entitlements.  A small contribution of €1 a week would be an inexpensive means of funding a pension.  Perhaps the Minister should consider the matter.  These people are not getting money, but are concerned to retain their pension entitlements.</p><p>As many Senators have said, the findings of the expert group that examined the reform of child benefit found their way into the media.  The Minister will appreciate that many scenarios are being bandied about.  If the expert advisory group has finalised its report, perhaps the Minister will advise the House of its findings if she is in a position to do so.  She mentioned that the value for money report on community employment schemes has been completed.  I am delighted to hear that no scheme has closed down.  There was uproar last year.  Many of us attended public meetings on this issue at which people expressed their anger.  We tried to transmit the message that the Minister kept reiterating, which was that no scheme would close down.</p></speech>

We will discuss the strategy for older people in more detail in the coming weeks.  Older people who paid their taxes and PRSI throughout their lives should be able to enjoy their golden years of retirement in confidence, without having to worry about falling into poverty.  That is something we really need to look at.</p><p>I could mention ten more matters, but I will conclude by referring to the school meals programme managed by the Department of Social Protection.  I welcome this fantastic initiative.  As Senator Zappone mentioned, it helps to ensure children get one decent meal a day.  I note that it is operated through the local authorities.  I ask the Minister to consider operating it through the family resource centres, which are fantastic.  The hands-on approach of those involved in the centres means they know exactly who needs assistance and who does not.  There is a fantastic centre in Killorglin that is already providing school meals.  I am sure their efforts could be enhanced if funding could be channelled through the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

I am sure he will transmit the gist of what is said here to the Minister for Social Protection, who has regrettably had to leave.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is a decent and courageous person.  I do not envy her as she faces such a mammoth task.  As I am nearly 70, I have lived through a couple of economic crises, but this is the worst one I can remember.  I never thought I would live to see the day when 10% of Irish people were experiencing food poverty.  That ties into what Senator Moloney eloquently said about the need for proper nutrition for our young people.  I understand she was echoing what my colleague, Senator Zappone, had said previously.  No Department is more necessary or more significant in dealing with this stark situation than the Department of Social Protection.  Ultimately, the Government has a duty to protect the welfare of citizens, rather than the system, which has many faults.  Senator Moloney referred to a series of anomalies and contradictions within the system.  The entire system is rife with them.  We need an interdepartmental review of the anomalies and Kafkaesque situations that do not actually assist the Exchequer.</p><p>I wish to make a practical suggestion.  Somebody at a reasonably senior level in the Civil Service should be appointed to audit the budgetary proposals of the various organisations.  I refer specifically to proposals that are supposedly budget-neutral, Exchequer-neutral or to the benefit of the Exchequer.  I am dizzy from going from briefing to briefing.  That is why I might not be as completely focused as I would like.  I will mention some of the briefings I have been at.  A number of organisations have produced documents to claim they could do a huge amount for their client base in terms that are budget-neutral or beneficial to the Exchequer.  There is a suggestion that these things are not being done because of bureaucratic red tape.  A couple of years ago, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, for which I have great regard, suggested that fuel allowance should be frontloaded to allow people to buy oil in bulk.  It would not have been more expensive.  It might have been cheaper because people would have been able to deal with oil companies that do not supply meagre amounts of oil every two weeks or every month.  That suggestion was not adopted even though it would not have cost anything.  It would have helped elderly people in isolated areas to have security of heating.  Why was it not done?  I do not understand it.  There is a blockage somewhere.  If we centralise the process by asking somebody with the intellectual capacity and the seniority within the Department to review these submissions, he or she might be able to say which ones would be able to eliminate anomalies, save money and benefit the people.</p><p>I will give another couple of examples.  I attended a briefing yesterday that was organised by some wonderful people from the Family Support Network.  Ms Sadie Grace, who champions the cause of the network, is a neighbour of mine from Seán MacDermott Street in the drug-ridden north inner city.  She spoke at the briefing about the impact of departmental policies on grandparents.  Tragically, it seems it is often the mother in a family who is addicted to certain substances.  I do not know why.  This creates a problem for her children.  As soon as the grandparents move in to deal with the situation that is threatening their daughter and her children, the family is excluded from receiving payments.  The Department tells the grandparents that the crisis does not exist anymore - it has been averted because they intervened.  It is sheer stark madness that people who sacrifice themselves and put their well-being on the line at a time in their lives when they could have been expected to take their ease and put their feet up are penalised when they heroically intervene in the interests of their children, their grandchildren and society as a whole.  We should be supporting these people instead of penalising them.</p> <p>I appeal that this kind of thing be removed from the system.  Similarly, if in a situation where the children are being looked after, the grandparents allow the mother to visit, that also leads to penalties but most psychologists believe that, even with a damaged parent, a connection between the child and the parent is good, particularly when it is monitored by a grandparent.  Why penalise people for something that is constructive and good and it does not save money?  Imagine what would happen if the grandparents were callous enough to say they would not get involved.  The situation would be landed back on the institutions of the State and there would be a multiplier effect in terms of the impact on the finances.  I ask that these issues be looked at and the anomalies ironed out as far as possible.  I appreciate it is a big task.  There should be a central examination of proposals to see if they are budget neutral and to implement them in the interests of the people.  I was delighted Senator Moran raised the issue of a centralised means test.</p></speech>

I beg the Senator's pardon.  I thank her for correcting me.  It was just a glitch, the rhetorical equivalent of a typo.  As I know her well and respect her work, it was completely inadvertent.</p><p>It is important that we do this because so many times we are told a particular policy cannot be implemented because there is not a means test in the particular Department.  I have been saying for many years that should be done in co-operation with the Revenue and the Department of Social Protection as then we would have the picture and we would not have to keep doing it.  In this crisis, means testing may be unpleasant but it is necessary because we have to target the resources at the people who need them most.  </p><p>I turn to the issue of carers.  I have the a copy of the Carers Association budget proposal for 2013, which I am sure will be brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Burton.  To my great delight I saw that it went to the heart of what I wanted to say on neutral proposals for building a brighter future for Ireland's family carers.  I compliment the Government on the fact that it has launched, for the first time, a national carers strategy.  I say &quot;Well done&quot; to the Government.  This is the theory and the ideal we are aiming for, where for the first time we commit ourselves, as a people, to recognising the vital contribution carers make to society.  We have never done that before.</p><p>As I went around the country last year visiting every single county I fell in love, all over again, with this country and the wonderful people who are unacknowledged and unrecognised.  These people give of themselves so wholeheartedly and generously in circumstances where there is virtually no recognition, very little in the way of financial reward, and where conditions became increasingly harsh.  As people retire they are not replaced, therefore the burden becomes greater.</p><p>The strategy pledges itself to recognise that carers are the backbone of the Irish health service and are key partners and supports to the health service.  One can see that.  That is not just waffle.  Let us face the financial facts.  Family carers provide €4 billion worth of care each year, five times what they cost the Department of Social Protection which gets €878 million.  It is the same with the family support network.  Its budget is €375,000 which is literally piddling.  I hope that tiny amount of money which does so much good in the most deprived areas of the capital city will not be touched.  </p><p>There is the question of the half rate.  It is assumed that this may be a double payment but it is not.  I quote from this side of the House the late Seamus Brennan.  He was a Fianna Fáil Minister and a decent man, as everyone recognised.  Like the present Minister he had the welfare of the people at heart.  He said this was a direct support for caring duties.  </p><p>There is also the household benefits package and the free travel pass.  We were told yesterday of situations where, for example, disabled people were expected to go from a hospital in Galway to a hospital in Limerick without proper transport.  The HSE provides either a bus or taxi but often the timetable does not suit the appointment.  Therefore, they are of no use.  </p></speech>

Many participants have a great sense of pride in what they do for their communities and for Tidy Towns committees and make a positive contribution.  I applaud the increasing numbers of participants.  I realise for certain age groups three years is the maximum period of participation, after which they return to the dole.  In many instances they want to continue on the scheme.  It is good to see people with a sense of pride and dignity who want to continue.  It is a pity the maximum period is not longer.  </p><p>Carers have been mentioned by many speakers.  They are committed to helping and caring for people who cannot help themselves in their own homes.  I applaud those people.  </p><p>Two weeks ago I spoke to a businessman who offered a man a job.  I know the businessman but not the man who was offered the job.  The businessman figured that he was the man for the job he wanted done.  He offered him a salary of €38,000 and 5% of the increase in profits that he was sure the man would make.  I asked what the 5% would amount to and he said it could be anything from €10,000 to €12,000 if things got better or it could be an additional €15,000 per annum.  This was a married man with four children who was receiving social welfare.  I do not know what he was getting on social welfare but he did his figures and declined the offer of a job that was likely to earn him €45,000 to €50,000.  That is reality, not fiction.  I could not believe it.  The businessman would not tell me who the man was but he still continues to receive unemployment payments.  What percentage of people on social welfare who, when offered a job, respond and take up the job?  For those who do not take up job offers, what is the procedure?</p> <p> It is estimated that expenditure on illness benefit in 2012 will be €847 million, quite a substantial sum.  The introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay, mentioned by previous speakers, whereby employers would directly meet the cost of illness-related absences for an initial period of illness is being considered - I hope consideration is as far as that will go - in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area.</p><p>I am aware that most other European countries, including all of our major competitors, oblige employers to pay for some sick pay costs.  The extent of this obligation varies considerably.  For example, the period is two years in the Netherlands, 28 weeks in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, six weeks in Germany and nine days in Finland.  I could go on, but I will not.  A range of complex issues need to be addressed before any decision can be taken by the Government on the possible introduction of such a scheme.  I believe it is the wrong time to introduce this scheme, which will cost jobs as has been stated.  The Minister will be aware there are approximately 200,000 small and medium enterprises in this country, many of which are struggling to exist.  Unfortunately, many too have closed down.</p><p>On the issue of absenteeism, I acknowledge the part the Government has played in reducing the dreadful absenteeism in the HSE.  Absenteeism of approximately five days per worker in small businesses in Ireland, means these workers are close to the best performers across Europe.  There is definite scope for further management of sick day absences in the Civil Service and public service.  There is little reason to expect that requiring employers to pay sickness payments during the first four weeks of a claim will bring about a reduction in welfare dependency.  The proposed scheme would have a particularly severe impact on small businesses, as most small businesses do not have a sick pay scheme in operation.  It is the wrong time to consider this and perhaps we should wait to consider it when we get back to full production throughout the country.  Please do not do it.</p></speech>

It is overwhelmed by the economy.  It is also overwhelmed by the fact the Government refused to take any decisions on levels of payment last year, so that the Labour Party could say it was keeping its promise not to cut welfare rates.</p></speech>

At my clinic every Monday morning in Kells and every Friday morning in Duleek, I hear of refusals of payment of invalidity payments.  Before this Government took office, I did not hear such complaints as they never came across my desk.</p></speech>

What should happen is that they be put on that pension, but it is not happening.  Those people are being cut off the system completely in an unfair manner.</p><p>Applications for carer's allowance are being delayed.  In some cases, people being cared for are dying during the application process, which is shocking.  I have come across such cases.  Applications for disability allowance are also being delayed.  Yes, the Government can say it has not cut the disability allowance, but it should point out that tens of thousands of people have either been refused the allowance or their payments have been delayed.  These people are getting nothing and are being sacrificed on the altar of a political promise not to cut welfare.  However, it has been cut and the lives of those affected have been devastated.  These are an unorganised silent group, but I know they come to the clinics of all parties.  Social welfare queries and delays in the social welfare system are one of the big issues for everybody meeting constituents.</p><p>Appeals to the social welfare appeals office always took a long time, but improvements had begun to take place.  However, those improvements now seem to have disappeared.  One thing I can say about the social welfare appeals office is that it is independent and is not dependent on the whims of the Minister, Deputy Burton, or the Government.  It seems to be making decisions strictly in accordance with the legislation, which is what it should do, but the Department of Social Protection is not doing the same.   I have seen several examples of this in my constituency office.  It is disgraceful the way the welfare system is being run.  </p><p>The Department mantra is &quot;we did not cut welfare&quot;, but it did.  It cut the household benefits package, affecting the most vulnerable people in society.  The fuel allowance has also been cut.  People must be particularly vulnerable to get those allowances.  A couple was on to me just before I came to the House to speak and told me they have just €120 a week pension between the two of them.  I doubt they will get the fuel allowance as I believe the limit is €100.  Even if they did qualify for the fuel allowance, they would be affected, because the Minister has reduced the season for fuel allowance by a number of weeks.  That is a significant cut in the income of such people over the year.  People who save up to buy a tank of oil have been hit particularly hard, because they depend on saving that allowance up to have a lump sum to enable them buy oil.  Instead of making such cuts, the Department should be honest with the people and tell them that the country is struggling and we need to cut our cloth to meet our measure.  </p><p>Fianna Fáil did that when in office, although nobody liked doing it.</p></speech>

Deputy Burton is not able to give such a definition when questioned.  However, I can tell the House that for an elderly lady in Kells who is saving up for a tank of oil, the fuel allowance is very much a core payment.  The Minister would be better off being straight and honest with the people.  It would be better for her to say that the Department was cutting tens of thousands of people off from welfare entirely, that it was cutting their payments to zero, at the altar of political expediency.  That is the honest truth of what is happening.</p><p>At the election, the promise was &quot;Cross our hearts, hope to die, we will not cut child benefit &quot;, because every little hurts.  That was the priority then that was to be advertised in the papers.  Now we have leaks about what is to happen and these are frightening families all over Ireland.  This is not a question of welfare policy or money, but a question of political honesty and integrity.  The Government parties were prepared to make these promises to vulnerable people who were struggling, and then at the altar of political convenience say &quot;Sorry, we cannot do it&quot;.  The programme the Government is following is the exact same programme Fianna Fáil brought in with the IMF before the election.  The projections are exactly the same.  The Labour Party had the figures at the time, but it just went out and lied to the people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800003#T02000"><p>I would like to remind Senator Byrne that the reason we have a creaking social welfare system in this country - it is like the layers of an onion - is because Fianna Fáil, in government for the guts of 15 years, made an absolute mess of it.  I welcome the Minister to the House.</p><p>I would like to address the issue of rent supplement.  I want to give a sharp warning to Government against imposing any further cuts to rent supplement payments in the forthcoming budget.  The cuts to the rent supplement imposed last year have left vulnerable people in grave situations.  I do not exaggerate here, but a cohort of people has been completely pushed out of the housing market and is now homeless as a direct consequence of the rent supplement cuts last year.  Others have been left at high risk of becoming homeless and unless they are protected in the forthcoming budget I foresee a significant increase in the problem of homelessness.</p> <p>We have a rental market in which there continues to be strong demand.  Last year in this House, the Minister for Social Protection expressed her concern about the impact of rent supplement on rents and argued that rent supplements were keeping rents artificially high.  However, the fact is that in urban areas in particular, rents are rising.  We have a situation where people who have been locked out of access to mortgages and are not in a position to house themselves privately are looking to the private rental sector for accommodation.  On top of that, because of the cuts to rent supplement, we have a growing number of people on rent supplement who are unable to find anything approaching good quality accommodation in the rental market.  In my own area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, the rent supplement limits are simply unrealistic compared to market rates.  The market rent in my area for bedsit accommodation is €674 but the rent supplement limit is €475.   As a result of this, people are dipping into scarce social welfare payments in order to make top ups to put a roof over their heads.  Realism must be brought to bear on this situation.  </p><p>Threshold, the national housing organisation, has observed the low affordability of rental properties in Cork and a recent survey conducted by that organisation found that less than 10% of landlords with rental accommodation were accepting tenants at the lower rent supplement limits.  There has been a culture of cuts and reducing rent supplement limits over the past number of years, not just by this Government, but the previous Administration also.  In fact, the last Government introduced severe cuts to the rent supplement budget and as a result, many people are now confined to sub-standard bedsit accommodation.</p></speech>

That is the bottom line and there is no point in crying crocodile tears about it now.</p><p>I congratulate this Government for agreeing to transfer the rent supplement payment to local authorities and I urge the Minister for Social Protection to ensure this is done as soon as possible.  Rent supplement is a housing payment, not an income support and it should not be treated as such.  The sooner it is in the hands of the local authorities, the better and there is no better woman than Deputy Joan Burton to do that.</p><p>I urge the Minister to ensure there are no further cuts to the rent supplement budget next year because it is not realistic in the current housing market.  I ask her to review the reductions that were made last year, particularly regarding their impact on single people, one-parent families and parents with part-time access to their children, who are particularly disadvantaged by the housing market.  I also ask her to review the rental limits on a geographical basis because there are certain areas where the limits are having a very serious impact.  Finally, I ask once again that she transfer the payment of rent supplements to the local authorities as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I have called for a debate on youth unemployment in this House and was hoping to address that issue with her today.  The Minister mentioned earlier that there are between 70 and 80 programmes under the aegis of her Department but I will only be able to refer to a number of these in the limited time available to me.  In her speech the Minister referred to the Irish Presidency of the European Union and her plans to advance the EU youth guarantee.  In the last week, however, the financial transaction tax has been linked by the Austrian and French Governments to the proposed EU youth guarantee, which raises a lot of concerns, given that the Irish Government has said it will not sign up to the proposed financial transaction tax.  I am concerned about where the EU youth guarantee will go, especially in the context of our very high youth unemployment rate, if it is linked to the financial transaction tax.</p><p>The Minister also referred to community employment, CE, schemes in her speech.  Yesterday, I met members of the troika, with whom I raised the issue of youth unemployment.  They told me that they had encouraged the Government to look into measures to tackle unemployment and long-term unemployment in particular.  They said they encouraged the Government to provide services around upskilling and training, especially for those who were previously employed the construction sector.  In that context, the community employment schemes have massive potential.  The original purpose of the CE schemes was to counteract the drift into long-term unemployment.  They were targeted at those who are over 25 and were focused on the older, low-skilled job seeker.  Perhaps something could be done to include those under 25 in the schemes now, given that we have so many young unemployed people, many of whom have been on the live register for long periods of time.  What can be done to modernise the CE schemes to include young people and to make them relevant to them?  The CE schemes could provide them with the skills, training and experience they need while also enabling them to enhance their communities. </p><p>My party has raised the issue of poverty-proofing on numerous occasions.  More must be done to make sure that all our legislation is poverty-proofed and that measures taken by Government do not disproportionately affect those on low and middle incomes.  We must ensure that cuts and tax increases are not driving people further into poverty.  During the debate on the Local Government (Household Charge) Bill, we proposed an amendment based on the criteria used by the ESRI to measure poverty, so that we can know that measures being implemented through legislation are not pushing people further into poverty.  I await the Minister's response on that issue when she returns to the House.  </p><p>The Minister also made reference to the domiciliary care allowance in her speech and to the fact that it is currently under review.  I have questions regarding the criteria used to assess eligibility for this allowance, and specifically the requirement that the child needs &quot;care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age&quot;.  I am not sure if other Senators have had this experience, but I have had many people contact me who have applied for a domiciliary care allowance, whose child does need more care and supervision than other children of the same age, but they are hitting a brick wall and are being refused the allowance.  Is it the case that the eligibility criteria are being examined as part of the review?  The qualification criteria seem to be especially stringent and many families who are caring for children are very frustrated.  The social protection system is supposed to help the most vulnerable in our society.  If it is not helping them, what is the point of it?  In that context, I ask that the Minister provide more details on the review and I look forward to her response on her return.</p></speech>

Most Senators would agree that she is a reforming Minister and that she is trying very hard to streamline the dysfunctional system she inherited.  That system certainly contributed to Fianna Fáil retaining power for two terms.</p><p>We all want to see a situation where the social welfare budget of €20.5 billion is targeted at the most disadvantaged in our society.  We all know that there are very serious abuses within the social welfare system.  Many of them have been tackled already but many have yet to be tackled.  I hope that whatever savings are made in that regard will offset whatever reductions are necessary in the 2013 budget.</p><p>Senators have raised a number of important issues already but we must recognise the fantastic work that is being done within the community employment schemes.  </p> <p>The financial review of community employment schemes was a job well done.  It proved the schemes worked and that there were opportunities for savings within the system.  There are 23,500 places in the system, including 1,400 for supervisors.  The schemes are providing fantastic services to local communities.  They are supporting social inclusion and tackling educational disadvantage in communities.</p><p>There has been much debate on the issue of child benefit and whether we should retain the universal payment system or have targeted payments to the disadvantaged.  We need further debate and discussion on that.  Not everyone, particularly the very wealthy, should receive child benefit.  The taxation system may be the way to address the issue. </p><p>The Minister made passing reference to the free travel pass.  There is considerable abuse of this system throughout the country.  The issue needs to be addressed.  There should be a modest charge on the travel pass.  Holders of the pass might, possibly, have to register every year to confirm their entitlement.  There is anecdotal evidence that the system is being abused hand over fist, and we need to address this.</p><p>I met an employer last week who until a few weeks ago had been employing 18 people.  The banks pulled the plug on his business because they would not lend him €150,000, despite the fact that he had orders worth €1 million to take him up to Christmas.  He laid his staff off.  They signed on and will receive redundancy payment.  He and his fellow-director, however, have no income and are not entitled to any State benefit.  That is not right and it must be addressed.  I urge the Minister to look at this situation and to put in place a system whereby self-employed people can contribute and have something to fall back on if they go out of business. </p><p>I join with colleagues in appealing to the Minister not to carry out the proposal to place the burden of sick pay on small businesses that are already stretched.  Many of them will go to the wall if we impose that additional cost on them.  </p><p>I agree with Senator Hayden regarding rent supplement.  It should not be cut further.  I meet people in my clinics who are now living in substandard accommodation because the rent supplement has been cut.  The sooner local authorities take responsibility for the rent supplement and the whole area of local authority housing is examined, the better.</p><p>The issue of fuel poverty has been raised.  It is a particular problem for elderly people who are living on the old age pension.  If we can make savings elsewhere the issue of fuel poverty should be addressed.  Additional resources should be made available for the fuel scheme and it should be targeted at elderly people living alone.</p><p>I agree with Senator Byrne that the appeals procedure for disability and invalidity benefits takes too long.  The Minister must examine the applications and appeals systems.  It is not acceptable that people should have to wait six, nine or 12 months for a decision on their application for benefit.</p><p>I wish the Minister, Deputy Burton, well.  She has a difficult task and a huge budget.  We all support her in her efforts to put in place a system that targets the underprivileged and we want to see abuses of the system eliminated, as a matter of urgency. </p></speech>

Táim an-sásta go bhfuil mé ag fáil deis labhairt ar an ábhar fíor-thábhachtach seo.</p><p>  Tá go leor ábhar i gceist leis an rannóg áirithe seo agus go leor ábhar go bhféadfaimid a phlé, ach díreoidh mé ar chuid acu sin.</p><p>  Táthar ag glacadh leis go gcaithfear gearradh siar a dhéanamh ar an Roinn Coimirce Sóisíalaí.  An bun-difríocht a bhéadh idir Sinn Féin agus na páirtithe eile ná nach nglacaimid-ne leis gur chóir go mbéadh sin a tarlu.  Dár le Sinn Féin, tá sin ag tarlú mar gheall ar na fiacha baincéireachta atá orainn, mar go bhfuilimid ag íoc ar ais le lucht baincéireachta agus as na bannaí nár thugamar aon barrántas orthu, agus nach ndeachamar i ngleic leis an bhfadhb sin.  </p><p>  It is taken as a <i>fait accompli </i>that there will be cutbacks in the Department of Social Protection.  Sinn Féin does not, necessarily, concur with that view.  Our fundamental economic model is different from that of the Government and Fianna Fáil.  The austerity budgets should not have been brought in as they were.  Unguaranteed bondholders should not have been paid back, but that is a wider debate.  </p><p>  That debate does, however, relate to social welfare and is specific to some of our social welfare payments.  The one thing we know about social welfare recipients is that they spend most of the money they have in their local economy. Every penny is used and spent locally.  Cutbacks in social welfare have a substantial multiplier effect on local shops and businesses.  </p><p>  The Government's fundamental economic model, under the aegis of the troika, is the wrong one.  We should be stimulating growth by creating employment, taking more people off the live register and, therefore, reducing social welfare payments.  That can be done, as shown in the jobs proposal Sinn Féin has put forward which I hope Senators will read over the weekend.  We need to create jobs to take people out of the social welfare scenario.</p><p>  We also need to tax wealth.  Sinn Féin brought forward proposals to cap Civil Service salaries of over &#8364;100,000 and to introduce a wealth tax of 1% and a third income tax band of 48% which would generate revenue that would alleviate the proposed cutbacks.</p><p>  Kite flying by Ministers about changes to social welfare payments is also detrimental.</p><p>  I agree with what Senators Hayden and Mullins said about some areas of social protection.  The basic tenet of the argument, however, is that if one buys into the model of austerity and cutbacks one must cut back social protection measures.</p><p>  In last year's budget, lone parents were given a very raw deal by the Minister who introduced severe cutbacks.  I call on the Minister to reverse those cutbacks in the forthcoming budget.  Budget 2012 removed many of the protections that were, rightly, put in place to help lone parents with the costs associated with returning to work.  It reintroduced poverty traps and put in place obstacles to work, despite the rhetoric from the Government that the opposite was its objective.  We were making it easier for lone parents to stay at home rather than continue in employment.  Many of the groups who lobbied public representatives testified to this.  I must praise Single Parents Actively Raising Kids, SPARK, who did very good lobbying on this issue.  I am sure they will be lobbying again in the run-up to this year's budget.  </p><p>  Last year we saw cuts, including a drop in rent allowance, children's allowance for families with more than three children and reductions in back-to-school and fuel allowances.  The one-parent family allowance was also removed from people on community employment schemes.  I call on the Minister to look into the purse and reverse those cuts, in particular.   </p><p>  Senator Hayden raised the issue of homelessness.  I concur with most of what she said.  She is perfectly right.  The cuts to rent supplement caused huge strife throughout the country.  They did not reflect what was happening in the market.  The fundamental model used to calculate the rent supplement was wrong.  It was based on an average rent in an area and did not reflect what people were actually paying.  In Galway city, for example, there were caps on rent supplement of &#8364;700 for a family, while most people were paying &#8364;800 or &#8364;850.  People were forced to move out of their homes and communities and the cut caused considerable upheaval.  I ask the Minister to revisit this matter.</p><p>  The fundamental issue is that we are too reliant on private rented accommodation and we are paying too much for it. </p> <p>The State should be providing more accommodation and I agree that it should be under local authority aegis.  We have been talking about this for the past year and I do not see any proposals coming forward from the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, on the issue in the interim.  I would hope to see them as a matter of urgency.  Large numbers of people are on the housing lists.  This issue is probably one of the most common to be raised at all our local offices as people try to get their names on the council housing or transfer lists.  It is obvious there is a dearth of housing stock and this matter needs to be addressed.  </p><p>The issue of poverty which was raised by Senator Reilly is very important.  We should examine every Bill that comes through these Houses to ensure it is poverty-proofed.  I suggest the EU model which we debated here at some length during the year.  The stories we have heard this week about people having their &quot;cornflakes day&quot; once a week because they cannot afford a full meal, are scandalous.  I agree that the cuts in fuel and other allowances should be reversed.</p><p>Tá neart eile gur mhaith linn a rá faoin ábhar seo, ach tá mé cinnte go mbeidh lá eile ag an bPaorach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1121" speakername="Paul Bradford" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800003#W00200"><p>It is becoming an annual ritual to have a debate on social welfare policy.  Even though the Department has been renamed the Department of Social Protection the traditionalists among us still regard it as the Department of Social Welfare.</p><p>The Minister has a very difficult job in advance of the budget.  I acknowledge her efforts to date in examining a range of options in an attempt to produce realistic and viable savings in the various departmental schemes.  Her annual budget is more than €20 billion which is a very large sum of money, more than €20,000 million.  It is a question of how to put that money to best use to provide the social security net needed by the elderly, children, unemployed and disabled people while at the same time attempting to use as much of that money as possible to get people back to work.  The Department has a variety of schemes of assistance for the elderly, the unemployed and those on invalidity pensions.  The debate on the social welfare budget usually happens over one or two days but this House needs to debate with the Minister more frequently on how social welfare resources are allocated.</p><p>In advance of the current Government's first budget one year ago, there was a view that the budget would be exceptionally tough with a broad spectrum of cuts across all Departments.  That did not happen and perhaps we are playing catch-up now in order to deal with some of the issues we did not seem to deal with last year.  My suggestion at the time - which may have been simplistic but it had certain financial merits - was that rather than removing some schemes and taking 20% from some payments and 5% from other payments, it might be better to have a modest 2% to 4% cut across all the payments.  It would have been very straightforward from an administrative point of view.  It might not have been entirely fair but then nothing in politics or in life is ever fair.  However, such a measure would have produced the savings of €500 million to €700 million required and in a balanced fashion.  Instead, we attempted to target a smaller number of payments and a smaller number of sectors.  I would like to discuss this with the Minister when she returns to the House.</p><p>I brought a group to the Dáil Visitors Gallery a few days ago.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, was responding to questions on disability and disability payments.  She stated that approximately 250,000 people are in receipt of either a disability, invalidity or injury benefit.  These people are deemed by the Department to be in some way injured, disabled or otherwise unfit for work.  I really wonder how accurate is that figure.  If 250,000 people are unfit for work through injury or sickness, our streets should be full of people in wheelchairs and on crutches.  This needs profound investigation.  It may be that some people who are perhaps unable to work are in the wrong scheme.  Others may become trapped in what becomes a vicious cycle of being injured at work or falling ill, signing on for injury benefit, suddenly getting disability benefit and ending up on an invalidity pension.  We must ask whether we truly believe that 250,000 people in this country are unfit for work, disabled, injured or sick, in some fashion.  I think the answer will be &quot;No&quot;.  We must then decide what to do about this situation.  We must try to engage with many of these people to see if they can be taken out of the so-called disability cycle and back to productivity.  </p><p>We had very useful and fruitful discussions in this House with the late former Minister, sadly deceased, Séamus Brennan, a man whom I hold in the highest esteem.  He was asked on one occasion how much of the social welfare budget was being claimed - I will not use the word &quot;fraudulently&quot; - because none of us lives in a glasshouse or on the high moral ground.  He was asked how much of the budget was being inappropriately claimed.  He put forward a figure which he said was only a guesstimate of up to 15% of the budget.  If only 10% of the social protection budget is being wrongly or not fully properly claimed - I am being careful with my language - that amounts to €2 billion and it is a lot of money.  We have a significant job of work in trying to re-engage with the hundreds of thousands of people who are claiming unemployment benefit, sick benefit, injury benefit or invalidity pension.  There is a need to encourage as many as possible out of the social protection scheme.  If only 10% of the money is being wrongly paid out, that amounts to €2 billion and it is money the country cannot afford.  I would love to see that money being saved and a substantial portion of it being used to further assist the hundreds of thousands of genuine claimants for child benefit, the old age pension, or whatever.  </p><p>Talking about a crackdown, fraud and chasing people can be very negative but if we can assure the public that a significant portion of the money saved will be re-invested into the hands and pockets of genuine claimants who really need it, this would help our mission to save money.  This is an issue that could be discussed all day but we need to talk about it much more frequently and in a much more open fashion.  I do not believe that one quarter of a million people in this country are physically unfit for work.  I do not believe that these people are frauds or criminals but rather they are people who have been corralled into a lifestyle by society, by lack of opportunity and by lack of education in some cases.  We need to help those people as much as penalise them.  Likewise, many of those in receipt of unemployment payments and jobseeker's benefit, need further help.  I suggest that schemes such as the family income supplement could be used to give people a little bonus to encourage them to go back to work rather than staying on social welfare.  New thinking is required.  </p><p>I was amused when people thought that the Minister, Deputy Burton, had been given a second division job.  In my view she has possibly the most important job in the Government.  She is looking after hundreds of thousands of people and a budget of more than €20 billion.  She needs our support and I look forward to working with her to ensure that the budget is used to the best extent possible.</p></speech>

I raise this matter in the context of comments made by the Minister for Education and Skills to the effect that two and three-teacher schools should consider their future.  According to the Minister, rural schools such as scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara which is located next to Ardea post office in County Kerry and to which this matter relates do not have a future.  The Minister is orchestrating a very slow and deliberate closure process for small schools throughout the country.  This process involves cutting off the school transport system on an incremental basis.  Over 60% of the students who attend scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara will no longer have access to school transport because they live nearer to a particular school in Kenmare, which is in a different parish.  As the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, is aware, a school is the heart of a parish.  Once a local school is closed down, a parish will slowly but surely wither away.  Regardless of whether this is a deliberate policy, it will certainly result in the outcome to which I refer and will have a detrimental effect on rural areas if the Minister is allowed to persist with it.</p><p>Four bus runs are provided for in order that students from Killane and Dromuchty can travel to scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara each day.  The parents of these students have been informed that in the future they must attend the school in Kenmare to which I refer.  School transport is being provided on a concessionary basis in some cases.  I have two nephews who attend the school, one of whom is guaranteed transport, while the other - Dylan - is not and may be obliged to attend a different school in the future.  What I have described is happening to children throughout the country.  Scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara is just one example of the consequences of the Minister's policy in this regard.</p><p>When the school in Douras and Lansdowne national school were closed, an amalgamation took place and scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara was established as the central school.  At the time there was an undertaking given to the effect that transport would be provided.  The Department is now resiling from that undertaking.  The school's future is, to put it mildly, in doubt.  If school transport policy remains as it stands and parish boundaries continue to be broken, the school in Kenmare, namely, St. John's, which is an excellent school and has only just been opened will not have the capacity to deal with the additional pupils it will be obliged to accommodate.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply.  I am sure he has encountered similar cases in his constituency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.257" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1081" speakername="John Perry" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800003#X00600"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  To begin, I wish to give the House an outline of the extent of the school transport service.  School transport is a very significant operation.  It is managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  School buses make journeys totalling 82 million km annually.  In the region of 114,000 children, including more than 8,000 with special needs, are transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools.</p><p>A number of changes to the school transport scheme arising from recommendations made in the value for money report on the scheme were introduced by the previous Government in budget 2011.  The changes at primary level related to the introduction of charges and changes to the closed school rule and the minimum numbers required to establish or maintain a service.  The changes which are relevant to the school in question relate principally to the closed school rule.  The Senator will be aware that, in the context of school transport eligibility, this rule was introduced in the 1960s and relates to circumstances where a primary school is either closed or amalgamated with another school.  Under the rule, as it previously applied, where a primary school closed and amalgamated with another, pupils who resided in the closed school area were eligible for transport to the school of amalgamation, even though their place of residence might be less than 3.2 km from that school.  Where a greater number of schools amalgamated, the central school rule applied.  In such instances, transport was provided for children who resided not less than 1 mile or 1.6 km from the new central school.  No time limit had been applied in respect of either rule.  Consequently, the closed school rule had been in effect for over 40 years.  Even in circumstances where there was actually a newer school closer to the child's home, transport eligibility was to the amalgamated school only.  In such circumstances, the child was not eligible for transport to the newer school.</p><p>The practical consequences of the changes to the closed school rule are: distance is now the key eligibility criterion which applies; from the 2012-13 school year, pupils residing in a closed school area, for whom the amalgamated school is not their nearest school but who enrol in their nearest school, will be eligible for school transport, provided the 3.2 km requirement is met; and in the case of all future primary school amalgamations, eligibility will be based on the distance criteria which apply when the amalgamation takes place and attendance at the nearest school.</p><p>In the context of the Department of Education and Skill's planning of primary school infrastructure, school accommodation needs in each area are assessed on the basis of local demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  The changes announced to primary school transport services are in line with this approach and will result in a more efficient and cost-effective scheme.  While there will be a transitional period in which children in the same family or area may be eligible for transport to different schools, ultimately eligibility for school transport will be easier to determine and the scheme will be simpler and more transparent for families and schools.</p><p>It is important to note that eligible children who are already attending an amalgamated school will retain their transport eligibility in order to allow them. providing there is no change in their circumstances, to complete their education at that school.  In cases in which families are not eligible for school transport, they may apply for transport on a concessionary basis, subject to a number of conditions detailed in the scheme.  I am pleased to advise that the cost of concessionary tickets was reduced to €100 per annum by the Government from the commencement of the 2012-13 school year.  This is the same charge as that which applies in respect of eligible tickets.</p><p>Given that the terms of the scheme are being applied equitably on a national basis, there is no scope for reversing the changes to which I refer.  Under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of €17 million in the school transport budget and all of the measures I have outlined, including the changes to the closed school rule, are an integral part of this.  It makes economic sense that, when fully implemented, the provision of school transport to the nearest school will reduce the overall cost of school transport services.</p></speech>

Perhaps he might convey to those who wrote the reply he read - a Labour Party Senator referred to this on the Order of Business this morning - that I asked a specific question about a particular school.  I did not receive a reply to that question; the reply only contains a one-line allusion to the school to which I refer.  In the remainder of the reply phrases such as "In cases where families are not eligible for school transport, they may apply for transport on a concessionary basis" and "children in the same family or area may be eligible for transport to different schools" are used.</p></speech>

What we are talking about is parishes being allowed to wither away as a result of schools being closed.  The reply from the Department falls very short in answering the question I asked.  Perhaps the Minister of State might convey my feelings on the matter to the Minister.  I am sure I could have obtained most of the information contained in the reply which the Minister of State was asked to read on the Minister's behalf on the Department's website.

I raise the Department’s current position on the allocation of teachers to Ratoath junior national school.  An unprecedented number of parents have been in touch with my colleague in Ratoath, Councillor Nick Killian, and a number of parents have been in touch with me.  They are most concerned at a decision of the Department, which I believe is under review today, to remove a teacher from the school.  What happened in Ratoath junior national school is that 470 names were on the school roll on the first day of term in September.  Ten of those names were reported to the National Education Welfare Board for various reasons which resulted in the school numbers being 460, seven short of the teacher allocation required to maintain existing staff numbers.  If the decision is upheld by the Department to remove a teacher based on the lower numbers, one teacher must go and one of five junior infants’ classes in the school must be reallocated to the other four classes.  That is not fair.  It is not right.</p><p>It is particularly unfair at this stage of the school year when children have settled into their classes if they have to be allocated to another class.  That would also result in one class having at least 37 pupils and an empty classroom within the school.  It might also have implications for next year in terms of whether the school would be in a position to take five classes.  The school is already over the threshold for four classes in the coming year.  It might not yet have reached five but it expects to do so.  The school might not be able to take all of the pupils that wish to go to it next year.  Therefore, if the decision is not reversed there might be pupils in Ratoath who are not accepted into the junior infants’ class in the school next year.  The school has already lost four teachers in the areas of resource teaching and language support and is in danger of losing a fifth mainstream teacher.</p><p>One of the criteria used in assessing such decisions is whether the post relates to a mainstream teacher.  I urge the Minister to take that into account and to take the particular circumstances of Ratoath into account.  It is a growing area.  The pupils are already six weeks’ into their school year.  I urge him to please leave the teacher in place to give the children the best possible education.</p></speech>

The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on the Department's website.  The staffing schedule is the mechanism used for the allocation of classroom teachers to all primary schools.  It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location.  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.</p><p>Classroom teachers are allocated under the staffing schedule based on the pupil enrolments for the previous 30 September.  While mainstream staffing for any school year is based on the previous September's enrolment, there is a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment.  The retention of such posts in the current school year is subject to schools having achieved their projected enrolment on 30 September.  If the enrolment is not achieved the post allocated on developing grounds is suppressed.</p><p>The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing circular 0007/2012 which is available on the Department's website.  The appeal criteria include provision for schools that have been granted a post under the developing school criterion.  Such schools may lodge an appeal on the basis that the pupils that failed to enrol as projected by 30 September 2012 are likely to be enrolled by December 2012.  A post allocated by the appeal board under this criterion will be sanctioned on a provisional basis, subject to confirmation of the required enrolment being achieved before 31 December 2012.</p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy had an enrolment of 442 pupils on 30 September 2011.  As a consequence, the school's staffing for the 2012-13 school year is a principal and 16 classroom teachers.  The school has an additional five support posts for learning and language support and resource teaching.</p><p>The school applied for a developing school post based on a projected enrolment of 478 pupils at September 2012 and this post was conditionally approved by the Department on 6 March 2012.  However, I understand that the required projected enrolment was not achieved by 30 September.  The school was therefore informed that the post was being suppressed in the normal manner.  The school has appealed the decision to the primary staffing appeal board.  The appeal board is holding its meeting today, 18 October, and it will consider the appeal from the school in question in this process.  The board of management of the school will be notified of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible.  The appeal board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  I thank the Deputy again for giving me an opportunity to update the House on the matter.</p></speech>

I hope the Department has the correct figures.  I will check the position immediately with the school.</p><p>My child started school this year in the junior infants’ class in another school in County Meath.  I can only imagine the disruption that would be caused to her by having to move classes and perhaps having to go into a class with 37 pupils because of what might be an arbitrary decision by the Department.  I urge the Department and the appeal board to take into account the factors I have raised on the school and the special circumstances that apply.  The school has lost four teachers and is in a developing area.  What is proposed is not fair on the small children involved.</p></speech>

I apologise for the mix-up that occurred previously.  The Minister is familiar with the plans and proposals on the rejuvenation and re-establishment of the Irish sugar industry and its potential for jobs.</p> <p>Most independent people believe there is the possibility of creating 4,500 jobs over time in this industry time.  We import 80% of our sugar from British Sugar.  The Minister is entering into a phase of serious negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform.  As the compensation scheme is due to end from 2015 I ask the Minister to give me an update on whether the Government is seeking 1% of the quota for Ireland.  I read with concern today in the farming supplement in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>about a decision made by the European Union Commission to reduce the maximum target for crop-based biofuels and bio-liquids to 5%.  Will that have any effect?  </p><p> I heard the Minister say on RTE radio recently that he is broadly supportive of this move.  It is a major opportunity for us.  Thousands of people here are interested in it.  It would provide an additional line to our farmers and those involved in tillage also, particularly in the event of inclement weather which we have experienced recently.  We have grown sugar beet here.  It can be done, and it would have the effect of reducing costs for many companies here that use sugar as a main part of their ingredients, both in the drinks industries and others, which import from other countries.  I am interested to hear the Minister's views.  Will this be part of the Government's negotiations on the CAP?  I thank the Minister for attending.</p></speech>

There are many interests that for some time have been discussing whether it is possible for Ireland to start processing sugar again from sugar beet.  As somebody who has driven many tractors and trailers with sugar beet into what was previously the Mallow factory, when I worked on a farm in Mallow, and on our farm at home for a while I have a good appreciation of how important the sugar industry is for the tillage sector as a break crop, a cash crop, a crop that does not rely on any payments and a crop that produces cash at a time of year when farmers want it, which is in the autumn in the build up to Christmas.</p><p>I have been as supportive as I can be of both feasibility studies that have been put together in the past six months from two different groups, both with a view to exploring the possibility of growing sugar beet for sugar processing in Ireland and putting a business case together for the redevelopment of a sugar processing sector.  Both of those feasibility studies were impressive, and I spent quite some time talking through them and so on with both teams.</p><p>It is important for me to emphasise that if we are to have a sugar industry re-emerge here we must ensure that it is an industry built on solid foundations in terms of the financing of it and the business plan for it.  It is something I would really like to see happen but the business case is the most important issue.  My job as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is to ensure that if a business case can be made for spending the guts of €200 million or €300 million on putting a new processing facility in place Ireland has a quota to be able to produce sugar, if there is still a quota regime, or that we can move away from the limitations of a sugar quota regime within the European Union as soon as possible.</p><p>In 2005, when there was a fundamental change in EU sugar policy, Ireland got out of the sugar processing business and significant compensation was paid to encourage us to do that.  I not want to go into the history of that but I had a big problem with it at the time.</p></speech>

That would leave Ireland, or anybody else who wants to process sugar, free to do so and take their chances on the open market.  That will not happen, however, because there are very powerful countries in the EU which want to see a continuance of sugar quotas beyond 2015.  As a realist I believe that is likely to happen, perhaps until 2017 or 2018, and therefore I have made the case, both on and off the record, to the Commissioner in Council meetings and outside them that if we are to move a sugar quota regime beyond 2015 countries like Ireland, which is trying to put a case together for processing sugar again, should be facilitated in doing that if there is to be an increase in EU sugar quotas, which I believe there must be because there was a big sugar shortage last year.</p><p>In terms of the calculation for the people who are trying to put this case together and who have gone a long way in terms of getting investors, picking a suitable site and talking to farmers about their capacity for producing sugar, a great deal of work has gone on in this area and much credit is due to a number of people, in particular Michael Hoey from Country Crest and others who have shown leadership in this area.  They need to know that Government is supportive of them in terms of trying to access quota for them but, ultimately, they will have to make the numbers add up in terms of making this work.  That is possible.  The rule of thumb is that if the price of processed sugar globally remains over €500 a tonne, the feasibility studies suggest that this is a viable proposition even given the capital expenditure that is required to build that processing facility.  </p><p>The judgment call that must be made, however, is the impact on world sugar prices when quotas are lifted in the EU, potentially after 2015, 2017 or 2018, and whether there will there be a significant increase in production of sugar across the European Union which may reduce the actual price of processed sugar internationally because it is very difficult to compete in Europe with sugar that has been processed from sugar cane in Brazil, for example, just as it is difficult to compete with sugar cane on a series of other levels from an ethanol perspective as well.</p><p>My view is that my job is to be supportive of the people who are working hard to make a business case for a sugar processing and ethanol and biofuel operation around that and to support them in that but also to ensure that if and when that happens, it is built on solid foundations that will last for decades rather than being an industry that starts with a lot of positivity but cannot keep going because it is unable to compete with other parts of the world.  There is a series of issues at play here but the fact that we are even talking about this and that people have put a significant amount of time and money into putting together very credible feasibility studies is a significant step in the right direction.</p></speech>

Motion 9, proposed by two Independent colleagues and myself, condemns sexual violence in conflict, affirms Ireland's commitment to the UN Security Council resolutions on women, peace and security and to playing a role in efforts to end sexual violence, and supports the efforts of organisations to draw attention to and denounce sexual violence.  So far, two colleagues have signed the motion.  I am sure all will because it is non-contentious and has been passed by other countries.

It underlines the credibility of Ireland as an IT sector given the many employers we have in this area.  More than 200 CEOs from various companies are speaking at the conference.  These include multi-million businesses, Twitter and Skype, as well as start-up entrepreneurs and everything in between.  It is a very important conference.</p><p>What has emerged in the commentary is the need to institute a technology visa, a concept I support because it is very important.  We  currently have approximately 4,000 to 5,000 vacancies in the IT sector because we do not have the graduates or capacity to fill them on our own.  This is a worldwide issue.  As a method of ensuring that Irish employers find employees with software capabilities, a technology visa would be a way of attracting such people to Ireland.  It is not about displacing jobs but about ensuring we can fill these positions and maintain jobs in our own communities.  It is a very important issue and has been raised time and again in such discussions.  Will the Leader bring the issue of a technology visa to the attention of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and ask that it be advanced in the interest of underpinning our strong performance in the technology area?</p></speech>

No answer has been given by the Government in spite of the hand-wringing on television and radio Senator O'Brien referred to, on the part of the Labour Party in particular.</p><p>A very serious matter arises in Brussels, not only for the Taoiseach but for the entire country.  Last June the Taoiseach referred to a &quot;seismic change&quot; in European policy.  The Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Gilmore, referred to a &quot;game changer&quot; for the country.  We were led to believe that the deal on Spanish debt would change things forever for Ireland.  There was peace in our time, such as Mr. Chamberlain brought from Munich.  That is not the first time this happened.  About a year ago, we heard from a 4 a.m. press conference in Brussels that the burden on the Irish people had been lifted.  Unfortunately, nothing has happened.  People do not mind if there is honest effort or if the Taoiseach is in Brussels doing his best.  Everybody knows he is not personally responsible for the situation.  What people do mind is having their expectations lifted but not delivered, and promises and statements made that are not accurate.  For the Taoiseach it is a question of how much of the burden on our people would be lifted, not that it would be lifted.</p><p>Today the Taoiseach is again in Brussels.  As I understand it, all he is looking for is a restatement of what was said in June.  There has been a considerable lack of action by the Government in the intervening period.  Momentum seems to have been lost.  We are watching and waiting and it is not good enough.  There has been tough talk at home, both in this Parliament and throughout the country, but the tough talk needs to take place in Brussels.  Given the Taoiseach is there, we need to have a debate in this House to examine what is going on at European level, what the Government is doing in regard to the burden of bank debt, why the Taoiseach's statements of summer and October 2011 and last June, are not being implemented, what caused the Taoiseach to make those statements, what exactly is happening and what he is looking for now.  What will be the end result for the people?</p></speech>

It follows hundreds of other often violent strikes that have taken place in Greece in the face of the austerity measures in that country.  In Irish media in the recent past there has been nothing short of vilification of public servants in this country and a failure to understand the significant sacrifices our public servants have made since the start of this crisis.</p><p>Will the Leader invite the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, to give us the good news of the achievements made under the Croke Park agreement?  He could bring to light the fact that in this country we have not had unrest of the kind that has happened in Greece.  We have a very responsible public sector in this country which has taken significant hits, and not just to overall salaries - the Exchequer pay bill has been reduced by 17.7%, with €3.1 billion saved by the end of 2012.  In addition, our public servants are now facing considerable demands on their services.  Without a shadow of doubt, they are delivering more with less.  For example, 500,000 additional medical cards have been issued and even with increasing student numbers we have introduced a single grant scheme.  We now have annual leave standardised and improved rostering in An Garda Síochána.  There have been significant achievements under the Croke Park agreement.  It is time to sit down and look seriously at those achievements without the type of nonsense that is spoken about our public servants.</p></speech>

That has been lacking in health care throughout the past 15 years.  Let us take nursing homes, for example.  Under the former Taoiseach's jurisdiction there was a massive failure and as a result €485 million had to be refunded to people.  It is a pity that sum is not available now because it would pay for many home-care packages.</p><p>In fairness to the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, he is dealing with the issues and doing long-term planning.  Take the drug scheme, for example, which I mentioned earlier this week, whereby we will save €400 million in the coming three years.  Yesterday health insurers agreed to pay out €125 million in advance.  It is about budgeting and ensuring we use the moneys we have effectively.  The Government intends to ensure that the number of people who can avail of home-care packages will grow rather than decrease.  We must deal with existing budgetary constraints but the plan is to grow the number of available packages so that the maximum number of people can remain in their homes rather than be referred to nursing homes.  The Minister will be doing that during the coming three years.  It is about the long-term planning that had not been in place.  That will happen in the lifetime of this Government.</p></speech>

No further business has been ordered for today.  When I asked the Leader to arrange a debate on youth employment, I was advised to use the opportunity of today's meeting with the Minister to discuss the issue.  Given that no other business has been scheduled, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to extend today's business and have a specific debate on youth unemployment with the Minister for Social Protection.

Last night the Government defeated by 78 votes to 49 a Dáil motion tabled by my party seeking to reverse €8 million in cuts to home help services and €1.7 million in cuts to home care packages.  Senators must have an opportunity to express their opinions on the removal of almost 500,000 home help hours and indicate whether they support the cuts or would vote to have them reversed.  </p><p>Will the Leader arrange to have the Minister for the Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, come to the House to discuss the Moore Street campaign?  An important documentary broadcast last night showed that Dublin City Council and a slew of developers had been engaging in smoke and mirrors tactics about this development.  The Minister should outline to the House the current status of the national monument on Moore Street.</p></speech>

Yesterday evening I received a written reply to a health related matter I had raised.  I guarantee that Senators who were not present for last night's debate would be unable to work out what the motion was about if they read the reply.  Worse still, an official from the Department of Health telephoned me before the discussion requesting that I be specific about the matter I had raised.  I referred to two specific issues related to the manner in which guidelines for medical cards were being interpreted by the primary care reimbursement service.  Neither of the issues I raised was referred to in the reply.  I call on the Leader to arrange a meeting of the Whips on the issue.  It is nonsensical and a waste of time for Senators to receive answers of this nature when they raise specific matters on the Adjournment.</p><p>I have made a proposal to the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, on the proposed cuts to home care services.  If he wants to reduce funding for home help services by €8 million and cut home help hours by 600,000, he should open up the service to community employment schemes.  Home helps are ordinary people, as are those experiencing long-term unemployment.  One could create 30,000 jobs and provide 600,000 home help hours for €750,000.  Under my proposal, the Minister would save €8 million without reducing home help hours.  I call on the Leader to bring this proposal to the attention of the Minister and ask him to give it serious consideration.</p></speech>

It will be one of the most important Bills to come before the House.  More than one in five mortgages are in distress.  I am disturbed that the Government is not providing information on how the Bill was designed.  Following the publication of the draft heads in January, Simon Carswell of <i>The Irish Times</i> submitted a freedom of information request seeking information on the legislation.  When it was refused, he subsequently submitted a new request.  Of 63 records in a schedule, the Department refused to release 52 and only two records were released in full and without redaction.  According to Mr. Carswell's report, the records that were not released included ten relating to contacts with the Department by the Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks, Ulster Bank, KBC Bank, Start Mortgages and GE Money, while a further five related to contacts made by the banks' representative body, the Irish Banking Federation.  The lobbying campaign by the banks has been intense since the publication of the Bill.  We know they sought to have the cap on mortgage debt that may be eligible for write-downs under the Bill lowered.  More than a dozen records of meetings were also refused, including those with the Department and correspondence between the Departments of Finance and Justice and Equality and the Central Bank.</p><p>  There is no doubt that members of the public would benefit from transparency on the Personal Insolvency Bill.  If implemented properly and without unreasonable banking interference or the exercise of a veto by the banks, the legislation could mark a significant step forward in resolving the current crisis.  Some of the Senators opposite who danced up and down when amendments were made to the Freedom of Information Act by a previous Government have embraced one of the most secretive Governments I have seen in my time.  Having listened to the contributions of Senators Michael D'Arcy and John Kelly, I ask that more Senators speak their minds about what is wrong with the current Administration in order that the problems can be corrected.</p></speech>

Our thoughts must be with those who will lose their jobs.  The announcement was made on the back of good news for the town, including the decision to retain 120 jobs at Stiefel Laboratories.  We must ensure employment becomes available to those who will be made redundant.  I call on the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to ensure everything possible is done by IDA Ireland in Sligo and other relevant organisations to ensure those who lose their jobs in the town are redeployed.  I note the redundancies will be voluntary and introduced on a phased basis.  We cannot stand over job losses of this nature.</p></speech>

If the legislation suits the banks, it will not suit citizens or those who owe money to the banks.  One in five mortgages is in distress and a new group of vulnerable people, namely, the middle class, has emerged.  The Minister for Social Protection has made a bizarre call on the banks to offer reasonable mechanisms and help their fellow citizens.  The banks will only help themselves.  Their directors will do nothing other than make profit in order that they can pay themselves large salaries and bonuses.  Calling on the banks to do anything other than make a profit is nothing short of living in cloud-cuckoo-land.</p> <p> The only way the Minister can help people is to regulate the banks in terms of dealing with those in distress because of arrears and the new vulnerable, namely, people who are struggling to pay their mortgages.  They are still paying their mortgages but as we know from the case of the Garda sergeant who had to seek help from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, they barely have enough money to eat.  The Government is calling on the banks to make a decision but it is the Government which must make a decision.  It must legislate for the banks to act because they will not do anything other than make profit.  Expecting anything else from the banks is not living in the real world.  In terms of calling on the banks to do something-----</p></speech>

There have been many discussions in this House and in the other House on the tens of thousands of Irish people who settled in the United States in past decades who are in employment but remain undocumented, illegal migrants.  Many politicians from all parties have travelled to meet politicians in the US and successive US Presidents on this issue but we stand in danger of being accused of hypocrisy if we do not address the problem on our own doorstep of the 30,000 migrant families and their children living undocumented here.  Many of those people have been working in well-paid jobs and are paying their taxes.  They are deeply rooted in the communities in which they live but they are living under great stress and fear.  They are vulnerable to exploitation and excluded from basic services.  Like the Irish in America they are cut off from their families.  That issue must be addressed.</p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange to have a debate in the not too distant future to allow the Minister, Deputy Shatter, come into the House to discuss this issue and how we could introduce an earned regularisation scheme that might work where &quot;illegals&quot; here would earn credits and that over time their position in this country would be regularised.  It involves a significant number of people.  They are making a contribution to the society and to the community and like the Irish in America it is only fair that they be allowed travel to see their relatives without the fear of being excluded from the country in the future.</p></speech>

I second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by my colleague, Senator Reilly, to extend the business of the day by an hour to give a specific focus on debating youth unemployment.</p><p>I agree with Senator Barrett's comments on the need to examine the issue of rural transport.</p><p>The primary issue I raise is about information in a reply to a parliamentary question tabled by my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, in the Dáil which shows that increased revenue resources could bring in up to €100 million.  With the information he has received from the Revenue Commissioners through the Department of Finance, an investment of €6.5 million in 125 additional trained Revenue staff would generate €100 million next year from the targeting of black market activity and increased audit activity.  I heard an interview on a radio programme this morning with a former Revenue Commissioners auditor who said that for what would seem to be a relatively good investment of €6.5 million, 125 extra jobs would be created but the return to the Exchequer would be up to €100 million.  It would be an interesting issue to examine.  We are often criticised for being negative in this House but we are bringing forward a positive proposal which could be examined.</p><p>While the Leader is examining that issue and if he has time over the weekend he might examine the other positive proposals in the Sinn Féin jobs proposals programme.  As I said, we are often criticised for not bringing forward positive ideas but there are many positive ideas in this document, which runs to 60 pages.  We have talked to many stakeholders on the issue.  We will be raising the issues when the Minister, Deputy Bruton, comes into the House to discuss job creation but we are talking about an investment programme of €13 billion creating 156,000 jobs and retaining 15,000 jobs.  The Leader might read that document in advance of any jobs debate to ensure he is aware of it and we will not have to tell him that we have a jobs programme.</p><p>It would be interesting to have a specific debate in the run up to the budget on ways Revenue could bring in more revenue and create jobs at the same time.</p></speech>

This is an opportune day to put back on the agenda the issue I raised with the Taoiseach when he was in the House with members of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, namely, United Nations Security Resolution 1325.  I work with Hanna's House in Dublin on sexual violence against women.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have responded positively to that issue because the Government launched a national action plan on United Nations Security Resolution 1325 but when EU resolutions are passed every EU country must ensure that those resolutions are implemented.  The Leader has asked all Members to put various items on the agenda for Private Members' motions.  This is one of my pet motions and I hope the Leader will look favourably on it.</p><p>I commend Senator Norris on raising the issue earlier, particularly on the day when the man who was charged with a violent sexual assault on a 17 year old woman can avoid a jail sentence if he pays €15,000.  There are certain things money cannot buy, and sex is one of them.  We all know it is called prostitution but I do not see the difference.  I want the issue of violence against women to be debated in this House.  I raised it with the Taoiseach and, under the auspices of Resolution 1325, with Hanna's House which is supporting this issue and doing great work on it.  Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Resolution 1670 makes sexual violence against women in armed conflict a war crime.  Unfortunately, many war crimes are committed against women.  It may not be a bullet that is used but we have seen sexual violence perpetrated against women throughout the world.  I want a debate on that issue.  I thank Senator Norris for raising it earlier.  I want us to ensure that this country takes the issue seriously on a day when a man can pay €15,000 to have his sentence suspended while another man was sent to jail for six years for non-payment of garlic import duty.

On that occasion relatives of the seven signatories of the Proclamation were in the Visitors Gallery.  They were indicating their support to have Moore Street developed as an historic and tourism attraction.  Following on that debate I arranged a meeting with the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach assembled officials from several Departments and also from the cultural institutions.  In attendance at that meeting were the Moore Street committee and the relatives of the signatories and it was clear that there was goodwill for the prospect of having this work done in time for the centenary of the Rising in 2016.</p><p>Last night I watched a programme on TG4 which made disturbing viewing because one of the road blocks to developing that site, and I know the Minister, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, is committed to it because I walked the site with him, seems to refer to some ownership of that property.  That balanced and well-researched programme discovered certain documents which would raise serious questions about the ownership and the way it was transferred from one company to another.  That has cast a shadow over Moore Street.</p> <p>I call on the Leader to ask the Minister to come in and discuss this with us.  There is a good deal of disturbance.</p><p>I received a letter signed by the relatives of the seven signatories which is in itself a historic letter.  Since 1916 they have never connected themselves with any other campaign.  They have been associated with nothing and have always remained silent.  However, they are keen that we do something to secure what they are looking for in Moore Street and that we arrange a proper commemoration in time for the centenary in 2016.</p></speech>

They sought to block or back track on the solemn agreement made in June that sovereign debt and bank debt should be decoupled.  It was specifically agreed that the vicious circle between the two should be broken and that Ireland's debt should be re-examined with a view to improving its sustainability.  Despite the views of Senator Byrne, we can have confidence that our Taoiseach and his team will ensure that the solemn agreement or commitment is re-affirmed and that we can make progress.</p></speech>

I reassure the House that An Taoiseach is doing absolutely everything to enforce the words of 29 June with regard to the separation of sovereign and private debt in the banks.  To be fair, he is also gathering allies on this issue.  Martin Schulz, President of the European Parliament, was here last week.  He said the agreement must be enforced as well.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, assures us that he is doing absolutely everything to get a deal on the debt.  He has said that without it, it is like driving a car with the handbrake on.  The House can rest assured that we are 100% sincere about this.</p><p>  I am shocked and flabbergasted at the judgment in the sexual assault case reported on the front page of <i>The Irish Times</i>.  A man with a previous record of serious harm and whose mother admitted that he had been a victim of sexual abuse as a child, got a suspended four-year sentence after attacking a 17 year old.  As Senator Cáit Keane noted, he was asked to pay &#8364;15,000.  I cannot get over why there was no requirement for him to attend counselling.  The poor 17 year old victim is attending counselling every two weeks to get over it.  This man has-----</p></speech>

I do not imagine there is anyone on this side of the House who would not support the efforts of the Government, led by the Taoiseach, to try to decouple the sovereign from the bank debt.  Ultimately, that is a partial solution to getting us out of our economic woes.  However, criticism has been levelled at the Taoiseach and the Government following the meeting that took place between the three finance Ministers.  There has been government to government contact and given that three quarters of the Cabinet were in Brussels recently it should have afforded an opportunity, at least on a public relations basis, for the Taoiseach to have requested a meeting with the Prime Ministers of the relevant countries.  At the very least there should have been a meeting held with the finance Ministers concerned, who seem to have taken a unilateral decision.  Admittedly, they are very powerful but it raises the point about how successful we can be.</p><p>Unless we are successful, we will have serious difficulties in trying to get rid of our debt.  We can talk about reducing our deficit to 3% of GDP until the cows come home but if we cannot get rid of the unsustainable bank debt and get it removed from the sovereign, then we will be running fast to stand still and into the next generation.  That is why concern is being expressed on this side of the House.  Whether it is a lack of awareness within the Government of the impact this is having on the public, there is a perception that we are not trying hard enough and that perhaps we should be playing hard ball.</p><p>It is obvious to the dogs in the street that Ireland was used as a guinea pig by the European Central Bank in particular.  Mr. Trichet's remarks recently to the effect that the bank went the extra mile to help Ireland were not helpful either.  It is perfectly clear that there is correspondence within the Department of the Taoiseach that forced the former Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, God rest him, to force Ireland into a bailout against the wishes of the Government of the time.  It is time that those responsible in Europe stood up and did what they were supposed to do.</p><p>I fully agree with all the comments made.  Whatever happened at the summit in June and irrespective of the meeting that took place subsequently between certain finance Ministers, the Taoiseach and the Government should stick closely and rigidly to what happened.  Will the Leader entertain the notion that the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs would come to the House to give a post-summit briefing?  That would allow an opportunity for us to tease out these issues.</p></speech>

From what I read in the newspaper this morning, it seems something is rotten in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.  It is appalling to think that money can buy one's way out of jail.

We must ensure people go to jail when they commit acts of violence against women.</p><p>I call for a debate on the undocumented Irish living in America, on which Senator Michael Mullins commented earlier.  I attended a rally in Washington in 2006 in support of the Kennedy McCain Immigration Bill.  More than 3,000 undocumented Irish people, our citizens, are living and working in America.  They cannot get health insurance or travel back to Ireland for family events such as weddings and funerals.  Many of them have not been back in Ireland in 20 years.  These people want to live legally and want to pay their taxes.  They want to embrace a society in a place they now call home.  Our Government and society have a responsibility to use whatever influence we have in Washington to support the legalisation and to create a path for documentation for these citizens of our country.  We all know undocumented people in America.  They are decent, hard-working people.  They are our citizens.  They fly the Irish flag at every opportunity and I am keen for the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to update the House in due course on what exactly is happening to support the undocumented Irish in Washington and in America.</p></speech>

However, it is difficult to listen to members of Fianna Fáil talking about openness and transparency when it comes to the banking sector.  The point that many of the leaders in the banks are missing is that they were saved in order that we could have a functioning banking system.  I reject the idea that they would tell us, now that we own them, how the Personal Insolvency Bill should operate.  That may be putting it too strongly but the idea that they have the clout that they seem to have is a matter of concern.  I urge those in charge in the Government to let the banks know that we run them now and that 97% is not a small shareholding by any stretch of the imagination.</p> <p>The economy cannot function unless the banks come to the realisation that they must work in the times that we are in and they must help those in distressed situations, and although they are in being to make profit, they need to realise that the clout they once had has diminished significantly.</p><p>I also support other colleagues who spoke about sexual violence against women.  I do not wish to speak on any particular case that is being covered in the media, but at the same time the idea that money can buy a person freedom from punishment is serious.  We need to have a debate on the matter in this House and I would welcome other Senators' calls for the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to come in for a meaningful debate on the issue.</p></speech>

Indeed, Senator Reilly asked for a debate on youth unemployment.  We can include it with the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, today and the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, on 13 November, and if we need to discuss the matter specifically we will arrange that also.</p><p>On home-help hours, there is the other side of the House in the person of Senator Darragh O'Brien criticising the Government for overruns in the health system but when it takes action, it is criticised as well.

I will certainly raise that matter.  The Minister is well aware of that situation.  As I stated, we will have him in on 13 November but I will relay the Senator's concerns in that regard.</p><p>I would hope that Senator Byrne would find it in his heart to support the Taoiseach and the Government in our efforts to get a deal on bank debt in the interests of all the citizens.  That would be the wish of everybody on the summit that will be held this week.</p><p>Senator Hayden raised the achievements of the Croke Park agreement.  There have been many achievements on the Croke Park agreement over the past 18 months.  We will have the Minister for Public Enterprise and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in the House, as has been requested, to debate the Croke Park agreement and, indeed, many other issues in respect of his Department.</p><p>I note Senator Barrett's comments on CIE and bus services for rural areas that have been withdrawn.  We will have the Minister for Transport, Deputy Varadkar, in here, probably for an overall debate encompassing a number of areas on transport, in early course.</p><p>Senator Colm Burke raised the achievements and reform that have taken place in the health service.  The Minister outlined those, in particular, on Second Stage of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Bill 2012, and we will have him in again here next week.</p><p>On the issue of national monuments, raised by Senators Reilly and Ó Murchú, I will certainly invite the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jimmy Deenihan, to come in.  I am sure it is a matter that is close to the Taoiseach's heart and, indeed, the Minister's, and perhaps we could have an update on the situation.  I note the points Senator Ó Murchú made on a television programme, which I have not viewed.  I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister and perhaps we can have him in here fairly soon.</p><p>Senator Kelly raised the question of answers to Adjournment motions and proposals for home help.  I can raise the question of answers for Adjournment motions at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  The Ceann Comhairle has taken action in the other House.  We will examine the system and see whether we can improve it in any way.  On proposals which Senator Kelly made for home help, if he provides me with a copy of those proposals I will ensure the Minister gets them.</p><p>Senator Walsh commented on the banks.  Indeed, other Senators have mentioned that.  We will take Second Stage of the Personal Insolvency Bill in the House on 21 November and I can assure everybody that they will have ample time to debate that on Second Stage.  We will provide as much time as possible for every Senator, if he or she wishes, to contribute on the Bill.  There will be no time constraints and any points that anybody wishes to raise can be made by them at that stage.</p><p>Senator Comiskey raised the regrettable job losses in Abbott in Sligo.  Hopefully, those jobs will be replaced in early course.</p><p>On Senator Daly's comments on banks, he will have ample time to bring forward amendments to the Personal Insolvency Bill if he is not happy with it.  On the points he raised on the Minister, Deputy Burton, I hope he will stay on to make those points to her when she is here.</p><p>Senators Michael Mullins and Conway raised the undocumented Irish in the United States.  The Government will continue to lobby on this issue.  Senator Mullins also raised the point on the undocumented in this country, which is another matter in need of attention.</p><p>Senator Ó Clochartaigh mentioned the Sinn Féin budget proposals.  As I stated, the Government will examine proposals from all sources but will then make its decisions, obviously based on the proposals.</p><p>Senator Keane raised the matter of sexual violence against women, which I have mentioned.  She mentioned the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 and Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Resolution 1670.  I will try to have a debate on that.  Perhaps we can do so in the context of non-Government motion No. 9 on the Order Paper at a later stage.</p><p>Senators Paul Coghlan and Healy Eames raised progress at the EU summit on bank debt.</p> <p>The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, will be in the House next week to discuss developments at the EU summit.  </p><p>Senator Noone mentioned the banks and the insolvency Bill and those items can be discussed on 21 November.

Otherwise, my responses today would be very general.</p><p>Now that I see Professor Mirrlees in the Visitors Gallery, I would like to say that in Ireland social welfare plays an enormous stimulus role in terms of demand.  Payments paid in pensions and to carers, jobseekers and almost 250,000 people who receive weekly payments relating to some kind of illness, disability or invalidity are all spent in our domestic economy and, therefore, constitute an important part of the spend in our domestic economy.  The recent work by the Central Statistics Office confirms this and highlights the importance of both the public wage spend and the social welfare spend, particularly in small and large towns throughout the country.  Many Seanad Members are aware of this in their own localities.</p><p>Today, I want to talk about a number of the important considerations being examined, including in the context of the forthcoming budget and the challenge that budget presents.  I would emphasise that I am anxious to see that people, such as pensioners, who rely on a weekly payment for all or the bulk of their income are protected in the budget for 2013 as we did in the budget for 2012.  On Monday in Sligo, the Taoiseach and I jointly opened the first office to facilitate the introduction of the new social welfare configuration.  This will mean that people coming in to receive jobseeker's payment will not only apply for payment, but will be introduced to a pathway back to work.  If they cannot find work in the current climate, they will be facilitated through training and education.  We emphasise this is for all jobseekers, particularly those who are at risk of long-term unemployment and young people.  Throughout the European Union there is a problem with regard to youth unemployment and in the context of the forthcoming Irish Presidency, I hope to be able to focus to some degree not only on employment and getting back to work, but on the supports Europe needs to put in place in the area of youth unemployment.</p><p>To return to the event in Sligo on Monday, the programme for Government gave an undertaking to introduce a better approach as to how the State engages with and supports the unemployed to get back into the workforce.  The challenge set by the Government in Pathways to Work is to ensure that the creation of new jobs results in a reduction in unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, so that individuals do not become permanently disenfranchised within society and to ensure they have financial independence for themselves and their families.</p><p>The aim of the Department with the new service is to engage with every unemployed individual to ensure that their first day out of work is also their first step on the pathway back to work.  Future funding of employment programmes, particularly community employment, CE, will reinforce this objective.  This requires a more focused engagement with people on CE and greater targeting of places and opportunities to further the progression of unemployed people into work.  Community employment is one of a number of employment schemes managed by the Department of Social Protection.  Other smaller programmes similar in many respects to community employment are: the rural social scheme; the community services programme; the jobs initiative; and Tús.  All of these are valuable opportunities for individuals and communities, and communities benefit from the work and services provided through these schemes. </p><p>On several occasions here, we have discussed the issue of community employment.  After community employment was transferred from 1 January 2012 to my Department, I initiated a review.  Last Friday, the CE financial review was laid in the Oireachtas Library.  I will not go into the background of the review, as Members here are familiar with it, but will mention that community employment is the largest single labour market activation employment programme funded by the Department.   The 2012 budget for CE is approximately €340 million.  Labour support measures overall in the social protection budget amount to just under €1 billion.  Therefore, we are spending a significant amount of money on this programme.  In that context, I would welcome the insight of Senators into what expenditure and programmes under this heading they perceive to be particularly valuable and useful and how they feel those programmes could be improved.</p><p>There are 23,300 places in community employment, including places for approximately 1,400 supervisors.  There are an astonishing 1,136 CE schemes providing a wide range of social services to local communities throughout the country. </p> <p>I am happy to say that contrary to much of the scaremongering that went on at the time of last year's budget, there has been no reduction in the number of places available under community employment schemes.  It is important to emphasise that there has been no reduction in the employment of supervisors or in the number of places.  An interesting aspect of the review was that many of those involved in it sent us a great deal of financial information - Members may have local knowledge of this - and highlighted that if more places were available, they would be in a position to do more for people who are unemployed, for their own communities and for the services supported by community employment schemes.</p><p>The community employment programme is mainly targeted at people over the age of 25 who have been unemployed for a long time and are very distant from the labour market.  Those who participate in community employment schemes receive specified social welfare payments for a minimum period of a year.  They include people on the live register, lone parents and people with disabilities.  Participants associated with long-term disadvantage, such as ex-offenders, people with drug dependencies and people from the Traveller community, are included in these categories.  Community employment is a broad and flexible programme that has been used to address many social challenges at individual or societal level, for example, by organising rehabilitative programmes or supporting communities in the provision of services.  To be honest, many people with drug dependencies who enter into rehabilitation programmes are on a journey that will take several years.  That journey might involve getting an opportunity to go back to education before going back to work.  The reality is that the chances of a person on such a programme being able to make rapid progress into employment are not great.  One of the reasons community employment is experiencing such difficulties among economic commentators is that it is pitched as a labour market jobs programme.  When one looks deeply into community employment, however, one notices that it has certain ring-fenced areas in addition to its labour market area.  It helps people with drug issues who are rehabilitating, as I have said.  It plays an important role in providing a training pathway for people interested in personal care services, including child care.  It is important to mention that such pathways take a period of time.</p><p>I want to talk about some of the educational disadvantages experienced by many new entrants to community employment and how community employment has responded to them.  The highest educational achievement of 53% of new entrants to community employment is the junior certificate.  Some 23% of them did not progress beyond primary level education or have no record of educational achievement.  Men tend to have lower educational attainment than women.  Over 37,000 components of learning were completed by community employment participants in 2011.  Almost 17,000 of them were accredited by FETAC under the national framework of qualifications as minor awards.  Those involved in FETAC, including some Senators, will be aware that the aim of its work is to help people to attain level 5 and 6 qualifications, which they can use to get a job.  Lower-level qualifications are great from the perspective of bringing people back into the education sector.  Those who employ people in areas like care services and child care have made the point that level 5 and 6 qualifications are needed in many cases.  The attainment of such qualifications is a great achievement for all involved.  Approximately one quarter of community employment participants are between the ages of 25 and 35 and over half of all participants are over the age of 45.  This programme focuses predominantly on older, low-skilled jobseekers and requires a type of environment that supports and understands the adult learner.</p><p>Community employment has had two main objectives, both of which are absolutely important: helping the long-term unemployed to gain employment; and supporting organisations in providing services to communities.  This dual mandate can lead sponsors to focus too much on service provision, often to the detriment of the progression of the jobseeker.  The review has gone a long way to redress this.  The primary focus of this Department for community employment participants is to assist them in gaining the skills and work experience needed to enable them to enter paid employment, while at the same time supporting the provision of local services.  Some 19% of those who left community employment in 2011 went into employment, including social employment, through the community employment structure, and a further 7% went onto further education.  In the current economic environment, and taking into account the qualifications profile of participants, this can be considered a positive outcome.  It is not as good as I would like, but it is quite positive nonetheless, particularly for the individuals and their families.  The Department of Social Protection assumed responsibility for the budget of the scheme in January of this year.  When I spoke in this House on a previous occasion, I mentioned that the Department is responsible for between 50 and 60 schemes.  Now that we have taken over some other schemes, we are responsible for between 70 and 80 schemes, which means the job just got bigger.</p><p>The 2012 budget made changes to participant allowances and to the materials and training budget.  The subsequent financial review conducted by my Department concluded that considerable savings could be secured, but additional funds would be required in 2012 to maintain the activity, employment and opportunity levels for supervisors and participants.  The materials and training budget was increased by €9.5 million to €20.5 million through the transfer of funds within my Department.  Sponsors were notified of their revised grants in July.  A review mechanism was set up for sponsors who wanted further examination of the costs incurred in running schemes.  To date, no scheme has ceased to operate as a result of the level of funds awarded.  Twelve of the 1,136 schemes have availed of the review mechanism put in place by my Department.  The community employment financial review has delivered on a number of levels.  When I spoke to the House at the time, I gave an undertaking that no scheme would close as a result of these cost-saving measures and that has come to pass.  The financial review gave the Department a greater degree of understanding, insight and learning about the operation of sponsors at a time when new staff were taking managerial responsibility for community employment.  The review identified significant efficiencies that could be achieved.  A key conclusion from the review is that significant savings can be achieved in the areas of insurance, audit and bank fees without affecting the viability of schemes.  The savings that would not have an impact on the viability of schemes are estimated at €3.5 million in a full operational year.  Further savings and economies, in terms of the administration of schemes, have been identified.</p><p>It is obvious that community employment schemes date back to the 1980s, when my ministerial colleague, Deputy Quinn, was instrumental in their establishment.  There is a lot of administration involved in them.  I do not doubt that the review has helped to identify areas where one could achieve as much administration for less money than has been the case up to now.  It was realised that the pooling of some very small community employment schemes in various towns and communities, which is now happening, would lead to better resources for the areas in question.  In other words, different aspects of communities, such as Meals on Wheels, the GAA, other sports clubs and Tidy Towns, are coming together under a single umbrella.  That has the potential to lead to cost savings and increased effectiveness and to give the participants in community employment schemes a better profile in the community as a whole.  It is seen as a positive contribution to the community.  My Department is committed to reforming community employment, for example by examining the effectiveness of the full range of employment support programmes.  The outcome of this review will help to determine future policy with regard to the role and appropriate scale of activation programmes.  My understanding is that the review will be made available and published in the coming weeks.</p><p>The most significant development in the support provided for family and informal carers in the last decade was the publication of the national carers strategy.</p> <p>I made it a priority that carers were protected in the budget, for which the various organisations which address care issues have indicated their satisfaction.  I am aware that, where somebody is caring for an elderly parent or a child with an illness, carers give their families and the person who needs the care a huge amount of service and love but, of course, it also helps society.  We all know that the fact people who have issues around becoming frail in old age, or children who have a recurring consistent condition or illness, can be cared for in the environs of their own home serves to limit admissions, including nursing home institutional admissions, and is of huge value.  I also know how much carers put into caring.  This is why the strategy has been made a priority by Government.</p><p> We have heard from the carer organisations.  They sometimes feel they are unnoticed by their communities and, most of all, by the State, and that their contribution is not acknowledged in the way it should be.  Caring obviously has a huge impact on carers' lives.  I am very conscious of the fact that when people are looking after an elderly parent and that parent dies, the carer, having perhaps given his or her life to looking after the parent for, say, the past three, five or seven years, is left with a huge void when that comes to an end.  It is not just the simple grief of bereavement because the person's whole life has been focused around that.</p><p> The Department is also assisting in terms of carer's allowance.  There are currently approximately 51,000 people in receipt of carer's allowance and, of these, 20,000 are in receipt of half-rate carer's allowance and another social welfare payment.  Two carers who are providing care on a part-time basis in an established pattern can, since 2005, be accommodated on the carer's allowance scheme, which can be of benefit.  Carer's benefit is a payment for people who have made social insurance contributions and who have recently left the workforce or who are looking after somebody in need of full-time care and attention.  Recipients can get carer's benefit for up to two years for each person being cared for.  There are approximately 2,000 people in receipt of carer's benefit.</p><p> For a child up to the age of 17 who requires full-time care, a domiciliary care allowance of &#8364;309.50 per month is available.  Where the care is full time and onerous, the parent or guardian may also qualify for a carer's allowance and approximately 40% of parents do so qualify.  We also pay the respite care grant, which is paid regardless of the carer's means.  People in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit receive the respite care grant each June.  Carers also receive free travel, which is very valuable, as well as access to the household benefits package.</p><p> With regard to training, carers were identified as a priority theme under the economic and social disadvantage category of the dormant accounts allocation for 2007 onwards.  The focus of the carers measure is to provide training to assist carers in undertaking their role.  The Department of Social Protection is the lead Department for this measure and the funding is being channelled through the Department's Vote.  Pobal is administering the measure on behalf of the Department and is responsible for the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the programme.  Applications were assessed by Pobal and 12 groups were approved for funding in December 2008, although the training which commenced in September 2009 is now coming to an end.  The grants range in size from the Carers Association receiving more than &#8364;500,000 and Caring for Carers receiving almost &#8364;250,000, to small projects throughout the country.</p><p> I am very conscious of the needs of carers but there is also a wide range of other groups, such as unemployed people, parents, pensioners and people with disabilities, who depend on the welfare budget for vital support.  I assure the House that the Government, in the context of the very tough budgetary environment, will continue to do its utmost to protect the most vulnerable people in Irish society.  I am very pleased that organisations like the IMF, which we in this country associate with cuts more than anything else, has spoken in the recent staff reports of the significance and importance of the social welfare spend.  I believe the dialogue is bearing some fruit.</p><p> I am anxious to return in a couple of days, having had an opportunity to hear the issues raised by Senators.  We have made enormous progress in regard to further updating IT systems in regard to applications concerning carers, domiciliary care allowance and disability.  I can provide the detail on that in due course as I know it is of particular interest to a number of Members.</p><p> To go back to the launch of the new service, by the end of the year this will have been rolled out in ten different locations.  The first four are in Sligo, Kings Inn Street in the centre of Dublin, Tallaght and Arklow, and there is follow-on in a number of areas around the country, including at locations like Ballymun and Finglas in Dublin and Buncrana in Donegal.  This has meant a huge transformation in the Department of Social Protection.  The Department had approximately 5,500 staff but, exactly one year ago, 1,000 community welfare officers from the HSE were taken into the Department and, subsequently, we took 700 FÁS employees from its employment services into the Department, as well as 1,400 CE supervisors.  We also took in the local employment services through local companies, comprising another couple of hundred staff, and the Department is also handling the citizens advice service and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.</p><p> I advise Senators the Department has recently set up a dedicated phone line based in Dublin to serve people who want advice about their mortgage or financial situation.  In the current economic crisis, we have two particular problems in this country, and I say this as much for the benefit of the troika as for the benefit of the Senators.  First, we have people in their 30s and 40s who went out, did the right thing, got a mortgage to provide a home for their family and now find themselves heavily indebted.  I welcome the comments made by the speakers from the Central Bank and the Department of Finance that the banks have to do more.  Yes, they do have to do more.  They have to cut to the chase and deal with the difficulties people are having because we will get no debt settlement without realistic, sustainable agreement between the debtor and the creditor.  Both sides have to come to the table and reach an agreement.</p><p> Second, we also have a situation in regard to social welfare, where the demands on the social welfare system are growing.  However, we have responded, as I said, by setting up a dedicated phone line through the Citizens Information Board and the very good website <i>keepingyourhome.ie</i>.  If people are in trouble and want advice, they can ring the dedicated phone line.  If they are reaching a deal with a bank and want financial advice, not just mortgage advice, they can arrange an appointment with one of a large panel of qualified accountants throughout the country to talk to them about the deal, so whatever agreement they reach with the bank is sustainable.</p><p> This is very important.  We do not want deals being done with banks which are not sustainable because, six months later, the deal will have fallen apart and the family which made the deal will end up more dispirited and in worse difficulty than if they had not made an agreement at all.</p> <p>I wish to stress to Senators that the service is now available countrywide, at local level.  People can talk to staff experienced in the area as well as go to the MABS services in their locality where that is available in order to build up a sense of what it is they need to do, what they can do and what the financial institution will agree to.  It is in that framework that we will be able to assist people who have difficulties with mortgages.  That is one issue that the Department is addressing in the current crisis.  The other issue is helping people back to work and education if they cannot find a job currently.</p></speech>

She must feel a cold wind around her Department as the budget approaches.  The demands on her Department will not alone be as bad as last year but on the basis of public statements from the Taoiseach down, the budget will be even worse.  I do not envy the Minister her job.</p><p>I could not help but reflect on a statement made in September 2011 to the effect that, for all that we are living through difficult times, we must always maintain a threshold of decency.  That was said by the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, at a pre-Dáil term meeting of the Labour Parliamentary Party.  The Minister made reference to the troika and the banking regulator.  It is somewhat apt that she should do so.  Her Department is primarily responsible for looking after the vulnerable in society, the socially and economically disadvantaged.  Many in society depend on the Department of Social Protection to put food on the table.  Stark statistics emerged in recent days, which even I find hard to grasp, to the effect that 450,000 in this country find it hard to put food on the table.  There was a letter from the wife of a garda who wrote about having ‘cornflakes days’.  What kind of society are we becoming?  It all seems to be because of the imposition of austerity concepts by the troika on this country in recent years and for the immediate future.  It is obvious that there is a growing volume of criticism that austerity alone does not work and that some form of growth policies must also be in place.  The Government has grappled with this particular conundrum since it was first elected last year.  Despite its best efforts, a range of job initiatives and various other policy initiatives, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high.  I referred to 450,000 people, of whom approximately 300,000 are hard-core cases.  What is frightening and of more concern is that the queue of those who are long-term unemployed is lengthening.</p><p>That is the scenario in which the Minister is now going to have to put forward her budget proposals in the coming months.  I appreciate that the money must be found somewhere but the argument is that the money could be found elsewhere rather than through attacking the poor and the vulnerable.  It was interesting to hear the Minister’s impressive outline of various headings, in particular relating to community employment schemes.  I applaud her for the initiatives she has taken in that regard.  Great public concern was evident at the beginning of the year, which was reflected by all parties and by anyone who operates at local level and is aware of the importance of the schemes.  A great deal of uncertainty surrounded the transfer of the schemes to the Department.  The Minister’s promised review has taken the edge off much of the concern.  The facts, as the Minister has outlined them, are impressive and heartening.  I refer specifically to the fact that there has been no reduction in the number of places available on community employment schemes.  That is the bottom line.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.388" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800009#N00400"><p>Speaking as someone who comes from a part of the country that is socially and economically disadvantaged, like many of my colleagues, I am aware that community employment schemes have proven to be a lifeline in particular for single men in isolated areas who have an opportunity through the schemes to live their lives with dignity.  From that point of view there is more than just number-crunching involved in terms of what the schemes bring to the table.  I am sure the troika will have views, as other European institutions did, about the way this country has operated community employment schemes in recent years.  I am particularly pleased from that point of view.</p><p>The Minister outlined details on the national carers’ strategy.  To cut to the chase, a great deal of the discussion in recent weeks has centred on the possibility of child benefit cuts.  A report compiled by an advisory group to the Minister for Social Protection which was leaked to “The Week in Politics” in September created an awful furore in recommending a two-tier child benefit system.  What is forgotten to some degree is that reductions in child benefit have already been implemented in the previous budget and will continue into the next budget.  That is in isolation to any other propositions that might be forthcoming from the Minister.  I accept we are speaking in somewhat of a vacuum because the Minister is putting forward her Estimates and will be doing battle around the Cabinet table in the coming months.  We will have to wait until budget day before we get an indication of what will happen in the Department.</p><p>Fianna Fáil is opposed to the cuts for a number of reasons.  The Minister is very much aware of them.  One or two issues are of particular concern.  The elimination of payments on multiple births ignores the significant costs incurred following the birth of twins, triplets or more children.  I understand that approximately 1,200 families will be affected annually by such a cut.  The Minister must take account of public concern expressed by all of those involved in the area.  It will create a great difficultly for her.  Barnardos has warned that a third cut in a row to child benefit could worsen the situation of 90,000 children living in poverty.  The National Women’s Council said the payment had become an easy target for successive Governments and that any reduction would lead to further hardship.  Early Childhood Ireland, which represents preschools and day care services, said such a proposal would hit poorest families hardest.  The Children’s Rights Alliance said low-income families would have to be compensated in the event of a cut because of the massive impact it would have on them.</p><p>I have had some equivocation and ambiguity in my attitude previously - the same might be true of colleagues on all sides of the House - on whether one would continue with the universal payment or start tampering with it.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, said that a two-tier proposal must be considered at a time when one has to prioritise spending for families who need the most support.  On the one hand one could argue that it is a logical way forward that one would target those most in need.  I have never to been able to grasp why the computers cannot talk to each other in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on the issue.  In this high-tech age I cannot figure out why one cannot take a cut-off of people who are on an income of €150,000 who clearly do not need child benefit, and isolate them.  Perhaps it is not worth it in the overall scheme of things to separate those one assumes do not need child benefit.  The assumptions could be totally incorrect.  We do not know the domestic situation in the most affluent of families.  Perhaps the wife does not receive any money and as a result the money received in child benefit is badly needed for basic essentials for the children.  I am not sure how the Minister will tackle the situation.  On the one hand, logic would dictate that one would target those most in need but on the other hand one must question why successive Governments have shied away from diluting the universal payment concept.  In that sense, I would have to come down on the approach that it is best to leave well enough alone in that regard.</p> <p> I refer to the disability allowance.  The Government suspended its announced cuts to this allowance pending a further review to be undertaken by the chairperson of the Commission on Social Welfare and Taxation.  The most recent statistics published by the CSO last week reveal that consistent poverty experienced by people with disabilities increased from 8.8% in 2009 to 13% in 2010.  The reality, of which I am sure the Minister is well aware, is that young disabled people on disability allowances are excluded from all the activation programmes announced to date from her Department.  A recent survey by the ESRI found that two thirds of this group were willing to work with the correct supports but employment opportunities are limited for people with a disability.  Hence the relationship between disability and a higher risk of poverty.  Approximately 4% of people aged 18 to 34 have a disability.</p><p>I refer again to the programme for Government which states: &quot;We will ensure that the quality of life of people with disabilities is enhanced.  We will also facilitate people with disabilities in achieving a greater level of participation in employment, training and education.&quot;  There is an issue which I do not believe to be in the Minister's mandate; rather it is HSE-related.  When those with a disability or special needs achieve the age of majority at 18 years, they hope to go into adult education programmes.  However, the budget for such programmes has also been cut.  What will happen those young adults who already suffer from a disadvantage and must now try to get into the workforce without having any proper training?  The Minister might comment on how this issue can be addressed.  The programme for Government committed to the enhancement of the quality of life of people with disabilities.</p><p>The Minister was taken to task last week about a comment she made on maintaining core payments.  In this debate it might be useful if she clarified what she means by core payments.</p><p>The eligibility criteria for the disability allowance have changed in the past year and the refusal rate has gone up significantly.  What is the current status of rejection rates by the Department?  I am sure the Minister is not satisfied with these rates.  Why are they so high?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.390" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800009#O00200"><p>The Minister is very welcome.  The purpose of this debate is to discuss items in advance of the budget that might inform the Minister's decision making and it is on that basis I propose to deal with it.  I will cover a broad range of issues.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister's decisions on CE schemes; I say &quot;Yes&quot; to these schemes and their continuation.  I have seen the richness they provide.  I say &quot;Yes&quot; to the carer's allowance arrangements; there are no cuts to it or to the CE schemes.  I say &quot;Yes&quot; to the measures for pensioners and the free travel scheme.  These are all very strong social measures and give a great deal of dignity to the people who benefit thereby.  All these groups are vulnerable.</p><p>  The genesis of the welfare state was based on a system of rights and responsibilities in equal part.  It is a social contract between the citizen and the State.  As the Minister has often observed, it is a hand up rather than a hand out.  I am not sure this is fully understood any more.  In the fullness of time, when the Minister is doing information campaigns, it might be useful if the nature of the welfare state were explained to the public.  She might consider that for the long run.</p><p>  One of our problems is that welfare is being used to service debt.  According to the Central Bank, there are 130,000 mortgages in arrears, of which 83,000 are private residential mortgages that have been in arrears for at least three months.  Some 5,600 mortgages have gone into arrears in the past five months.  We have a deepening mortgage crisis in Ireland, with 70% of household debt being mortgage debt.  This is where the problem lies.  As I see it, the anomaly in our social welfare system is that payments such as FIS, jobseeker's allowance and benefit - not just mortgage income supplement - are being used to service mortgage debt.  This is due to the economic imbalance caused by the property bust and the recession.  It causes a cyclical problem whereby the State increases its own debt to pay out social welfare that is being used to service private debt.  It is creating a welfare system that is under an enormous burden and is not really a properly functioning system.  </p><p>  This is an issue for the Minister.  The Personal Insolvency Bill which is to be debated in this House is understood to give too much clout to the banks.  I read in the article by Kathy Sheridan in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the Minister stated the banks must help middle-income families who, by and large, are crippled with mortgage debt.  The Minister is at the Cabinet table.  How can she influence this issue in such a way that we can have a functioning banking system that will be fair to the citizens?  Let us not have a veto given to banks in the Personal Insolvency Bill.</p><p>  Senator Mooney described austerity as a problem - of course it is.  Yet we all know why we need austerity.  We must grasp every measure that will provide for and give us growth.  I attended an EU meeting last weekend where I learned that if we implemented the EU services directive our country would gain 2.4% in GDP growth.  I will make the same point to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  We need to look at such measures in order to counteract the very bad news in terms of austerity and necessary cuts.</p><p>  As the previous speaker remarked, nobody wants to attack the poor and vulnerable.  If it were only that easy.  When the opposite side was in government it had to take &#8364;5 from blind people.  I am sure it did not want to do that.  </p><p>  Will the Minister address my question?  How will her functioning system address the fact that welfare is being used to service banking debt?  Why is there no family income upper limit for welfare in order to maintain the work incentive?  Rather than means-test, surely there is a way of finding that if there are two parents and one child in a family a certain figure is the maximum welfare that can be earned, while if there is one parent with three children there is a different maximum welfare figure.  That families are living entirely on welfare without incentives to work shows a flaw in the system.  In the social protection committee we have learned that this applies to some 4% of families in the country, in particular families with three or four children.  How is this being addressed?  Children grow up in these families.  We do not want anybody to get a bad lesson from the welfare system.  If 4% of families have a problem let us address it.</p><p>   Are the various allowances such as those for rent and fuel and jobseeker's allowance being taken into account together when they are being calculated or approved?  Is there a reason the aggregate cannot form a method of arriving at an upper limit for welfare?  I have put that question before to the Minister and would like to hear the answer.  </p><p>  My next point comes as a result of walkabouts with feedback coming from constituents.  Why are people not asked to work for their welfare?  It would be purposeful and meaningful work, the people concerned would be out and about and their contribution would be visible.  Now that local councils and agencies are short-staffed and in need there could be a real benefit.  Fr. Sean Healy has put this concept to us before.  Taking into consideration the post a person had before falling out of employment, for example, an architect on &#8364;20 per hour, that person could work at that rate per hour to contribute a number of hours for his or her welfare.  If he or she was receiving &#8364;20 per hour before and is now receiving &#8364;180 per week in welfare he or she would work nine hours.  Has the Minister given any thought to that system?  I am sure Fr. Sean Healy has presented it to her.  I see a lot of merit there.  Fr. Healy costed that scheme at approximately &#8364;150 million because it would create extra work to run.  In addition, there would be a small reward of approximately &#8364;20 to &#8364;30 per week.</p><p>  There is a debate around child benefit on whether to cut or not to cut.  I believe there is good support for the Minister's proposed two-tier system.  I did a walkabout in a middle-class estate.  Let us not forget these are the people who are paying all the charges and facing property tax next year.</p> <p>The average age of children on the estate is under five years.  I spoke to 21 families, all of whom stated it would be fair to cut child benefit by &#8364;40 per month, provided the savings were put to good use.  I was astonished by this response, especially as these are the people who will pay the property tax next year.  They would love the &#8364;40 reduction in child benefit to be put towards their property tax.  This would be a reasonable solution, given that &#8364;40 per month adds up to &#8364;480 in a year and a property tax bill of &#8364;500 would be significant.  Psychologically, people do not mind if money taken from one area is used to ensure they do not have to pay another new bill.  There is a generosity of spirit abroad and people trust that we are doing the right thing.</p><p> Child benefit is a universal tax-free payment made to all families.  Since when did people come into the world equal?  When did incomes become equal?  Universal payments amount to unequal treatment.  The key issue is deciding where would be the dividing line between those who would lose &#8364;40 per month and those who would keep it.  We must bear in mind the squeezed middle and the wife of a Garda sergeant whose letter was cited in <i>The Irish Times</i>yesterday.  It is becoming abundantly obvious that the new poor are those in the middle class who do not receive social welfare payments.  We must set a figure for how much disposable income families should be left with after paying for essential outgoings.  Is the Minister working on this figure?  Has she worked out what can reasonably considered essential outgoings?</p><p> The jobseeker's casual working payment should be calculated by the hour rather than whole days.  The Minister will have heard this argument at a meeting last Friday.  Is she open to the suggestion such a move would facilitate greater part-time employment?  I am very concerned about the level of youth unemployment and I have examined the position in countries such as Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark.  All of these countries use this type of system as it allows for greater flexibility among jobseekers.  Youth unemployment stands at 8.5% in the Netherlands, 14.3% in Denmark and 30% in Ireland.  Under the arrangement I propose, jobseekers would not be unavailable for full days and would be able to do more part-time work.  This system reduces the disincentive to work on certain days which is created by the current social welfare rules. </p><p> The self-employed should have an option to contribute to the social insurance fund to address the possibility that their business will fold.  The Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection heard a good presentation on this issue.  Is the Minister open to this proposal which would provide a much needed safety net for the self-employed?  Self-employed persons should be given this option, even if it is costly.  </p><p> The Minister must not implement the proposal to have employers pay the cost of the first four weeks of sick leave for employees as to do so would force businesses out of this jurisdiction.  We have listened to the views of representatives of ISME, the Small Firms Association and IBEC on this matter.  Employers have informed me they will source employees in the North. </p></speech>

I welcome and thank her for being willing to return to the House to answer Senators' questions.  She has identified many ways by which her vision for reform and change is being implemented.  I commend her for this.  Senators appreciate the opportunity to exchange views with her on the choices she and her Cabinet colleagues will make in the next couple of months about the well-being and protection of citizens and residents and growth in the economy.  As she is well aware and as Senators Paschal Mooney and Fidelma Healy Eames noted, we are hearing many heart-rending stories of how people in the middle and low income brackets are finding it impossible to feed their families nutritiously.  One middle income woman stated: "There are weeks I can't put food on the table."  A man on low income who pleaded guilty to stealing groceries in order that his children could have milk stated: "I couldn't let my children ask for a glass of milk in the morning and not get any."</p><p>There has been a considerable comment about a recent research paper on food poverty published by the Department of Social Protection - I commend the Minister for making the report public - showing that 10% of the population was in food poverty in 2010.  I was so unsettled and upset by this figure that I read the paper in question to ascertain how the term &quot;food poverty&quot; was being defined.  One of the indications of food poverty is &quot;whether during the last fortnight, there is at least one day (i.e. from getting up or going to bed) when a person does not have a substantial meal due to lack of money&quot;.  While I do not know about anyone else in this Chamber, I certainly could not be productive or energetic or learn or relate well if I did not have a substantial meal.  While I know there is a difference in theory between food poverty and income poverty, in practice and in the day-to-day drudgery of not having enough to eat, one would imagine that they feel like the same thing.  Are they not in reality the same? </p><p>These are the stories and questions that weigh heavily on those who govern.  They must motivate all of us, especially the Minister and her colleagues, to reconsider each day the adequacy and correctness of the macroeconomic policies and choices being pursued, as well as the decisions of her own Department.  The Minister, in an interview during the summer - she referred to the relevant remarks when she commenced her speech in the presence of Nobel Laureate, Sir James Mirrlees - indicated that social transfers could be viewed as a kind of Keynesian stimulus to the economy, as well as an effective mechanism for reducing poverty and that it was critical to retain demand in the economy.  While I agree with these sentiments, if one were to apply a similar logic across the broad span of our macro policies which I hope the Minister will do, the Government would decide to make a substantive investment in a growth programme and pay attention to the extensive economic research which demonstrates that austerity policies in advanced countries between 1978 and 2009 were followed by economic contraction and higher unemployment.  How will the circumstances of the people to whom I have referred improve if the economy does not grow?</p><p>Allied to an adequate growth programme, we need to meet our current troika commitments and obligations of fiscal discipline and the Government needs to save €3.5 billion in the next budget.  As Social Justice Ireland points out in its budget proposals, it is not a troika requirement that we increase taxation revenue by €1.25 billion and reduce public expenditure by €2.25 billion through austerity measures.  Instead, we could reverse the ratio of public expenditure reductions to tax increases or at least consider reducing public expenditure by a lesser amount and finding additional measures to increase tax. </p><p>While much current commentary notes the progressivity of the taxation system, a recent publication by the TASC entitled, Tax Injustice: Following the Tax Trail, challenges this message that is not nuanced.  If the Government is committed to fairness and a progressive approach to taxation, the measures it takes should reflect the principle that the more one earns, the more one should pay.  There are still a number of tax breaks or reliefs which reduce the tax bill of high earners.  If we are to have a fair and progressive system, these measures should be eliminated.  It is calculated, for example, that the Government could increase tax revenue by €700 million if the tax break for all pension contributions was at the standard rate in order that high earners would not benefit more.  If the Minister or her Cabinet colleagues were to choose to implement this taxation measure alone, it would follow that she would not have to reduce her Department's budget for the social protection and well-being of the people by the €540 million figure she indicated to the Joint Committee on Social Protection recently. </p> <p>Is that the figure the Minister proposes to extract from the social protection budget or is she considering revising the Estimate downward in light of the potentially devastating consequences for many households if their protection income is reduced any further?</p><p>I have a number of other questions in light of the process of reform the Minister has undertaken in her Department.  I commend her on the establishment of Intreo, the new service she promised and has introduced that will be a single point of contact for jobseekers and employers.  I know it is part of her vision for reform to move from a passive model of income support to one that engages proactively with people dependent on social welfare but given the economic context and the very high unemployment rate, the Minister is aware that many people are taking up part-time and low paid work.  I listened to the Minister talk about some of the changes her Department is undertaking in light of the additional administrative burden but I point out that in respect of those with children taking up part-time and low paid work, the waiting time for family income supplement, FIS, is still approximately four to six months.  A call to the family income supplement section on Tuesday confirmed, by way of a recorded message, that the waiting times for new claims for FIS is 18 weeks and for renewals it is 16 weeks.  That is the official line.  The reality is likely far worse as ongoing queries from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, indicate that it is anywhere between four to six months.  As the Minister knows, the delays in the FIS processing times are real crises for many families.  As the Minister is committed to helping those trying to work I ask her to consider assigning resources to commit to turning around the FIS claims within a maximum period of four weeks as a matter of urgency.</p><p>On the subject of family income supplement, it has also come to my attention that the Department of Social Protection is maintaining an interpretation of the family income supplement rules that is legally incorrect and I have an ethical obligation to raise that matter.  The Minister's Department changed its interpretation of the law governing FIS in 2009 under the previous Minister.  That changed interpretation prevented a person who is maintaining their children from claiming FIS if they are living apart from the child and the other parent.  Two claimants successfully appealed the Department's refusal to pay them FIS.  I have been advised that officials from the Minister's Department have met the Social Welfare Appeals Office on this matter and that representations were made to her following the successful outcome of both appeals yet it appears her Department may be continuing to deny the supplement to those who may be legally entitled to a payment.  Is the Minister in the process of rectifying that matter?</p><p>My last question is on the changes the Minister promised earlier this year regarding the one parent family payment, namely, lowering the age of the youngest child to seven years by 2014 for all lone parents regardless of when they entered the system, after which the one parent family payment ceases.  The Minister indicated that changing the age of the youngest child to ten in 2013 and seven in 2014 would not go ahead unless she got a credible and bankable commitment from the Government on the delivery of a Scandinavian type system of child care by the time of this year's budget.  Can she give us an update on her progress with regard to that promise?</p></speech>

While the main function of the Department of Social Protection is the delivery of income support, it has now moved into the area of tackling unemployment through activation.  It is also proactive in the control of fraud and abuse.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection is responsible for 87 million payments per year at a cost of €20.5 billion, which is 40% of the overall Government spend.  That is a huge responsibility, and being at the helm of this Department is an onerous job for the Minister.  I assure her I would not like to take it on.</p><p>Last Tuesday the members of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection met with officials of the Department and raised all our concerns with them, many of which the Minister will hear on the floor of the House today.  We had an informative meeting with the officials who outlined in detail for us the challenges of delivering a service with limited staff, streamlining the services and making changes that will deliver a more user friendly, informative and activation service to the people.</p><p>The official launch of the Intreo office in Sligo last week is testament to that.  That will be a great service in that people will be able to go into a one stop shop and meet one official who will deal with all their problems.  Until now, if people applied for jobseeker's allowance it would take up to 14 weeks to process in some cases and if people wanted to apply for supplementary welfare in the meantime they would have to complete all the forms again and provide all the documentation to a different person.  The need for that will be eliminated with the establishment of Intreo.  We have been advised by the officials, and I am taking them at their word, that the Department will be able to process applications in four days provided no major problems arise.  That is a great step forward.  The service launched in Sligo is up and running, as the Minister has told us, in a number of areas but it must be rolled out to other areas before the end of the year such as Ballymun, Buncrana, Dundalk, Coolock, Finglas and, I am delighted to say, Killarney.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.402" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Maloney" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800009#Q00400"><p>I thank the Minister.  I will hold her to that.</p><p>The Minister says repeatedly that she recognises the important role of employers in getting Ireland back to work, and with this in mind the Department will be actively working with employers in each area on getting feedback from them.  It will also roll out a road show in the coming weeks, starting with Limerick, in conjunction with IBEC, to interact with and encourage employers to work with the Department.  Many employers are not aware of the benefits of taking on an employee who is on the live register, such as Revenue job assist and the PRSI exemption.  When one hires a person with a disability, there are employability services such as the wage subsidy scheme, employment services and employers' supports.</p><p>It has been brought to my attention that a number of employers have advertised jobs and interviewed people.  An employer told me that on one occasion four people were called for interview.  Two turned up and were unsuccessful, one did not bother turning up and one was taken on.  The two people who turned up but did not get the job asked the employer not to forget their letter for the Department of Social Protection.  The person who was taken on remained three days and then left stating it was not worth his while.  We are all saying there are no jobs but that is going on.  Another Senator brought that to my attention this morning and asked me to raise it.  That is going on despite what people say to the contrary.</p><p>As we are discussing employers, if the Minister has not done so already I ask her to take off the agenda any proposals to get employers to pay the first four weeks of illness benefit for their employees.  While that may look good to employees at the outset, my concern is that it will cost jobs in the long run.  Employers are hard-pressed to pay their employees' PRSI contributions let alone their illness benefit.  That might be the proverbial final straw for employers.  I understand the Minister will refer to absenteeism in the workplace and in particular in the public sector but she should treat workers in the public sector the same as those in the private sector and tell them that if they take time off, they must live on social welfare only just as those in the private sector must do.  That might make a difference to the absenteeism rates.</p><p>One of the most widespread complaints is about the waiting time for applications to be processed.  I was delighted to hear on Tuesday that the Department is making progress in the processing time for applications and while there is still much to be done due to the high volume of applications, it is hoped that by the end of the year invalidity pension applications will be up to date.  It is also working vigorously to reduce the waiting times in its other applications offices.  I ask the Minister to keep the pressure on the Department to alleviate the backlog of applications and ensure a speedy response to applicants.  I trust that the Intreo office will have a positive effect on reducing waiting times.</p><p>I welcome also that the social services cards are being issued.  I understand that to date, 35,000 cards have been issued and are continuing to be issued daily to everyone.  It is hoped that will greatly reduce any fraudulent claims.</p><p>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to take this debate.  I very much welcome that she is endeavouring not to cut the core social welfare payments rates.  I hope she will take on board my concerns and those of my colleagues and give them due consideration when it comes to the budget.</p><p>The Minister will be aware that at every opportunity and in committee I raise the issue of the self-employed and the reduced number of benefits for which they can make application.  I ask that the same benefits be afforded to the self-employed as are afforded to PAYE workers.  I am not asking for a free service but that self-employed people be allowed to pay the same contribution rate as PAYE workers and avail of the same benefits.  One of the main benefits they are unable to avail of is family income supplement to help them earn a decent living.  The same is the case with carer's benefit and illness benefit.</p> <p>I know the advisory group that is working on this is preparing a report for the Minister.  I hope that when the report is published, we will have an idea of the suggestions the group is making to help the self-employed.</p><p>When a self-employed person eventually accesses jobseeker's allowance, he or she is not given a credited contribution simply because of his or her self-employed status.  People might think this is a small matter, but I think it is significant because the contribution in question is invaluable in the context of such a person's pension.  This anomaly is not addressed, it will have an adverse effect on the future pension entitlements of the self-employed.</p><p>I welcome the publication of the national carers strategy, which I had always been fighting for.  I respect the commitment of the Minister to the protection of the interests of carers.  In that context, I would like to mention the habitual residency condition that applies to Irish people who return to this country to look after a relative.  The two-year habitual residency clause is preventing such people from receiving carer's allowance.  It is an insult to Irish people who are returning to their own country that they are debarred from it.  I ask the Minister to examine the matter.</p><p>The Minister will be aware that I am constantly lobbying for the establishment of a central means-testing board.  I appreciate that cross-departmental co­operation is needed if this is to happen.  Its introduction would save a lot of money and avoid the duplication of work because information would be available to those considering applications for third level grants, social welfare payments such as the back to school allowance, social housing and medical cards.  All of the work needed to test a person's means should be done in one office.  It would eliminate some of the work of civil servants.</p><p>The briefing we received on the social insurance fund made for stark reading.  The provisional 2011 deficit of €1.5 billion will double to €3 billion in 2019 if no action is taken to tackle the shortfall.  The contributions of self-employed people would help to tackle this shortfall.  Some people are signing for credits without receiving any money.  They are keeping up their contributions merely to retain their pension entitlements.  A small contribution of €1 a week would be an inexpensive means of funding a pension.  Perhaps the Minister should consider the matter.  These people are not getting money, but are concerned to retain their pension entitlements.</p><p>As many Senators have said, the findings of the expert group that examined the reform of child benefit found their way into the media.  The Minister will appreciate that many scenarios are being bandied about.  If the expert advisory group has finalised its report, perhaps the Minister will advise the House of its findings if she is in a position to do so.  She mentioned that the value for money report on community employment schemes has been completed.  I am delighted to hear that no scheme has closed down.  There was uproar last year.  Many of us attended public meetings on this issue at which people expressed their anger.  We tried to transmit the message that the Minister kept reiterating, which was that no scheme would close down.</p></speech>

We will discuss the strategy for older people in more detail in the coming weeks.  Older people who paid their taxes and PRSI throughout their lives should be able to enjoy their golden years of retirement in confidence, without having to worry about falling into poverty.  That is something we really need to look at.</p><p>I could mention ten more matters, but I will conclude by referring to the school meals programme managed by the Department of Social Protection.  I welcome this fantastic initiative.  As Senator Zappone mentioned, it helps to ensure children get one decent meal a day.  I note that it is operated through the local authorities.  I ask the Minister to consider operating it through the family resource centres, which are fantastic.  The hands-on approach of those involved in the centres means they know exactly who needs assistance and who does not.  There is a fantastic centre in Killorglin that is already providing school meals.  I am sure their efforts could be enhanced if funding could be channelled through the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

I am sure he will transmit the gist of what is said here to the Minister for Social Protection, who has regrettably had to leave.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is a decent and courageous person.  I do not envy her as she faces such a mammoth task.  As I am nearly 70, I have lived through a couple of economic crises, but this is the worst one I can remember.  I never thought I would live to see the day when 10% of Irish people were experiencing food poverty.  That ties into what Senator Moloney eloquently said about the need for proper nutrition for our young people.  I understand she was echoing what my colleague, Senator Zappone, had said previously.  No Department is more necessary or more significant in dealing with this stark situation than the Department of Social Protection.  Ultimately, the Government has a duty to protect the welfare of citizens, rather than the system, which has many faults.  Senator Moloney referred to a series of anomalies and contradictions within the system.  The entire system is rife with them.  We need an interdepartmental review of the anomalies and Kafkaesque situations that do not actually assist the Exchequer.</p><p>I wish to make a practical suggestion.  Somebody at a reasonably senior level in the Civil Service should be appointed to audit the budgetary proposals of the various organisations.  I refer specifically to proposals that are supposedly budget-neutral, Exchequer-neutral or to the benefit of the Exchequer.  I am dizzy from going from briefing to briefing.  That is why I might not be as completely focused as I would like.  I will mention some of the briefings I have been at.  A number of organisations have produced documents to claim they could do a huge amount for their client base in terms that are budget-neutral or beneficial to the Exchequer.  There is a suggestion that these things are not being done because of bureaucratic red tape.  A couple of years ago, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, for which I have great regard, suggested that fuel allowance should be frontloaded to allow people to buy oil in bulk.  It would not have been more expensive.  It might have been cheaper because people would have been able to deal with oil companies that do not supply meagre amounts of oil every two weeks or every month.  That suggestion was not adopted even though it would not have cost anything.  It would have helped elderly people in isolated areas to have security of heating.  Why was it not done?  I do not understand it.  There is a blockage somewhere.  If we centralise the process by asking somebody with the intellectual capacity and the seniority within the Department to review these submissions, he or she might be able to say which ones would be able to eliminate anomalies, save money and benefit the people.</p><p>I will give another couple of examples.  I attended a briefing yesterday that was organised by some wonderful people from the Family Support Network.  Ms Sadie Grace, who champions the cause of the network, is a neighbour of mine from Seán MacDermott Street in the drug-ridden north inner city.  She spoke at the briefing about the impact of departmental policies on grandparents.  Tragically, it seems it is often the mother in a family who is addicted to certain substances.  I do not know why.  This creates a problem for her children.  As soon as the grandparents move in to deal with the situation that is threatening their daughter and her children, the family is excluded from receiving payments.  The Department tells the grandparents that the crisis does not exist anymore - it has been averted because they intervened.  It is sheer stark madness that people who sacrifice themselves and put their well-being on the line at a time in their lives when they could have been expected to take their ease and put their feet up are penalised when they heroically intervene in the interests of their children, their grandchildren and society as a whole.  We should be supporting these people instead of penalising them.</p> <p>I appeal that this kind of thing be removed from the system.  Similarly, if in a situation where the children are being looked after, the grandparents allow the mother to visit, that also leads to penalties but most psychologists believe that, even with a damaged parent, a connection between the child and the parent is good, particularly when it is monitored by a grandparent.  Why penalise people for something that is constructive and good and it does not save money?  Imagine what would happen if the grandparents were callous enough to say they would not get involved.  The situation would be landed back on the institutions of the State and there would be a multiplier effect in terms of the impact on the finances.  I ask that these issues be looked at and the anomalies ironed out as far as possible.  I appreciate it is a big task.  There should be a central examination of proposals to see if they are budget neutral and to implement them in the interests of the people.  I was delighted Senator Moran raised the issue of a centralised means test.</p></speech>

I beg the Senator's pardon.  I thank her for correcting me.  It was just a glitch, the rhetorical equivalent of a typo.  As I know her well and respect her work, it was completely inadvertent.</p><p>It is important that we do this because so many times we are told a particular policy cannot be implemented because there is not a means test in the particular Department.  I have been saying for many years that should be done in co-operation with the Revenue and the Department of Social Protection as then we would have the picture and we would not have to keep doing it.  In this crisis, means testing may be unpleasant but it is necessary because we have to target the resources at the people who need them most.  </p><p>I turn to the issue of carers.  I have the a copy of the Carers Association budget proposal for 2013, which I am sure will be brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Burton.  To my great delight I saw that it went to the heart of what I wanted to say on neutral proposals for building a brighter future for Ireland's family carers.  I compliment the Government on the fact that it has launched, for the first time, a national carers strategy.  I say &quot;Well done&quot; to the Government.  This is the theory and the ideal we are aiming for, where for the first time we commit ourselves, as a people, to recognising the vital contribution carers make to society.  We have never done that before.</p><p>As I went around the country last year visiting every single county I fell in love, all over again, with this country and the wonderful people who are unacknowledged and unrecognised.  These people give of themselves so wholeheartedly and generously in circumstances where there is virtually no recognition, very little in the way of financial reward, and where conditions became increasingly harsh.  As people retire they are not replaced, therefore the burden becomes greater.</p><p>The strategy pledges itself to recognise that carers are the backbone of the Irish health service and are key partners and supports to the health service.  One can see that.  That is not just waffle.  Let us face the financial facts.  Family carers provide €4 billion worth of care each year, five times what they cost the Department of Social Protection which gets €878 million.  It is the same with the family support network.  Its budget is €375,000 which is literally piddling.  I hope that tiny amount of money which does so much good in the most deprived areas of the capital city will not be touched.  </p><p>There is the question of the half rate.  It is assumed that this may be a double payment but it is not.  I quote from this side of the House the late Seamus Brennan.  He was a Fianna Fáil Minister and a decent man, as everyone recognised.  Like the present Minister he had the welfare of the people at heart.  He said this was a direct support for caring duties.  </p><p>There is also the household benefits package and the free travel pass.  We were told yesterday of situations where, for example, disabled people were expected to go from a hospital in Galway to a hospital in Limerick without proper transport.  The HSE provides either a bus or taxi but often the timetable does not suit the appointment.  Therefore, they are of no use.  </p></speech>

Many participants have a great sense of pride in what they do for their communities and for Tidy Towns committees and make a positive contribution.  I applaud the increasing numbers of participants.  I realise for certain age groups three years is the maximum period of participation, after which they return to the dole.  In many instances they want to continue on the scheme.  It is good to see people with a sense of pride and dignity who want to continue.  It is a pity the maximum period is not longer.  </p><p>Carers have been mentioned by many speakers.  They are committed to helping and caring for people who cannot help themselves in their own homes.  I applaud those people.  </p><p>Two weeks ago I spoke to a businessman who offered a man a job.  I know the businessman but not the man who was offered the job.  The businessman figured that he was the man for the job he wanted done.  He offered him a salary of €38,000 and 5% of the increase in profits that he was sure the man would make.  I asked what the 5% would amount to and he said it could be anything from €10,000 to €12,000 if things got better or it could be an additional €15,000 per annum.  This was a married man with four children who was receiving social welfare.  I do not know what he was getting on social welfare but he did his figures and declined the offer of a job that was likely to earn him €45,000 to €50,000.  That is reality, not fiction.  I could not believe it.  The businessman would not tell me who the man was but he still continues to receive unemployment payments.  What percentage of people on social welfare who, when offered a job, respond and take up the job?  For those who do not take up job offers, what is the procedure?</p> <p> It is estimated that expenditure on illness benefit in 2012 will be €847 million, quite a substantial sum.  The introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay, mentioned by previous speakers, whereby employers would directly meet the cost of illness-related absences for an initial period of illness is being considered - I hope consideration is as far as that will go - in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area.</p><p>I am aware that most other European countries, including all of our major competitors, oblige employers to pay for some sick pay costs.  The extent of this obligation varies considerably.  For example, the period is two years in the Netherlands, 28 weeks in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, six weeks in Germany and nine days in Finland.  I could go on, but I will not.  A range of complex issues need to be addressed before any decision can be taken by the Government on the possible introduction of such a scheme.  I believe it is the wrong time to introduce this scheme, which will cost jobs as has been stated.  The Minister will be aware there are approximately 200,000 small and medium enterprises in this country, many of which are struggling to exist.  Unfortunately, many too have closed down.</p><p>On the issue of absenteeism, I acknowledge the part the Government has played in reducing the dreadful absenteeism in the HSE.  Absenteeism of approximately five days per worker in small businesses in Ireland, means these workers are close to the best performers across Europe.  There is definite scope for further management of sick day absences in the Civil Service and public service.  There is little reason to expect that requiring employers to pay sickness payments during the first four weeks of a claim will bring about a reduction in welfare dependency.  The proposed scheme would have a particularly severe impact on small businesses, as most small businesses do not have a sick pay scheme in operation.  It is the wrong time to consider this and perhaps we should wait to consider it when we get back to full production throughout the country.  Please do not do it.</p></speech>

At my clinic every Monday morning in Kells and every Friday morning in Duleek, I hear of refusals of payment of invalidity payments.  Before this Government took office, I did not hear such complaints as they never came across my desk.</p></speech>

What should happen is that they be put on that pension, but it is not happening.  Those people are being cut off the system completely in an unfair manner.</p><p>Applications for carer's allowance are being delayed.  In some cases, people being cared for are dying during the application process, which is shocking.  I have come across such cases.  Applications for disability allowance are also being delayed.  Yes, the Government can say it has not cut the disability allowance, but it should point out that tens of thousands of people have either been refused the allowance or their payments have been delayed.  These people are getting nothing and are being sacrificed on the altar of a political promise not to cut welfare.  However, it has been cut and the lives of those affected have been devastated.  These are an unorganised silent group, but I know they come to the clinics of all parties.  Social welfare queries and delays in the social welfare system are one of the big issues for everybody meeting constituents.</p><p>Appeals to the social welfare appeals office always took a long time, but improvements had begun to take place.  However, those improvements now seem to have disappeared.  One thing I can say about the social welfare appeals office is that it is independent and is not dependent on the whims of the Minister, Deputy Burton, or the Government.  It seems to be making decisions strictly in accordance with the legislation, which is what it should do, but the Department of Social Protection is not doing the same.   I have seen several examples of this in my constituency office.  It is disgraceful the way the welfare system is being run.  </p><p>The Department mantra is &quot;we did not cut welfare&quot;, but it did.  It cut the household benefits package, affecting the most vulnerable people in society.  The fuel allowance has also been cut.  People must be particularly vulnerable to get those allowances.  A couple was on to me just before I came to the House to speak and told me they have just €120 a week pension between the two of them.  I doubt they will get the fuel allowance as I believe the limit is €100.  Even if they did qualify for the fuel allowance, they would be affected, because the Minister has reduced the season for fuel allowance by a number of weeks.  That is a significant cut in the income of such people over the year.  People who save up to buy a tank of oil have been hit particularly hard, because they depend on saving that allowance up to have a lump sum to enable them buy oil.  Instead of making such cuts, the Department should be honest with the people and tell them that the country is struggling and we need to cut our cloth to meet our measure.  </p><p>Fianna Fáil did that when in office, although nobody liked doing it.</p></speech>

Deputy Burton is not able to give such a definition when questioned.  However, I can tell the House that for an elderly lady in Kells who is saving up for a tank of oil, the fuel allowance is very much a core payment.  The Minister would be better off being straight and honest with the people.  It would be better for her to say that the Department was cutting tens of thousands of people off from welfare entirely, that it was cutting their payments to zero, at the altar of political expediency.  That is the honest truth of what is happening.</p><p>At the election, the promise was &quot;Cross our hearts, hope to die, we will not cut child benefit &quot;, because every little hurts.  That was the priority then that was to be advertised in the papers.  Now we have leaks about what is to happen and these are frightening families all over Ireland.  This is not a question of welfare policy or money, but a question of political honesty and integrity.  The Government parties were prepared to make these promises to vulnerable people who were struggling, and then at the altar of political convenience say &quot;Sorry, we cannot do it&quot;.  The programme the Government is following is the exact same programme Fianna Fáil brought in with the IMF before the election.  The projections are exactly the same.  The Labour Party had the figures at the time, but it just went out and lied to the people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.442" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1172" speakername="Aideen Hayden" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800009#T02000"><p>I would like to remind Senator Byrne that the reason we have a creaking social welfare system in this country - it is like the layers of an onion - is because Fianna Fáil, in government for the guts of 15 years, made an absolute mess of it.  I welcome the Minister to the House.</p><p>I would like to address the issue of rent supplement.  I want to give a sharp warning to Government against imposing any further cuts to rent supplement payments in the forthcoming budget.  The cuts to the rent supplement imposed last year have left vulnerable people in grave situations.  I do not exaggerate here, but a cohort of people has been completely pushed out of the housing market and is now homeless as a direct consequence of the rent supplement cuts last year.  Others have been left at high risk of becoming homeless and unless they are protected in the forthcoming budget I foresee a significant increase in the problem of homelessness.</p> <p>We have a rental market in which there continues to be strong demand.  Last year in this House, the Minister for Social Protection expressed her concern about the impact of rent supplement on rents and argued that rent supplements were keeping rents artificially high.  However, the fact is that in urban areas in particular, rents are rising.  We have a situation where people who have been locked out of access to mortgages and are not in a position to house themselves privately are looking to the private rental sector for accommodation.  On top of that, because of the cuts to rent supplement, we have a growing number of people on rent supplement who are unable to find anything approaching good quality accommodation in the rental market.  In my own area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, the rent supplement limits are simply unrealistic compared to market rates.  The market rent in my area for bedsit accommodation is €674 but the rent supplement limit is €475.   As a result of this, people are dipping into scarce social welfare payments in order to make top ups to put a roof over their heads.  Realism must be brought to bear on this situation.  </p><p>Threshold, the national housing organisation, has observed the low affordability of rental properties in Cork and a recent survey conducted by that organisation found that less than 10% of landlords with rental accommodation were accepting tenants at the lower rent supplement limits.  There has been a culture of cuts and reducing rent supplement limits over the past number of years, not just by this Government, but the previous Administration also.  In fact, the last Government introduced severe cuts to the rent supplement budget and as a result, many people are now confined to sub-standard bedsit accommodation.</p></speech>

That is the bottom line and there is no point in crying crocodile tears about it now.</p><p>I congratulate this Government for agreeing to transfer the rent supplement payment to local authorities and I urge the Minister for Social Protection to ensure this is done as soon as possible.  Rent supplement is a housing payment, not an income support and it should not be treated as such.  The sooner it is in the hands of the local authorities, the better and there is no better woman than Deputy Joan Burton to do that.</p><p>I urge the Minister to ensure there are no further cuts to the rent supplement budget next year because it is not realistic in the current housing market.  I ask her to review the reductions that were made last year, particularly regarding their impact on single people, one-parent families and parents with part-time access to their children, who are particularly disadvantaged by the housing market.  I also ask her to review the rental limits on a geographical basis because there are certain areas where the limits are having a very serious impact.  Finally, I ask once again that she transfer the payment of rent supplements to the local authorities as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I have called for a debate on youth unemployment in this House and was hoping to address that issue with her today.  The Minister mentioned earlier that there are between 70 and 80 programmes under the aegis of her Department but I will only be able to refer to a number of these in the limited time available to me.  In her speech the Minister referred to the Irish Presidency of the European Union and her plans to advance the EU youth guarantee.  In the last week, however, the financial transaction tax has been linked by the Austrian and French Governments to the proposed EU youth guarantee, which raises a lot of concerns, given that the Irish Government has said it will not sign up to the proposed financial transaction tax.  I am concerned about where the EU youth guarantee will go, especially in the context of our very high youth unemployment rate, if it is linked to the financial transaction tax.</p><p>The Minister also referred to community employment, CE, schemes in her speech.  Yesterday, I met members of the troika, with whom I raised the issue of youth unemployment.  They told me that they had encouraged the Government to look into measures to tackle unemployment and long-term unemployment in particular.  They said they encouraged the Government to provide services around upskilling and training, especially for those who were previously employed the construction sector.  In that context, the community employment schemes have massive potential.  The original purpose of the CE schemes was to counteract the drift into long-term unemployment.  They were targeted at those who are over 25 and were focused on the older, low-skilled job seeker.  Perhaps something could be done to include those under 25 in the schemes now, given that we have so many young unemployed people, many of whom have been on the live register for long periods of time.  What can be done to modernise the CE schemes to include young people and to make them relevant to them?  The CE schemes could provide them with the skills, training and experience they need while also enabling them to enhance their communities. </p><p>My party has raised the issue of poverty-proofing on numerous occasions.  More must be done to make sure that all our legislation is poverty-proofed and that measures taken by Government do not disproportionately affect those on low and middle incomes.  We must ensure that cuts and tax increases are not driving people further into poverty.  During the debate on the Local Government (Household Charge) Bill, we proposed an amendment based on the criteria used by the ESRI to measure poverty, so that we can know that measures being implemented through legislation are not pushing people further into poverty.  I await the Minister's response on that issue when she returns to the House.  </p><p>The Minister also made reference to the domiciliary care allowance in her speech and to the fact that it is currently under review.  I have questions regarding the criteria used to assess eligibility for this allowance, and specifically the requirement that the child needs &quot;care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age&quot;.  I am not sure if other Senators have had this experience, but I have had many people contact me who have applied for a domiciliary care allowance, whose child does need more care and supervision than other children of the same age, but they are hitting a brick wall and are being refused the allowance.  Is it the case that the eligibility criteria are being examined as part of the review?  The qualification criteria seem to be especially stringent and many families who are caring for children are very frustrated.  The social protection system is supposed to help the most vulnerable in our society.  If it is not helping them, what is the point of it?  In that context, I ask that the Minister provide more details on the review and I look forward to her response on her return.</p></speech>

Most Senators would agree that she is a reforming Minister and that she is trying very hard to streamline the dysfunctional system she inherited.  That system certainly contributed to Fianna Fáil retaining power for two terms.</p><p>We all want to see a situation where the social welfare budget of €20.5 billion is targeted at the most disadvantaged in our society.  We all know that there are very serious abuses within the social welfare system.  Many of them have been tackled already but many have yet to be tackled.  I hope that whatever savings are made in that regard will offset whatever reductions are necessary in the 2013 budget.</p><p>Senators have raised a number of important issues already but we must recognise the fantastic work that is being done within the community employment schemes.  </p> <p>The financial review of community employment schemes was a job well done.  It proved the schemes worked and that there were opportunities for savings within the system.  There are 23,500 places in the system, including 1,400 for supervisors.  The schemes are providing fantastic services to local communities.  They are supporting social inclusion and tackling educational disadvantage in communities.</p><p>There has been much debate on the issue of child benefit and whether we should retain the universal payment system or have targeted payments to the disadvantaged.  We need further debate and discussion on that.  Not everyone, particularly the very wealthy, should receive child benefit.  The taxation system may be the way to address the issue. </p><p>The Minister made passing reference to the free travel pass.  There is considerable abuse of this system throughout the country.  The issue needs to be addressed.  There should be a modest charge on the travel pass.  Holders of the pass might, possibly, have to register every year to confirm their entitlement.  There is anecdotal evidence that the system is being abused hand over fist, and we need to address this.</p><p>I met an employer last week who until a few weeks ago had been employing 18 people.  The banks pulled the plug on his business because they would not lend him €150,000, despite the fact that he had orders worth €1 million to take him up to Christmas.  He laid his staff off.  They signed on and will receive redundancy payment.  He and his fellow-director, however, have no income and are not entitled to any State benefit.  That is not right and it must be addressed.  I urge the Minister to look at this situation and to put in place a system whereby self-employed people can contribute and have something to fall back on if they go out of business. </p><p>I join with colleagues in appealing to the Minister not to carry out the proposal to place the burden of sick pay on small businesses that are already stretched.  Many of them will go to the wall if we impose that additional cost on them.  </p><p>I agree with Senator Hayden regarding rent supplement.  It should not be cut further.  I meet people in my clinics who are now living in substandard accommodation because the rent supplement has been cut.  The sooner local authorities take responsibility for the rent supplement and the whole area of local authority housing is examined, the better.</p><p>The issue of fuel poverty has been raised.  It is a particular problem for elderly people who are living on the old age pension.  If we can make savings elsewhere the issue of fuel poverty should be addressed.  Additional resources should be made available for the fuel scheme and it should be targeted at elderly people living alone.</p><p>I agree with Senator Byrne that the appeals procedure for disability and invalidity benefits takes too long.  The Minister must examine the applications and appeals systems.  It is not acceptable that people should have to wait six, nine or 12 months for a decision on their application for benefit.</p><p>I wish the Minister, Deputy Burton, well.  She has a difficult task and a huge budget.  We all support her in her efforts to put in place a system that targets the underprivileged and we want to see abuses of the system eliminated, as a matter of urgency. </p></speech>

Táim an-sásta go bhfuil mé ag fáil deis labhairt ar an ábhar fíor-thábhachtach seo.</p><p>  Tá go leor ábhar i gceist leis an rannóg áirithe seo agus go leor ábhar go bhféadfaimid a phlé, ach díreoidh mé ar chuid acu sin.</p><p>  Táthar ag glacadh leis go gcaithfear gearradh siar a dhéanamh ar an Roinn Coimirce Sóisíalaí.  An bun-difríocht a bhéadh idir Sinn Féin agus na páirtithe eile ná nach nglacaimid-ne leis gur chóir go mbéadh sin a tarlu.  Dár le Sinn Féin, tá sin ag tarlú mar gheall ar na fiacha baincéireachta atá orainn, mar go bhfuilimid ag íoc ar ais le lucht baincéireachta agus as na bannaí nár thugamar aon barrántas orthu, agus nach ndeachamar i ngleic leis an bhfadhb sin.  </p><p>  It is taken as a <i>fait accompli </i>that there will be cutbacks in the Department of Social Protection.  Sinn Féin does not, necessarily, concur with that view.  Our fundamental economic model is different from that of the Government and Fianna Fáil.  The austerity budgets should not have been brought in as they were.  Unguaranteed bondholders should not have been paid back, but that is a wider debate.  </p><p>  That debate does, however, relate to social welfare and is specific to some of our social welfare payments.  The one thing we know about social welfare recipients is that they spend most of the money they have in their local economy. Every penny is used and spent locally.  Cutbacks in social welfare have a substantial multiplier effect on local shops and businesses.  </p><p>  The Government's fundamental economic model, under the aegis of the troika, is the wrong one.  We should be stimulating growth by creating employment, taking more people off the live register and, therefore, reducing social welfare payments.  That can be done, as shown in the jobs proposal Sinn Féin has put forward which I hope Senators will read over the weekend.  We need to create jobs to take people out of the social welfare scenario.</p><p>  We also need to tax wealth.  Sinn Féin brought forward proposals to cap Civil Service salaries of over &#8364;100,000 and to introduce a wealth tax of 1% and a third income tax band of 48% which would generate revenue that would alleviate the proposed cutbacks.</p><p>  Kite flying by Ministers about changes to social welfare payments is also detrimental.</p><p>  I agree with what Senators Hayden and Mullins said about some areas of social protection.  The basic tenet of the argument, however, is that if one buys into the model of austerity and cutbacks one must cut back social protection measures.</p><p>  In last year's budget, lone parents were given a very raw deal by the Minister who introduced severe cutbacks.  I call on the Minister to reverse those cutbacks in the forthcoming budget.  Budget 2012 removed many of the protections that were, rightly, put in place to help lone parents with the costs associated with returning to work.  It reintroduced poverty traps and put in place obstacles to work, despite the rhetoric from the Government that the opposite was its objective.  We were making it easier for lone parents to stay at home rather than continue in employment.  Many of the groups who lobbied public representatives testified to this.  I must praise Single Parents Actively Raising Kids, SPARK, who did very good lobbying on this issue.  I am sure they will be lobbying again in the run-up to this year's budget.  </p><p>  Last year we saw cuts, including a drop in rent allowance, children's allowance for families with more than three children and reductions in back-to-school and fuel allowances.  The one-parent family allowance was also removed from people on community employment schemes.  I call on the Minister to look into the purse and reverse those cuts, in particular.   </p><p>  Senator Hayden raised the issue of homelessness.  I concur with most of what she said.  She is perfectly right.  The cuts to rent supplement caused huge strife throughout the country.  They did not reflect what was happening in the market.  The fundamental model used to calculate the rent supplement was wrong.  It was based on an average rent in an area and did not reflect what people were actually paying.  In Galway city, for example, there were caps on rent supplement of &#8364;700 for a family, while most people were paying &#8364;800 or &#8364;850.  People were forced to move out of their homes and communities and the cut caused considerable upheaval.  I ask the Minister to revisit this matter.</p><p>  The fundamental issue is that we are too reliant on private rented accommodation and we are paying too much for it. </p> <p>The State should be providing more accommodation and I agree that it should be under local authority aegis.  We have been talking about this for the past year and I do not see any proposals coming forward from the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, on the issue in the interim.  I would hope to see them as a matter of urgency.  Large numbers of people are on the housing lists.  This issue is probably one of the most common to be raised at all our local offices as people try to get their names on the council housing or transfer lists.  It is obvious there is a dearth of housing stock and this matter needs to be addressed.  </p><p>The issue of poverty which was raised by Senator Reilly is very important.  We should examine every Bill that comes through these Houses to ensure it is poverty-proofed.  I suggest the EU model which we debated here at some length during the year.  The stories we have heard this week about people having their &quot;cornflakes day&quot; once a week because they cannot afford a full meal, are scandalous.  I agree that the cuts in fuel and other allowances should be reversed.</p><p>Tá neart eile gur mhaith linn a rá faoin ábhar seo, ach tá mé cinnte go mbeidh lá eile ag an bPaorach.</p></speech>

Even though the Department has been renamed the Department of Social Protection the traditionalists among us still regard it as the Department of Social Welfare.</p><p>The Minister has a very difficult job in advance of the budget.  I acknowledge her efforts to date in examining a range of options in an attempt to produce realistic and viable savings in the various departmental schemes.  Her annual budget is more than €20 billion which is a very large sum of money, more than €20,000 million.  It is a question of how to put that money to best use to provide the social security net needed by the elderly, children, unemployed and disabled people while at the same time attempting to use as much of that money as possible to get people back to work.  The Department has a variety of schemes of assistance for the elderly, the unemployed and those on invalidity pensions.  The debate on the social welfare budget usually happens over one or two days but this House needs to debate with the Minister more frequently on how social welfare resources are allocated.</p><p>In advance of the current Government's first budget one year ago, there was a view that the budget would be exceptionally tough with a broad spectrum of cuts across all Departments.  That did not happen and perhaps we are playing catch-up now in order to deal with some of the issues we did not seem to deal with last year.  My suggestion at the time - which may have been simplistic but it had certain financial merits - was that rather than removing some schemes and taking 20% from some payments and 5% from other payments, it might be better to have a modest 2% to 4% cut across all the payments.  It would have been very straightforward from an administrative point of view.  It might not have been entirely fair but then nothing in politics or in life is ever fair.  However, such a measure would have produced the savings of €500 million to €700 million required and in a balanced fashion.  Instead, we attempted to target a smaller number of payments and a smaller number of sectors.  I would like to discuss this with the Minister when she returns to the House.</p><p>I brought a group to the Dáil Visitors Gallery a few days ago.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, was responding to questions on disability and disability payments.  She stated that approximately 250,000 people are in receipt of either a disability, invalidity or injury benefit.  These people are deemed by the Department to be in some way injured, disabled or otherwise unfit for work.  I really wonder how accurate is that figure.  If 250,000 people are unfit for work through injury or sickness, our streets should be full of people in wheelchairs and on crutches.  This needs profound investigation.  It may be that some people who are perhaps unable to work are in the wrong scheme.  Others may become trapped in what becomes a vicious cycle of being injured at work or falling ill, signing on for injury benefit, suddenly getting disability benefit and ending up on an invalidity pension.  We must ask whether we truly believe that 250,000 people in this country are unfit for work, disabled, injured or sick, in some fashion.  I think the answer will be &quot;No&quot;.  We must then decide what to do about this situation.  We must try to engage with many of these people to see if they can be taken out of the so-called disability cycle and back to productivity.  </p><p>We had very useful and fruitful discussions in this House with the late former Minister, sadly deceased, Séamus Brennan, a man whom I hold in the highest esteem.  He was asked on one occasion how much of the social welfare budget was being claimed - I will not use the word &quot;fraudulently&quot; - because none of us lives in a glasshouse or on the high moral ground.  He was asked how much of the budget was being inappropriately claimed.  He put forward a figure which he said was only a guesstimate of up to 15% of the budget.  If only 10% of the social protection budget is being wrongly or not fully properly claimed - I am being careful with my language - that amounts to €2 billion and it is a lot of money.  We have a significant job of work in trying to re-engage with the hundreds of thousands of people who are claiming unemployment benefit, sick benefit, injury benefit or invalidity pension.  There is a need to encourage as many as possible out of the social protection scheme.  If only 10% of the money is being wrongly paid out, that amounts to €2 billion and it is money the country cannot afford.  I would love to see that money being saved and a substantial portion of it being used to further assist the hundreds of thousands of genuine claimants for child benefit, the old age pension, or whatever.  </p><p>Talking about a crackdown, fraud and chasing people can be very negative but if we can assure the public that a significant portion of the money saved will be re-invested into the hands and pockets of genuine claimants who really need it, this would help our mission to save money.  This is an issue that could be discussed all day but we need to talk about it much more frequently and in a much more open fashion.  I do not believe that one quarter of a million people in this country are physically unfit for work.  I do not believe that these people are frauds or criminals but rather they are people who have been corralled into a lifestyle by society, by lack of opportunity and by lack of education in some cases.  We need to help those people as much as penalise them.  Likewise, many of those in receipt of unemployment payments and jobseeker's benefit, need further help.  I suggest that schemes such as the family income supplement could be used to give people a little bonus to encourage them to go back to work rather than staying on social welfare.  New thinking is required.  </p><p>I was amused when people thought that the Minister, Deputy Burton, had been given a second division job.  In my view she has possibly the most important job in the Government.  She is looking after hundreds of thousands of people and a budget of more than €20 billion.  She needs our support and I look forward to working with her to ensure that the budget is used to the best extent possible.</p></speech>

I raise this matter in the context of comments made by the Minister for Education and Skills to the effect that two and three-teacher schools should consider their future.  According to the Minister, rural schools such as scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara which is located next to Ardea post office in County Kerry and to which this matter relates do not have a future.  The Minister is orchestrating a very slow and deliberate closure process for small schools throughout the country.  This process involves cutting off the school transport system on an incremental basis.  Over 60% of the students who attend scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara will no longer have access to school transport because they live nearer to a particular school in Kenmare, which is in a different parish.  As the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, is aware, a school is the heart of a parish.  Once a local school is closed down, a parish will slowly but surely wither away.  Regardless of whether this is a deliberate policy, it will certainly result in the outcome to which I refer and will have a detrimental effect on rural areas if the Minister is allowed to persist with it.</p><p>Four bus runs are provided for in order that students from Killane and Dromuchty can travel to scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara each day.  The parents of these students have been informed that in the future they must attend the school in Kenmare to which I refer.  School transport is being provided on a concessionary basis in some cases.  I have two nephews who attend the school, one of whom is guaranteed transport, while the other - Dylan - is not and may be obliged to attend a different school in the future.  What I have described is happening to children throughout the country.  Scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara is just one example of the consequences of the Minister's policy in this regard.</p><p>When the school in Douras and Lansdowne national school were closed, an amalgamation took place and scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara was established as the central school.  At the time there was an undertaking given to the effect that transport would be provided.  The Department is now resiling from that undertaking.  The school's future is, to put it mildly, in doubt.  If school transport policy remains as it stands and parish boundaries continue to be broken, the school in Kenmare, namely, St. John's, which is an excellent school and has only just been opened will not have the capacity to deal with the additional pupils it will be obliged to accommodate.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply.  I am sure he has encountered similar cases in his constituency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1081" speakername="John Perry" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800009#X00600"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  To begin, I wish to give the House an outline of the extent of the school transport service.  School transport is a very significant operation.  It is managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  School buses make journeys totalling 82 million km annually.  In the region of 114,000 children, including more than 8,000 with special needs, are transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools.</p><p>A number of changes to the school transport scheme arising from recommendations made in the value for money report on the scheme were introduced by the previous Government in budget 2011.  The changes at primary level related to the introduction of charges and changes to the closed school rule and the minimum numbers required to establish or maintain a service.  The changes which are relevant to the school in question relate principally to the closed school rule.  The Senator will be aware that, in the context of school transport eligibility, this rule was introduced in the 1960s and relates to circumstances where a primary school is either closed or amalgamated with another school.  Under the rule, as it previously applied, where a primary school closed and amalgamated with another, pupils who resided in the closed school area were eligible for transport to the school of amalgamation, even though their place of residence might be less than 3.2 km from that school.  Where a greater number of schools amalgamated, the central school rule applied.  In such instances, transport was provided for children who resided not less than 1 mile or 1.6 km from the new central school.  No time limit had been applied in respect of either rule.  Consequently, the closed school rule had been in effect for over 40 years.  Even in circumstances where there was actually a newer school closer to the child's home, transport eligibility was to the amalgamated school only.  In such circumstances, the child was not eligible for transport to the newer school.</p><p>The practical consequences of the changes to the closed school rule are: distance is now the key eligibility criterion which applies; from the 2012-13 school year, pupils residing in a closed school area, for whom the amalgamated school is not their nearest school but who enrol in their nearest school, will be eligible for school transport, provided the 3.2 km requirement is met; and in the case of all future primary school amalgamations, eligibility will be based on the distance criteria which apply when the amalgamation takes place and attendance at the nearest school.</p><p>In the context of the Department of Education and Skill's planning of primary school infrastructure, school accommodation needs in each area are assessed on the basis of local demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  The changes announced to primary school transport services are in line with this approach and will result in a more efficient and cost-effective scheme.  While there will be a transitional period in which children in the same family or area may be eligible for transport to different schools, ultimately eligibility for school transport will be easier to determine and the scheme will be simpler and more transparent for families and schools.</p><p>It is important to note that eligible children who are already attending an amalgamated school will retain their transport eligibility in order to allow them. providing there is no change in their circumstances, to complete their education at that school.  In cases in which families are not eligible for school transport, they may apply for transport on a concessionary basis, subject to a number of conditions detailed in the scheme.  I am pleased to advise that the cost of concessionary tickets was reduced to €100 per annum by the Government from the commencement of the 2012-13 school year.  This is the same charge as that which applies in respect of eligible tickets.</p><p>Given that the terms of the scheme are being applied equitably on a national basis, there is no scope for reversing the changes to which I refer.  Under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of €17 million in the school transport budget and all of the measures I have outlined, including the changes to the closed school rule, are an integral part of this.  It makes economic sense that, when fully implemented, the provision of school transport to the nearest school will reduce the overall cost of school transport services.</p></speech>

Perhaps he might convey to those who wrote the reply he read - a Labour Party Senator referred to this on the Order of Business this morning - that I asked a specific question about a particular school.  I did not receive a reply to that question; the reply only contains a one-line allusion to the school to which I refer.  In the remainder of the reply phrases such as "In cases where families are not eligible for school transport, they may apply for transport on a concessionary basis" and "children in the same family or area may be eligible for transport to different schools" are used.</p></speech>

As a result of the Minister for Education and Skill's policy, families are going to be split up and siblings will be obliged to attend different schools.  What we are talking about is parishes being allowed to wither away as a result of schools being closed.  The reply from the Department falls very short in answering the question I asked.  Perhaps the Minister of State might convey my feelings on the matter to the Minister.  I am sure I could have obtained most of the information contained in the reply which the Minister of State was asked to read on the Minister's behalf on the Department's website.  A reply to an Adjournment matter should relate to the specific question raised about a particular matter.</p></speech>

I raise the Department’s current position on the allocation of teachers to Ratoath junior national school.  An unprecedented number of parents have been in touch with my colleague in Ratoath, Councillor Nick Killian, and a number of parents have been in touch with me.  They are most concerned at a decision of the Department, which I believe is under review today, to remove a teacher from the school.  What happened in Ratoath junior national school is that 470 names were on the school roll on the first day of term in September.  Ten of those names were reported to the National Education Welfare Board for various reasons which resulted in the school numbers being 460, seven short of the teacher allocation required to maintain existing staff numbers.  If the decision is upheld by the Department to remove a teacher based on the lower numbers, one teacher must go and one of five junior infants’ classes in the school must be reallocated to the other four classes.  That is not fair.  It is not right.</p><p>It is particularly unfair at this stage of the school year when children have settled into their classes if they have to be allocated to another class.  That would also result in one class having at least 37 pupils and an empty classroom within the school.  It might also have implications for next year in terms of whether the school would be in a position to take five classes.  The school is already over the threshold for four classes in the coming year.  It might not yet have reached five but it expects to do so.  The school might not be able to take all of the pupils that wish to go to it next year.  Therefore, if the decision is not reversed there might be pupils in Ratoath who are not accepted into the junior infants’ class in the school next year.  The school has already lost four teachers in the areas of resource teaching and language support and is in danger of losing a fifth mainstream teacher.</p><p>One of the criteria used in assessing such decisions is whether the post relates to a mainstream teacher.  I urge the Minister to take that into account and to take the particular circumstances of Ratoath into account.  It is a growing area.  The pupils are already six weeks’ into their school year.  I urge him to please leave the teacher in place to give the children the best possible education.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1081" speakername="John Perry" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800009#Y00300"><p>I thank the Senator for giving me the opportunity to outline for the House the position on the allocation of teaching posts to primary schools.  The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on the Department's website.  The staffing schedule is the mechanism used for the allocation of classroom teachers to all primary schools.  It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location.  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.</p><p>Classroom teachers are allocated under the staffing schedule based on the pupil enrolments for the previous 30 September.  While mainstream staffing for any school year is based on the previous September's enrolment, there is a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment.  The retention of such posts in the current school year is subject to schools having achieved their projected enrolment on 30 September.  If the enrolment is not achieved the post allocated on developing grounds is suppressed.</p><p>The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing circular 0007/2012 which is available on the Department's website.  The appeal criteria include provision for schools that have been granted a post under the developing school criterion.  Such schools may lodge an appeal on the basis that the pupils that failed to enrol as projected by 30 September 2012 are likely to be enrolled by December 2012.  A post allocated by the appeal board under this criterion will be sanctioned on a provisional basis, subject to confirmation of the required enrolment being achieved before 31 December 2012.</p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy had an enrolment of 442 pupils on 30 September 2011.  As a consequence, the school's staffing for the 2012-13 school year is a principal and 16 classroom teachers.  The school has an additional five support posts for learning and language support and resource teaching.</p><p>The school applied for a developing school post based on a projected enrolment of 478 pupils at September 2012 and this post was conditionally approved by the Department on 6 March 2012.  However, I understand that the required projected enrolment was not achieved by 30 September.  The school was therefore informed that the post was being suppressed in the normal manner.  The school has appealed the decision to the primary staffing appeal board.  The appeal board is holding its meeting today, 18 October, and it will consider the appeal from the school in question in this process.  The board of management of the school will be notified of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible.  The appeal board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  I thank the Deputy again for giving me an opportunity to update the House on the matter.</p></speech>

I hope the Department has the correct figures.  I will check the position immediately with the school.</p><p>My child started school this year in the junior infants’ class in another school in County Meath.  I can only imagine the disruption that would be caused to her by having to move classes and perhaps having to go into a class with 37 pupils because of what might be an arbitrary decision by the Department.  I urge the Department and the appeal board to take into account the factors I have raised on the school and the special circumstances that apply.

I apologise for the mix-up that occurred previously.  The Minister is familiar with the plans and proposals on the rejuvenation and re-establishment of the Irish sugar industry and its potential for jobs.</p> <p>Most independent people believe there is the possibility of creating 4,500 jobs over time in this industry time.  We import 80% of our sugar from British Sugar.  The Minister is entering into a phase of serious negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform.  As the compensation scheme is due to end from 2015 I ask the Minister to give me an update on whether the Government is seeking 1% of the quota for Ireland.  I read with concern today in the farming supplement in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>about a decision made by the European Union Commission to reduce the maximum target for crop-based biofuels and bio-liquids to 5%.  Will that have any effect?  </p><p> I heard the Minister say on RTE radio recently that he is broadly supportive of this move.  It is a major opportunity for us.  Thousands of people here are interested in it.  It would provide an additional line to our farmers and those involved in tillage also, particularly in the event of inclement weather which we have experienced recently.  We have grown sugar beet here.  It can be done, and it would have the effect of reducing costs for many companies here that use sugar as a main part of their ingredients, both in the drinks industries and others, which import from other countries.  I am interested to hear the Minister's views.  Will this be part of the Government's negotiations on the CAP?  I thank the Minister for attending.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.476" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800009#Z00200"><p>I thank the Senator for raising the issue because it is relevant.  There are many interests that for some time have been discussing whether it is possible for Ireland to start processing sugar again from sugar beet.  As somebody who has driven many tractors and trailers with sugar beet into what was previously the Mallow factory, when I worked on a farm in Mallow, and on our farm at home for a while I have a good appreciation of how important the sugar industry is for the tillage sector as a break crop, a cash crop, a crop that does not rely on any payments and a crop that produces cash at a time of year when farmers want it, which is in the autumn in the build up to Christmas.</p><p>I have been as supportive as I can be of both feasibility studies that have been put together in the past six months from two different groups, both with a view to exploring the possibility of growing sugar beet for sugar processing in Ireland and putting a business case together for the redevelopment of a sugar processing sector.  Both of those feasibility studies were impressive, and I spent quite some time talking through them and so on with both teams.</p><p>It is important for me to emphasise that if we are to have a sugar industry re-emerge here we must ensure that it is an industry built on solid foundations in terms of the financing of it and the business plan for it.  It is something I would really like to see happen but the business case is the most important issue.  My job as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is to ensure that if a business case can be made for spending the guts of €200 million or €300 million on putting a new processing facility in place Ireland has a quota to be able to produce sugar, if there is still a quota regime, or that we can move away from the limitations of a sugar quota regime within the European Union as soon as possible.</p><p>In 2005, when there was a fundamental change in EU sugar policy, Ireland got out of the sugar processing business and significant compensation was paid to encourage us to do that.  I not want to go into the history of that but I had a big problem with it at the time.</p></speech>

That would leave Ireland, or anybody else who wants to process sugar, free to do so and take their chances on the open market.  That will not happen, however, because there are very powerful countries in the EU which want to see a continuance of sugar quotas beyond 2015.  As a realist I believe that is likely to happen, perhaps until 2017 or 2018, and therefore I have made the case, both on and off the record, to the Commissioner in Council meetings and outside them that if we are to move a sugar quota regime beyond 2015 countries like Ireland, which is trying to put a case together for processing sugar again, should be facilitated in doing that if there is to be an increase in EU sugar quotas, which I believe there must be because there was a big sugar shortage last year.</p><p>In terms of the calculation for the people who are trying to put this case together and who have gone a long way in terms of getting investors, picking a suitable site and talking to farmers about their capacity for producing sugar, a great deal of work has gone on in this area and much credit is due to a number of people, in particular Michael Hoey from Country Crest and others who have shown leadership in this area.  They need to know that Government is supportive of them in terms of trying to access quota for them but, ultimately, they will have to make the numbers add up in terms of making this work.  That is possible.  The rule of thumb is that if the price of processed sugar globally remains over €500 a tonne, the feasibility studies suggest that this is a viable proposition even given the capital expenditure that is required to build that processing facility.  </p><p>The judgment call that must be made, however, is the impact on world sugar prices when quotas are lifted in the EU, potentially after 2015, 2017 or 2018, and whether there will there be a significant increase in production of sugar across the European Union which may reduce the actual price of processed sugar internationally because it is very difficult to compete in Europe with sugar that has been processed from sugar cane in Brazil, for example, just as it is difficult to compete with sugar cane on a series of other levels from an ethanol perspective as well.</p><p>My view is that my job is to be supportive of the people who are working hard to make a business case for a sugar processing and ethanol and biofuel operation around that and to support them in that but also to ensure that if and when that happens, it is built on solid foundations that will last for decades rather than being an industry that starts with a lot of positivity but cannot keep going because it is unable to compete with other parts of the world.  There is a series of issues at play here but the fact that we are even talking about this and that people have put a significant amount of time and money into putting together very credible feasibility studies is a significant step in the right direction.</p></speech>

Otherwise, my responses today would be very general.</p><p>Now that I see Professor Mirrlees in the Visitors Gallery, I would like to say that in Ireland social welfare plays an enormous stimulus role in terms of demand.  Payments paid in pensions and to carers, jobseekers and almost 250,000 people who receive weekly payments relating to some kind of illness, disability or invalidity are all spent in our domestic economy and, therefore, constitute an important part of the spend in our domestic economy.  The recent work by the Central Statistics Office confirms this and highlights the importance of both the public wage spend and the social welfare spend, particularly in small and large towns throughout the country.  Many Seanad Members are aware of this in their own localities.</p><p>Today, I want to talk about a number of the important considerations being examined, including in the context of the forthcoming budget and the challenge that budget presents.  I would emphasise that I am anxious to see that people, such as pensioners, who rely on a weekly payment for all or the bulk of their income are protected in the budget for 2013 as we did in the budget for 2012.  On Monday in Sligo, the Taoiseach and I jointly opened the first office to facilitate the introduction of the new social welfare configuration.  This will mean that people coming in to receive jobseeker's payment will not only apply for payment, but will be introduced to a pathway back to work.  If they cannot find work in the current climate, they will be facilitated through training and education.  We emphasise this is for all jobseekers, particularly those who are at risk of long-term unemployment and young people.  Throughout the European Union there is a problem with regard to youth unemployment and in the context of the forthcoming Irish Presidency, I hope to be able to focus to some degree not only on employment and getting back to work, but on the supports Europe needs to put in place in the area of youth unemployment.</p><p>To return to the event in Sligo on Monday, the programme for Government gave an undertaking to introduce a better approach as to how the State engages with and supports the unemployed to get back into the workforce.  The challenge set by the Government in Pathways to Work is to ensure that the creation of new jobs results in a reduction in unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, so that individuals do not become permanently disenfranchised within society and to ensure they have financial independence for themselves and their families.</p><p>The aim of the Department with the new service is to engage with every unemployed individual to ensure that their first day out of work is also their first step on the pathway back to work.  Future funding of employment programmes, particularly community employment, CE, will reinforce this objective.  This requires a more focused engagement with people on CE and greater targeting of places and opportunities to further the progression of unemployed people into work.  Community employment is one of a number of employment schemes managed by the Department of Social Protection.  Other smaller programmes similar in many respects to community employment are: the rural social scheme; the community services programme; the jobs initiative; and Tús.  All of these are valuable opportunities for individuals and communities, and communities benefit from the work and services provided through these schemes. </p><p>On several occasions here, we have discussed the issue of community employment.  After community employment was transferred from 1 January 2012 to my Department, I initiated a review.  Last Friday, the CE financial review was laid in the Oireachtas Library.  I will not go into the background of the review, as Members here are familiar with it, but will mention that community employment is the largest single labour market activation employment programme funded by the Department.   The 2012 budget for CE is approximately €340 million.  Labour support measures overall in the social protection budget amount to just under €1 billion.  Therefore, we are spending a significant amount of money on this programme.  In that context, I would welcome the insight of Senators into what expenditure and programmes under this heading they perceive to be particularly valuable and useful and how they feel those programmes could be improved.</p><p>There are 23,300 places in community employment, including places for approximately 1,400 supervisors.  There are an astonishing 1,136 CE schemes providing a wide range of social services to local communities throughout the country. </p> <p>I am happy to say that contrary to much of the scaremongering that went on at the time of last year's budget, there has been no reduction in the number of places available under community employment schemes.  It is important to emphasise that there has been no reduction in the employment of supervisors or in the number of places.  An interesting aspect of the review was that many of those involved in it sent us a great deal of financial information - Members may have local knowledge of this - and highlighted that if more places were available, they would be in a position to do more for people who are unemployed, for their own communities and for the services supported by community employment schemes.</p><p>The community employment programme is mainly targeted at people over the age of 25 who have been unemployed for a long time and are very distant from the labour market.  Those who participate in community employment schemes receive specified social welfare payments for a minimum period of a year.  They include people on the live register, lone parents and people with disabilities.  Participants associated with long-term disadvantage, such as ex-offenders, people with drug dependencies and people from the Traveller community, are included in these categories.  Community employment is a broad and flexible programme that has been used to address many social challenges at individual or societal level, for example, by organising rehabilitative programmes or supporting communities in the provision of services.  To be honest, many people with drug dependencies who enter into rehabilitation programmes are on a journey that will take several years.  That journey might involve getting an opportunity to go back to education before going back to work.  The reality is that the chances of a person on such a programme being able to make rapid progress into employment are not great.  One of the reasons community employment is experiencing such difficulties among economic commentators is that it is pitched as a labour market jobs programme.  When one looks deeply into community employment, however, one notices that it has certain ring-fenced areas in addition to its labour market area.  It helps people with drug issues who are rehabilitating, as I have said.  It plays an important role in providing a training pathway for people interested in personal care services, including child care.  It is important to mention that such pathways take a period of time.</p><p>I want to talk about some of the educational disadvantages experienced by many new entrants to community employment and how community employment has responded to them.  The highest educational achievement of 53% of new entrants to community employment is the junior certificate.  Some 23% of them did not progress beyond primary level education or have no record of educational achievement.  Men tend to have lower educational attainment than women.  Over 37,000 components of learning were completed by community employment participants in 2011.  Almost 17,000 of them were accredited by FETAC under the national framework of qualifications as minor awards.  Those involved in FETAC, including some Senators, will be aware that the aim of its work is to help people to attain level 5 and 6 qualifications, which they can use to get a job.  Lower-level qualifications are great from the perspective of bringing people back into the education sector.  Those who employ people in areas like care services and child care have made the point that level 5 and 6 qualifications are needed in many cases.  The attainment of such qualifications is a great achievement for all involved.  Approximately one quarter of community employment participants are between the ages of 25 and 35 and over half of all participants are over the age of 45.  This programme focuses predominantly on older, low-skilled jobseekers and requires a type of environment that supports and understands the adult learner.</p><p>Community employment has had two main objectives, both of which are absolutely important: helping the long-term unemployed to gain employment; and supporting organisations in providing services to communities.  This dual mandate can lead sponsors to focus too much on service provision, often to the detriment of the progression of the jobseeker.  The review has gone a long way to redress this.  The primary focus of this Department for community employment participants is to assist them in gaining the skills and work experience needed to enable them to enter paid employment, while at the same time supporting the provision of local services.  Some 19% of those who left community employment in 2011 went into employment, including social employment, through the community employment structure, and a further 7% went onto further education.  In the current economic environment, and taking into account the qualifications profile of participants, this can be considered a positive outcome.  It is not as good as I would like, but it is quite positive nonetheless, particularly for the individuals and their families.  The Department of Social Protection assumed responsibility for the budget of the scheme in January of this year.  When I spoke in this House on a previous occasion, I mentioned that the Department is responsible for between 50 and 60 schemes.  Now that we have taken over some other schemes, we are responsible for between 70 and 80 schemes, which means the job just got bigger.</p><p>The 2012 budget made changes to participant allowances and to the materials and training budget.  The subsequent financial review conducted by my Department concluded that considerable savings could be secured, but additional funds would be required in 2012 to maintain the activity, employment and opportunity levels for supervisors and participants.  The materials and training budget was increased by €9.5 million to €20.5 million through the transfer of funds within my Department.  Sponsors were notified of their revised grants in July.  A review mechanism was set up for sponsors who wanted further examination of the costs incurred in running schemes.  To date, no scheme has ceased to operate as a result of the level of funds awarded.  Twelve of the 1,136 schemes have availed of the review mechanism put in place by my Department.  The community employment financial review has delivered on a number of levels.  When I spoke to the House at the time, I gave an undertaking that no scheme would close as a result of these cost-saving measures and that has come to pass.  The financial review gave the Department a greater degree of understanding, insight and learning about the operation of sponsors at a time when new staff were taking managerial responsibility for community employment.  The review identified significant efficiencies that could be achieved.  A key conclusion from the review is that significant savings can be achieved in the areas of insurance, audit and bank fees without affecting the viability of schemes.  The savings that would not have an impact on the viability of schemes are estimated at €3.5 million in a full operational year.  Further savings and economies, in terms of the administration of schemes, have been identified.</p><p>It is obvious that community employment schemes date back to the 1980s, when my ministerial colleague, Deputy Quinn, was instrumental in their establishment.  There is a lot of administration involved in them.  I do not doubt that the review has helped to identify areas where one could achieve as much administration for less money than has been the case up to now.  It was realised that the pooling of some very small community employment schemes in various towns and communities, which is now happening, would lead to better resources for the areas in question.  In other words, different aspects of communities, such as Meals on Wheels, the GAA, other sports clubs and Tidy Towns, are coming together under a single umbrella.  That has the potential to lead to cost savings and increased effectiveness and to give the participants in community employment schemes a better profile in the community as a whole.  It is seen as a positive contribution to the community.  My Department is committed to reforming community employment, for example by examining the effectiveness of the full range of employment support programmes.  The outcome of this review will help to determine future policy with regard to the role and appropriate scale of activation programmes.  My understanding is that the review will be made available and published in the coming weeks.</p><p>The most significant development in the support provided for family and informal carers in the last decade was the publication of the national carers strategy.</p> <p>I made it a priority that carers were protected in the budget, for which the various organisations which address care issues have indicated their satisfaction.  I am aware that, where somebody is caring for an elderly parent or a child with an illness, carers give their families and the person who needs the care a huge amount of service and love but, of course, it also helps society.  We all know that the fact people who have issues around becoming frail in old age, or children who have a recurring consistent condition or illness, can be cared for in the environs of their own home serves to limit admissions, including nursing home institutional admissions, and is of huge value.  I also know how much carers put into caring.  This is why the strategy has been made a priority by Government.</p><p> We have heard from the carer organisations.  They sometimes feel they are unnoticed by their communities and, most of all, by the State, and that their contribution is not acknowledged in the way it should be.  Caring obviously has a huge impact on carers' lives.  I am very conscious of the fact that when people are looking after an elderly parent and that parent dies, the carer, having perhaps given his or her life to looking after the parent for, say, the past three, five or seven years, is left with a huge void when that comes to an end.  It is not just the simple grief of bereavement because the person's whole life has been focused around that.</p><p> The Department is also assisting in terms of carer's allowance.  There are currently approximately 51,000 people in receipt of carer's allowance and, of these, 20,000 are in receipt of half-rate carer's allowance and another social welfare payment.  Two carers who are providing care on a part-time basis in an established pattern can, since 2005, be accommodated on the carer's allowance scheme, which can be of benefit.  Carer's benefit is a payment for people who have made social insurance contributions and who have recently left the workforce or who are looking after somebody in need of full-time care and attention.  Recipients can get carer's benefit for up to two years for each person being cared for.  There are approximately 2,000 people in receipt of carer's benefit.</p><p> For a child up to the age of 17 who requires full-time care, a domiciliary care allowance of &#8364;309.50 per month is available.  Where the care is full time and onerous, the parent or guardian may also qualify for a carer's allowance and approximately 40% of parents do so qualify.  We also pay the respite care grant, which is paid regardless of the carer's means.  People in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit receive the respite care grant each June.  Carers also receive free travel, which is very valuable, as well as access to the household benefits package.</p><p> With regard to training, carers were identified as a priority theme under the economic and social disadvantage category of the dormant accounts allocation for 2007 onwards.  The focus of the carers measure is to provide training to assist carers in undertaking their role.  The Department of Social Protection is the lead Department for this measure and the funding is being channelled through the Department's Vote.  Pobal is administering the measure on behalf of the Department and is responsible for the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the programme.  Applications were assessed by Pobal and 12 groups were approved for funding in December 2008, although the training which commenced in September 2009 is now coming to an end.  The grants range in size from the Carers Association receiving more than &#8364;500,000 and Caring for Carers receiving almost &#8364;250,000, to small projects throughout the country.</p><p> I am very conscious of the needs of carers but there is also a wide range of other groups, such as unemployed people, parents, pensioners and people with disabilities, who depend on the welfare budget for vital support.  I assure the House that the Government, in the context of the very tough budgetary environment, will continue to do its utmost to protect the most vulnerable people in Irish society.  I am very pleased that organisations like the IMF, which we in this country associate with cuts more than anything else, has spoken in the recent staff reports of the significance and importance of the social welfare spend.  I believe the dialogue is bearing some fruit.</p><p> I am anxious to return in a couple of days, having had an opportunity to hear the issues raised by Senators.  We have made enormous progress in regard to further updating IT systems in regard to applications concerning carers, domiciliary care allowance and disability.  I can provide the detail on that in due course as I know it is of particular interest to a number of Members.</p><p> To go back to the launch of the new service, by the end of the year this will have been rolled out in ten different locations.  The first four are in Sligo, Kings Inn Street in the centre of Dublin, Tallaght and Arklow, and there is follow-on in a number of areas around the country, including at locations like Ballymun and Finglas in Dublin and Buncrana in Donegal.  This has meant a huge transformation in the Department of Social Protection.  The Department had approximately 5,500 staff but, exactly one year ago, 1,000 community welfare officers from the HSE were taken into the Department and, subsequently, we took 700 FÁS employees from its employment services into the Department, as well as 1,400 CE supervisors.  We also took in the local employment services through local companies, comprising another couple of hundred staff, and the Department is also handling the citizens advice service and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service.</p><p> I advise Senators the Department has recently set up a dedicated phone line based in Dublin to serve people who want advice about their mortgage or financial situation.  In the current economic crisis, we have two particular problems in this country, and I say this as much for the benefit of the troika as for the benefit of the Senators.  First, we have people in their 30s and 40s who went out, did the right thing, got a mortgage to provide a home for their family and now find themselves heavily indebted.  I welcome the comments made by the speakers from the Central Bank and the Department of Finance that the banks have to do more.  Yes, they do have to do more.  They have to cut to the chase and deal with the difficulties people are having because we will get no debt settlement without realistic, sustainable agreement between the debtor and the creditor.  Both sides have to come to the table and reach an agreement.</p><p> Second, we also have a situation in regard to social welfare, where the demands on the social welfare system are growing.  However, we have responded, as I said, by setting up a dedicated phone line through the Citizens Information Board and the very good website <i>keepingyourhome.ie</i>.  If people are in trouble and want advice, they can ring the dedicated phone line.  If they are reaching a deal with a bank and want financial advice, not just mortgage advice, they can arrange an appointment with one of a large panel of qualified accountants throughout the country to talk to them about the deal, so whatever agreement they reach with the bank is sustainable.</p><p> This is very important.  We do not want deals being done with banks which are not sustainable because, six months later, the deal will have fallen apart and the family which made the deal will end up more dispirited and in worse difficulty than if they had not made an agreement at all.</p> <p>I wish to stress to Senators that the service is now available countrywide, at local level.  People can talk to staff experienced in the area as well as go to the MABS services in their locality where that is available in order to build up a sense of what it is they need to do, what they can do and what the financial institution will agree to.  It is in that framework that we will be able to assist people who have difficulties with mortgages.  That is one issue that the Department is addressing in the current crisis.  The other issue is helping people back to work and education if they cannot find a job currently.</p></speech>

She must feel a cold wind around her Department as the budget approaches.  The demands on her Department will not alone be as bad as last year but on the basis of public statements from the Taoiseach down, the budget will be even worse.  I do not envy the Minister her job.</p><p>I could not help but reflect on a statement made in September 2011 to the effect that, for all that we are living through difficult times, we must always maintain a threshold of decency.  That was said by the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, at a pre-Dáil term meeting of the Labour Parliamentary Party.  The Minister made reference to the troika and the banking regulator.  It is somewhat apt that she should do so.  Her Department is primarily responsible for looking after the vulnerable in society, the socially and economically disadvantaged.  Many in society depend on the Department of Social Protection to put food on the table.  Stark statistics emerged in recent days, which even I find hard to grasp, to the effect that 450,000 in this country find it hard to put food on the table.  There was a letter from the wife of a garda who wrote about having ‘cornflakes days’.  What kind of society are we becoming?  It all seems to be because of the imposition of austerity concepts by the troika on this country in recent years and for the immediate future.  It is obvious that there is a growing volume of criticism that austerity alone does not work and that some form of growth policies must also be in place.  The Government has grappled with this particular conundrum since it was first elected last year.  Despite its best efforts, a range of job initiatives and various other policy initiatives, the unemployment rate remains stubbornly high.  I referred to 450,000 people, of whom approximately 300,000 are hard-core cases.  What is frightening and of more concern is that the queue of those who are long-term unemployed is lengthening.</p><p>That is the scenario in which the Minister is now going to have to put forward her budget proposals in the coming months.  I appreciate that the money must be found somewhere but the argument is that the money could be found elsewhere rather than through attacking the poor and the vulnerable.  It was interesting to hear the Minister’s impressive outline of various headings, in particular relating to community employment schemes.  I applaud her for the initiatives she has taken in that regard.  Great public concern was evident at the beginning of the year, which was reflected by all parties and by anyone who operates at local level and is aware of the importance of the schemes.  A great deal of uncertainty surrounded the transfer of the schemes to the Department.  The Minister’s promised review has taken the edge off much of the concern.  The facts, as the Minister has outlined them, are impressive and heartening.  I refer specifically to the fact that there has been no reduction in the number of places available on community employment schemes.  That is the bottom line.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.495" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800014#N00400"><p>Speaking as someone who comes from a part of the country that is socially and economically disadvantaged, like many of my colleagues, I am aware that community employment schemes have proven to be a lifeline in particular for single men in isolated areas who have an opportunity through the schemes to live their lives with dignity.  From that point of view there is more than just number-crunching involved in terms of what the schemes bring to the table.  I am sure the troika will have views, as other European institutions did, about the way this country has operated community employment schemes in recent years.  I am particularly pleased from that point of view.</p><p>The Minister outlined details on the national carers’ strategy.  To cut to the chase, a great deal of the discussion in recent weeks has centred on the possibility of child benefit cuts.  A report compiled by an advisory group to the Minister for Social Protection which was leaked to “The Week in Politics” in September created an awful furore in recommending a two-tier child benefit system.  What is forgotten to some degree is that reductions in child benefit have already been implemented in the previous budget and will continue into the next budget.  That is in isolation to any other propositions that might be forthcoming from the Minister.  I accept we are speaking in somewhat of a vacuum because the Minister is putting forward her Estimates and will be doing battle around the Cabinet table in the coming months.  We will have to wait until budget day before we get an indication of what will happen in the Department.</p><p>Fianna Fáil is opposed to the cuts for a number of reasons.  The Minister is very much aware of them.  One or two issues are of particular concern.  The elimination of payments on multiple births ignores the significant costs incurred following the birth of twins, triplets or more children.  I understand that approximately 1,200 families will be affected annually by such a cut.  The Minister must take account of public concern expressed by all of those involved in the area.  It will create a great difficultly for her.  Barnardos has warned that a third cut in a row to child benefit could worsen the situation of 90,000 children living in poverty.  The National Women’s Council said the payment had become an easy target for successive Governments and that any reduction would lead to further hardship.  Early Childhood Ireland, which represents preschools and day care services, said such a proposal would hit poorest families hardest.  The Children’s Rights Alliance said low-income families would have to be compensated in the event of a cut because of the massive impact it would have on them.</p><p>I have had some equivocation and ambiguity in my attitude previously - the same might be true of colleagues on all sides of the House - on whether one would continue with the universal payment or start tampering with it.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, said that a two-tier proposal must be considered at a time when one has to prioritise spending for families who need the most support.  On the one hand one could argue that it is a logical way forward that one would target those most in need.  I have never to been able to grasp why the computers cannot talk to each other in that regard.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on the issue.  In this high-tech age I cannot figure out why one cannot take a cut-off of people who are on an income of €150,000 who clearly do not need child benefit, and isolate them.  Perhaps it is not worth it in the overall scheme of things to separate those one assumes do not need child benefit.  The assumptions could be totally incorrect.  We do not know the domestic situation in the most affluent of families.  Perhaps the wife does not receive any money and as a result the money received in child benefit is badly needed for basic essentials for the children.  I am not sure how the Minister will tackle the situation.  On the one hand, logic would dictate that one would target those most in need but on the other hand one must question why successive Governments have shied away from diluting the universal payment concept.  In that sense, I would have to come down on the approach that it is best to leave well enough alone in that regard.</p> <p> I refer to the disability allowance.  The Government suspended its announced cuts to this allowance pending a further review to be undertaken by the chairperson of the Commission on Social Welfare and Taxation.  The most recent statistics published by the CSO last week reveal that consistent poverty experienced by people with disabilities increased from 8.8% in 2009 to 13% in 2010.  The reality, of which I am sure the Minister is well aware, is that young disabled people on disability allowances are excluded from all the activation programmes announced to date from her Department.  A recent survey by the ESRI found that two thirds of this group were willing to work with the correct supports but employment opportunities are limited for people with a disability.  Hence the relationship between disability and a higher risk of poverty.  Approximately 4% of people aged 18 to 34 have a disability.</p><p>I refer again to the programme for Government which states: &quot;We will ensure that the quality of life of people with disabilities is enhanced.  We will also facilitate people with disabilities in achieving a greater level of participation in employment, training and education.&quot;  There is an issue which I do not believe to be in the Minister's mandate; rather it is HSE-related.  When those with a disability or special needs achieve the age of majority at 18 years, they hope to go into adult education programmes.  However, the budget for such programmes has also been cut.  What will happen those young adults who already suffer from a disadvantage and must now try to get into the workforce without having any proper training?  The Minister might comment on how this issue can be addressed.  The programme for Government committed to the enhancement of the quality of life of people with disabilities.</p><p>The Minister was taken to task last week about a comment she made on maintaining core payments.  In this debate it might be useful if she clarified what she means by core payments.</p><p>The eligibility criteria for the disability allowance have changed in the past year and the refusal rate has gone up significantly.  What is the current status of rejection rates by the Department?  I am sure the Minister is not satisfied with these rates.  Why are they so high?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.497" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800015#O00200"><p>The Minister is very welcome.  The purpose of this debate is to discuss items in advance of the budget that might inform the Minister's decision making and it is on that basis I propose to deal with it.  I will cover a broad range of issues.</p><p>  I welcome the Minister's decisions on CE schemes; I say &quot;Yes&quot; to these schemes and their continuation.  I have seen the richness they provide.  I say &quot;Yes&quot; to the carer's allowance arrangements; there are no cuts to it or to the CE schemes.  I say &quot;Yes&quot; to the measures for pensioners and the free travel scheme.  These are all very strong social measures and give a great deal of dignity to the people who benefit thereby.  All these groups are vulnerable.</p><p>  The genesis of the welfare state was based on a system of rights and responsibilities in equal part.  It is a social contract between the citizen and the State.  As the Minister has often observed, it is a hand up rather than a hand out.  I am not sure this is fully understood any more.  In the fullness of time, when the Minister is doing information campaigns, it might be useful if the nature of the welfare state were explained to the public.  She might consider that for the long run.</p><p>  One of our problems is that welfare is being used to service debt.  According to the Central Bank, there are 130,000 mortgages in arrears, of which 83,000 are private residential mortgages that have been in arrears for at least three months.  Some 5,600 mortgages have gone into arrears in the past five months.  We have a deepening mortgage crisis in Ireland, with 70% of household debt being mortgage debt.  This is where the problem lies.  As I see it, the anomaly in our social welfare system is that payments such as FIS, jobseeker's allowance and benefit - not just mortgage income supplement - are being used to service mortgage debt.  This is due to the economic imbalance caused by the property bust and the recession.  It causes a cyclical problem whereby the State increases its own debt to pay out social welfare that is being used to service private debt.  It is creating a welfare system that is under an enormous burden and is not really a properly functioning system.  </p><p>  This is an issue for the Minister.  The Personal Insolvency Bill which is to be debated in this House is understood to give too much clout to the banks.  I read in the article by Kathy Sheridan in <i>The Irish Times</i> that the Minister stated the banks must help middle-income families who, by and large, are crippled with mortgage debt.  The Minister is at the Cabinet table.  How can she influence this issue in such a way that we can have a functioning banking system that will be fair to the citizens?  Let us not have a veto given to banks in the Personal Insolvency Bill.</p><p>  Senator Mooney described austerity as a problem - of course it is.  Yet we all know why we need austerity.  We must grasp every measure that will provide for and give us growth.  I attended an EU meeting last weekend where I learned that if we implemented the EU services directive our country would gain 2.4% in GDP growth.  I will make the same point to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton.  We need to look at such measures in order to counteract the very bad news in terms of austerity and necessary cuts.</p><p>  As the previous speaker remarked, nobody wants to attack the poor and vulnerable.  If it were only that easy.  When the opposite side was in government it had to take &#8364;5 from blind people.  I am sure it did not want to do that.  </p><p>  Will the Minister address my question?  How will her functioning system address the fact that welfare is being used to service banking debt?  Why is there no family income upper limit for welfare in order to maintain the work incentive?  Rather than means-test, surely there is a way of finding that if there are two parents and one child in a family a certain figure is the maximum welfare that can be earned, while if there is one parent with three children there is a different maximum welfare figure.  That families are living entirely on welfare without incentives to work shows a flaw in the system.  In the social protection committee we have learned that this applies to some 4% of families in the country, in particular families with three or four children.  How is this being addressed?  Children grow up in these families.  We do not want anybody to get a bad lesson from the welfare system.  If 4% of families have a problem let us address it.</p><p>   Are the various allowances such as those for rent and fuel and jobseeker's allowance being taken into account together when they are being calculated or approved?  Is there a reason the aggregate cannot form a method of arriving at an upper limit for welfare?  I have put that question before to the Minister and would like to hear the answer.  </p><p>  My next point comes as a result of walkabouts with feedback coming from constituents.  Why are people not asked to work for their welfare?  It would be purposeful and meaningful work, the people concerned would be out and about and their contribution would be visible.  Now that local councils and agencies are short-staffed and in need there could be a real benefit.  Fr. Sean Healy has put this concept to us before.  Taking into consideration the post a person had before falling out of employment, for example, an architect on &#8364;20 per hour, that person could work at that rate per hour to contribute a number of hours for his or her welfare.  If he or she was receiving &#8364;20 per hour before and is now receiving &#8364;180 per week in welfare he or she would work nine hours.  Has the Minister given any thought to that system?  I am sure Fr. Sean Healy has presented it to her.  I see a lot of merit there.  Fr. Healy costed that scheme at approximately &#8364;150 million because it would create extra work to run.  In addition, there would be a small reward of approximately &#8364;20 to &#8364;30 per week.</p><p>  There is a debate around child benefit on whether to cut or not to cut.  I believe there is good support for the Minister's proposed two-tier system.  I did a walkabout in a middle-class estate.  Let us not forget these are the people who are paying all the charges and facing property tax next year.</p> <p>The average age of children on the estate is under five years.  I spoke to 21 families, all of whom stated it would be fair to cut child benefit by &#8364;40 per month, provided the savings were put to good use.  I was astonished by this response, especially as these are the people who will pay the property tax next year.  They would love the &#8364;40 reduction in child benefit to be put towards their property tax.  This would be a reasonable solution, given that &#8364;40 per month adds up to &#8364;480 in a year and a property tax bill of &#8364;500 would be significant.  Psychologically, people do not mind if money taken from one area is used to ensure they do not have to pay another new bill.  There is a generosity of spirit abroad and people trust that we are doing the right thing.</p><p> Child benefit is a universal tax-free payment made to all families.  Since when did people come into the world equal?  When did incomes become equal?  Universal payments amount to unequal treatment.  The key issue is deciding where would be the dividing line between those who would lose &#8364;40 per month and those who would keep it.  We must bear in mind the squeezed middle and the wife of a Garda sergeant whose letter was cited in <i>The Irish Times</i>yesterday.  It is becoming abundantly obvious that the new poor are those in the middle class who do not receive social welfare payments.  We must set a figure for how much disposable income families should be left with after paying for essential outgoings.  Is the Minister working on this figure?  Has she worked out what can reasonably considered essential outgoings?</p><p> The jobseeker's casual working payment should be calculated by the hour rather than whole days.  The Minister will have heard this argument at a meeting last Friday.  Is she open to the suggestion such a move would facilitate greater part-time employment?  I am very concerned about the level of youth unemployment and I have examined the position in countries such as Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark.  All of these countries use this type of system as it allows for greater flexibility among jobseekers.  Youth unemployment stands at 8.5% in the Netherlands, 14.3% in Denmark and 30% in Ireland.  Under the arrangement I propose, jobseekers would not be unavailable for full days and would be able to do more part-time work.  This system reduces the disincentive to work on certain days which is created by the current social welfare rules. </p><p> The self-employed should have an option to contribute to the social insurance fund to address the possibility that their business will fold.  The Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection heard a good presentation on this issue.  Is the Minister open to this proposal which would provide a much needed safety net for the self-employed?  Self-employed persons should be given this option, even if it is costly.  </p><p> The Minister must not implement the proposal to have employers pay the cost of the first four weeks of sick leave for employees as to do so would force businesses out of this jurisdiction.  We have listened to the views of representatives of ISME, the Small Firms Association and IBEC on this matter.  Employers have informed me they will source employees in the North. </p></speech>

I welcome and thank her for being willing to return to the House to answer Senators' questions.  She has identified many ways by which her vision for reform and change is being implemented.  I commend her for this.  Senators appreciate the opportunity to exchange views with her on the choices she and her Cabinet colleagues will make in the next couple of months about the well-being and protection of citizens and residents and growth in the economy.  As she is well aware and as Senators Paschal Mooney and Fidelma Healy Eames noted, we are hearing many heart-rending stories of how people in the middle and low income brackets are finding it impossible to feed their families nutritiously.  One middle income woman stated: "There are weeks I can't put food on the table."  A man on low income who pleaded guilty to stealing groceries in order that his children could have milk stated: "I couldn't let my children ask for a glass of milk in the morning and not get any."</p><p>There has been a considerable comment about a recent research paper on food poverty published by the Department of Social Protection - I commend the Minister for making the report public - showing that 10% of the population was in food poverty in 2010.  I was so unsettled and upset by this figure that I read the paper in question to ascertain how the term &quot;food poverty&quot; was being defined.  One of the indications of food poverty is &quot;whether during the last fortnight, there is at least one day (i.e. from getting up or going to bed) when a person does not have a substantial meal due to lack of money&quot;.  While I do not know about anyone else in this Chamber, I certainly could not be productive or energetic or learn or relate well if I did not have a substantial meal.  While I know there is a difference in theory between food poverty and income poverty, in practice and in the day-to-day drudgery of not having enough to eat, one would imagine that they feel like the same thing.  Are they not in reality the same? </p><p>These are the stories and questions that weigh heavily on those who govern.  They must motivate all of us, especially the Minister and her colleagues, to reconsider each day the adequacy and correctness of the macroeconomic policies and choices being pursued, as well as the decisions of her own Department.  The Minister, in an interview during the summer - she referred to the relevant remarks when she commenced her speech in the presence of Nobel Laureate, Sir James Mirrlees - indicated that social transfers could be viewed as a kind of Keynesian stimulus to the economy, as well as an effective mechanism for reducing poverty and that it was critical to retain demand in the economy.  While I agree with these sentiments, if one were to apply a similar logic across the broad span of our macro policies which I hope the Minister will do, the Government would decide to make a substantive investment in a growth programme and pay attention to the extensive economic research which demonstrates that austerity policies in advanced countries between 1978 and 2009 were followed by economic contraction and higher unemployment.  How will the circumstances of the people to whom I have referred improve if the economy does not grow?</p><p>Allied to an adequate growth programme, we need to meet our current troika commitments and obligations of fiscal discipline and the Government needs to save €3.5 billion in the next budget.  As Social Justice Ireland points out in its budget proposals, it is not a troika requirement that we increase taxation revenue by €1.25 billion and reduce public expenditure by €2.25 billion through austerity measures.  Instead, we could reverse the ratio of public expenditure reductions to tax increases or at least consider reducing public expenditure by a lesser amount and finding additional measures to increase tax. </p><p>While much current commentary notes the progressivity of the taxation system, a recent publication by the TASC entitled, Tax Injustice: Following the Tax Trail, challenges this message that is not nuanced.  If the Government is committed to fairness and a progressive approach to taxation, the measures it takes should reflect the principle that the more one earns, the more one should pay.  There are still a number of tax breaks or reliefs which reduce the tax bill of high earners.  If we are to have a fair and progressive system, these measures should be eliminated.  It is calculated, for example, that the Government could increase tax revenue by €700 million if the tax break for all pension contributions was at the standard rate in order that high earners would not benefit more.  If the Minister or her Cabinet colleagues were to choose to implement this taxation measure alone, it would follow that she would not have to reduce her Department's budget for the social protection and well-being of the people by the €540 million figure she indicated to the Joint Committee on Social Protection recently. </p> <p>Is that the figure the Minister proposes to extract from the social protection budget or is she considering revising the Estimate downward in light of the potentially devastating consequences for many households if their protection income is reduced any further?</p><p>I have a number of other questions in light of the process of reform the Minister has undertaken in her Department.  I commend her on the establishment of Intreo, the new service she promised and has introduced that will be a single point of contact for jobseekers and employers.  I know it is part of her vision for reform to move from a passive model of income support to one that engages proactively with people dependent on social welfare but given the economic context and the very high unemployment rate, the Minister is aware that many people are taking up part-time and low paid work.  I listened to the Minister talk about some of the changes her Department is undertaking in light of the additional administrative burden but I point out that in respect of those with children taking up part-time and low paid work, the waiting time for family income supplement, FIS, is still approximately four to six months.  A call to the family income supplement section on Tuesday confirmed, by way of a recorded message, that the waiting times for new claims for FIS is 18 weeks and for renewals it is 16 weeks.  That is the official line.  The reality is likely far worse as ongoing queries from the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, indicate that it is anywhere between four to six months.  As the Minister knows, the delays in the FIS processing times are real crises for many families.  As the Minister is committed to helping those trying to work I ask her to consider assigning resources to commit to turning around the FIS claims within a maximum period of four weeks as a matter of urgency.</p><p>On the subject of family income supplement, it has also come to my attention that the Department of Social Protection is maintaining an interpretation of the family income supplement rules that is legally incorrect and I have an ethical obligation to raise that matter.  The Minister's Department changed its interpretation of the law governing FIS in 2009 under the previous Minister.  That changed interpretation prevented a person who is maintaining their children from claiming FIS if they are living apart from the child and the other parent.  Two claimants successfully appealed the Department's refusal to pay them FIS.  I have been advised that officials from the Minister's Department have met the Social Welfare Appeals Office on this matter and that representations were made to her following the successful outcome of both appeals yet it appears her Department may be continuing to deny the supplement to those who may be legally entitled to a payment.  Is the Minister in the process of rectifying that matter?</p><p>My last question is on the changes the Minister promised earlier this year regarding the one parent family payment, namely, lowering the age of the youngest child to seven years by 2014 for all lone parents regardless of when they entered the system, after which the one parent family payment ceases.  The Minister indicated that changing the age of the youngest child to ten in 2013 and seven in 2014 would not go ahead unless she got a credible and bankable commitment from the Government on the delivery of a Scandinavian type system of child care by the time of this year's budget.  Can she give us an update on her progress with regard to that promise?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.507" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Maloney" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800017#Q00200"><p>I welcome the Minister back to the House.  While the main function of the Department of Social Protection is the delivery of income support, it has now moved into the area of tackling unemployment through activation.  It is also proactive in the control of fraud and abuse.</p><p>The Department of Social Protection is responsible for 87 million payments per year at a cost of €20.5 billion, which is 40% of the overall Government spend.  That is a huge responsibility, and being at the helm of this Department is an onerous job for the Minister.  I assure her I would not like to take it on.</p><p>Last Tuesday the members of the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection met with officials of the Department and raised all our concerns with them, many of which the Minister will hear on the floor of the House today.  We had an informative meeting with the officials who outlined in detail for us the challenges of delivering a service with limited staff, streamlining the services and making changes that will deliver a more user friendly, informative and activation service to the people.</p><p>The official launch of the Intreo office in Sligo last week is testament to that.  That will be a great service in that people will be able to go into a one stop shop and meet one official who will deal with all their problems.  Until now, if people applied for jobseeker's allowance it would take up to 14 weeks to process in some cases and if people wanted to apply for supplementary welfare in the meantime they would have to complete all the forms again and provide all the documentation to a different person.  The need for that will be eliminated with the establishment of Intreo.  We have been advised by the officials, and I am taking them at their word, that the Department will be able to process applications in four days provided no major problems arise.  That is a great step forward.  The service launched in Sligo is up and running, as the Minister has told us, in a number of areas but it must be rolled out to other areas before the end of the year such as Ballymun, Buncrana, Dundalk, Coolock, Finglas and, I am delighted to say, Killarney.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.509" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Maloney" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800017#Q00400"><p>I thank the Minister.  I will hold her to that.</p><p>The Minister says repeatedly that she recognises the important role of employers in getting Ireland back to work, and with this in mind the Department will be actively working with employers in each area on getting feedback from them.  It will also roll out a road show in the coming weeks, starting with Limerick, in conjunction with IBEC, to interact with and encourage employers to work with the Department.  Many employers are not aware of the benefits of taking on an employee who is on the live register, such as Revenue job assist and the PRSI exemption.  When one hires a person with a disability, there are employability services such as the wage subsidy scheme, employment services and employers' supports.</p><p>It has been brought to my attention that a number of employers have advertised jobs and interviewed people.  An employer told me that on one occasion four people were called for interview.  Two turned up and were unsuccessful, one did not bother turning up and one was taken on.  The two people who turned up but did not get the job asked the employer not to forget their letter for the Department of Social Protection.  The person who was taken on remained three days and then left stating it was not worth his while.  We are all saying there are no jobs but that is going on.  Another Senator brought that to my attention this morning and asked me to raise it.  That is going on despite what people say to the contrary.</p><p>As we are discussing employers, if the Minister has not done so already I ask her to take off the agenda any proposals to get employers to pay the first four weeks of illness benefit for their employees.  While that may look good to employees at the outset, my concern is that it will cost jobs in the long run.  Employers are hard-pressed to pay their employees' PRSI contributions let alone their illness benefit.  That might be the proverbial final straw for employers.  I understand the Minister will refer to absenteeism in the workplace and in particular in the public sector but she should treat workers in the public sector the same as those in the private sector and tell them that if they take time off, they must live on social welfare only just as those in the private sector must do.  That might make a difference to the absenteeism rates.</p><p>One of the most widespread complaints is about the waiting time for applications to be processed.  I was delighted to hear on Tuesday that the Department is making progress in the processing time for applications and while there is still much to be done due to the high volume of applications, it is hoped that by the end of the year invalidity pension applications will be up to date.  It is also working vigorously to reduce the waiting times in its other applications offices.  I ask the Minister to keep the pressure on the Department to alleviate the backlog of applications and ensure a speedy response to applicants.  I trust that the Intreo office will have a positive effect on reducing waiting times.</p><p>I welcome also that the social services cards are being issued.  I understand that to date, 35,000 cards have been issued and are continuing to be issued daily to everyone.  It is hoped that will greatly reduce any fraudulent claims.</p><p>I thank the Minister for coming into the House to take this debate.  I very much welcome that she is endeavouring not to cut the core social welfare payments rates.  I hope she will take on board my concerns and those of my colleagues and give them due consideration when it comes to the budget.</p><p>The Minister will be aware that at every opportunity and in committee I raise the issue of the self-employed and the reduced number of benefits for which they can make application.  I ask that the same benefits be afforded to the self-employed as are afforded to PAYE workers.  I am not asking for a free service but that self-employed people be allowed to pay the same contribution rate as PAYE workers and avail of the same benefits.  One of the main benefits they are unable to avail of is family income supplement to help them earn a decent living.  The same is the case with carer's benefit and illness benefit.</p> <p>I know the advisory group that is working on this is preparing a report for the Minister.  I hope that when the report is published, we will have an idea of the suggestions the group is making to help the self-employed.</p><p>When a self-employed person eventually accesses jobseeker's allowance, he or she is not given a credited contribution simply because of his or her self-employed status.  People might think this is a small matter, but I think it is significant because the contribution in question is invaluable in the context of such a person's pension.  This anomaly is not addressed, it will have an adverse effect on the future pension entitlements of the self-employed.</p><p>I welcome the publication of the national carers strategy, which I had always been fighting for.  I respect the commitment of the Minister to the protection of the interests of carers.  In that context, I would like to mention the habitual residency condition that applies to Irish people who return to this country to look after a relative.  The two-year habitual residency clause is preventing such people from receiving carer's allowance.  It is an insult to Irish people who are returning to their own country that they are debarred from it.  I ask the Minister to examine the matter.</p><p>The Minister will be aware that I am constantly lobbying for the establishment of a central means-testing board.  I appreciate that cross-departmental co­operation is needed if this is to happen.  Its introduction would save a lot of money and avoid the duplication of work because information would be available to those considering applications for third level grants, social welfare payments such as the back to school allowance, social housing and medical cards.  All of the work needed to test a person's means should be done in one office.  It would eliminate some of the work of civil servants.</p><p>The briefing we received on the social insurance fund made for stark reading.  The provisional 2011 deficit of €1.5 billion will double to €3 billion in 2019 if no action is taken to tackle the shortfall.  The contributions of self-employed people would help to tackle this shortfall.  Some people are signing for credits without receiving any money.  They are keeping up their contributions merely to retain their pension entitlements.  A small contribution of €1 a week would be an inexpensive means of funding a pension.  Perhaps the Minister should consider the matter.  These people are not getting money, but are concerned to retain their pension entitlements.</p><p>As many Senators have said, the findings of the expert group that examined the reform of child benefit found their way into the media.  The Minister will appreciate that many scenarios are being bandied about.  If the expert advisory group has finalised its report, perhaps the Minister will advise the House of its findings if she is in a position to do so.  She mentioned that the value for money report on community employment schemes has been completed.  I am delighted to hear that no scheme has closed down.  There was uproar last year.  Many of us attended public meetings on this issue at which people expressed their anger.  We tried to transmit the message that the Minister kept reiterating, which was that no scheme would close down.</p></speech>

We will discuss the strategy for older people in more detail in the coming weeks.  Older people who paid their taxes and PRSI throughout their lives should be able to enjoy their golden years of retirement in confidence, without having to worry about falling into poverty.  That is something we really need to look at.</p><p>I could mention ten more matters, but I will conclude by referring to the school meals programme managed by the Department of Social Protection.  I welcome this fantastic initiative.  As Senator Zappone mentioned, it helps to ensure children get one decent meal a day.  I note that it is operated through the local authorities.  I ask the Minister to consider operating it through the family resource centres, which are fantastic.  The hands-on approach of those involved in the centres means they know exactly who needs assistance and who does not.  There is a fantastic centre in Killorglin that is already providing school meals.  I am sure their efforts could be enhanced if funding could be channelled through the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

I am sure he will transmit the gist of what is said here to the Minister for Social Protection, who has regrettably had to leave.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is a decent and courageous person.  I do not envy her as she faces such a mammoth task.  As I am nearly 70, I have lived through a couple of economic crises, but this is the worst one I can remember.  I never thought I would live to see the day when 10% of Irish people were experiencing food poverty.  That ties into what Senator Moloney eloquently said about the need for proper nutrition for our young people.  I understand she was echoing what my colleague, Senator Zappone, had said previously.  No Department is more necessary or more significant in dealing with this stark situation than the Department of Social Protection.  Ultimately, the Government has a duty to protect the welfare of citizens, rather than the system, which has many faults.  Senator Moloney referred to a series of anomalies and contradictions within the system.  The entire system is rife with them.  We need an interdepartmental review of the anomalies and Kafkaesque situations that do not actually assist the Exchequer.</p><p>I wish to make a practical suggestion.  Somebody at a reasonably senior level in the Civil Service should be appointed to audit the budgetary proposals of the various organisations.  I refer specifically to proposals that are supposedly budget-neutral, Exchequer-neutral or to the benefit of the Exchequer.  I am dizzy from going from briefing to briefing.  That is why I might not be as completely focused as I would like.  I will mention some of the briefings I have been at.  A number of organisations have produced documents to claim they could do a huge amount for their client base in terms that are budget-neutral or beneficial to the Exchequer.  There is a suggestion that these things are not being done because of bureaucratic red tape.  A couple of years ago, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, for which I have great regard, suggested that fuel allowance should be frontloaded to allow people to buy oil in bulk.  It would not have been more expensive.  It might have been cheaper because people would have been able to deal with oil companies that do not supply meagre amounts of oil every two weeks or every month.  That suggestion was not adopted even though it would not have cost anything.  It would have helped elderly people in isolated areas to have security of heating.  Why was it not done?  I do not understand it.  There is a blockage somewhere.  If we centralise the process by asking somebody with the intellectual capacity and the seniority within the Department to review these submissions, he or she might be able to say which ones would be able to eliminate anomalies, save money and benefit the people.</p><p>I will give another couple of examples.  I attended a briefing yesterday that was organised by some wonderful people from the Family Support Network.  Ms Sadie Grace, who champions the cause of the network, is a neighbour of mine from Seán MacDermott Street in the drug-ridden north inner city.  She spoke at the briefing about the impact of departmental policies on grandparents.  Tragically, it seems it is often the mother in a family who is addicted to certain substances.  I do not know why.  This creates a problem for her children.  As soon as the grandparents move in to deal with the situation that is threatening their daughter and her children, the family is excluded from receiving payments.  The Department tells the grandparents that the crisis does not exist anymore - it has been averted because they intervened.  It is sheer stark madness that people who sacrifice themselves and put their well-being on the line at a time in their lives when they could have been expected to take their ease and put their feet up are penalised when they heroically intervene in the interests of their children, their grandchildren and society as a whole.  We should be supporting these people instead of penalising them.</p> <p>I appeal that this kind of thing be removed from the system.  Similarly, if in a situation where the children are being looked after, the grandparents allow the mother to visit, that also leads to penalties but most psychologists believe that, even with a damaged parent, a connection between the child and the parent is good, particularly when it is monitored by a grandparent.  Why penalise people for something that is constructive and good and it does not save money?  Imagine what would happen if the grandparents were callous enough to say they would not get involved.  The situation would be landed back on the institutions of the State and there would be a multiplier effect in terms of the impact on the finances.  I ask that these issues be looked at and the anomalies ironed out as far as possible.  I appreciate it is a big task.  There should be a central examination of proposals to see if they are budget neutral and to implement them in the interests of the people.  I was delighted Senator Moran raised the issue of a centralised means test.</p></speech>

I beg the Senator's pardon.  I thank her for correcting me.  It was just a glitch, the rhetorical equivalent of a typo.  As I know her well and respect her work, it was completely inadvertent.</p><p>It is important that we do this because so many times we are told a particular policy cannot be implemented because there is not a means test in the particular Department.  I have been saying for many years that should be done in co-operation with the Revenue and the Department of Social Protection as then we would have the picture and we would not have to keep doing it.  In this crisis, means testing may be unpleasant but it is necessary because we have to target the resources at the people who need them most.  </p><p>I turn to the issue of carers.  I have the a copy of the Carers Association budget proposal for 2013, which I am sure will be brought to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Burton.  To my great delight I saw that it went to the heart of what I wanted to say on neutral proposals for building a brighter future for Ireland's family carers.  I compliment the Government on the fact that it has launched, for the first time, a national carers strategy.  I say &quot;Well done&quot; to the Government.  This is the theory and the ideal we are aiming for, where for the first time we commit ourselves, as a people, to recognising the vital contribution carers make to society.  We have never done that before.</p><p>As I went around the country last year visiting every single county I fell in love, all over again, with this country and the wonderful people who are unacknowledged and unrecognised.  These people give of themselves so wholeheartedly and generously in circumstances where there is virtually no recognition, very little in the way of financial reward, and where conditions became increasingly harsh.  As people retire they are not replaced, therefore the burden becomes greater.</p><p>The strategy pledges itself to recognise that carers are the backbone of the Irish health service and are key partners and supports to the health service.  One can see that.  That is not just waffle.  Let us face the financial facts.  Family carers provide €4 billion worth of care each year, five times what they cost the Department of Social Protection which gets €878 million.  It is the same with the family support network.  Its budget is €375,000 which is literally piddling.  I hope that tiny amount of money which does so much good in the most deprived areas of the capital city will not be touched.  </p><p>There is the question of the half rate.  It is assumed that this may be a double payment but it is not.  I quote from this side of the House the late Seamus Brennan.  He was a Fianna Fáil Minister and a decent man, as everyone recognised.  Like the present Minister he had the welfare of the people at heart.  He said this was a direct support for caring duties.  </p><p>There is also the household benefits package and the free travel pass.  We were told yesterday of situations where, for example, disabled people were expected to go from a hospital in Galway to a hospital in Limerick without proper transport.  The HSE provides either a bus or taxi but often the timetable does not suit the appointment.  Therefore, they are of no use.  </p></speech>

Many participants have a great sense of pride in what they do for their communities and for Tidy Towns committees and make a positive contribution.  I applaud the increasing numbers of participants.  I realise for certain age groups three years is the maximum period of participation, after which they return to the dole.  In many instances they want to continue on the scheme.  It is good to see people with a sense of pride and dignity who want to continue.  It is a pity the maximum period is not longer.  </p><p>Carers have been mentioned by many speakers.  They are committed to helping and caring for people who cannot help themselves in their own homes.  I applaud those people.  </p><p>Two weeks ago I spoke to a businessman who offered a man a job.  I know the businessman but not the man who was offered the job.  The businessman figured that he was the man for the job he wanted done.  He offered him a salary of €38,000 and 5% of the increase in profits that he was sure the man would make.  I asked what the 5% would amount to and he said it could be anything from €10,000 to €12,000 if things got better or it could be an additional €15,000 per annum.  This was a married man with four children who was receiving social welfare.  I do not know what he was getting on social welfare but he did his figures and declined the offer of a job that was likely to earn him €45,000 to €50,000.  That is reality, not fiction.  I could not believe it.  The businessman would not tell me who the man was but he still continues to receive unemployment payments.  What percentage of people on social welfare who, when offered a job, respond and take up the job?  For those who do not take up job offers, what is the procedure?</p> <p> It is estimated that expenditure on illness benefit in 2012 will be €847 million, quite a substantial sum.  The introduction of a scheme of statutory sick pay, mentioned by previous speakers, whereby employers would directly meet the cost of illness-related absences for an initial period of illness is being considered - I hope consideration is as far as that will go - in the context of the need to reform the social welfare system to bring it into line with practices in other countries in this area.</p><p>I am aware that most other European countries, including all of our major competitors, oblige employers to pay for some sick pay costs.  The extent of this obligation varies considerably.  For example, the period is two years in the Netherlands, 28 weeks in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom, six weeks in Germany and nine days in Finland.  I could go on, but I will not.  A range of complex issues need to be addressed before any decision can be taken by the Government on the possible introduction of such a scheme.  I believe it is the wrong time to introduce this scheme, which will cost jobs as has been stated.  The Minister will be aware there are approximately 200,000 small and medium enterprises in this country, many of which are struggling to exist.  Unfortunately, many too have closed down.</p><p>On the issue of absenteeism, I acknowledge the part the Government has played in reducing the dreadful absenteeism in the HSE.  Absenteeism of approximately five days per worker in small businesses in Ireland, means these workers are close to the best performers across Europe.  There is definite scope for further management of sick day absences in the Civil Service and public service.  There is little reason to expect that requiring employers to pay sickness payments during the first four weeks of a claim will bring about a reduction in welfare dependency.  The proposed scheme would have a particularly severe impact on small businesses, as most small businesses do not have a sick pay scheme in operation.  It is the wrong time to consider this and perhaps we should wait to consider it when we get back to full production throughout the country.  Please do not do it.</p></speech>

What should happen is that they be put on that pension, but it is not happening.  Those people are being cut off the system completely in an unfair manner.</p><p>Applications for carer's allowance are being delayed.  In some cases, people being cared for are dying during the application process, which is shocking.  I have come across such cases.  Applications for disability allowance are also being delayed.  Yes, the Government can say it has not cut the disability allowance, but it should point out that tens of thousands of people have either been refused the allowance or their payments have been delayed.  These people are getting nothing and are being sacrificed on the altar of a political promise not to cut welfare.  However, it has been cut and the lives of those affected have been devastated.  These are an unorganised silent group, but I know they come to the clinics of all parties.  Social welfare queries and delays in the social welfare system are one of the big issues for everybody meeting constituents.</p><p>Appeals to the social welfare appeals office always took a long time, but improvements had begun to take place.  However, those improvements now seem to have disappeared.  One thing I can say about the social welfare appeals office is that it is independent and is not dependent on the whims of the Minister, Deputy Burton, or the Government.  It seems to be making decisions strictly in accordance with the legislation, which is what it should do, but the Department of Social Protection is not doing the same.   I have seen several examples of this in my constituency office.  It is disgraceful the way the welfare system is being run.  </p><p>The Department mantra is &quot;we did not cut welfare&quot;, but it did.  It cut the household benefits package, affecting the most vulnerable people in society.  The fuel allowance has also been cut.  People must be particularly vulnerable to get those allowances.  A couple was on to me just before I came to the House to speak and told me they have just €120 a week pension between the two of them.  I doubt they will get the fuel allowance as I believe the limit is €100.  Even if they did qualify for the fuel allowance, they would be affected, because the Minister has reduced the season for fuel allowance by a number of weeks.  That is a significant cut in the income of such people over the year.  People who save up to buy a tank of oil have been hit particularly hard, because they depend on saving that allowance up to have a lump sum to enable them buy oil.  Instead of making such cuts, the Department should be honest with the people and tell them that the country is struggling and we need to cut our cloth to meet our measure.  </p><p>Fianna Fáil did that when in office, although nobody liked doing it.</p></speech>

Deputy Burton is not able to give such a definition when questioned.  However, I can tell the House that for an elderly lady in Kells who is saving up for a tank of oil, the fuel allowance is very much a core payment.  The Minister would be better off being straight and honest with the people.  It would be better for her to say that the Department was cutting tens of thousands of people off from welfare entirely, that it was cutting their payments to zero, at the altar of political expediency.  That is the honest truth of what is happening.</p><p>At the election, the promise was &quot;Cross our hearts, hope to die, we will not cut child benefit &quot;, because every little hurts.  That was the priority then that was to be advertised in the papers.  Now we have leaks about what is to happen and these are frightening families all over Ireland.  This is not a question of welfare policy or money, but a question of political honesty and integrity.  The Government parties were prepared to make these promises to vulnerable people who were struggling, and then at the altar of political convenience say &quot;Sorry, we cannot do it&quot;.  The programme the Government is following is the exact same programme Fianna Fáil brought in with the IMF before the election.  The projections are exactly the same.  The Labour Party had the figures at the time, but it just went out and lied to the people.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister to the House.</p><p>I would like to address the issue of rent supplement.  I want to give a sharp warning to Government against imposing any further cuts to rent supplement payments in the forthcoming budget.  The cuts to the rent supplement imposed last year have left vulnerable people in grave situations.  I do not exaggerate here, but a cohort of people has been completely pushed out of the housing market and is now homeless as a direct consequence of the rent supplement cuts last year.  Others have been left at high risk of becoming homeless and unless they are protected in the forthcoming budget I foresee a significant increase in the problem of homelessness.</p> <p>We have a rental market in which there continues to be strong demand.  Last year in this House, the Minister for Social Protection expressed her concern about the impact of rent supplement on rents and argued that rent supplements were keeping rents artificially high.  However, the fact is that in urban areas in particular, rents are rising.  We have a situation where people who have been locked out of access to mortgages and are not in a position to house themselves privately are looking to the private rental sector for accommodation.  On top of that, because of the cuts to rent supplement, we have a growing number of people on rent supplement who are unable to find anything approaching good quality accommodation in the rental market.  In my own area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, the rent supplement limits are simply unrealistic compared to market rates.  The market rent in my area for bedsit accommodation is €674 but the rent supplement limit is €475.   As a result of this, people are dipping into scarce social welfare payments in order to make top ups to put a roof over their heads.  Realism must be brought to bear on this situation.  </p><p>Threshold, the national housing organisation, has observed the low affordability of rental properties in Cork and a recent survey conducted by that organisation found that less than 10% of landlords with rental accommodation were accepting tenants at the lower rent supplement limits.  There has been a culture of cuts and reducing rent supplement limits over the past number of years, not just by this Government, but the previous Administration also.  In fact, the last Government introduced severe cuts to the rent supplement budget and as a result, many people are now confined to sub-standard bedsit accommodation.</p></speech>

Rent supplement is a housing payment, not an income support and it should not be treated as such.  The sooner it is in the hands of the local authorities, the better and there is no better woman than Deputy Joan Burton to do that.</p><p>I urge the Minister to ensure there are no further cuts to the rent supplement budget next year because it is not realistic in the current housing market.  I ask her to review the reductions that were made last year, particularly regarding their impact on single people, one-parent families and parents with part-time access to their children, who are particularly disadvantaged by the housing market.  I also ask her to review the rental limits on a geographical basis because there are certain areas where the limits are having a very serious impact.  Finally, I ask once again that she transfer the payment of rent supplements to the local authorities as a matter of urgency.</p></speech>

I have called for a debate on youth unemployment in this House and was hoping to address that issue with her today.  The Minister mentioned earlier that there are between 70 and 80 programmes under the aegis of her Department but I will only be able to refer to a number of these in the limited time available to me.  In her speech the Minister referred to the Irish Presidency of the European Union and her plans to advance the EU youth guarantee.  In the last week, however, the financial transaction tax has been linked by the Austrian and French Governments to the proposed EU youth guarantee, which raises a lot of concerns, given that the Irish Government has said it will not sign up to the proposed financial transaction tax.  I am concerned about where the EU youth guarantee will go, especially in the context of our very high youth unemployment rate, if it is linked to the financial transaction tax.</p><p>The Minister also referred to community employment, CE, schemes in her speech.  Yesterday, I met members of the troika, with whom I raised the issue of youth unemployment.  They told me that they had encouraged the Government to look into measures to tackle unemployment and long-term unemployment in particular.  They said they encouraged the Government to provide services around upskilling and training, especially for those who were previously employed the construction sector.  In that context, the community employment schemes have massive potential.  The original purpose of the CE schemes was to counteract the drift into long-term unemployment.  They were targeted at those who are over 25 and were focused on the older, low-skilled job seeker.  Perhaps something could be done to include those under 25 in the schemes now, given that we have so many young unemployed people, many of whom have been on the live register for long periods of time.  What can be done to modernise the CE schemes to include young people and to make them relevant to them?  The CE schemes could provide them with the skills, training and experience they need while also enabling them to enhance their communities. </p><p>My party has raised the issue of poverty-proofing on numerous occasions.  More must be done to make sure that all our legislation is poverty-proofed and that measures taken by Government do not disproportionately affect those on low and middle incomes.  We must ensure that cuts and tax increases are not driving people further into poverty.  During the debate on the Local Government (Household Charge) Bill, we proposed an amendment based on the criteria used by the ESRI to measure poverty, so that we can know that measures being implemented through legislation are not pushing people further into poverty.  I await the Minister's response on that issue when she returns to the House.  </p><p>The Minister also made reference to the domiciliary care allowance in her speech and to the fact that it is currently under review.  I have questions regarding the criteria used to assess eligibility for this allowance, and specifically the requirement that the child needs &quot;care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age&quot;.  I am not sure if other Senators have had this experience, but I have had many people contact me who have applied for a domiciliary care allowance, whose child does need more care and supervision than other children of the same age, but they are hitting a brick wall and are being refused the allowance.  Is it the case that the eligibility criteria are being examined as part of the review?  The qualification criteria seem to be especially stringent and many families who are caring for children are very frustrated.  The social protection system is supposed to help the most vulnerable in our society.  If it is not helping them, what is the point of it?  In that context, I ask that the Minister provide more details on the review and I look forward to her response on her return.</p></speech>

Most Senators would agree that she is a reforming Minister and that she is trying very hard to streamline the dysfunctional system she inherited.  That system certainly contributed to Fianna Fáil retaining power for two terms.</p><p>We all want to see a situation where the social welfare budget of €20.5 billion is targeted at the most disadvantaged in our society.  We all know that there are very serious abuses within the social welfare system.  Many of them have been tackled already but many have yet to be tackled.  I hope that whatever savings are made in that regard will offset whatever reductions are necessary in the 2013 budget.</p><p>Senators have raised a number of important issues already but we must recognise the fantastic work that is being done within the community employment schemes.  </p> <p>The financial review of community employment schemes was a job well done.  It proved the schemes worked and that there were opportunities for savings within the system.  There are 23,500 places in the system, including 1,400 for supervisors.  The schemes are providing fantastic services to local communities.  They are supporting social inclusion and tackling educational disadvantage in communities.</p><p>There has been much debate on the issue of child benefit and whether we should retain the universal payment system or have targeted payments to the disadvantaged.  We need further debate and discussion on that.  Not everyone, particularly the very wealthy, should receive child benefit.  The taxation system may be the way to address the issue. </p><p>The Minister made passing reference to the free travel pass.  There is considerable abuse of this system throughout the country.  The issue needs to be addressed.  There should be a modest charge on the travel pass.  Holders of the pass might, possibly, have to register every year to confirm their entitlement.  There is anecdotal evidence that the system is being abused hand over fist, and we need to address this.</p><p>I met an employer last week who until a few weeks ago had been employing 18 people.  The banks pulled the plug on his business because they would not lend him €150,000, despite the fact that he had orders worth €1 million to take him up to Christmas.  He laid his staff off.  They signed on and will receive redundancy payment.  He and his fellow-director, however, have no income and are not entitled to any State benefit.  That is not right and it must be addressed.  I urge the Minister to look at this situation and to put in place a system whereby self-employed people can contribute and have something to fall back on if they go out of business. </p><p>I join with colleagues in appealing to the Minister not to carry out the proposal to place the burden of sick pay on small businesses that are already stretched.  Many of them will go to the wall if we impose that additional cost on them.  </p><p>I agree with Senator Hayden regarding rent supplement.  It should not be cut further.  I meet people in my clinics who are now living in substandard accommodation because the rent supplement has been cut.  The sooner local authorities take responsibility for the rent supplement and the whole area of local authority housing is examined, the better.</p><p>The issue of fuel poverty has been raised.  It is a particular problem for elderly people who are living on the old age pension.  If we can make savings elsewhere the issue of fuel poverty should be addressed.  Additional resources should be made available for the fuel scheme and it should be targeted at elderly people living alone.</p><p>I agree with Senator Byrne that the appeals procedure for disability and invalidity benefits takes too long.  The Minister must examine the applications and appeals systems.  It is not acceptable that people should have to wait six, nine or 12 months for a decision on their application for benefit.</p><p>I wish the Minister, Deputy Burton, well.  She has a difficult task and a huge budget.  We all support her in her efforts to put in place a system that targets the underprivileged and we want to see abuses of the system eliminated, as a matter of urgency. </p></speech>

Táim an-sásta go bhfuil mé ag fáil deis labhairt ar an ábhar fíor-thábhachtach seo.</p><p>  Tá go leor ábhar i gceist leis an rannóg áirithe seo agus go leor ábhar go bhféadfaimid a phlé, ach díreoidh mé ar chuid acu sin.</p><p>  Táthar ag glacadh leis go gcaithfear gearradh siar a dhéanamh ar an Roinn Coimirce Sóisíalaí.  An bun-difríocht a bhéadh idir Sinn Féin agus na páirtithe eile ná nach nglacaimid-ne leis gur chóir go mbéadh sin a tarlu.  Dár le Sinn Féin, tá sin ag tarlú mar gheall ar na fiacha baincéireachta atá orainn, mar go bhfuilimid ag íoc ar ais le lucht baincéireachta agus as na bannaí nár thugamar aon barrántas orthu, agus nach ndeachamar i ngleic leis an bhfadhb sin.  </p><p>  It is taken as a <i>fait accompli </i>that there will be cutbacks in the Department of Social Protection.  Sinn Féin does not, necessarily, concur with that view.  Our fundamental economic model is different from that of the Government and Fianna Fáil.  The austerity budgets should not have been brought in as they were.  Unguaranteed bondholders should not have been paid back, but that is a wider debate.  </p><p>  That debate does, however, relate to social welfare and is specific to some of our social welfare payments.  The one thing we know about social welfare recipients is that they spend most of the money they have in their local economy. Every penny is used and spent locally.  Cutbacks in social welfare have a substantial multiplier effect on local shops and businesses.  </p><p>  The Government's fundamental economic model, under the aegis of the troika, is the wrong one.  We should be stimulating growth by creating employment, taking more people off the live register and, therefore, reducing social welfare payments.  That can be done, as shown in the jobs proposal Sinn Féin has put forward which I hope Senators will read over the weekend.  We need to create jobs to take people out of the social welfare scenario.</p><p>  We also need to tax wealth.  Sinn Féin brought forward proposals to cap Civil Service salaries of over &#8364;100,000 and to introduce a wealth tax of 1% and a third income tax band of 48% which would generate revenue that would alleviate the proposed cutbacks.</p><p>  Kite flying by Ministers about changes to social welfare payments is also detrimental.</p><p>  I agree with what Senators Hayden and Mullins said about some areas of social protection.  The basic tenet of the argument, however, is that if one buys into the model of austerity and cutbacks one must cut back social protection measures.</p><p>  In last year's budget, lone parents were given a very raw deal by the Minister who introduced severe cutbacks.  I call on the Minister to reverse those cutbacks in the forthcoming budget.  Budget 2012 removed many of the protections that were, rightly, put in place to help lone parents with the costs associated with returning to work.  It reintroduced poverty traps and put in place obstacles to work, despite the rhetoric from the Government that the opposite was its objective.  We were making it easier for lone parents to stay at home rather than continue in employment.  Many of the groups who lobbied public representatives testified to this.  I must praise Single Parents Actively Raising Kids, SPARK, who did very good lobbying on this issue.  I am sure they will be lobbying again in the run-up to this year's budget.  </p><p>  Last year we saw cuts, including a drop in rent allowance, children's allowance for families with more than three children and reductions in back-to-school and fuel allowances.  The one-parent family allowance was also removed from people on community employment schemes.  I call on the Minister to look into the purse and reverse those cuts, in particular.   </p><p>  Senator Hayden raised the issue of homelessness.  I concur with most of what she said.  She is perfectly right.  The cuts to rent supplement caused huge strife throughout the country.  They did not reflect what was happening in the market.  The fundamental model used to calculate the rent supplement was wrong.  It was based on an average rent in an area and did not reflect what people were actually paying.  In Galway city, for example, there were caps on rent supplement of &#8364;700 for a family, while most people were paying &#8364;800 or &#8364;850.  People were forced to move out of their homes and communities and the cut caused considerable upheaval.  I ask the Minister to revisit this matter.</p><p>  The fundamental issue is that we are too reliant on private rented accommodation and we are paying too much for it. </p> <p>The State should be providing more accommodation and I agree that it should be under local authority aegis.  We have been talking about this for the past year and I do not see any proposals coming forward from the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, on the issue in the interim.  I would hope to see them as a matter of urgency.  Large numbers of people are on the housing lists.  This issue is probably one of the most common to be raised at all our local offices as people try to get their names on the council housing or transfer lists.  It is obvious there is a dearth of housing stock and this matter needs to be addressed.  </p><p>The issue of poverty which was raised by Senator Reilly is very important.  We should examine every Bill that comes through these Houses to ensure it is poverty-proofed.  I suggest the EU model which we debated here at some length during the year.  The stories we have heard this week about people having their &quot;cornflakes day&quot; once a week because they cannot afford a full meal, are scandalous.  I agree that the cuts in fuel and other allowances should be reversed.</p><p>Tá neart eile gur mhaith linn a rá faoin ábhar seo, ach tá mé cinnte go mbeidh lá eile ag an bPaorach.</p></speech>

Even though the Department has been renamed the Department of Social Protection the traditionalists among us still regard it as the Department of Social Welfare.</p><p>The Minister has a very difficult job in advance of the budget.  I acknowledge her efforts to date in examining a range of options in an attempt to produce realistic and viable savings in the various departmental schemes.  Her annual budget is more than €20 billion which is a very large sum of money, more than €20,000 million.  It is a question of how to put that money to best use to provide the social security net needed by the elderly, children, unemployed and disabled people while at the same time attempting to use as much of that money as possible to get people back to work.  The Department has a variety of schemes of assistance for the elderly, the unemployed and those on invalidity pensions.  The debate on the social welfare budget usually happens over one or two days but this House needs to debate with the Minister more frequently on how social welfare resources are allocated.</p><p>In advance of the current Government's first budget one year ago, there was a view that the budget would be exceptionally tough with a broad spectrum of cuts across all Departments.  That did not happen and perhaps we are playing catch-up now in order to deal with some of the issues we did not seem to deal with last year.  My suggestion at the time - which may have been simplistic but it had certain financial merits - was that rather than removing some schemes and taking 20% from some payments and 5% from other payments, it might be better to have a modest 2% to 4% cut across all the payments.  It would have been very straightforward from an administrative point of view.  It might not have been entirely fair but then nothing in politics or in life is ever fair.  However, such a measure would have produced the savings of €500 million to €700 million required and in a balanced fashion.  Instead, we attempted to target a smaller number of payments and a smaller number of sectors.  I would like to discuss this with the Minister when she returns to the House.</p><p>I brought a group to the Dáil Visitors Gallery a few days ago.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, was responding to questions on disability and disability payments.  She stated that approximately 250,000 people are in receipt of either a disability, invalidity or injury benefit.  These people are deemed by the Department to be in some way injured, disabled or otherwise unfit for work.  I really wonder how accurate is that figure.  If 250,000 people are unfit for work through injury or sickness, our streets should be full of people in wheelchairs and on crutches.  This needs profound investigation.  It may be that some people who are perhaps unable to work are in the wrong scheme.  Others may become trapped in what becomes a vicious cycle of being injured at work or falling ill, signing on for injury benefit, suddenly getting disability benefit and ending up on an invalidity pension.  We must ask whether we truly believe that 250,000 people in this country are unfit for work, disabled, injured or sick, in some fashion.  I think the answer will be &quot;No&quot;.  We must then decide what to do about this situation.  We must try to engage with many of these people to see if they can be taken out of the so-called disability cycle and back to productivity.  </p><p>We had very useful and fruitful discussions in this House with the late former Minister, sadly deceased, Séamus Brennan, a man whom I hold in the highest esteem.  He was asked on one occasion how much of the social welfare budget was being claimed - I will not use the word &quot;fraudulently&quot; - because none of us lives in a glasshouse or on the high moral ground.  He was asked how much of the budget was being inappropriately claimed.  He put forward a figure which he said was only a guesstimate of up to 15% of the budget.  If only 10% of the social protection budget is being wrongly or not fully properly claimed - I am being careful with my language - that amounts to €2 billion and it is a lot of money.  We have a significant job of work in trying to re-engage with the hundreds of thousands of people who are claiming unemployment benefit, sick benefit, injury benefit or invalidity pension.  There is a need to encourage as many as possible out of the social protection scheme.  If only 10% of the money is being wrongly paid out, that amounts to €2 billion and it is money the country cannot afford.  I would love to see that money being saved and a substantial portion of it being used to further assist the hundreds of thousands of genuine claimants for child benefit, the old age pension, or whatever.  </p><p>Talking about a crackdown, fraud and chasing people can be very negative but if we can assure the public that a significant portion of the money saved will be re-invested into the hands and pockets of genuine claimants who really need it, this would help our mission to save money.  This is an issue that could be discussed all day but we need to talk about it much more frequently and in a much more open fashion.  I do not believe that one quarter of a million people in this country are physically unfit for work.  I do not believe that these people are frauds or criminals but rather they are people who have been corralled into a lifestyle by society, by lack of opportunity and by lack of education in some cases.  We need to help those people as much as penalise them.  Likewise, many of those in receipt of unemployment payments and jobseeker's benefit, need further help.  I suggest that schemes such as the family income supplement could be used to give people a little bonus to encourage them to go back to work rather than staying on social welfare.  New thinking is required.  </p><p>I was amused when people thought that the Minister, Deputy Burton, had been given a second division job.  In my view she has possibly the most important job in the Government.  She is looking after hundreds of thousands of people and a budget of more than €20 billion.  She needs our support and I look forward to working with her to ensure that the budget is used to the best extent possible.</p></speech>

I raise this matter in the context of comments made by the Minister for Education and Skills to the effect that two and three-teacher schools should consider their future.  According to the Minister, rural schools such as scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara which is located next to Ardea post office in County Kerry and to which this matter relates do not have a future.  The Minister is orchestrating a very slow and deliberate closure process for small schools throughout the country.  This process involves cutting off the school transport system on an incremental basis.  Over 60% of the students who attend scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara will no longer have access to school transport because they live nearer to a particular school in Kenmare, which is in a different parish.  As the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, is aware, a school is the heart of a parish.  Once a local school is closed down, a parish will slowly but surely wither away.  Regardless of whether this is a deliberate policy, it will certainly result in the outcome to which I refer and will have a detrimental effect on rural areas if the Minister is allowed to persist with it.</p><p>Four bus runs are provided for in order that students from Killane and Dromuchty can travel to scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara each day.  The parents of these students have been informed that in the future they must attend the school in Kenmare to which I refer.  School transport is being provided on a concessionary basis in some cases.  I have two nephews who attend the school, one of whom is guaranteed transport, while the other - Dylan - is not and may be obliged to attend a different school in the future.  What I have described is happening to children throughout the country.  Scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara is just one example of the consequences of the Minister's policy in this regard.</p><p>When the school in Douras and Lansdowne national school were closed, an amalgamation took place and scoil naisiúnta Realt na Mara was established as the central school.  At the time there was an undertaking given to the effect that transport would be provided.  The Department is now resiling from that undertaking.  The school's future is, to put it mildly, in doubt.  If school transport policy remains as it stands and parish boundaries continue to be broken, the school in Kenmare, namely, St. John's, which is an excellent school and has only just been opened will not have the capacity to deal with the additional pupils it will be obliged to accommodate.</p><p>I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's reply.  I am sure he has encountered similar cases in his constituency.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-18a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1081" speakername="John Perry" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012101800024#X00600"><p>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  To begin, I wish to give the House an outline of the extent of the school transport service.  School transport is a very significant operation.  It is managed by Bus Éireann on behalf of the Department of Education and Skills.  School buses make journeys totalling 82 million km annually.  In the region of 114,000 children, including more than 8,000 with special needs, are transported in approximately 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis to primary and post-primary schools.</p><p>A number of changes to the school transport scheme arising from recommendations made in the value for money report on the scheme were introduced by the previous Government in budget 2011.  The changes at primary level related to the introduction of charges and changes to the closed school rule and the minimum numbers required to establish or maintain a service.  The changes which are relevant to the school in question relate principally to the closed school rule.  The Senator will be aware that, in the context of school transport eligibility, this rule was introduced in the 1960s and relates to circumstances where a primary school is either closed or amalgamated with another school.  Under the rule, as it previously applied, where a primary school closed and amalgamated with another, pupils who resided in the closed school area were eligible for transport to the school of amalgamation, even though their place of residence might be less than 3.2 km from that school.  Where a greater number of schools amalgamated, the central school rule applied.  In such instances, transport was provided for children who resided not less than 1 mile or 1.6 km from the new central school.  No time limit had been applied in respect of either rule.  Consequently, the closed school rule had been in effect for over 40 years.  Even in circumstances where there was actually a newer school closer to the child's home, transport eligibility was to the amalgamated school only.  In such circumstances, the child was not eligible for transport to the newer school.</p><p>The practical consequences of the changes to the closed school rule are: distance is now the key eligibility criterion which applies; from the 2012-13 school year, pupils residing in a closed school area, for whom the amalgamated school is not their nearest school but who enrol in their nearest school, will be eligible for school transport, provided the 3.2 km requirement is met; and in the case of all future primary school amalgamations, eligibility will be based on the distance criteria which apply when the amalgamation takes place and attendance at the nearest school.</p><p>In the context of the Department of Education and Skill's planning of primary school infrastructure, school accommodation needs in each area are assessed on the basis of local demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  The changes announced to primary school transport services are in line with this approach and will result in a more efficient and cost-effective scheme.  While there will be a transitional period in which children in the same family or area may be eligible for transport to different schools, ultimately eligibility for school transport will be easier to determine and the scheme will be simpler and more transparent for families and schools.</p><p>It is important to note that eligible children who are already attending an amalgamated school will retain their transport eligibility in order to allow them. providing there is no change in their circumstances, to complete their education at that school.  In cases in which families are not eligible for school transport, they may apply for transport on a concessionary basis, subject to a number of conditions detailed in the scheme.  I am pleased to advise that the cost of concessionary tickets was reduced to €100 per annum by the Government from the commencement of the 2012-13 school year.  This is the same charge as that which applies in respect of eligible tickets.</p><p>Given that the terms of the scheme are being applied equitably on a national basis, there is no scope for reversing the changes to which I refer.  Under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of €17 million in the school transport budget and all of the measures I have outlined, including the changes to the closed school rule, are an integral part of this.  It makes economic sense that, when fully implemented, the provision of school transport to the nearest school will reduce the overall cost of school transport services.</p></speech>

Perhaps he might convey to those who wrote the reply he read - a Labour Party Senator referred to this on the Order of Business this morning - that I asked a specific question about a particular school.  I did not receive a reply to that question; the reply only contains a one-line allusion to the school to which I refer.  In the remainder of the reply phrases such as "In cases where families are not eligible for school transport, they may apply for transport on a concessionary basis" and "children in the same family or area may be eligible for transport to different schools" are used.</p></speech>

As a result of the Minister for Education and Skill's policy, families are going to be split up and siblings will be obliged to attend different schools.  What we are talking about is parishes being allowed to wither away as a result of schools being closed.  The reply from the Department falls very short in answering the question I asked.  Perhaps the Minister of State might convey my feelings on the matter to the Minister.  I am sure I could have obtained most of the information contained in the reply which the Minister of State was asked to read on the Minister's behalf on the Department's website.  A reply to an Adjournment matter should relate to the specific question raised about a particular matter.</p></speech>

I raise the Department’s current position on the allocation of teachers to Ratoath junior national school.  An unprecedented number of parents have been in touch with my colleague in Ratoath, Councillor Nick Killian, and a number of parents have been in touch with me.  They are most concerned at a decision of the Department, which I believe is under review today, to remove a teacher from the school.  What happened in Ratoath junior national school is that 470 names were on the school roll on the first day of term in September.  Ten of those names were reported to the National Education Welfare Board for various reasons which resulted in the school numbers being 460, seven short of the teacher allocation required to maintain existing staff numbers.  If the decision is upheld by the Department to remove a teacher based on the lower numbers, one teacher must go and one of five junior infants’ classes in the school must be reallocated to the other four classes.  That is not fair.  It is not right.</p><p>It is particularly unfair at this stage of the school year when children have settled into their classes if they have to be allocated to another class.  That would also result in one class having at least 37 pupils and an empty classroom within the school.  It might also have implications for next year in terms of whether the school would be in a position to take five classes.  The school is already over the threshold for four classes in the coming year.  It might not yet have reached five but it expects to do so.  The school might not be able to take all of the pupils that wish to go to it next year.  Therefore, if the decision is not reversed there might be pupils in Ratoath who are not accepted into the junior infants’ class in the school next year.  The school has already lost four teachers in the areas of resource teaching and language support and is in danger of losing a fifth mainstream teacher.</p><p>One of the criteria used in assessing such decisions is whether the post relates to a mainstream teacher.  I urge the Minister to take that into account and to take the particular circumstances of Ratoath into account.  It is a growing area.  The pupils are already six weeks’ into their school year.  I urge him to please leave the teacher in place to give the children the best possible education.</p></speech>

The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on the Department's website.  The staffing schedule is the mechanism used for the allocation of classroom teachers to all primary schools.  It operates in a clear and transparent manner and treats all similar types of schools equally, irrespective of location.  The configuration of classes and the deployment of classroom teachers are done at local school level.</p><p>Classroom teachers are allocated under the staffing schedule based on the pupil enrolments for the previous 30 September.  While mainstream staffing for any school year is based on the previous September's enrolment, there is a provision whereby schools experiencing rapid increases in enrolment can apply for additional mainstream posts on developing grounds, using projected enrolment.  The retention of such posts in the current school year is subject to schools having achieved their projected enrolment on 30 September.  If the enrolment is not achieved the post allocated on developing grounds is suppressed.</p><p>The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeal board.  Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing circular 0007/2012 which is available on the Department's website.  The appeal criteria include provision for schools that have been granted a post under the developing school criterion.  Such schools may lodge an appeal on the basis that the pupils that failed to enrol as projected by 30 September 2012 are likely to be enrolled by December 2012.  A post allocated by the appeal board under this criterion will be sanctioned on a provisional basis, subject to confirmation of the required enrolment being achieved before 31 December 2012.</p><p>The school referred to by the Deputy had an enrolment of 442 pupils on 30 September 2011.  As a consequence, the school's staffing for the 2012-13 school year is a principal and 16 classroom teachers.  The school has an additional five support posts for learning and language support and resource teaching.</p><p>The school applied for a developing school post based on a projected enrolment of 478 pupils at September 2012 and this post was conditionally approved by the Department on 6 March 2012.  However, I understand that the required projected enrolment was not achieved by 30 September.  The school was therefore informed that the post was being suppressed in the normal manner.  The school has appealed the decision to the primary staffing appeal board.  The appeal board is holding its meeting today, 18 October, and it will consider the appeal from the school in question in this process.  The board of management of the school will be notified of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible.  The appeal board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  I thank the Deputy again for giving me an opportunity to update the House on the matter.</p></speech>

I hope the Department has the correct figures.  I will check the position immediately with the school.</p><p>My child started school this year in the junior infants’ class in another school in County Meath.  I can only imagine the disruption that would be caused to her by having to move classes and perhaps having to go into a class with 37 pupils because of what might be an arbitrary decision by the Department.  I urge the Department and the appeal board to take into account the factors I have raised on the school and the special circumstances that apply.  The school has lost four teachers and is in a developing area.  What is proposed is not fair on the small children involved.</p></speech>

I apologise for the mix-up that occurred previously.  The Minister is familiar with the plans and proposals on the rejuvenation and re-establishment of the Irish sugar industry and its potential for jobs.</p> <p>Most independent people believe there is the possibility of creating 4,500 jobs over time in this industry time.  We import 80% of our sugar from British Sugar.  The Minister is entering into a phase of serious negotiations on the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, reform.  As the compensation scheme is due to end from 2015 I ask the Minister to give me an update on whether the Government is seeking 1% of the quota for Ireland.  I read with concern today in the farming supplement in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>about a decision made by the European Union Commission to reduce the maximum target for crop-based biofuels and bio-liquids to 5%.  Will that have any effect?  </p><p> I heard the Minister say on RTE radio recently that he is broadly supportive of this move.  It is a major opportunity for us.  Thousands of people here are interested in it.  It would provide an additional line to our farmers and those involved in tillage also, particularly in the event of inclement weather which we have experienced recently.  We have grown sugar beet here.  It can be done, and it would have the effect of reducing costs for many companies here that use sugar as a main part of their ingredients, both in the drinks industries and others, which import from other countries.  I am interested to hear the Minister's views.  Will this be part of the Government's negotiations on the CAP?  I thank the Minister for attending.</p></speech>

There are many interests that for some time have been discussing whether it is possible for Ireland to start processing sugar again from sugar beet.  As somebody who has driven many tractors and trailers with sugar beet into what was previously the Mallow factory, when I worked on a farm in Mallow, and on our farm at home for a while I have a good appreciation of how important the sugar industry is for the tillage sector as a break crop, a cash crop, a crop that does not rely on any payments and a crop that produces cash at a time of year when farmers want it, which is in the autumn in the build up to Christmas.</p><p>I have been as supportive as I can be of both feasibility studies that have been put together in the past six months from two different groups, both with a view to exploring the possibility of growing sugar beet for sugar processing in Ireland and putting a business case together for the redevelopment of a sugar processing sector.  Both of those feasibility studies were impressive, and I spent quite some time talking through them and so on with both teams.</p><p>It is important for me to emphasise that if we are to have a sugar industry re-emerge here we must ensure that it is an industry built on solid foundations in terms of the financing of it and the business plan for it.  It is something I would really like to see happen but the business case is the most important issue.  My job as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is to ensure that if a business case can be made for spending the guts of €200 million or €300 million on putting a new processing facility in place Ireland has a quota to be able to produce sugar, if there is still a quota regime, or that we can move away from the limitations of a sugar quota regime within the European Union as soon as possible.</p><p>In 2005, when there was a fundamental change in EU sugar policy, Ireland got out of the sugar processing business and significant compensation was paid to encourage us to do that.  I not want to go into the history of that but I had a big problem with it at the time.</p></speech>

That would leave Ireland, or anybody else who wants to process sugar, free to do so and take their chances on the open market.  That will not happen, however, because there are very powerful countries in the EU which want to see a continuance of sugar quotas beyond 2015.  As a realist I believe that is likely to happen, perhaps until 2017 or 2018, and therefore I have made the case, both on and off the record, to the Commissioner in Council meetings and outside them that if we are to move a sugar quota regime beyond 2015 countries like Ireland, which is trying to put a case together for processing sugar again, should be facilitated in doing that if there is to be an increase in EU sugar quotas, which I believe there must be because there was a big sugar shortage last year.</p><p>In terms of the calculation for the people who are trying to put this case together and who have gone a long way in terms of getting investors, picking a suitable site and talking to farmers about their capacity for producing sugar, a great deal of work has gone on in this area and much credit is due to a number of people, in particular Michael Hoey from Country Crest and others who have shown leadership in this area.  They need to know that Government is supportive of them in terms of trying to access quota for them but, ultimately, they will have to make the numbers add up in terms of making this work.  That is possible.  The rule of thumb is that if the price of processed sugar globally remains over €500 a tonne, the feasibility studies suggest that this is a viable proposition even given the capital expenditure that is required to build that processing facility.  </p><p>The judgment call that must be made, however, is the impact on world sugar prices when quotas are lifted in the EU, potentially after 2015, 2017 or 2018, and whether there will there be a significant increase in production of sugar across the European Union which may reduce the actual price of processed sugar internationally because it is very difficult to compete in Europe with sugar that has been processed from sugar cane in Brazil, for example, just as it is difficult to compete with sugar cane on a series of other levels from an ethanol perspective as well.</p><p>My view is that my job is to be supportive of the people who are working hard to make a business case for a sugar processing and ethanol and biofuel operation around that and to support them in that but also to ensure that if and when that happens, it is built on solid foundations that will last for decades rather than being an industry that starts with a lot of positivity but cannot keep going because it is unable to compete with other parts of the world.  There is a series of issues at play here but the fact that we are even talking about this and that people have put a significant amount of time and money into putting together very credible feasibility studies is a significant step in the right direction.</p></speech>
