Last week I raised the issue of the ICS Building Society and Bank of Ireland raising their variable rate by 0.5% to an average of 4.490%.  Yesterday, AIB raised its variable rate by 0.5% to just over 4%.  These are significant increases for mortgage holders.  I have referred to the worsening mortgage crisis on numerous occasions, about which all of us are concerned.  We know the Government does not have a magic wand but we can do much better.  People are under ferocious pressure.  I will not propose an amendment to the Order of Business, as I did last week.  The position is getting out of hand.   People with variable mortgages are being crucified by the banks to pay for the losses on tracker mortgages.  There are other solutions that can be used.  In view of the urgency of the matter I ask the Leader to arrange for a debate next week on mortgages with the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, or the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.</p><p>I draw to the attention of the House some new information.  As a representative for Dublin North I am concerned at the ongoing situation in regard to primary health care centres, specifically in Balbriggan, and the manner in which the site was selected.  Balbriggan needs a primary care centre, about which there is no question.  It has the second highest rate of unemployment in Dublin.  It has a large percentage of new Irish people in the community and has integration problems.  However, that is not the issue.</p><p>I am tired of listening to the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, using the people of Balbriggan as a human shield.  He said the people of Balbriggan were insulted.  I was in Balbriggan last night.  The people there are worried that they will lose the primary care centre because of the manner in which the Minister has gone about his work on their behalf.  The Minister should publish the criteria he used in selecting Balbriggan for a primary care centre.  I stand over the selection of Balbriggan for such a centre.  However, it has come to my attention that as far back as 2002 in the Balbriggan south east Castlelands local area plan, the county council had handed over land in Balbriggan for a primary care centre for free to the Health Service Executive for the development of a health care centre in Castlelands in Balbriggan which is much better served by way of roadway and parking facilities than the site now selected.  It was further reconfirmed in 2006 that the site, adjacent to Pinewood Estate and Castlelands in Balbriggan, was given for free by the local authority to the HSE.  This was reaffirmed in two local area plans and a county development plan.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-04a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1139" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012100400003#B00200"><p>I do have a question for him.  First, I want to bring this matter to the attention of colleagues.  Second, I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Health if he is aware that the land that was identified is still available, at no cost to the taxpayer, the Exchequer or the people of Balbriggan.  It is on a county development plan and two local area plans.  Extensive discussions have taken place between the local authority and the HSE over many years.  They go all the way back to 1970 with the publication of the County Dublin Areas of Need, CODAN, report, in which areas such as Tallaght, Ballymun, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin and Balbriggan were included.  Balbriggan was the only town in north County Dublin that was identified then.  Why is the State entering into a lease on the Dublin Street site when there is a free site still available at Castlelands, Balbriggan?  The Minister did not explain why he did not proceed with a centre that location.</p><p>This is important.  I restate that Balbriggan needs a primary care centre.  I know that because I live there.  I am concerned that no one can see the wood for the trees with regard to why the site was selected.  I ask the Minister to stop using the people of Balbriggan as an excuse and as a shield.  They are insulted.  Last night, when I was in Balbriggan, I heard its inhabitants' concerns that they will not get the primary care centre they deserve because of the way he has dealt with this matter.  I ask the Leader to ask the Minister whether he is aware that the site identified by the HSE and Fingal County Council, which is in the development plan and has been in two local area plans since 2002, is available at no cost.  It was selected for the specific purpose of developing a primary care centre in Balbriggan, which is badly needed.</p></speech>

I thank Senator Susan O'Keeffe, the outgoing Labour Party Whip, and commend her for all the work she has done.  I wish Senator Hayden well in her new role.  I know that other Members of the House have spoken on this issue and thank Senator Wilson, in particular, for his kind words yesterday, which we appreciate.  I will formally notify the Clerk of the Seanad of the change.</p><p>I thank the Leader for confirming that today's Committee Stage debate on the Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill will be adjourned if not concluded.  I note that quite a number of amendments have been tabled, including some substantive Government amendments that will be introduced in the Seanad.  The move was signalled in the good Second Stage debate last week by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  He signalled then that the Government would table a series of amendments in the Seanad, which we welcome.  Senator Barrett and I were particularly glad to see a change to ensure that the HEA would become a reviewable agency.  Some important amendments have been tabled and I am glad that we will now have plenty of time to discuss them.  </p><p>I note that it is five years ago this week that we debated the Climate Protection Bill 2007, which I introduced as a Private Members' Bill.  I know that an ongoing substantial consultation process is being conducted by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, with a view to finally introducing a climate change Bill.  It would be good to hold a debate here on the process of consultation and the process leading to the climate change Bill in order to achieve the best framework for climate protection in the forthcoming Bill.</p><p>I will say a final word on the Government's legislative programme.  I am delighted that the civil registration Bill to legalise humanist weddings has been given a priority A listing in the Government's legislative programme.  I hope it will be introduced here within a month.</p></speech>

Without going into details, students will be assessed continuously and not by one exam.  The measure will be good for the quality of teaching and learning in schools.  Education is not about assessment and exams but the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom.  Continuous assessment with standardised tests at the end of each year is a welcome development.  It will still be a rigorous system.  We need the quality of education to be maintained and the new measure will ensure that.  This morning on "Morning Ireland", Dr. Emer Smyth from the Economic and Social Research Institute said that the proposed overhaul would lead to improved educational standards among students.  I ask the Leader to request that the Minister for Education and Skills return to the House.  He has attended a number of times but I would like him to return to speak about junior cycle reform and on what progress, if any, has been made following the report on patronage and pluralism in schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-04a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012100400003#B00500"><p>I ask the Leader to give us a timescale for the introduction of privacy legislation.  This is an issue that has been covered widely internationally.  I gather that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, gave a commitment to seriously examine the legislation and to introduce such a Bill.  It is about time.  Today, item No. 5 on the Order Paper is a Government Bill on privacy and item No. 16 is my privacy Bill.  Privacy is important.  It is extraordinary that we were propelled into legislating by the invasion of privacy of members of the British royal family.  I thought we already had sufficient reason, which has been increased in recent days by the arrest of a gentleman who was the Irish editor of one of the tabloids that was impugned at the Leveson inquiry.  He now resides in Dublin but the individual made his money from such trade.  I found it ironic that the person who said he was going to close the newspaper made his initial fortune from the publication of erotic material.  In evidence to the Leveson inquiry, when the word "ethical" was used, he said he did not know what it meant.  The matter raises questions.  If somebody in a position of considerable power within the media is completely unaware of the meaning of ethics, then we need to examine the question of privacy.  When we do that we should also review the role of the Press Ombudsman because these institutions need to be strengthened, on which I have some views.  In light of the evidence that suggests there is a strong crossover between bad practices in the British and Irish press, we need some form of inquiry similar to the Leveson inquiry here.  I hope such an inquiry will be established.  We also need to examine the Defamation Bill, which I opposed, as did other Senators on this side of the House.  The Bill rebalanced the equation in libel to the disadvantage of the private citizen and in the interest of the press barons.</p><p>I do not intend to get involved in the extraordinarily difficult and complicated matter regarding the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly.  As I have found it difficult to comprehend his explanation - the arithmetical and logarithmic stuff and so on - I am not in a position to judge the matter.  I was interested in one comment that was made and repeated.  It has been said that one of the other people involved was a self-confessed Fine Gael supporter.  I was unaware that such support was a sin and I sincerely hope that it is not a mortaller.  </p><p>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on safety in light of the tragic accident that occurred on a waste disposal lorry that resulted in a man's losing his life.</p><p>I shall mention something close to the Leader's heart: the extraordinary situation whereby 132 boxes of monkfish will be dumped on a quayside in Wexford because they were not caught properly.  Such an appalling waste of food and resources needs to be examined because it is immoral.  The fishermen did not deliberately set out to break legislation.  We need accountability and decency and not just a rigid application of rules.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank the Leader, Senator Cummins, the Deputy Leader, Senator Bacik, the Whip, Senator Coghlan, and the staff of the Seanad Office for all their help, patience and courtesy.  I am delighted we have a rotating Whip in the Labour Party group and wish Senator Hayden, the incoming Whip for the group, well.</p><p>The Minister for Education and Skills will be in the House next week and obviously there are many issues we would like to discuss with this busy Minister.  I welcome the announcement of the reform of the junior certificate today and I suspect much of the Minister's time in the House will be taken up with that issue.  However, I would like the Leader to ensure we have some time then or in the near future to discuss the events related to our third level institutions, with UCD and Trinity College Dublin falling down in the list of top universities.  The criteria for selection to that list, includes teaching and research.  The criterion of 30% citations, or the influence of research, is obviously very high.  I wonder whether we are chasing something we cannot achieve.  The size of universities in this country must make it difficult to reach that scale in comparison with other universities, particularly in the United States. </p><p>I have a particular concern for smaller universities and the prospects of technological universities.  I have a concern regarding the Connacht Ulster alliance, including Sligo Institute of Technology, which were hoping to come together under the Hunt report.  Now there is concern about this, particularly in light of the HEA's report last week.  There are many issues at stake here with regard to the direction we take with third level institutions and how we compete in the world.  I ask the Leader to ensure that if there is not sufficient time, since the Minister is busy and is engaging in significant reform and change, he will ensure this debate is held in the not too distant future if the junior certificate issue takes up the time next week.</p></speech>

Is mór an náire í an gheamaireacht atá ar bun faoi láthair agus tá sí ag baint aird ar fad de na príomh cheisteanna sláinte atá sa tír go gcaithfear a dhíriú orthu.  The pantomime in which Deputy James Reilly is the main protagonist would be funny if it was not so serious.  It is taking the focus away from the serious health issues we have here, including: some 130,000 patients waiting a year or more to be seen; 60,000 patients waiting four years or more to be seen; the highest prices in northern Europe for unpatented medicines; generic drugs 12 times more expensive than in Britain; salary caps ignored by the Minister's special adviser and external consultants; primary care centres not built; the first Minister ever to be listed in <i>Stubbs Gazette</i>; and some &#8364;750 million removed from the health budget in 2012, resulting in cuts in all areas, and a further &#8364;130 million removed in August.  It is scandalous this is happening on the watch of Government Senators and we need to do something about this quickly.</p><p>  My colleague, Senator Darragh O'Brien, brought some new information on Balbriggan to our attention, which is interesting and useful in the wider picture.  However, it raises the question - if the land was available since 2002 - of where the primary care centre for Balbriggan should have been built under the watch of Fianna Fáil.  I am sure the Senator will answer that question.</p><p>  It is important that we have a debate on the issue of confidence in the Minister for Health.  I am aware there was such a debate in the other House, but things have changed substantially since then.  I call on the Leader to allow us have a debate of confidence - no confidence from our side or confidence from the Government side - in the Minister.  I would like to know more about his Einstein-like capabilities for algorithms, particularly with regard to how he figured out how to put two primary care centres in his constituency.</p><p>  In the wake of statements on Twitter or on social networks from two Labour Party MEPs, I would also like to know where the Labour Party stands on this issue.  Are there two Labour parties?  Are those MEPs in a different party?  Are they in some kind of independent European Labour Party?  Why is the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, so quiet on this issue?  Will he issue a statement?  When will he stand up for the people of this country in the way he promised before the election and address the issues I highlighted earlier?   They are the real issues.  The Minister does not appear capable of doing his job.  This issue is a distraction from Government and while that is happening, people are suffering.  It is about time it stopped.  A motion of confidence or no confidence and a debate on that issue is important and should be held next week if the Minister is still in place at that time.</p></speech>

We should have that debate next week.  There is significant talk on the issue and such a motion is the right thing to do.  I have a lot of confidence in the Minister and believe that if he is given the opportunity, he will turn the health sector around.  However, there seems to be an unending plethora of stories, some of which have little grounds whatsoever.</p><p>We should also debate the issue of AIB and the increase of 0.5% in the variable rate on the mortgage book.  What is happening is scandalous.  AIB is trying to make its profit on the back of people, most of whom did not participate in the Celtic tiger boom.  To put this in context, a mortgage of €300,000 will cost an extra €90 per month or over €1,000 per year.  The moneys that AIB will take in over the year will amount to approximately €75 million extra as a result of that 0.5% increase.  That amounts to half the household charge.  Many Senators, mostly on this side of the House, have gone nuts over that charge, but very few are saying anything about this increase.  This is AIB robbing its customers of substantial moneys.  We should ask the Minister for Finance to come here to explain this, and I speak as Fine Gael spokesperson on finance in this regard.  This increase is scandalous.</p><p>We have long known that the two public interest directors of AIB appointed by the Minister and previous Ministers have been asleep at the wheel.  Another AIB director has been appointed, a former CEO of KBC Bank, who I am told is a mortgage expert.  It is no coincidence that a few weeks after we have a mortgage expert going on the board of AIB, these rates are increased.  This is disgraceful and I call on the Minister for Finance to come to the House to discuss the issue.</p></speech>

The sideshow has gone on for far too long.  We have overruns of some €300 million and there are concerns all over the country.  We are unanimous that we want these primary care centres built as quickly as possible, in whatever order the criteria dictate and resources permit.  However, the gobbledegook and misinformation of the past week or ten days must come to an end.  We see this from the courageous MEPs, Nessa Childers and Phil Prendergast, who have said "Enough is enough" from a Labour Party perspective.  I support that position.  Sometimes people with leadership step out from the crowd and take a stand when necessary.  This is what is necessary now.</p><p>I hope Labour Party Senators can prevail upon the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, to put an end to this sideshow.  The people, as I said here last Wednesday, are fully behind any Minister.  They fully understand that cuts and savings must be made, but they are entitled to have confidence in the actions and activity of the Minister on their behalf.  I fear the actions and activity of the past two weeks have done nothing other than ensure uncertainty among people, further ambiguity and doubt that this person can do this job on their behalf.  If Fine Gael persists in keeping its head in the sand, the Labour Party has an obligation, on behalf of ordinary people, to take the opportunity to take steps on behalf of the people and to put somebody in command of the €12 billion that will be spent on health.  They must do it before the Sunday newspapers are issued in order that people do not have to put up with another week of uncertainty or of the headless chicken approach to managing the health service.</p></speech>

If one looks at where we have come from, we allowed the drugs bill to increase from €576 million to €1.9 billion a year without any check being made and a health system to develop in which fewer than 10% of the people in charge of managing finance within the HSE had a financial management qualification.  That happened under their watch.  They talked about the site being identified in 2002.  Ten years on nothing has yet been built.</p></speech>

Only yesterday a new story broke about data audits having revealed that the credit histories of thousands of customers had been misreported to the Irish Credit Bureau.  This is a scandal and an unmitigated mess inflicted on unsuspecting bank customers.</p><p>It is clear from the banks' actions that they are not listening.  What worries me is that I am not sure anybody is capable of making them listen.  So far, the response of Permanent TSB and AIB to this debacle has been lamentably poor.  We need the Minister's intervention in the matter.  Neither bank has confirmed the number of the customers affected and they have made no suggestion to the effect that they will remedy the problems associated with their own negligence.  We must also remember the significance of this error.  To input an adverse credit finding against a customer in Irish Credit Bureau records is to suggest he or she is insolvent, which gives the message that he or she cannot pay his or her debts as they fall due.  This is potentially defamatory and has ramifications for people's good name but not only that, it may prevent them from obtaining finance down the road.  I remember in my capacity as a barrister how a client of mine had had an adverse credit rating against them which was highly erroneous.  Despite having valuable property, that person could not raise 1 cent in the banks during the boom years as a consequence of this error which was ultimately rectified through legal proceedings against the bank in question.</p><p>This morning I have written to all of the banks involved to ask them how they propose to deal with this issue.  I hope they will deal with my correspondence with urgency in order that when I return to the House on Tuesday, I can read their responses.  I have requested that they provide free credit reports for their customers, with a goodwill gesture for those individuals who have had erroneous and adverse entries entered against their good name.  I have also asked them to set up a helpline to deal with the issue and ensure anyone who uses it will be reimbursed.</p><p>Short of running out of money, it is very hard to think of a more serious problem affecting the banks' customers.  It is clear from their sloppy customer services that the customer still ranks at the bottom in term of priorities, despite all guarantees to the contrary.  For me, it remains a major source of disappointment, after the banks have been bailed out by the taxpayer, the ordinary customer cannot have peace of mind.  It is the most serious customer service failure in my memory and the reactions of both banks so far have been a disgrace.</p></speech>

I agree that it was a terrific debate last week, when we heard phrases such as "pane of glass" and so on.  Unfortunately, the Bill that will be before us later will mean that 110 agencies will be exempt, whereas the number was 60 before we started the debate.  We all praised the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly, and her staff and highlighted the need for greater accountability.  We said we needed to pass the Bill because Sir Humphrey was not a natural democrat.  He has been very active during the week and managed to have another 50 agencies exempted.  That is a shame because there is a view at large that the elected Government has been taken over by the permanent government of civil servants, of which this is an illustration.</p></speech>

I will broaden my request, therefore, and ask the Leader that we have, starting in the next two to three weeks, a debate with each Minister on his or her own particular component part of the programme for Government.   The Government has a programme which it hopes to implement, Department by Department.  It would be useful, first, for the Seanad and, second, Ministers, many of whom apparently feel unsure about the role of the Seanad, if they came before us to debate their work to date under the programme for Government and their proposals for the next 12 to 18 months.  Senators should be quite firm and state we expect and demand this of the Government.  No Minister should be afraid to come into this House to debate his or her management of his or her Department and his or her plans for that Department's role and work in the next 12 to 18 months.  As the Leader knows, we previously engaged in a similar fashion with MEPs and a number of European leaders.  We should now act more domestically and have each Minister, perhaps one a fortnight, in ths House for at least half a day to debate his or her programmes.</p><p>On an unrelated matter, having listened to &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; on RTE this morning, I wonder why we are paying to have an American correspondent, Mr. Downes.  It would be just as easy for RTE to have a direct link with Democratic national party headquarters.  The mood and tone of RTE and &quot;Morning Ireland&quot; this morning as they tried to explain why President Obama did not appear so triumphant last night in the first debate as they apparently wished he would and the list of excuses were, I thought, unbalanced.  Everybody is entitled to his or her view as to who should be the next President of the United States, but that will be decided by the American people.  It is interesting that we have RTE commenting on the matter, but we could expect balance.  It should not be an entirely biased programme in which the presenter and the reporter are upset at the apparent defeat of the President last night; they would almost have a person in tears.</p></speech>

There are 70,000 mortgage holders who will later this month pay an additional €50 on their mortgage because they have a variable rate mortgage from AIB.  This is a bank that is 100% owned by the taxpayer.  Senator D'Arcy is correct that there are public interest directors in the bank and other financial institutions within the State.  The question has to be asked as to what the hell they are doing.  It is time they were held to account.  If we are interested in reforming Seanad Éireann, we should start by having the public interest directors come before the House to explain to us what they are doing on behalf of the taxpayer.</p> <p>It would be a step in the right direction if that could be facilitated.</p></speech>

A total of 100,000 people are facing mortgage difficulty.  The Government is sitting on a report without implementing its recommendations.  That is disgraceful, despite promises which were made before the election.</p><p>I wish to raise an issue raised by you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, and others in the House on the Pilot Training College.  An alarming development has occurred in recent days.  I refer to students who paid tens of thousands of euro to the private training college in Waterford to undergo pilot training.  It now transpires that on the day the company was liquidated an application was made to the Companies Registration Office to register a new company.  The new company was registered yesterday.  The name of the new company is Clear Sky Pilot Training College Limited and it has the same address as the former pilot training company.  Two company directors both work for Company Bureau Formations Limited.  They will apply to the Irish Aviation Authority for recognition.  There is a need for an investigation.  Why is the new company using the same premises and why are the directors from the company, Company Bureau Formations Limited?  What connection does the new company have to the former directors?  Who is financing the formation of the company and why are the students being left high and dry by the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport?  I do not propose an amendment to the Order of Business but I will do so next week if there is no progress on the issue.  I call on the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House and advise on whether he will investigate the situation prior to approval being given by the Irish Aviation Authority.</p></speech>

I also thank Senators Wilson and Paul Coghlan and other Senators for their kind words.  I pay tribute to Senator O’Keeffe who did an excellent job as Labour Party Whip and is a wonderful contributor to this House in every way.</p><p>I also thank Senator Darragh O’Brien for bringing it to our attention today that only Fianna Fáil could look a gift horse in the mouth – not only a free site in Balbriggan but also, if I recall correctly, a free ward that was offered for cystic fibrosis sufferers in St. Vincent’s Hospital during its term in office.  It makes one wonder, as one discusses mortgage arrears, that perhaps if they had been more careful about accepting gifts rather than rejecting them we would not be where we are today.</p><p>I agree with the contributors who sought a debate on insolvency, housing debt and mortgage arrears.  It was my intention to do so on coming to the House today.  Could the Leader report back to us on the status of the Personal Insolvency Bill and when we can expect it to come before this Chamber?  It has come to my attention in the recent past that banks have not in any way softened their cough when it comes to dealing with mortgage arrears.  There is no doubt they are keeping people in a holding pattern.  There is a persistent and consistent attitude of not responding to mail.  I know of one person who is waiting three months for a reply to an urgent letter relating to their mortgage arrears.  Significant numbers of people are “in negotiations” with banks for a year, a year and a half and in some instances, two years.  It is a holding pattern.  It is worse than aeroplanes over Heathrow.  It is time we brought them down to land.  People are hanging on by their fingernails waiting for insolvency legislation.</p><p>One of my concerns is that under the legislation as drafted, mortgagors are required to go through processes with the bank before they can avail of the provisions of the legislation.  Unless we bring banks to heel we will never get anywhere in dealing with personal debt and mortgage debt in this country.  I ask the Leader, as a matter of urgency, to ask the Minister for Finance to come to the House and explain where we now stand on this important issue.  It is important to note that a specific age cohort are particularly affected by the situation.  I refer to young people who bought their homes and who are trying to form families who are trapped in the situation.  It is our duty to enable them to go forward.</p></speech>

Having lived in the United States for many years I realise the value of continuous assessment.  There is too much pressure on young people in this country to perform well in examinations on one day which will make a difference to the rest of their lives.  This transformation will prove to be a wonderful success.</p><p>I also note in recent days a proposed €12 million investment by the Department of Education and Skills for the upskilling of teachers on how to deal with misbehaviour among young people attending school.  The upskilling should focus on parents not teachers.  We are well aware of the increase in anti-social behaviour and the misuse of alcohol and drugs.  We are also well aware of the growing epidemic of obesity in this country, which currently affects more than 300,000 children.  We frequently debate in the Seanad the difficulties facing the health service.  We are talking about sick people making complaints.  One could go to any hospital and see people who are suffering from illnesses smoking at the entrance to the building.  They are not taking responsibility for their health.  It is time to put responsibility back on people rather than making it the responsibility of the Department of Health.</p><p>I call on the Leader to see whether we could get the Department of Education and Skills to introduce a continuous assessment programme in schools for physical education.  If we could take a small percentage of the proposed €12 million for the upskilling of teachers on how to deal with misbehaviour, we could nip the problem in the bud through the positive effect of physical education in schools.  We do not value the importance of physical education in schools where it could be of lifelong benefit to children.  I would like to see whether we could get a certain percentage of the funding to upskill teachers in physical education in schools.  Teachers have not had any upskilling in schools for the past six years.  That would be an important solution to deal with anti-social behaviour and the misuse of drugs and alcohol.</p></speech>

What Senator Eamonn Coghlan and others have spoken about today is important, namely, continuous assessment.  There has been a problem in the past with continuous assessment.  It has not been welcomed by teachers themselves.  They have difficulty with assessing their own pupils.  It would be a shame not to have continuous assessment and to have examinations on a more regular basis by someone outside the school.  I am not sure why teachers in the past have not been enthusiastic.  I hope they will change their attitude because one of the important elements of continuous assessment is being assessed by one’s own teachers.  In the past, teachers have not shown enthusiasm for such an approach.  I hope we get a chance to broach the subject next week.  I would prefer continuous assessment to having the assessment done as if it were a number of junior certificates, on a more regular basis.</p> <p> The Minister for Education and Skills will also speak this afternoon about adding to the curriculum the teaching of Mandarin, or Chinese, and entrepreneurship, which will be very useful.  A man in County Kerry, Jerry Kenneally, sold his business but decided he wished to remain in Kerry and invest in entrepreneurship for young people.  He is doing so with 15 year olds and 16 year olds in transition year.  Each year he puts money into training teachers how to teach entrepreneurship in the county - this is being done only in Kerry.  Last year I had the opportunity to go down with a number of pupils from Drogheda to see what was happening there.  This is one man getting behind his county and saying, "We are going to teach people who are 15 and 16 years of age how to be entrepreneurs".  It was so exciting to go down and see how successful that has been.  I mention this because although we may expect the Department of Education and Skills to do everything sometimes it is better for us to do it ourselves, with the support of the Department.  I would love to think we could manage to do something in that area.  When I went to County Kerry I could not get over the enthusiasm of some 600 pupils who came to Tralee and met other entrepreneurs, many of whom were in their teens and had set up successful businesses.  I would love to think other counties could do the same.  I know Jerry Kenneally would love to see this happening in every one of the other 31 counties in Ireland and I hope this will take place.</p><p>The other day I read that legislation has been passed in Portugal to the effect that all large stores - I do not remember the size specified - which employ a certain number of people must have defibrillators on site.  This seems to be a very useful provision and it would be well worthwhile if companies in Ireland that employ a certain number of people or which take in a certain number of visitors, as stores do, were also to do the same.  This seems to be something we in this House could grab hold of and encourage the Minister for Health to undertake.  Considering the problems the Minister has, it would be a real coup if he could manage to have a look at what is happening in Portugal and install something similar in this country.</p></speech>

I hope it will receive the broad-based support Senator Quinn mentioned from the stakeholders within the education sector to radically reform the junior certificate.  I noted the Senator's comments but am not sure if a course that teaches Kerry people how to make money is actually necessary.  Other colleagues made some excellent observations in good faith, such as Senator Coghlan on physical well-being.  When he attends the House next week I will ask the Minister to include mental health and coping skills as something to be embedded properly into the curriculum.  We have a generation of young people who, for one reason or another, find themselves under extraordinary stress and strain.  This manifests itself in communities throughout the country, unfortunately, with one tragedy after another wreaked upon families and friends on a daily and weekly basis.  This is not just important: we must prepare young people for life rather than just for exams.  Mental health and coping skills should be part of the curriculum of the new junior certificate cycle.  It is important that nobody leaves school without being able to read and write but neither should anybody leave school without knowing how to drive a car properly, swim and prepare three basic meals.  These are the fundamental life skills that would give a good foundation to young people leaving school.</p><p>There is a matter that the Cathaoirleach raised repeatedly in good faith and with conviction.  I second the proposal by Senator Ó Domhnaill that we call on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, to initiate an immediate investigation into what happened at the pilot training school in Waterford.  The cadet pilots were informed yesterday by the liquidator that they will not get one penny back of the €80,000 they invested in their careers and education. I do not wish to impugn anybody's reputation and we want to give fair call to people but it seems mysterious that a new company magically mushroomed overnight within hours of the previous company being put into liquidation.  We must hear from the Irish Aviation Authority and the Minister whether any of the principals who were involved in the debacle of the Waterford school are involved in the new training school and if any of the same investors are involved there.  If it had any hand, act or part in the previous school it should not get a licence to operate.  Injustice has been visited on these young cadet pilots and anybody responsible should not be allowed to walk away from the wreckage and start afresh the next day.</p></speech>

In recent times I have noted the number of e-mails that come from various parts of the world, telling us there are large sums of money awaiting us if only we provide details to those concerned.  This has been happening for some time but recently I noticed the mails have become exceptionally sophisticated in their layout.  There is not just one of them; they are arriving in numbers and it is obvious there is an international grouping working on this.  Most of us throw them in the wastepaper basket or may pass them to the Garda but I am a little worried there may be people who find themselves tempted by these types of messages.  I received one recently and did not reply to it but then got a further mail telling me my €2 million had arrived in Kentucky and cannot be released until I provide my details.  Needless to say, I did not do that but I am worried about this situation.  We should bring this to the notice of the Garda, obviously, but it would also be well worth while having a discussion in this House.  While most of us would laugh off this type of e-mail I remain convinced these letters would not come unless they are successful in certain cases.  The worst thing that can happen is that details of that nature would be passed on to these international fraudsters, which is what they are.  Will the Leader find time, not specifically for this topic, but for fraudulent activities in general?  I would not like there to be heartbreaking stories again, in this age, particularly of elderly people who lose their life savings.</p></speech>

They should consider their position.  They are there a long time, having been appointed in the dying days of the previous Government, and are not serving the public interest.</p> <p>It would be preferable if they could come before this House to explain themselves.  The public do not have confidence in AIB and neither do I.  That institution must do a better job, as it is predominantly a State-run bank.  In the light of the amount of taxpayers' money that has been invested in it, it has a responsibility and a clear role to play in getting the country back on track.</p><p>I take the opportunity to welcome, in advance, the announcement due to be made at 2 p.m. of a radical overhaul of the junior certificate programme.  I have always believed it is mad to put young people aged between 13 and 15 years through the type of examination process which obtains at junior cycle level.  A system of continuous assessment is required.  I do not believe in the notion of regurgitating certain information just for the sake of obtaining a particular grade in an examination.  I would prepare young people to be able to engage in critical analysis and also to be in a position to interpret information properly.  These are important life skills which will stand young people in good stead in the future.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by previous speakers on mental health issues and physical education.  I would go further and state I am not completely comfortable with the notion of the Irish education system becoming Americanised.  There may be a lot wrong with the education system, but there is also a great dealt that is right with it.  We produce some of the best qualified and world renowned scientists, engineers, computer experts, etc.  However, an education system must evolve continually and in a reflective way.  It would be far better if we proceeded with a process of continuous assessment within the education system.  I look forward to the Minister for Education and Skills outlining his plans in detail at 2 p.m.  Let us hope the type of thinking that has been engaged in with regard to the junior certificate will also be brought to bear in reforming the leaving certificate programme.</p></speech>

Such numbers were allocated to females in the past.  Certain females who registered for PPS numbers prior to 2000 were allocated the same numbers as their husbands, with the letter "W" included at the end.  These numbers are being phased out in certain circumstances.  For example, in instances where a husband is deceased, a divorce or separation has occurred, or where there is a pre-1979 consideration, new numbers must be provided.  When those affected receive new numbers, they are required to download and complete a form and return it to the Revenue Commissioners in order to notify them that their numbers have been changed.  Some women came to my constituency office in Carrick-on-Suir in the past week and indicated that when they handed in their existing identity cards and tried to claim carer's allowance, they were informed that they had disappeared from the system and that their previous PPS numbers were no longer valid.  Furthermore, they were informed that their old cards were being withdrawn, even though their new ones had yet not issued.  This matter has been handled badly.  Those in receipt of carer's allowance have already been affected and when those with medical cards seek to renew them, they will be informed their PPS numbers are no longer in use.  This is because the onus will be on them to notify the medical card section of the HSE of their new numbers.  In addition, their tax affairs will no longer be in order.  Given that the change affects people registered pre-1979, the majority of those involved are elderly females.  Many of the women concerned are not computer literate and not able to download from the Department's website the form necessary to inform Revenue that they have been issued with new PPS numbers.  As a result of what has happened, payments have been withheld.  I was visited by individuals earlier in the week who had been obliged to go to their community welfare officers in order to obtain payment.</p></speech>

As Members will be aware - I am grateful to them for this - last year the House unanimously passed a resolution asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to clarify this matter with the Government of Bahrain.  In addition, Senator Averil Power was a member of the delegation of Irish factfinders who travelled to Bahrain last year to try to ascertain what was taking place.  This matter was in abeyance for some time as a result of the appeals process, but the final appeal has now been held and some of the staff involved are facing prison terms of as much as ten or 15 years.  There is a body of opinion which states the only crime they committed was performing their professionally mandated duties to care for people who were victims of the disturbances taking place in Bahrain at the time.  I ask the Leader to communicate our concerns to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and ask him whether he has had an opportunity to pursue this matter further since it was originally raised.</p><p>I am not certain whether I wish to ask for a debate or clarification in respect of a particular matter.  I refer to an issue which has been of great concern to me for some time, namely, the amount of money spent on public relations contracts at all levels - from hospitals up to the Minister - within the health service.  No public money should be spent on public relations.  The role of public relations consultants is not to foster communication, rather it is to engage in an attorney-client style relationship with the person or entity that pays them and to make that person or entity look good.  People in all parts of the public service should be in a position to stand on and speak for their own records.  Senior civil servants in the Department of Health, senior HSE officials and senior consultants should, in rotation, be obliged to make themselves available to discuss publicly what is happening in their areas of expertise.  One of the medical journalists in this country whom I respect the most has been banging his head against a stone wall in trying to obtain figures from individual hospitals.  The catch-22 with which one is faced when one contacts a hospital to ask about the nature of its public relations contract is that the person to whom one speaks is the public relations consultant for that hospital.  These individuals are not very forthright in volunteering the information one requires.</p><p>I know it may take some time to obtain it, but will the Leader inquire if the Minister will provide itemised information on the total amount spent on external public relations contracts and internal press relations and public relations officers by the Department of Health, the HSE and the various quangos, particularly the National Cancer Control Programme and the Health Information Quality Authority?  It is apparent that every one of the hospitals has an external public relations contract.  There are public relations companies which are billing these hospitals for their services at a time when waiting lists are lengthening and staff numbers have been frozen.  I was horrified to discover yesterday, even though a doctor and a nurse have been appointed to run the national rare diseases metabolic programme for adults - it is based in the Mater Hospital and run in conjunction with Temple Street Children's University Hospital - that a secretary could not be hired as a result of the embargo on recruitment in the public service.  This is madness.  I will bet that both hospitals are paying public relations consultants.  This matter which is part of a larger problem relating to management consultants tends to be ignored.  What is happening in respect of public relations is real, finite, quantifiable and wrong.  If the Leader could discover what is going on, I would be extremely grateful.</p></speech>

The generation of which I am a member is the one which has been very much affected by the crisis relating to negative equity, mortgage arrears, etc.  The most recent hike in mortgage interest rates on the part of AIB is very unwelcome.  AIB is more willing to interact with mortgage holders than was previously the case, but, as Senator Aideen Hayden stated, the process in this regard tends to last for one year or two.  One is obliged to wonder whether this relates to a need to massage the figures and statistics for overdrafts, etc. - to make it appear that banks are lending when they are not - rather than achieving real outcomes.  I join previous speakers in asking that not the Minister for Finance but rather representatives of the banks come before the House to discuss this matter.  On previous occasions, people from outside have addressed the House.  Given that the State practically owns AIB, senior management from that institution should be brought before us to explain how they are handling the situation relating to mortgage arrears.</p></speech>

He stated clearly that unless that happened, the citizens of Europe would lose trust in the Union.  We need to stand firmly behind this view.  I am delighted with his showing of common sense because the people are feeling this also.</p><p>I welcome the proposals made by the Minister for Education and Skills for reform of the junior certificate programme.  They are radical and represent a significant shift in mindset.  The Minister proposes to introduce a new national standardised testing system in second year to assess literacy and numeracy levels; a school-based assessment, with teachers marking students; and provide for the issuing of a school certificate instead of a State junior certificate.  If this new radical approach improves student learning, I am all for it.  If it improves how students think, if they are taught to be thinkers, instead of how to regurgitate information, that will be good.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to discuss these reforms.  How can we reassure parents and students about the standards applicable to teachers and schools?  Unless this is successful, the credibility of the system will fall apart.  They are new and significant reforms, but we must ensure we maintain the good while embracing the new.</p></speech>

I agree with the Senator that waiting times to be seen by consultants are unacceptable and the Minister agrees.  I have asked him to highlight the point about the number of patients who do not attend for their appointments with consultants.  I checked the figures for Waterford Regional Hospital.  In 2011 a total of 16,000 failed to attend for their appointments.  In the year to August, over 9,000 have not attended for their appointments.  This means that approximately 25,000 others could have been seen, which would have made a significant dent in hospital waiting lists.</p></speech>

If he thinks there is a lack of balance, he should pursue the matter with the RTE Authority and I am sure it will be investigated.  </p><p>Senators Brian Ó Domhnaill and John Whelan today and Senator Denis O'Donovan yesterday all raised the question of the pilot training college in Waterford.  Senator Denis O'Donovan said he intended to write to the Minister to lay out the points to be made.  I encourage Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill to write to the Minister also and will certainly follow up the matter.  I ask him to forward me a copy of that correspondence.  No one should be allowed to start up a company following the collapse of a previous one.</p><p>Senator Labhrás Ó Murchú referred to fraudulent activities on the Internet.  We all receive such e-mails.  However, if the Senator wants a companion to travel with him to Kentucky to collect the €2 million, I am available.  I do not mean to be flippant because it is a problem and people can be hoodwinked in that regard.</p></speech>

In page 3, lines 16 to 19, to delete subsection (3) and substitute the following:
&quot;(3) This Act shall come into operation on enactment save in respect of entities that were not reviewable agencies under the Principal Act immediately prior to the enactment of this Act.

The Second Stage debate on this legislation was very informative and I look forward to answering as best I can the points raised by Senators in this committee discussion.</p><p>Amendment No. 1 is a technical amendment which provides for the commencement of the legislation on enactment save in respect of any entities that are not subject to the Ombudsman Act 1980 immediately prior to such enactment.  In respect of such bodies, the Act will commence on a date six months from the date of enactment or on such earlier date as the Minister may specify by order.  The amendment will ensure there is a clear start-up date for the enactment of the provisions in the Bill.</p></speech>

The observation was made during that debate that this type of legislation is necessary because Sir Humphrey is not a natural democrat.  In these grim times, when so much of the reform is stymied by a regrettable lack of funding, it is important that we examine every opportunity to enhance accountability and scrutiny in the public sector.  I am squarely on the same side as the Minister in these matters and acknowledge that the constraints under which his Government is operating were inherited from the previous Administration.</p><p>As the explanatory memorandum indicates, the purpose of the legislation is to extend the remit of the Ombudsman.  Ms Emily O'Reilly is universally well regarded and no entity should be exempt from her powers of scrutiny.  Why then are certain bodies being given a six-month grace period before coming under the Ombudsman's remit?  This Bill was initiated in the Dáil in 2008 and passed in 2010.  There is no slur or insult implied against any particular agency in the provisions in the Bill to extend the remit of the Ombudsman.  On the contrary, the aim of the legislation is ensure that every relevant entity is accountable in the same way for its expenditure of public moneys.  Citizens must be confident that any concerns they have in this regard can be submitted to the Ombudsman and that a full and frank response will be forthcoming.  As I said on the Order of Business this morning, there is a view that Sir Humphrey still reigns and, moreover, that he has had a very active week in tabling amendments in his own interest as opposed to what we are seeking to achieve.</p><p>This Oireachtas has been in place for 18 months, or approximately one third of a full term.  Time is moving on and a Government that was elected to be radical should consider whether it is acceptable to allow certain bodies a six-month breathing space from their obligations to citizens in terms of accountability and transparency.  People are dispirited and disillusioned.  Unlike many of the reforms which the Government might like to make, this particular step would have no heavy cost and will ensure that all bodies operating in the State are answerable to the citizens of this country through the agency of the Ombudsman.  I will listen with great interest to the Minister's response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-04a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1122" speakername="Trevor Ó Clochartaigh" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012100400010#J01900"><p>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire arís.  Táim ag súil go mór leis an díospóireacht inniu mar tá an Bille seo thar a bheith tábhachtach.  Tagaim leis an méid atá á rá ag an Seanadóir Barrett.  An léamh a d'fhéadfá a bhaint as an leasú áirithe seo ná go bhfuil muid ag tabhairt sé mhí breise do na heagraíochtaí eile seo an seó atá acu a ghlanadh suas, rud nach bhfuil agus nár cóir a bheith ag teastáil.</p><p>Although it is not the Minister's intention, this amendment could be misconstrued as seeking to give the specified entities an additional six months in which to clean up their act.  One would hope that all of the agencies being added are already doing their work in a fitting manner which upholds the principles set out in legislation.  The Ombudsman is the independent arbiter of whether or not a citizen is being treated fairly and whether public bodies are fulfilling their functions in the proper manner.  As such, there is a fuzzy logic in affording these particular bodies an extra six months.  While I do not intend to oppose the amendment, it seems quite strange to afford them this latitude.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-04a.108" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012100400011#K00100"><p>I will do my best to de-fuzz the logic, as it were.  This is a standard provision as a commencement date is required.  The commencement date for all bodies subject to the Ombudsman under the existing legislation is the date of enactment.  For all other bodies, a horizon of six months or such lesser time as I determine by order will apply.  It is my intention to determine the tightest timeframe possible in each case.</p><p>I note Senator Sean D. Barrett expressed views on this matter on the Order of Business and tabled a series of amendments to the Schedule.  I look forward to explaining the position in this regard.  The Department was in discussions with the Ombudsman and other Departments on specific agencies until the day the amendments were tabled.  Once it has been determined which bodies will come within the purview of the legislation, we must give them some notice that is consistent with good administration.  In essence, the six month timeframe sets out the horizon by which everything will come into effect.  It is, however, my intention to have a much narrower timeline for all the agencies specified in the Bill.  </p><p>I do not propose to discuss the agencies which have been excluded from the structure of the Bill as I hope to do so when we discuss the next substantial group of amendments.  However, as this is the first amendment, I will outline the principles involved.  I am absolutely determined, as is the Government, to build on our previous period in government when we introduced the Freedom of Information Act, the Standards in Public Office Act and the Ethics in Public Office Act, as well as changes to the Electoral Act to provide for greater accountability.  Much of this legislation was watered down in the intervening period and the Government will restore it to the position that obtained previously.</p><p>I have introduced this legislation in the House and we held a detailed seminar on the heads of a whistleblowing Bill which will be known as the protected disclosures Bill.  Legislation providing for a register of lobbyists is at an advanced stage and the restoration and extension of the Freedom of Information Act are fast coming down the tracks.  This Bill is part of a corpus of law that will do exactly what Senators Sean D. Barrett and Trevor Ó Clochartaigh seek, namely, greatly expand the capacity of citizens to understand how decisions are made, how public administration works and who influences decisions in our democracy and introduce the greatest possible degree of transparency. </p><p>The amendment provides simply for an enabling timeline.  I will commence the legislation as quickly as I can.  The six month horizon is the outer limit for doing so.  </p></speech>

I suggest a period of three months should apply.  Perhaps he will consider before Committee Stage whether the legislation can be commenced sooner, but we will leave the matter to his judgment.</p></speech>

In increasing the number by 140, we must have procedures in place in each case and the bodies in question must be given some indication of how they should deal with complaints, interact with the Ombudsman and so forth.  It may be of interest to Senators to note that, unusually in the preparation of this legislation, the Department has worked very closely with the Ombudsman to the extent that the Ombudsman has kindly seconded to my office a member of her staff who is working closely with us in the drafting of the Bill.  I want the legislation to be practical rather than aspirational.  We will ensure it works, while also upholding the principles that are important to the House and the Government.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 33 amounts to three pages of legislation, while amendment No. 34 amounts to four pages.  Each of the amendments in the group raises serious issues and teasing them out individually would help in the preparation of the Bill.  Too much is being swept into one set of amendments in which different issues arise.  If, during the course of the debate, it transpires that some of the amendments have been discussed, I will withdraw or decline to move them.  However, these issues are of great importance; Irish democracy is at stake.  When one considers what took place four years ago last weekend, when a large number of accountable agencies to Parliament did serious damage to this country, we must take this chance to extend control to more agencies, as the Minister proposes.  While I am delighted he is working with the Ombudsman, much went wrong as a result of the role of unaccountable people.</p><p>This is probably the most important Bill to come before the House this session because it proposes to extend democracy in circumstances in which many institutions collapsed and less than two years later the country had to be rescued by the International Monetary Fund.  The governance of the country requires that we discuss these amendments separately.  If there is unnecessary duplication, we will quickly dispose of the relevant amendments.  However, the amendments are so wide-ranging and include such a large amount of legislation that we should discuss them individually as we seek to assist the Minister.  That is the spirit in which I am participating in this debate.</p></speech>

Barrett because I do not wish to be at odds with him.  We have plenty of time to deal with the amendments.  The reason we should discuss them as a group is that they overlap.  In any case, each individual amendment must be disposed of separately at the end of the discussion.  It is proposed, however, that we discuss them together because they overlap and it would be difficult to disaggregate the Senator's amendments from those I have tabled because a number of them are identical.  If we have a general discussion on the principles - we can have a meeting of minds in that regard - we could then deal with each individual amendment.  That would be the best way to proceed and I recommend that we adopt such an approach.</p></speech>

That is the objective we all have and I am here to assist the Minister to make a major breakthrough in our democracy.  No agencies should be exempt from democratic accountability.  The concept is foreign to what the Minister was saying on the legislation last week.  What is wrong with society in many ways is that agencies categorise themselves as exempt.  The aim of the legislation is to extend the Ombudsman&#8217;s remit.  The exempt agency is a null concept running against these principles.</p><p>  The body of the law exempts matters before the courts, financial matters and industrial relations as the machinery is in place to deal with them.  The courts will decide on issues of referral to the Ombudsman.  The concept of an exempt agency that is outside the law is too much like the public administration that failed us in the past and should be part of the Minister&#8217;s reform agenda.  All agencies, apart from those covered by the courts, financial and industrial relations matters, should be within the remit of the legislation.  State agencies must know that if they annoy citizens, the Ombudsman will come around.  In the spirit of what the Minister said to us last week, which I commend, the concept of an exempt agency is a contradiction in terms.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 2 deals with the concept of exemption, while the others specify the exemptions.  It makes sense to talk about it in the round, but I am in the hands of the House.</p><p>I understand the passion Senator Sean D. Barrett feels about the catastrophe inflicted on the economy by bad decision-making by several agencies.  People feel very raw about this, with absolute justification.  Members of the Government and Senators on this side of the House feel a righteous anger as much as anyone else.  However, it would not be the Ombudsman’s role to be the point person to say a wrong decision was being made by an agency.  The role is to deal with cases where a class of citizens interfacing with public bodies is subject to maladministration or decision-making that affects them adversely.  For example, it can involve a person allocated a house by a local authority unfairly.  It is not a super regulator to regulate everything that happens in public administration.  That would be a job beyond the capacity of an individual Ombudsman to take on.  The Ombudsman’s remit has always been focused on public bodies which have a close interface and direct engagement with significant numbers of members of the public.  The Ombudsman is entitled to intervene in cases where a citizen believes he or she has not been treated fairly or a decision made by an agency has the potential to have an adverse effect on a member of the public.</p><p>I do not agree with the general principle that everything should be subject to the Ombudsman’s remit.  I also consider she would agree with this, as there are different types of watchdogs and regulators.  In the case of fiscal decisions, we have the fiscal council, with which Senator Sean D. Barrett will be familiar, to give separate advice and there is oversight of banking.  These are complicated structures and the Ombudsman is not a super overseer of all public administration in that sense.</p><p>I have been convinced that specialist advisory bodies which do not deal with the general public should not be within the extent of the Ombudsman’s purview such as ComReg, the Commission for Aviation Regulation and the Commission for Energy Regulation.  There are some advisory or regulatory bodies which do deal with the general public which will be within the remit such as HIQA.  I do not want Ryanair complaining to the Ombudsman because it did not receive a favourable decision from the aviation regulator.  The same argument holds in the commercial semi-State sector.  These are commercial bodies engaged in market activities, governed by industry and sector specific regulatory bodies, legal requirements and company law like any other company.  They are in direct competition with companies in the private sector.  This competition would be distorted if these companies were subject to an individual complaints mechanism.  An individual could, for example, complain because he or she felt the Aer Lingus price structure did not suit them.  Such complaints would bog down the Ombudsman.</p> <p>It might suit other airlines if that was the case.  Those are the sort of commercial sensitivities we must consider.</p><p> By definition, there are some bodies that are public bodies, largely owned or controlled by the State, such as commercial semi-States which operate in a different regulatory environment where the rules that apply to them are the same rules that apply to every one of their competitors in the same sector.  We do not want to make it overly difficult for a State-owned company to operate and make it an uneven playing field for them <i>vis-à-vis</i>their competitors.</p><p> Similarly, as I stated, in the regulatory sector, these are regulators.  They do not deal with individual members of the public.  My view and that of the Government is that these are not appropriate ones to be brought within the remit of the Ombudsman.  They do not deal with everybody in every case.  The advisory bodies are there to proffer expert advice but do not deal with individual members of the public and there is no cause for complaint.  Of course, anybody can complain.  On the notion that people would be giving out about the fiscal council because it recommended that there should be &#8364;4 billion, there would be quite a large amount of complaints to the Ombudsman if we brought the fiscal council within her remit.</p><p> To be practical about it, it is an extraordinary extension of the remit of the Ombudsman to cover those areas where individual citizens are interacting or interfacing with agents or agencies or Departments of State and where they believe they have not been given fair treatment.  That is the traditional role of the Ombudsman and we should not try to extend it beyond that because it would not be fair to the Ombudsman herself.</p><p> In general terms, where there are exemptions it is my intention that there would be inclusions in the future and that should not be a matter for me alone to determine.  In the Bill, it is my intention to give a role to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions.  Where that committee believes that a body, maybe because the committee received complaints from the general public through petitions, would be appropriate to be brought within the remit, the committee can make a recommendation to me or to whoever holds my office in future.  That is a good way of involving the democratic process and the elected Members in the selection process so that it can be expanded in future, if it is not exhaustive enough in this enactment.</p></speech>

According to the section to which I refer, she could investigate any entity that is financed wholly or partly, whether directly or indirectly, by means of moneys provided from the Exchequer.  Taxpayers have that entitlement.  That is my concern about exemptions.  They know where one is when they are looking for money and then they are exempt when one asks what they did with it.  That can affect individuals.</p><p>On the example the Minister mentioned, of course, we would not be particularly exercised as to whether Ryanair liked decisions etc., but the airport charges were increased by 41% by that regulator at the behest of the former Minister, Mr. Noel Dempsey, which might have affected a great many in their day-to-day dealings.</p></speech>

That is what I say to a 41% increase in charges.</p><p>If there is a general power that anybody who looks for public money under section 4 is reviewable, we should specify the exemptions - the concept of which is wrong anyway - in a section of the Act rather than have a list of exempted bodies.  The general presumption should be that the law applies and if people are being disadvantaged by agencies funded from the purse, those must have redress.</p><p>I appreciate the Minister's sentiments about Parliament and its rights, but there is much behind the scenes governance in Ireland which must be opened up.  I suppose I am wishing to extend the powers of the Ombudsman to try to achieve that because a great deal was going wrong for a good while in this country.  I fear, I suppose, going back to the Minister's earlier statement, that we are wasting a good recession if we do not open up to scrutiny on behalf of the citizens.  The citizens are very annoyed at what has happened in this country.  They believe they were powerless and they need the Minister and the Ombudsman to intervene on their behalf.  It is a white knight role for them both.  That is why I have difficulties with bodies being exempt from the general provision.  If they want public money, we want to know what they do with it.  Certainly, we want to ensure that they did not do it to the detriment of the citizens who paid for this.</p><p>The Minister raised that example.  There are many other examples for which, when one goes through the list of bodies at the end, it is strange that we would deprive the citizen of that form of redress for which, we agree, from the former Ombudsman, Mr. Mills, through to the Ombudsman, Ms O'Reilly, the Ombudsman has been a beacon for the citizen in dealing with the many faults in the system of governance.</p></speech>

I understand why the Senator is using this legislation to address an issue it is not designed to address.  There are enormous difficulties in regulation.  The Senator is an expert on that area and I readily acknowledge that.  One could not state objectively, if there is an aviation regulator who determines on balance an increase in landing fees at Dublin Airport, or a taxi regulator determining what taxi charges should be, that it could possibly be appropriate for the Ombudsman to state that it is an appropriate or an inappropriate fee or charge.  It would be an impossible position for the Ombudsman.</p><p>It is a fair point that maybe we need to re-look at our regulators and whether they have been up to the job, but that is a different argument for a different time.  This House is capable, through its committees, of calling in any of these regulators and getting explanations of their practice etc.</p><p>On the notion that one would make the unfortunate Ombudsman the final court of appeal for every decision, where the Competition Authority makes a determination on a merger it could not be sustained objectively that the Ombudsman has the right of appeal.</p> <p>Objectively, this very significant expansion of the role of the Ombudsman to cover all categories where there is a direct interface with the public and agencies of the State should be welcomed.  If there are lacunas in what we have done, we have the power to add on at a later stage.  As we will also give a proactive role to a committee of the House to keep the matter under constant review, we are not waiting another number of years for a Minister to focus on it.  </p><p>Regarding the specific question asked, any body not listed as exempt is included.  Therefore, in the specific case of the State Examination Commission, it is included.  Any other body that the Senator can think of which is not on the exempt list is included.  This gets to the heart of the Senator's question.  The old idea was that one listed the bodies that were included.  My view is that every body is included except those that are exempt.  It might look as if the Minister is exempting many bodies but in fact I am narrowing down the exemptions considerably.  It is a different way of looking at it.  I only exempted those bodies for which a coherent and logical case existed and I did that in close dialogue with the Ombudsman herself and her office. </p></speech>

It is good that we are looking at it from a different angle rather than the standard position as we have known it.  I appreciate Senator Barrett's passion for what he wants done but I do not know that this is the correct vehicle.  My concept for the office of the Ombudsman was that it was for the individual citizen to use against the arm of the State.  The arm of the State is practically, as the Minister has just said, going to take in just about every body except those that are prescribed and exempt, which is good.</p><p>In the days of the first Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, the office was new and alien to us.  On so many occasions, however, individuals took a case to the Ombudsman and a determination was made and we need to remind ourselves that this is the primary purpose of the office.  It is there so that the individual citizen can take on the apparatus of the State, which can be too strong, powerful and perhaps, too dominant.  </p><p>We touched on the issue of the legislation being used to the advantage of a private company against a semi-State company.  It is not beyond the realms of possibility that a private company could use the legislation in this way and this becomes an unintended consequence, namely, that the semi-State company is put at a commercial disadvantage.  I do not think we want to create that circumstance, as the Minister said.</p></speech>

She was critical of the previous Bill, saying: &quot;It is my understanding that the Bill will not extend my remit to complaints regarding decisions in relation to immigration and asylum matters.  I am most concerned by this.&quot;  She went on to say that in most European countries, such complaints are covered.  She said:<blockquote><br />...I have stressed a number of points about this lacuna in my jurisdiction.  I highlighted the fact that most Ombudsman Offices in Europe have jurisdiction in this area of administration.  It is an area of administration which impacts very significantly on the lives of a very vulnerable group of people, many of whom face significant challenges...  </blockquote>I appreciate the principle that every body is included unless on the exempt list.  I do not see the Reception and Integration Agency, RIA, the Irish Prison Service or the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, on the list but I do see a reference further on to the fact that jurisdiction does not extend to the Department of Justice and Equality in so far as it relates to an action taken in the administration of the law relating to aliens or naturalisation, taken in the administration of the prisons, involving the exercise of the right or power referred to in Article 13.6 of the Constitution and so forth.  </p><p>  I ask the Minister to clarify if this Bill extends the powers of the Ombudsman in the way she sought in her critique of the Bill in 2008.  I contend that this is one of the areas that we most need to allow her to have jurisdiction over.  I have raised the issue of the Lisbrook direct provision centre in Galway on a number of occasions in this House in the past two weeks, which was in danger of being closed.  I also highlighted the Irish Refugee Council's recent report during the debate on the children's referendum because there are serious issues concerning the rights of children in direct provision.  During that debate, much praise was given to Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, who pioneered that legislation but it relates to this legislation too in that the Ombudsman has sought the power of jurisdiction over direct provision centres.  The Irish Refugee Council report is very critical of those centres.  Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness wrote the foreword to that report,  in which she says the following:<blockquote><i>Poverty and Exclusion </i>paints a convincing picture of the damage done to children by years of living in institutional accommodation which is so far removed from the atmosphere of a normal family home. This is rendered even more damaging by the income poverty of their parents. </blockquote>She goes on to say that Ireland is in breach of the family life rights set out in Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The author of the report raises a number of very serious issues which I appreciate the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs have said they will address.</p></speech>

The authors of the report claim that the sustained and prolonged restriction of human rights and civil liberties inherent in the direct provision system amount to child abuse.  These are very serious allegations based on numerous complaints.  The Ombudsman has said that the people who made those types of complaints, which have been catalogued by the Irish Refugee Council, should be able to make their complaints to her office and she should be able to investigate them.  My reading of the Bill as it stands - and I hope the Minister will clarify this - is that she will not have jurisdiction over these issues.  She will not have jurisdiction over the administration of law relating to immigration or naturalisation.  If that is the case, it is a very sad day and would represent a retrograde step and a reason for us not to support the Bill.  One of the most important things that we must do, as Senator Barrett has said, is to open up the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman.  Any organisation or State agency which is receiving money or delivering a service to the citizens should be open to those citizens being able to have redress if they felt they have not been treated properly.</p></speech>

The Senator has made a compelling case on this issue and I wanted to ascertain what we are doing.  In that context, I have spoken at length to my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, on the justice matters.  To answer the specific question, the Department of Justice and Equality is included but some of its functions are excluded.  We have looked at the specifics referred to by the Senator.  To take the Irish Prison Service, for example,  there has been a lot of interaction between my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality about that service because my instinct, like the Senator's, would be to include it.  There have been a lot of independent reports from the Inspector of Prisons and there is considerable public confidence in the inspector's analysis, which is very damning.</p> <p> As I noted in my Second Stage contribution in this House, the Minister for Justice and Equality has confirmed that he intends to introduce a credible prisoner complaint system that will deal with genuine complaints in an open, transparent and independent manner.  The report of the inspector noted that the issues which give rise to complaints occur on an almost daily basis and indicated that an on-the-spot mechanism was needed to deal with them.  It is not sufficient to write to the Ombudsman and wait while she conducts a formal investigation, writes to the Irish Prison Service and gets its response.  This is a daily administrative issue and we need an efficient, on-the-spot ombudsman system.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, intends to introduce such a system and I am determined to give him the space to do so.  If a view is taken subsequently that the Irish Prison Service should be part of the Ombudsman's remit, I have an open mind in this regard.</p><p>In respect to the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, the programme for Government contains a commitment on introducing comprehensive reform of the immigration, residency and asylum system, including the creation of a statutory appeals system.  This is intended to provide for efficient processing and determination of citizenship applications within a defined statutory timeframe.  The reforms will be progressed through the enactment of the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010.  Following the preparation of key Government amendments to that Bill, the Minister, Deputy Shatter, intends to return to the Oireachtas with comprehensive legislation as a centrepiece of wide ranging reform of asylum and immigration policy.  The Minister's objective is to be in a position to bring this new Bill before the Government for approval later this year.  On foot of his decision to introduce more effective legislation, I accept his advice against including the service entirely within the remit of the Ombudsman at this time.</p></speech>

I have experience of dealing with the latter office on behalf of an individual who was looking for a matter to be concluded.  The office was supposed to issue an opinion to a Minister but I could not even say that I found my interaction with it unsatisfactory because it refused to interact with me.  Officials asked me why I was ringing them and told me that I should not be contacting them.  Under these circumstances, I found it the most displeasing office of any with which I have ever dealt.  I reached the point at which I had to down tools and tell the individual concerned that I could not advance the issue any further.  I had no intention of misleading my constituent.  That interaction may have been different if the Ombudsman had oversight of the office.</p><p>I speak against myself when I say the Attorney General should be exempt in nearly all cases but when this citizen learned that his solicitor was having no success in interacting with the Chief State Solicitor he approached me and other Members.  The latter were no more successful in their efforts, however.  I am not sure if this Bill is the vehicle for ensuring the Office of the Chief State Solicitor interacts with the public but perhaps certain parts of prescribed bodies should be subject to some form of oversight.</p></speech>

I do not fully buy his answer, however, because, as a member of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, I understand the Ombudsman's role as the last chance saloon for people with grievances.  Such individuals are directed to pursue other avenues of redress before they approach the Office of the Ombudsman.  It would be a welcome development if the Minister for Justice and Equality put in place a procedure to deal with day-to-day issues but, as the Ombudsman's reports make clear, her office deals with issues that the arms of the State have failed to address.</p><p>The legislation on naturalisation has been a long time coming and while I have been critical of policies pursued by the previous Administration in respect of direct provision, these policies are still in place and they need to be addressed immediately.  We are discussing an agency which does not yet exist.  The Refugee and Integration Agency and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service do exist and a mechanism of redress needs to be provided for those who have complaints about how they have been treated by these bodies.  I see the Ombudsman as playing that role because no other mechanism is available.  I do not believe the two mechanisms would clash in any way.  The proposals of the Minister, Deputy Shatter, are a positive development but my understanding of the role of the Ombudsman is that she would get involved where an individual cannot resolve a complaint through the existing mechanisms.  I strongly support the Ombudsman and I am interested in hearing her opinion of the Minister's advice.  Do the officials seconded to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform agree with this advice or do they believe the relevant powers should be given to the Ombudsman, as she stated in 2008?  I would argue strongly for the inclusion of these agencies in the Bill. </p></speech>

As I do not want to delay the Minister in his reform agenda I suggest that the Bill list the principles rather than the agencies, provided it does not require a vast amount of work.  I have been fairly hard on exempt agencies and do not wish to press the point on amendments Nos. 2 and 4.  Exempt agencies have been given a good run.  The fear is that a garda who knocks on a door while conducting an investigation might be told that the agency concerned is exempt.  That would not make for strong rule of law or the accountability which the Minister and I desire.</p></speech>

The principles would not separate any of us.  We want a practical Ombudsman to ensure every citizen is confident that if badly treated by an agent or agency of the State, there is an appeals mechanism that is robust enough to put that right.  In essence that is what the Ombudsman is about and must have the necessary resources.  Successive incumbents of that office have built up a fine reputation in vindicating its role which is now being extended.  As to whether this will be the last word on it, I am not sure.  The two major principles enshrined in the legislation are that new bodies will automatically come within its purview and the only bodies exempted are those listed in Schedule 2.  Even where there are exemptions, if in the future the Oireachtas is minded to amend the list, it will be in a position to make recommendations.  Obviously the House can make its own recommendations on a motion at any time but formally through the Joint Committee on Oversight and Petitions, which is a new device.  The Bill provides that the next Ombudsman will not be the sole choice of Government but the process will involve the Oireachtas.  The range of changes are very democratising.  </p><p>I shall deal with the two points made by Senator Michael D'Arcy.  I understand the frustrations one might have.  There are principles also.  We cannot have somebody guessing the role of the Attorney General as the chief law officer of the State, the legal adviser to the Government, and a constitutional office-holder with a specific role to uphold the Constitution, even though some of the subsets of that would cause its own difficulty.  In my parliamentary career I am more frustrated at the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions than of the Chief State Solicitor's office, but for right and good reasons they are absolutely independent in their decision making and cannot be gainsaid.  </p><p>I note the logic and passion of the argument made by Senator Ó Clochartaigh.  I ask him to give us the space to see how the new regime will operate.  If at the end of it, there is still good reason to revisit the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service or the Irish Prison Service, we will have an open mind.</p></speech>

However, it would be a mistake to give the Minister the space to think about it because he will need that role for the Ombudsman.  For example, if the Minister for Justice and Equality sets up a redress agency for the Irish Prison Service and the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, there will still be a role for the Ombudsman in overseeing the agency as there could be issues relating to people who have been through the system who need to have redress to the Ombudsman.  Surely, the role of Ombudsman is to oversee and have that independent viewpoint.</p><p>I am concerned at the speed at which the other legislation will come through and how quickly those agencies would be set up.  I have visited a direct provision centre in Galway.  It is a difficult situation for the people there.  In opposition, the Minister was critical of the direct provision model and it was to be scrapped within six months.  Some 18 months in, there is no change and we are still awaiting legislation.  The people who spoke to me and who are in that limbo say that every day that goes by is another day too long to deal with the situation.  The Irish Refugee Council has highlighted that many people there have issues and they want them redressed.  They do not have citizenship which makes it much more difficult for them to find redress.  The Minister mentioned the six-month horizon.  Even if the legislation is passed there will be a six-month lacuna.  I hope there will be movement before then in, say, three months or less.  They will still wait a long time.  From a human perspective, that is extremely difficult for them.  I ask the Minister to reconsider the amendment and, perhaps, discuss the matter with the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  Even if what he says will be put in place, it will take too long and there will still be a need for a role for the Ombudsman.</p><p>The Minister did not answer my question as to what the Ombudsman thinks.  Is she agreeable?</p></speech>

In the Bills digest in 2008 on the Bill, that was her major point of contention.  She said the Bill would not extend her remit to complaints regarding decisions on immigration and asylum matters and she was most concerned by this.  Has her view changed?  Has it been intimated to the Minister that she is happy with the legislation and, if so, will the Minister inform us accordingly?  He said he has daily interactions with officials from the Ombudsman's office.  If that was her main bugbear with the previous legislation, it must have been discussed  and they must have come to an agreement on it.  It is the nub of the legislation and is the one bone of contention we would have with the Minister.</p></speech>

Of course, the Ombudsman has a view about her remit.  Every agency set up by law will have a view that it should have greater powers.  I am sure the Seanad has views about itself but ultimately it is a matter for the Government in respect of legislation to make a proposition to the House, in consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  I have outlined his views.  I am minded to accept his views and recommendations and they are the considered views of the Government.</p><p>In essence, it is the Government, by and largem, that proposes legislation, individual Members can do that as well, and it is for the House to consider it.  External bodies have views on it.  In this case, the view of the Ombudsman is extremely important but it is for the Government to make decisions.  I am minded to accept the recommendations in this instance.  I understand the argument and the logic which I share with Senator Ó Clochartaigh.  However, if a new regime is to be put in place, let us look at the legislation - we are waiting a long time for it - in terms of the immigration and naturalisation service and general legislation on immigration matters and also in responding to reports from the prisons' inspector, a complaints regime that is immediate and timely for the Irish Prison Service.  If there is a judgment call subsequently that we need to visit, I have indicated to the House that Senators will find I have an open ear on that matter.  I ask Members to give us the space to put in place what the Minister for justice intends.</p></speech>

It is important to note that as the Minister has said, we are speaking to the amendments which refer to the exemptions.  It will be noted from my contribution on Second Stage that we certainly congratulated the Minister for bringing the Bill forward and noted the extension of powers.  It is important to say that as the Minister has raised the issue.  This is about getting down to any particular areas of the legislation that we consider will not do what is best in the common good.  I appreciate what the Minister said about the Minister for Justice and Equality.</p> <p>Our experience is that most complaints were made where people believed they had not experienced transparency or an openness to redress and relate to particular services of the Irish Prison Service, naturalisation and asylum seekers.  It would be remiss of us not to address this issue.  </p><p>Ministers come and go but I hope that the Minister for Justice and Equality introduces legislation as quickly as possible.  I would place great weight on the comments of the Ombudsman as somebody independent of the Government.  The general public would do the same.  Any citizen would believe Ombudsman is doing an extremely good job and that she has been forthright in her opinions when she gives them.  She does not express them lightly and the weight of her opinion must be taken on board.  We cannot allow such an area to go unaddressed and I ask the Minister to reconsider the measure.  It is a retrograde move and I disagree with his analysis of the matter.  </p></speech>

That is what they are about and let there be no doubt about it.  The lobbyist makes his client, the person himself or herself better off but who loses?  Are there losers as a result of lobbying?  I know that the Minister shall soon address the matter with legislation and I will strongly support him.  Does the legislation strengthen his intention to deal with the activities of lobbyists?  There are losers and that is why lobbyists engage in the activity.  Do the losers have a right to lodge an appeal with the Ombudsman?  Failed regulators damage people.  We have probably discussed it but we have not discussed lobbying.  </p><p>Public private partnerships can also damage people, yet they have managed to escape scrutiny on the basis that they are in some way confidential.  Some of them were raised in the House, including confidential agreements on drug prices and tolls on motorways.  I put those forward because the issues require scrutiny, particularly lobbying which is close to the Minister's heart.  I am simply making suggestions.  Does he think that they contain anything that he can use to prise open some activities and subject them to scrutiny?  Is this the appropriate place to raise the matter?  During the course of his political career he expressed an interest in such matters and that is why I raise them now.  Is there a link? </p></speech>

As the Senator will know, we have published extensive heads of a Bill to regulate lobbyists.  People involved in lobbying were strongly at pains to underscore to me that the business of lobbying is perfectly legitimate and that virtually every citizen engages in it.  Whether it is the Children's Rights Alliance - perhaps I should not use it as an example in the presence of the Acting Chairman - the agricultural community or the IFA, lobbying is part of the democratic process.  The objective is to conduct it in a transparent and open manner and to ensure that there are not fellas whispering into important ears at the back of a tent in Galway.  There are consequences when a lobbyist gets their way.  It is not a matter for the Ombudsman to deal with no more than I would regard it legitimate for the Ombudsman to deal with the adverse impact of a regulatory decision from, for example, the Competition Authority, ComReg or anybody else.</p><p>We will have a chance to discuss in some detail the robust mechanisms that deal with the regulation of lobbyists in the House.  I do not foresee a particular role for the Ombudsman in that regard. </p></speech>

Paragraph (<i>a</i>) provides for consultation with the committee of the House before making any proposal to appoint an Ombudsman in order to strengthen the Ombudsman's relationship with the Oireachtas.  The Ombudsman supports the enhanced role for the Oireachtas in terms of pre-appointment scrutiny and regular reporting.</p><p>  The purpose of the amendment is to make the appointment process more transparent, to recognise the legitimate interests of the Oireachtas in the selection and appointment of an Ombudsman, and to encourage and support the ongoing involvement of the relevant Oireachtas committee with the Ombudsman.  Senators will be aware that part of the role of the new oversight and petitions committee is to be a vehicle where reports of the Ombudsman can be properly dealt with.  A lacuna in the past sometimes existed where the reports of the Ombudsman were not properly dealt with.  It is important for the Oireachtas to play a role in the pre-selection process before a new Ombudsman is appointed. </p> <p>It is also envisaged that the consultation process will allow the general public the opportunity to understand the approach the Ombudsman designate would take to the role he or she would perform in the future.</p></speech>

She has sought more transparent procedures for appointing ombudsmen and has argued for some kind of a confirmation hearing before an Oireachtas committee charged with monitoring and supporting the work of the office.</p><p>Perhaps we should consider changing the wording from &quot;may&quot; be preceded by consideration to &quot;shall&quot; be preceded by consideration.  This would give a sense of compellability and demonstrate it needs to be done, rather than that it may be done at the behest of a Minister.  What is the Minister's thinking on that aspect?  As somebody who sits on the committee, I welcome this and see it as a good move.  We support this amendment.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister to the House.  Following our really good debate on Second Stage of this Bill, I welcome this amendment.  We spoke on Second Stage about the importance of having Oireachtas supervision of appointments such as this.  I mentioned at the time the proposed merged Human Rights and Equality Authority on which we had hearings before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  It is appropriate that amendment No. 13 provides for such a committee "as may be designated by the Minister".  Given the changes we have seen in committee structures, even in the past 12 months, it is more appropriate to say that rather than specify a particular committee at this stage.  I welcome the amendment and the principle behind it.</p></speech>

Indecisiveness or conditionality surrounds the word &quot;may&quot;.  We are talking about an officer of the State charged with most important duties which are being exercised expeditiously.  Why, therefore, do we use the word &quot;may&quot;?  Why is there doubt or conditionality about the issue.  If it appears to the Ombudsman her investigations are needed, she has the full authority of this House to carry them out.  There should be no unnecessary indecision.</p></speech>

The effect of Senator Barrett's amendment would be that the Ombudsman, having carried out a preliminary examination, would not be able to exercise any discretion over whether to continue on to a full investigation.  She would be obliged to always investigate administrative actions taken by or on behalf of a reviewable agency, even where she felt such an investigation was unwarranted.  I do not believe that is the Senator's intention.  We must leave the discretion to the Ombudsman to carry out a preliminary investigation and, at her sole discretion, to determine whether a full investigation is merited by that case, rather than let her carry out an investigation and even where a full investigation is not merited, be obliged by law to continue with one.  That would be wasteful.</p></speech>

When one reads the entire section, one sees there are quite a number of provisos in terms of when the Ombudsman "may" investigate or "shall not investigate unless" and so on.  To include "shall" as suggested by this amendment would be unduly prescriptive in terms of the Ombudsman's powers.</p><p>We are debating three amendments together.  Amendment No. 16 is very helpful as it clarifies that the Ombudsman, in deciding whether to have an investigation, may do so &quot;on her own motion or on foot of a communication from a person who is not, in respect of the complaint, an eligible person or a person referred to&quot;.  This clarifies that the Ombudsman can make this decision on her own motion or on foot of a communication from another person.  This broadens the scope.  Therefore, we are better off leaving the discretion less fettered and retaining the careful circumstances in which the Ombudsman may or may not investigate.</p></speech>

In 2012 the European Union is marking the 50th year of the CAP.  The historical influence of Ireland's membership of the EU, the subsequent participation in the CAP and its impact on the farming sector cannot be exaggerated.  Since its inception, farmers have been the main beneficiaries of direct EU funds, which amount to 40% of the total EU budget.</p> <p>The CAP was introduced as a means of securing food production in Europe while alleviating the pressures on the farming community and farm incomes.  The direct payments scheme allowed many to remain on the land at a time when emigration and urbanisation were becoming the norm.  However, just as reform was necessary in 1992 as a consequence of Internal Market disintegration and growing food mountains, the impact on the external economic environment and social and technological pressures necessitate reform today.</p><p>I wish to address some of the areas of reform outlined by the Minister, particularly the proposed changes to direct payments and the introduction of the greening element.  The Commission proposes that 30% of future direct payments be used as greening measures.  The farming sector is acutely aware of the effect of climate change and is more vulnerable to it than most sectors.  It directly affects soil quality and consequently has an impact on output and livelihoods.  As the pressure to respond to increased demand for food continues, we cannot allow our basic input resources to degrade to a state from which they cannot recover.  The successful integration of such policy may contribute to improved soil conservation and secure food production.  In addition, it would address the wider societal concerns in respect of food security and food safety.  Those concerns are best addressed under one common policy with a pooled use of resources.  However, in addressing environmental challenge, the burden of compliance must not be so onerous as to constrain output.</p><p>I support the Minister in seeking manageable proportions of direct payment to be attributed to the greening element and support him in his call for streamlined integration of the policy into cross-compliance requirements under a single scheme.  Any further administrative burdens on farmers should be limited.</p><p>I wish to consider the proposed changes to the structures and methods of distribution of the direct payments, which I have no doubt formed a significant part of the reform discussions.  I am aware that the funds attributed to the CAP form part of the multi-annual financial framework discussions, but as agriculture is our largest indigenous industry it is vital that this country maintain a strong negotiating position to ensure strong overall funding for the CAP.</p><p>This country has benefited by more than €44 million in direct payments under the CAP, and direct payments form the basic annual income for many farmers.  The current funding levels to this country should be maintained.  Any proposal to reform the levels and method of distribution of payments are a key concern.  The Commission has proposed changes to the operation of direct payments by which entitlements would be allocated at a flat national or regional rate.  However, such a system would fail to take into account the unique element of national farming systems, which should form the overarching basis on which the payment is made.  It is important to ensure that any changes to direct payments be accompanied by a transitional period and that maximum flexibility be given to member states in determining a payment system that is best suited to their national farming industry.</p><p>In respect of pillar 2 reforms, I am disappointed by the lack of detail brought forward by the Commission on the distribution of the funds.  I agree with the Minister that pillars 1 and 2 should be considered together, as the aims of one complement the other in supporting a sustainable agriculture sector under one common policy.  As the Minister and Members of the House are aware, I come from a rural constituency which has directly benefited from pillar 2 as a means of supporting rural life.  As two thirds of Irish farmers are classified as rural, that is an important element of the agriculture sector.  The supports have alleviated the pressures of urbanisation and migration from the land while increasing land competitiveness and improving the quality of life in rural areas.  Rural development plans have been instrumental in creating employment, promoting tourism and maintaining national identity in rural areas.  I support the Minister's aim to move away from the objective criteria proposal, which would fail to take into account significant local factors.  Simplification must be reflected in any changes to rural development funding.  The objective of sustainable management of natural resources and climate action under pillar 1 is an equally important feature of pillar 2 reforms.  I welcome the stated intention to retain those objectives.</p><p>The restoration, preservation and enhancement of the national ecosystem into the future must be actively promoted.  However, any environmental protection measures must not lose sight of the need to protect the social viability of agriculture.  Special attention must be given to the revitalisation of rural areas, many of which rely heavily on agriculture for employment.  Census 2011 figures show the farming sector has one of the lowest unemployment rates.  In supporting rural economies and creating an incentive for farmers to remain in production, the agriculture sector can play a vital role in the Europe 2020 strategy and the Food Harvest 2020 programme.</p><p>I welcome the discussion on young farmers.  There is little benefit in the promotion of sustainable farming methods without putting in place measures to support those who are expected to adhere to the standards in the future.  We had a good meeting this morning with Macra na Feirme, and we have taken on board a number of the views expressed at the meeting.</p><p>We are all aware of the importance of agriculture to the economy and the growing significance it can have in leading the economy back to growth.  Modern CAP reforms are driven primarily by external factors, as European farmers compete with heavily subsidised producers from emerging markets with less stringent production rules.  The reforms will enable European agriculture to better respond to environmental and climate change and sustain it far into the future, in contrast to other markets which may continue to rely on intensive farming methods and will be less able to adapt.</p><p>World population growth is outstripping food supply.  The UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that food now costs 39% more than it did last year.  Sustainable farming methods will ensure that the European agriculture sector has the ability to respond to these demands.  I again thank the Minister for coming to the House.  I understand his schedule is busy as a consequence of the ongoing discussions on the CAP.  This country has a unique opportunity to bring its influence to bear on the outcome of the new CAP programme during its EU Presidency, which will start next year.  I wish the Minister the best of luck in negotiating the best possible outcome for farmers in the future.</p></speech>

I was not booing either.</p><p>The Minister has achieved a great deal since he became Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in 2011.  He is widely recognised as a dominant voice in Europe on CAP reform, especially in respect of proposals for an alternative to the Commissioner’s preferred new payment method of a flat-rate payment, negotiating flexibility on greening and support for younger farmers.  He has done that through a mastery of policy and the hard graft of politics, holding endless rounds of bilateral meetings with fellow European agriculture Ministers.  I note that against the odds he secured funding last week for a new €20 million AEOS.  Severe pressure was put on him by the troika.  He has achieved a great deal in difficult times.</p><p>It is worthwhile to reflect on the previous Government’s efforts on agriculture when Fianna Fáil held the agriculture Ministry.  Among the measures taken by Fianna Fáil in 2009, many of which the party is seeking to be restored in today's amendment, were the suspension of the early retirement scheme in the budget; the suspension of the young farmer installation aid scheme; the halving of the suckler cow welfare scheme; a €34 million, 14%, cut in disadvantaged area payments; an 8% cut in forestry premiums; a 2% income levy for growers of forestry; the cessation of pruning and shaping grants; the end of supports for the fallen animal collection scheme; the closure of REPS 4 to 30,000 REPS 3 farmers and a cut in REPS 4 payments by 17% for 29,000 farmers; the introduction of carbon taxes; and the cutting of grants to the national co-operative farm relief services.  The Fianna Fáil amendment contains many specifics.</p> <p>Many of these proposals are what we would like to achieve but if the amendment is agreed today it would tie the Minister's hands too much in regard to the CAP negotiations.</p><p>In the motion I welcome that the Seanad is united in its main principles on the CAP.  I fully endorse the ambitions for a positive outcome to the MMF negotiations which will deliver a properly funded CAP and maintain Ireland's allocation of direct payments for rural development funding.  I agree that a greener CAP should not involve too much red tape - or green tape, if one prefers - and that we need to reinforce the supports to young farmers.  I accept we need a sensible and practical definition of an active farmer.  In regard to supporting the CAP in principle, although the capping proposals currently on the table would not have any impact on Irish farmers, they would cause serious problems for other member states.</p><p>There is no doubt the Minister has had to make cuts but he has done this difficult task with great diligence.  He has consulted with stakeholders and those on the ground, has tackled those who exploit farming grants with token sheep or horses, and has taken great care to reward hard-working productive farmers and those farming in difficult conditions - in other words, active farmers.  The steps the Minister is now taking will yield enormous positive results for Irish farmers, not only in the immediate term but in years to come.  When Ireland assumes the EU Presidency next January his role will be critical, not only for Irish farmers but for those throughout the European Union.  He will be very influential in a powerful position and I have no doubt that farmers across Europe will feel confident the future of European agriculture will be in safe hands when the Minister plays a leading role in 2013.  </p><p>I reiterate my formal seconding of the motion.</p></speech>

I hope Senator O'Neill knows a little more about hurling because he seems to have some amnesia around what happened during the last spell in government when agriculture was supported in every way possible.  It was the European Commission that inflicted the situation of cuts whereby the REPS had to end.  That was one of the best schemes in the country.

The Minister will represent this country in those negotiations in Europe and will have our full support in that regard.  It is not our intention to divide the House but we intend to raise some of the concerns which, as the Minister knows, face farms and farmers throughout the country.</p><p>Irrespective of what has been said, the template and blueprint to drive agriculture in Ireland was published in 2009 under the stewardship of the former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, when a 20-person committee under the stewardship of Dr. Brady was established.  That report, the Food Harvest 2020 template, was adopted in this programme for Government and will drive the future of Irish agriculture between now and 2020.  The report seeks to increase the value of primary output in the agrifood, fisheries and forestry sector by €1.5 billion, which would represent a 33% increase when compared with average figures for the period 2007-09.</p><p>Without going into the detail of the Food Harvest 2020 report, as we only have few minutes, I wish to outline some of the concerns in regard to the current CAP negotiations that are taking place.  We would obviously hope the CAP would remain broadly around the figure of €1.25 billion per annum for the Irish national envelope over those years.  A debate is taking place in Europe, with thousands of amendments tabled in the European Parliament.  The Parliament has not agreed the multi-annual financial framework for 2014-20 and we need to see a commitment in regard to CAP expenditure for 2013 levels, which was €371 billion.  The Parliament must agree on the financial measures and this will be critically important for the future of the industry in Ireland.  We fully support the Minister in any negotiations he is undertaking in conjunction with our MEPs.  Under the new arrangements, MEPs have a co-sharing of power whereby MEPs in the Council of Ministers have an influential role in regard to the future of the CAP negotiations.</p><p>The 30% greening pillar is a cause of concern.  My party is particularly concerned that this would add further bureaucracy and red, or green, tape to Irish agriculture, especially because of the costs associated with meeting the greening measures, which are anticipated to be in the region of €15 per hectare.  That would place an additional burden on Irish agriculture at a time when many farmers are struggling.  Take, for example, tillage farmers and the difficulties they have experienced this year, coupled with livestock farmers, whether in sheep, beef or dairy, when many animals were kept in during the summer months due to the difficult weather conditions the farming sector experienced.  That situation will push up feed costs and increase scarcity of feed.  Many farmers have lost crops.  Measures must be built in to ensure these farmers are supported both prior to and post 2013.</p><p>Time is scarce and I do not wish merely to read a script but want to touch on a number of issues.  I welcomed the announcement regarding AEOS and issued a statement to that effect last week.  However, we were all hoping it would have been at the levels approved by the previous Government - €5,000 instead of €4,000 and applying to 10,000 farmers instead of 8,000.  I appreciate we are in a difficult economic climate at present but notwithstanding that we have to support smaller farmers, particularly those who are now struggling to survive.  The alternative for many of those farmers is to go on the farm assist scheme or on social welfare.  I know thousands of small farmers along the west coast of Ireland who are contemplating leaving the industry because they just cannot afford to meet the costs associated with staying in the sector.  Those farmers must be supported in the new CAP----</p></speech>

Measures must be built in.  The Commissioner has a number of proposals in that regard.  Although I would support some of what the Commissioner is saying we must ensure that active farmers are supported.  We do not yet have a definition of what the Department views as an active farmer and we need some clarity on that issue.  We also need to ensure smaller farmers are supported.  All the talk is about active farmers and large agrifood businesses and we all support those people because they provide productive farming.  However, the smaller farmer also needs to be encouraged and supported to stay on the land.</p></speech>

We must ensure those farmers are supported in the new CAP funding that is to be earmarked for smaller farmers.  It could be argued that smaller farmers are leaving or under-using the land but we must encourage small farmers to stay in the sector.  The proposed supports in the CAP for younger farmers are very welcome but unfortunately there are no proposals for the 5 million farmers who are retiring across Europe or who anticipate leaving agriculture in the coming months and years.  We should fight for a retirement package for some of the older farmers who may want to leave.  That might encourage them to do so and bring in more young farmers to the land, especially to the poorer holdings.  I am sure my colleague will touch on that.  We will not press this amendment because it would be wrong to divide the House on something as important as the CAP.  We would rather work with the Minister and his officials and with the Department and colleagues to try to get the best outcome for Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-04a.248" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1127" speakername="Denis O'Donovan" time="13:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012100400022#V00100"><p>I formally second the amendment.  I previously wished the Minister, a fellow Corkman, well in his job.  I have always been positive in respect of and supported what he has set out to achieve.  He is involved in one of the most important negotiations - those relating to the new CAP proposals - that has occurred since Ireland joined the then EEC in 1973.  We all want to wear the green jersey but I urge the Minister to be steadfast and strong and ensure that the existing arrangements will not be diluted to the detriment of Irish farming.  In particular, there must be a fully funded CAP budget in respect of pillar 1 and pillar 2.  Senator Ó Domhnaill referred to an annual figure of €1.2 billion for Ireland in this regard.</p><p>Furthermore, the demands of the farming organisations, particularly the IFA, to the effect that the impact of total redistribution be minimised or at least limited in respect of active and productive farmers must be met.  The position with regard to the agrifood sector is extremely encouraging, particularly in light of the fact that it is responsible for exports with a value in the region of €9 billion.  If, however, the outcome from the negotiations does not come close to meeting the expectations of farmers and organisations which represent them, then this will have serious knock-on effects for that sector.  Am I correct in stating that the Minister will be in a position to finalise the CAP negotiations during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in the first half of next year?  The period of our Presidency is going to be important because we will have some control in respect of the negotiations.  Will the CAP negotiating process be concluded by the end of June next or will it fall to another member state to bring it to finality?</p><p>I echo Senator Ó Domhnaill's comments in respect of the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS.  It is not long since there were significant numbers of farmers on the REP scheme.  REPS 3 and 4 are to conclude shortly but many farmers are still involved with them.  The Minister is very familiar with the area I represent and he knows that there are many less well-off farmers there who are dependent on schemes of this nature.  The current proposal relating to the AEO scheme is that there will be a maximum payment of €4,000 to each individual applicant.  That is a long way short of what people were paid ten or 12 years ago.  I accept that the economic climate has changed.  However, if small farmers throughout the country - be they involved in rearing cattle or sheep or engaged in dairy farming - are not supported by means of these schemes and other measures, they will lose their competitiveness and some of them will go out of business.</p><p>I understand that the Government proposes to make cutbacks across various Departments.  I also understand that the average cutback in respect of each Department will be in the region of 3.4%.  There have been reports to the effect that the cutback relating to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine could be as high as 6.5% to 6.6%.  This is a matter of some concern to me and perhaps the Minister will comment on it when he makes his contribution.  As Senator Ó Domhnaill indicated, it is not our intention to be divisive.  We all have the interests of those involved in the agriculture industry and farming at heart.  It is critical, however, that the cutback relating to the Minister's Department should not be any greater than those which will apply in respect of other Departments.  I hope the reports I have heard are mere rumours and that nothing has been written in stone.</p><p>European Union co-financing, on a 50:50 basis, in respect of rural development measures is vitally important.  I hope the Minister will take that fact into account.</p><p>I accept that this matter may not relate directly to the Minister but I am aware, from conversations with my constituents, that there is a concern among those in farming communities regarding the proposal from the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, that capital assets should form part of the assessment relating to the sons and daughters of farmers who wish to attend college.  This would have a massive impact.  There is a myth that people who own some land and a few out-buildings and sheds are in possession of wonderful assets and that these should be taken into consideration when deciding who should receive third level grants.  It must be borne in mind that there is clear evidence available with regard to what farmers earn, particularly as 98% of them make the relevant returns.  Those returns and information relating to their farm management programmes and accounts are what should be assessed when they are applying for third level grants in respect of their children.  It should not be the case that notional values should be attached to 300 acres of mountain land a farmer might own on the Sheep's Head Peninsula or a similar amount of poor farmland he or she might own in the Borlin Valley.</p><p>At meetings of the Cabinet, the Minister should use his height advantage in order to exert pressure on the Minister for Education and Skills in respect of this matter.  The idea that has been put forward is nothing short of mad and it will do huge damage to farming families.  Our agricultural colleges are now full to the brim with young people who want to make a future for themselves in farming or farm-related activities.  That is extremely encouraging but it also gives rise to concern because one is obliged to wonder whether there will be a future for them when they have obtained their diplomas and degrees.</p><p>There is much more I could say but in view of the time constraints involved, I must conclude.  I wish the Minister well with the CAP negotiations, which are critical.  I urge him to stand firm and not flinch when the negotiations are being finalised.  The outcome of those negotiations will signal what is in store for farming during the next decade.</p></speech>

He has been busy up to now and he will be even busier in the coming months.  I welcome the comments from the Fianna Fáil Senators to the effect that while they wish to raise certain matters, there is no particular division among us and that we are all singing from the same hymn sheet.</p><p>It always strikes me as extraordinary that the CAP negotiations appear almost as a footnote in television and radio news programmes or in newspaper reports.  I am amazed by the fact that the concept of the CAP has failed to ignite the public's interest.  The CAP negotiations involve large sums of money and, if Members will excuse the expression, a bit of horse-trading, two things which are pretty dear to most people's hearts.  Central to the CAP is how a massive amount of public money is spent.  I often wonder how this can be seen as boring and how it does not merit significant debate, discussion and argument.  With the exception of a very limited community of people, however, it never seems to give rise to the latter.</p><p>I welcome the opportunity to support the Fine Gael motion, which gives us the chance to begin a debate in respect of the CAP.  It also underlines the centrality of the CAP and the importance of the new proposals to the future prospects and, I hope, prosperity of the country.  It is that important.  Statistics relating to the food industry in this country are always worth repeating, not least because they are very dear to the Minister's heart.  Some 23,000 jobs are linked to the agrifood industry, which has a turnover of €24 billion, is responsible for almost €9 billion worth of exports and gives rise to the purchase of €8 billion worth of materials, most of which are bought in Ireland.  This country is now the largest net exporter of dairy ingredients, beef and lamb in Europe and is the UK's largest supplier of food and drink and this should not be forgotten.  I accept that the Minister does not have a magic wand when it comes to the negotiations and he does not need me or anyone else present to remind him of their importance.</p><p>The Minister is one of that very small group of people for whom - if they every get any time to eat - the CAP is probably breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It is no exaggeration to say that the future development and success of the food industry in Ireland is intricately linked with what will happen in the coming weeks and months.  The co-decision powers of the European Parliament are going to be a significant factor on this occasion.  The latter's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has been vociferous in its support of restoring the proposed cuts to pillars 1 and 2.</p> <p>A German MEP, Albert Dess, recently reminded the Commission that history has shown that when government payments to farms are reduced, food prices automatically increase and consumers suffer from having to pay more, which is not a result that anyone wants.  The IFA is organising a day of action next week to underline the seriousness of the CAP proposals.  In effect, it is reminding us that CAP is not about farmers simply getting a handout - it is a vital support for an indigenous industry.  Despite improvements in management skills, technology, feeds and fertiliser, etc., the agriculture industry is subject to enormous volatility in food commodity pricing, price pressures for inputs and, ultimately, the weather, which remains outside everyone's control.  We have seen this year that the weather can have a vicious and significant impact on farmers in Ireland and throughout the world.</p><p>I know the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been organising its approach to the CAP proposals for many months.  I understand the Minister has heard many varied submissions from interested parties.  It is obvious that the agreement is complex.  I pay tribute to the departmental officials who have dedicated enormous time, effort and experience to these vital negotiations and will continue to do so.  The word &quot;experience&quot; will really come into play during Ireland's Presidency of the EU next year.  We should not forget that other countries will be turning to Ireland because they know our officials can use their experience to close a deal.</p><p>I would like to make a few comments on pillar 2 - rural development - of the CAP.  I am sure the Minister has been repeatedly urged to ensure those who benefit from direct payments are productive farmers and to pay a great deal of caution to the so-called &quot;flattening effect&quot;.  I urge him to ensure the ultimate negotiation on these CAP proposals does not result in factory farms in Ireland.  Such large-scale entities are run as businesses.  They are not really part of our communities because they are not in tune with the ethos of the way Irish farming has developed.  There must be an appropriate middle ground that reflects the way Irish people live and work.  Over 40% of the population lives and works in rural areas.  The stated objectives of pillar 2 are to enhance the economic viability of agriculture through investment and modernisation, to preserve the rural environment in the countryside and to support the wider rural economy.  These issues are at the heart of what the CAP is about.  We have to make sure we value the role our rural community plays in sustaining the farming community.  As the world moves towards greater urbanisation, we have to ensure the role of our farmers in underpinning and protecting the environment is strengthened, supported and encouraged.  Equally, we need to value the unique role agriculture has played in Ireland's growth and development over recent decades.  Like my colleague, Senator Comiskey, I am concerned about the lack of detail on pillar 2.  Perhaps the Minister will be in a position to comment on that when he addresses the House.</p><p>I join other Senators in taking this opportunity to encourage the Minister to argue for a reasonable budget that is 50:50 co-financed.  That is needed to ensure that people in rural communities, including farmers, can continue to be sustained.  As the Minister and his officials make their arguments during the negotiations, they will draw strength from Ireland's past performance.  I refer, for example, to the strong uptake of key initiatives like REPS, AEOS, the young farmers' installation scheme and the Leader programme.  The money that is spent on REPS and Leader projects, in particular, is spent locally on goods and services.  Leader initiatives have begun to open up rural enterprise.  In the next five years, we will look to the Leader programme and the REPS to enhance our food and agri-tourism offerings in rural communities.  When I spoke about this issue previously in the House, I said I believed Ireland must develop such offerings and could do so.  They will grind to a halt if rural development funding is seen as less important or is cut in any significant way.  It is true that these enterprises are not on the scale of the international food companies that are driving our exports and Food Harvest 2020 targets.</p><p>In general, small and medium-sized enterprises play a valuable role in creating jobs in this country.  That role is even more significant in rural communities, where the value of their contribution to the social fabric cannot be under-estimated.  Productive, enterprising and forward-thinking farmers who want to invest in their businesses so that they grow need to see continued investment in the agriculture sector.  Direct and indirect investment is needed to give them the confidence to build their businesses.  As Senator Ó Domhnaill said, such steps are necessary to ensure they do not consider leaving the land.  We should not be afraid to say that the social fabric of communities is important.  This value should be considered as having primary importance in the CAP negotiations, which often tend to veer towards the purely financial.  As the mission statement of the Leader programme refers to social inclusion, poverty reduction and economic development, these factors need to be at the centre of the rural development element of the negotiations.</p><p>I am aware that the so-called &quot;greening&quot; issue is terribly technical.  I am sure it will require a lot of arguing.  The core vision of Food Harvest 2020, which involves the production of high quality food from a sustainable agriculture sector, implies and expects that the environmental question will become more crucial and heated in years to come.  Farmers have a key role to play as the main guardians of our natural environment and our ecosystems.  The Common Agricultural Policy needs to reflect that by supporting and encouraging Irish and European farmers to manage their farms and reach their targets without sacrificing the environment.  I know that substantial progress has been made in Ireland.  It is imperative that the greening bar is not set at an impossibly high level for pillar 1 payments, as that could discourage farmers from taking up rural development schemes.  I wonder whether the greening efforts under rural development can be classified for the pillar 1 greening payments.  There are indications that the proposed 7% set-aside requirement might be reduced to a more appropriate 5% requirement.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to respond to that.  The IFA has accurately described Irish farming and the Irish landscape as being akin to a patchwork quilt which completely fails to fit the 7% approach and really does not suit tillage farmers, who would be in the figurative firing line if such a change were made.</p><p>I hope we will have an opportunity to debate the negotiations again as they continue.  As time is short, I will conclude by referring briefly to the least-favoured areas review.  It is important that there is some local flexibility with regard to the changed criteria of so-called &quot;natural handicap&quot;.  While this is one of the smaller aspects of the CAP, obviously it will become quite important.  I suspect that the lands which may be reclassified will not have changed dramatically - it is just the criteria that will have been changed.  I understand that 75% of our land is classified as less favoured.  There may be some loss to us.  I ask the Minister to take that into account.  I wish the Minister well as he continues with these difficult negotiations and urge him to put our rural communities to the fore in his conversations and persuasions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-04a.251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012100400023#W00200"><p>The Minister is very welcome.  I am pleased to see him.  I am glad he will take charge of this matter in the next few months.  I have every confidence in him.  He did a great job during the fisheries negotiations.  I am confident that he will do the same during the negotiations on CAP reform.</p><p>We need to frame agriculture in terms of our overall economic recovery.  I have looked at one or two particular countries.  Politicians in New Zealand understand that their country's economic growth depends on innovation and value-added food production.  They know that New Zealand must be an international leader in that field.  We must get inspiration from New Zealand.  I am impressed by what has been done in other countries, particularly New Zealand.  While it is fashionable to talk about high-tech industry, our strength lies in agriculture.  We seem to be running behind countries like New Zealand in terms of coming up with new food products and promoting research and development in this sector.</p><p>It is amazing to consider the benefits of the CAP.  Between 1973 and 2008, Irish farmers received almost €44 billion under the Common Agricultural Policy.  Given the success of some farmers in Ireland and the inequity in CAP - I accept that some farmers rely on these payments - there is a great need for CAP reform.</p><p>The inability of farmers around the world, particularly in developing countries, to compete with European farmers who receive such large subsidies presents us with a real moral dilemma.  We have to move away from protectionism.  We must ensure farmers are business-led when it comes to their own products.  New Zealand has been very successful despite the provision of little support through farm subsidies.  The effect of the Chinese market has to be acknowledged.  Between 2009 and 2011, more than half of gross farm receipts in Norway, Switzerland and Japan came from support policies.  The equivalent figure for producers in Australia, Chile and New Zealand was less than 5%.  We have to acknowledge that subsidies for farmers and farming are decreasing throughout the world.  Irish farmers cannot live in a bubble and assume things will continue on the current basis.</p> <p> I am glad the Minister is working towards a situation where farmers on lower incomes will earn more.  He has stated that he is pushing for CAP reforms which will see the highest earning farmers lose part of their single farm payment.  However, lower earners would gain and those in the middle would stay close to the current average payment of &#8364;275 per hectare.  It would be a compromise between the European Commission's wish for flat rate payments per hectare and the more limited redistribution being sought by Ireland.</p><p> Ireland will play a vital role in the formulation of the new CAP up to 2020, given that Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union for the six months starting in January 2013.  This time period will determine what kind of CAP there will be up to 2020.  It seems it is likely to be a very different CAP from what Commissioner Ciolos envisages.  I support his wish that the new CAP will involve less paperwork and red tape.  That is vital for any business, not just for farmers.</p><p> I also welcome the drive towards more transparency and welcome the fact the European Commission has just adopted a proposal designed to apply new rules with regard to the publication of information to better inform citizens on the benefits and beneficiaries of European agricultural funds.  The new rules require member states to publish the first and last names of beneficiaries, as well as the reasons they obtained the funds.  EU member states were already required to publish some data on line by April every year, but pro-transparency groups, like the NGO <i>farmsubsidy.org</i>found that many regularly failed to provide comprehensive details on how the money is spent, who receives it and why.  Just last May, <i>farmsubsidy.org</i>ranked Luxembourg the least transparent, while others such as Ireland, France, Italy and the Netherlands have created online databases which are extremely hard to navigate.  This is far from ideal.  There is a real need for a simple website in order that citizens can see clearly how funds are being spent.  They will have more confidence in the process if this happens.</p><p> There are still massive stories of fraud, both anecdotal and concrete.  OLAF, the European Union's anti-fraud office, recovered &#8364;691 million in stolen funds from the EU budget in 2011, of which &#8364;524.7 million had been siphoned off from Structural Funds.  Approximately &#8364;113 million was drawn from customs and another &#8364;34 million from EU agricultural subsidies.  The new rules will not apply to small farmers or small land holders, in order to safeguard personal privacy.  While I am aware of a European Court of Justice judgment on the matter, if a farmer receives any subsidies, the public has a right to know.  We need to publish all of this information.</p><p> Agriculture is proving to be one of the country's major success stories at this difficult time.  We have so much potential in this area as can be seen from the fact that numbers attending agricultural colleges are increasing and when we consider that we supply baby formula worldwide.  However, we need more investment in new agricultural techniques and to consider areas like food research.  Can we attract more foreign direct investment to make Ireland a centre of excellence in food research to complement our world-class produce?  Consider, for example, that Swiss food giant Nestlé employs 5,000 people directly on research and development and has 28 research centres across the world.  I am involved with the Institute of Food and Health at UCD which is doing marvellous work.  I suggest we should establish similar centres, like the Swiss have done, or attract them here with incentives.  Surely we should not be outsourcing our agriculture industry, given the raw material we have here.</p><p> Why are our universities not doing more?  I am very impressed by what is taking place in the Institute of Food and Health in UCD, but we could do more.  For example, Massey University in New Zealand now has more than 400 agrifood researchers, 2,000 hectares of farmland and a history of innovation.  The university aims to focus on forming strategic partnerships around the world and on expanding its agrifood business opportunities.  We are not doing enough on this here and could do a lot more.</p><p> The reform of the CAP is vital for us, especially in areas like the dairy sector.  The Minister will not get much sleep in the next while, but I encourage him to continue his work for reform.  In 2015, the European milk quota system will be abolished, which will allow the sector to grow further.  It is amazing to consider that Ireland is the No. 1 exporter of baby formula in the world.  One in seven children in the world now drink products manufactured in Ireland.  I hope the Government's work in this area will help to ensure the continued growth of the agrifood sector in the context of the growing demand from regions such as Asia.</p><p> We must listen to the customer and adapt our agricultural produce to that demand.  The New Zealand dairy company, Fonterra, makes products specifically for the Chinese market.  Are companies in Ireland trying this approach?  If not, we should do something to encourage it.  As dairy consumption goes through the roof, Fonterra is establishing farms in China.  Our dairy products are the best in the world, but we seem to be lagging far behind in exploring these emerging markets.  Fonterra<i></i>is the largest dairy company in the world.  If we had a joined-up dairy sector, we would be able to compete with it.  We already have some success stories in that regard.  However, we must do more.</p><p> We must really consider how developing countries can help Ireland.  China's Vice-Premier visited Spain last year and said that if each of the 1,300 million Chinese people consumed a bottle of olive oil or enjoyed a few glasses of wine, all of Spain's annual production would probably not be sufficient to meet the demand.  This is a real reminder of the opportunities and of what could be done.  The fact we have a good relationship with China since Mr. Li was here and since the Minister went to China last year, where I gather he established a strong relationship, means the door is open for us to be able to do even better.</p><p> I congratulate the Minister on what he has done and wish him every success in the CAP negotiations.  We have put the authority in the right hands in giving it to him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-04a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012100400024#X00200"><p>I thank the Seanad for having this debate.  We need an equally comprehensive debate on this issue in the Dáil in the not too distant future.  Perhaps, too, we should have another debate on the CAP as the negotiations develop during the Irish Presidency or before it.  I wish to focus on the CAP rather than respond to the budgetary issues on AEOS and so on.  We can deal with them on another day.</p><p>I will try to provide the context for this debate and Senator Quinn's contribution raises some questions to which I would like to respond.  If we compare Ireland to New Zealand and ask why it has seen such success, innovation and expansion and why we have had limited success in some measurement of our industry, there are some clear answers.  Back in 1983, before quotas were introduced into the European Union, Ireland and New Zealand had similar sized dairy industries.  Both countries produced 5 billion litres of milk per year.  We had approximately the same number of farmers, the same amount of land available for grass and similar climates.  Since then, because Ireland had to operate under a quota system, we still produce just 5 billion litres per year in terms of volume production from dairy farms.  New Zealand has made a transition and now produces 18 billion litres of milk per year.  That transition has not been smooth, however.  There have been problems in farming communities in New Zealand.  There are debt problems and many dairy farmers are working for the bank.  Many Irish people are aware of what that feels like.</p><p>It is true we have a lot to learn from New Zealand, but we have a lot to teach it also. Consider what the Irish dairy industry has achieved since the mid-1980s, when it has been restricted from expansion and growth and achieving economies of scale and all of the other efficiencies Fonterra has managed to deliver in New Zealand.  Because we have not been able to increase volume, we have focused on adding value.  That is the reason companies, like Carbery Group in Cork, are now producing some of the top sports nutrition drinks in the world.</p> <p>That is why Kerry Group had to leave Ireland to grow and expand.  It is now the largest company on the Irish Stock Exchange, employing 24,000 people in 70 countries, with a turnover of $5 billion per year.  In Ireland our dairy system has been operating in the straitjacket of a quota system in Europe, which now looks like a totally flawed policy.  However, at the time, we had to create an artificial market for milk in Europe, limiting supply to drive demand and drive prices up because it was more expensive to produce milk in Europe and we could not compete with world prices.  We created a false, protectionist, artificial market.  That made political sense at the time, even though I had some difficulty with that thinking.  That was the reasoning at the time and I can understand it.  The reasoning now needs to be totally different.  We have agreed that in April 2015 quotas will go.  They will be replaced by contractual relationships between farmers and their co-operatives or processors and we will see quite dramatic growth over a relatively short space of time.</p><p> The notion that Ireland has not driven innovation in the food industry because of subsidies at a European level is flawed.  Kerry Group, to take an example, is probably the No. 1 food ingredients company on the planet, in terms of its customer base.  Glanbia is rapidly moving down the added-value track.  Big multinational food companies like Nestlé, Danone and Abbott have chosen to come to Ireland to produce and manufacture infant formula, which is the most sensitive product there is in terms of safety and quality control.  They have chosen Ireland and approximately 10% of all infant formula is exported from here.</p><p> We have done a lot in terms of innovation but Senators are right that we need to do more.  The food industry in Ireland is moving from being a commodity producer of cheese, skimmed and semi-skimmed milk, beef, sheep meat and so on, to being an added-value, high-end food producer.  Instead of just producing skimmed and semi-skimmed milk we are producing infant formula.  Instead of just producing milk powder, we are producing sports nutrition drinks.  Instead of just simply selling milk in either liquid or powder form, we are taking content from milk, like whey, and putting it into new products such as muscle-building formula and so forth.  All of these things are happening.  That is why so many young people are choosing courses in human nutrition, sports nutrition, dairy science, food science and agricultural science and going to agricultural colleges.  It is not because they all want to be farmers but because they see a really dynamic, innovative industry in the agrifood and drinks sector.  </p><p> I have not even mentioned the drinks sector yet, which is also changing.  The fastest growing whiskey on the planet is Jameson, which has seen double digit growth in 35 countries recently.  Other well known and successful brands include Baileys and Guinness.  We have a dynamic sector in Ireland, although we do need to do more.  If Senators examine my list of priorities for last year in the budget, where I had to make significant cutbacks, they will see the areas I tried to protect in the context of that reduced expenditure.  I urge Senators to look at what we did in terms of research and innovation funding coming from my Department.  That funding went to universities like UCD and UCC, as well as to Teagasc, Bord Bia and BIM, which are all arms of the State that are trying to promote innovation, new thinking and new research.  They are trying to add science to food production so that rather than Irish food producers going to other parts of the world and claiming that they produce the most sustainable and safe food in the world and asking others to simply believe it because they come from this green island, they are making that claim but also providing the data to back it up.</p><p> By the end of this year we will have 32,000 beef farms in Ireland carbon foot-printed.  We will be able to say to buyers, whether they be in Boston, Berlin or Bangkok, that when they buy Irish beef, not only will they know it is traceable, safe and of high quality but they will also know what greenhouse gas emissions came from the source of that beef.  Bord Bia is rolling that out.  We are about to do the same for the dairy industry.  In the next two years all 18,000 dairy farms in Ireland will be audited in relation to sustainability.  We are the first country to do it.  Most countries are not even thinking about how they might do that.  People are thinking about it within companies but there is no country that has a national plan for added value, sustainability and innovation for a sector.  In New Zealand they are really good at doing it because they have one big dominant company, Fonterra, and they do it as a company.  In fact, they drive a sector as a company.  We have decided to go down a different route, with multiple co-operatives.  While there must be some consolidation in the dairy sector as we move towards an absence of quotas, there is enormous value in having different types of co-operatives and processors in that sector.  Each has gone down slightly different routes in terms of how to add value and how to innovate.  They have all taken different avenues in order to find ways to add value to products that they had not been able to add to, in terms of volume, because of quotas.  </p><p> I am strong defender of the agrifood industry in Ireland in terms of its intent.  It is finding money, even where it is scarce, to invest in research and development.  There is no comparison between the food science courses available in universities in Ireland now and what was on offer ten years ago.  Furthermore, the quality of the students taking those courses, in terms of the points required to gain access, is immeasurably higher.  We have mature companies that are making their mark globally.  We have a new type of student entering the food industry who is driven, bright and wants to make a mark in that industry.  These are students who might have chosen IT, biotechnology or pharmaceutical courses a number of years ago.</p><p> We also have an extraordinary opportunity right now because it just so happens that the products that Ireland is one of the best in the world at producing, along with New Zealand and one or two other countries, namely, dairy products and meat, will be in short supply globally over the next 50 years.  Between now and 2030 the world must produce 50% more food, in volume terms, just to feed itself.  Where will that food come from?  Ireland is already a food exporting country and we have the capacity to produce much more food, from the same resources, and we can do it sustainably, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, water management, protecting biodiversity and so forth.  All of which brings me to the CAP.  </p><p> The CAP is important in the context of the challenge and opportunity for Ireland, in terms of wealth and job creation, as well as growth.  In the last 12 months, employment in the food and agrifood sector has increased by 4%, while almost all other sectors are under constant pressure.  That is not happening by accident.  In terms of the CAP, a deal is required between the producers and consumers of food in Europe.  Consumers in Europe demand high safety standards, good animal husbandry standards, in terms of animal welfare, animal transport and so forth, restrictions on hormone use in animals and on the use of genetically modified organisms, as well as decent working conditions and the protection of labour.  Given all of that, consumers must accept that food produced under those conditions will be more expensive than is the case in those countries that do not have similar consumer demands to meet.  If European consumers want that type of food, they will have to pay for it and they can pay for it in two ways.  They can either support farming through the CAP or they can pay more for food.  The problem with the second option is that food production in Europe becomes relatively more expensive than in other parts of the world and producers cannot compete.  That is why the way to support sustainable food production, in a way that ensures it is competitive <i>vis-à-vis</i>the rest of the world, is by supporting the income of food producers and that is what the CAP is about.  It is not about subsidies linked directly to production - we cannot do that anyway under the world trade rules - but about a recognition that if high production standards are imposed then some form of payment must be provided to producers through the CAP.</p> <p>However, it is about a recognition.  Given that standards are being imposed in terms of production there must be some form of recognition, that is to say, a payment provided for through the CAP.  We have a major job to do since we are a country that relies more on the food industry than any other country in Europe.  In fact, 85% of the European Union funds that come to Ireland are CAP funds.</p><p>We are discussing the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, a seven-year budget that the European Union will, I hope, agree before the end of the year.  For Ireland the CAP element of that framework is more important in comparison with most other countries which have perhaps between 10% and 40% of their overall income from the European Union in the form of CAP.</p><p>This sector is singularly important to Ireland.  We need to ensure that the ambition of the Food Harvest 2020 plan, put together by the previous Government, can be realised and CAP is central to supporting this in terms of allowing farmers to invest, expand, grow and modernise and to do all of that within the restrictions imposed on them by EU directives and national legislation relating to the quality control and traceability which they must buy into.</p><p>There is a series of technical discussions going on in respect of the CAP.  By the way, I am pleased to accept the Fianna Fáil amendment.  It adds to the discussion.  It is unfortunate that Fianna Fáil has decided to refer to the suckler cow welfare scheme at the end and I am unsure why this was done because that is a different debate.  Fianna Fáil believes it is a national scheme.  It is not part of the CAP reform negotiations and not for debate today, so why is it in the motion?  Anyway, that is for Fianna Fáil to decide.  The other issues outlined are helpful and they are all very relevant.  It is a shame that Fianna Fáil went into such detail, yet said nothing about the strategy that the Government and I are adopting in respect of providing an alternative to the Commission's proposal, which is a flat rate payment for everyone.  We have an alternative proposal under consideration which has got some traction now.  It has signed-up support from five other member states, some of which are significant in size.  It would be helpful to get strong support on this proposal on a cross-party basis, if possible.  I understood I had such support.  Certainly in the Dáil debates in the past I have received support and farming organisations support our stance as well.</p><p>There is a process in respect of how and when we make a decision on the final negotiations on the CAP.  Essentially there are two negotiations going on in tandem.  The first relates to the budget negotiations, the MFF, and these should be decided by Heads of State at the end of November.  There will be a special three or four day Heads of State meeting, being organised by the Council, to try to get the multi-annual financial framework agreed by the end of the year.  This is important because the CAP is very much a part of the negotiating box for the budget discussions.  During the negotiations the Heads of State will decide the total CAP budget for pillar 1 and pillar 2.  More than €1.25 billion comes to Ireland through CAP in direct payments. A further €300 million comes in pillar 2 rural development funding.  At the moment there is considerable pressure coming from countries such as the United Kingdom, Sweden, Germany and others to reduce the overall budget for the EU.  They are seeking reductions in all lines of spending, including the CAP.  We will be strongly resisting it.</p><p>I was pleased to hear the President of the European Parliament strongly resisting this as well when he made his statement today.  He specifically referred to the importance of CAP for Ireland, its importance for food security in the context of what is happening globally and the need for Europe to produce more food.  I offer this figure to reflect on in respect of seafood.  Some 70% of seafood consumed in the European Union is being imported from outside the EU, despite all our technology and resources.  Unfortunately the figures are similar for other agri-foodstuffs.  Even in Ireland, in the case of grain and feedstuffs used for animal feed, we have to import 50%.  We are exposed in that sense.</p><p>This country must protect the CAP budget in the context of any reductions in the overall budget allocation and the Government will do so as best it can.  However, these will be difficult discussions.  I assure the House that my Department will be central to these discussions because of the centrality of the CAP budget in respect of Ireland's interests in the overall budget.  It will be a considerable political challenge to get that job done by November or December but if we can do that it will make the Irish Presidency of the EU somewhat more straightforward in respect of the CAP.  We will be able to focus on finalising the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy, both of which must be finalised.  All countries hope these discussions can be finalised during the Irish Presidency because we have credibility in both of these areas.  This is our seventh Presidency of the EU and we have shown real form in previous Presidencies and an ability to get big things done; this is a big job.  Never before has the CAP been subject to such complex political negotiations.  A total of 27 countries and three institutions, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council, are all centrally involved in finding a compromise.  In the past there were far fewer countries and it was essentially between the Commission and the Council.  I will spend a good deal of time working with the European Parliament as well as with my colleagues in the Council.  I am lucky to be working with high quality MEPs, including Mairead McGuinness, Liam Aylward and others, who are also involved in the CAP discussions.</p><p>That is the process.  Once the MFF is finalised and agreed it will take between three and four months to finalise the details of CAP expenditure in terms of how we allocate and spend the money between and within countries.  If the MFF carries over into the Irish Presidency and is not completed until March then we will be under pressure.  This is the reason I am hopeful that we can get an agreement on the MFF and I hope the money will be decided upon before Christmas.</p><p>I have spend a good deal of time travelling in the past six months.  I have been to London, Berlin, Rome, Budapest, Madrid, Paris, Riga, Limassol, Vilnius, Tallinn, Brussels, Luxembourg and Amsterdam.  I have probably omitted several others.  I have been setting up bilateral meetings with other Ministers to try to understand their red-line issues.  We will not get everything we want.  That is one sure thing we know about these negotiations but no country will get everything it seeks and the Commission will not get everything it wants either.  This will be a compromise and it is my job between now and the end of the year to ensure that everyone understands the Irish red-line issues in order that we can get principled agreement on them before we take the Presidency.  This would mean that by the time I sit in the chair I can focus on trying to pull together all the other concerns into compromises, rather than having to dig my heels in on key Irish issues.  I will do that if I have to and if we have to delay the process then so be it.  However, I am hopeful that we will be able to deal with the key Irish issues in consultation and in robust discussions with the Commission between now and the end of December.</p><p>I will not discuss all the issues in detail but I will offer a flavour of the main issues.  There will be a distribution between member states and this is a big issue for many member states.  We broadly support the Commission's proposals which involve what is termed the approximation model.  In simple terms this means that the Commission will calculate the average payment per hectare throughout the European Union and then they relate different countries to that average payment.  If one country is below the average payment the Commission will move it towards the average and if a country is above the average payment then it makes a contribution towards those who need to increase their payments.  Ireland is more or less on the average and regardless of the levels of redistribution among member states Ireland will be affected but not affected to the extent other countries will be.  That is a safe place to be and that is no accident either in terms of the approximation model.  Ireland pushed the approximation model as the method of calculating how countries will do from the CAP.  The Department is lucky to have really good technocrats working on the CAP and its detailed management.</p> <p> An issue of extreme importance to Ireland - I regard it as a red-line issue - revolves around the requirements on member states with regard to how to distribute direct payments, pillar 1 or single farm payments, within their jurisdictions.  The Commission wants member states to move to a flat-rate, area-based payment that would be based on the average payments which apply in their jurisdictions.  If a national flat rate were introduced in Ireland, approximately 76,000 farmers would gain an average of 86% on their current payments while in the region of 57,000 would lose an average of 33%.  Given that these are averages, some farmers would either stand to gain or lose a great deal more.  Members might say that I, as a politician, should support the proposal in this regard because far more people stand to gain than will lose.  That may be the case but I want to build a bigger, stronger and more profitable industry in this country.  Taking a large amount of money from a relatively small number of people and spreading it out among all of those involved - some of whom may be less productive either through no fault of their own or because they are hobby farmers - would not be a good way to proceed.</p><p>Redistribution is needed.  Those who earn the largest amounts from single farm payments need to lose some money and this must be given to the lower earners to ensure that we can move towards an average payment.  However, we must manage this process in a way that will not dramatically undermine the commercial heart of farming.  We must also use rural development funds in order to ensure that we can continue to supplement the incomes of farmers who do not have the capacity to make large amounts of money from the marketplace, either as a result of where their farms are located or the size of their properties.</p><p>There is a need to get the balance right and we have put forward an alternative proposal in respect of this matter.  Ironically, the latter incorporates the Commission's proposal regarding the redistribution of money between member states and gives countries which want to use the alternative model the option of redistributing such money within their own jurisdictions.  In other words, there would be an average payment per farmer per hectare.  What would happen then would be that we would identify what would be 90% of that payment and we would move everybody up towards it by 30%.  This would be paid for by everyone above the average.  I accept that this sounds complex but essentially it means that all of those involved would be moved towards the average.  The highest earners will contribute most and the lowest will gain the most.</p><p>As I informed the Commissioner, we have discovered a political solution to redistributing funds between member states.  In that context, everyone accepts that, for all sorts of reasons, member states cannot be on the same payments per hectare.  We would like to be in a position to adopt the same approach in respect of solving a difficult problem within member states.  In other words, we suggest that member states would have the option of redistributing funds within their own jurisdictions.  Portugal, Spain, Italy, Denmark and Luxembourg have given us their written support in this regard.  In addition, we have received principled support from France.  Countries such as Belgium and Austria have problems which are similar to ours and have suggested a slightly different solution in the context of how these can be resolved.</p><p>I am trying to negotiate a compromise with the Commissioner.  The ultimate solution probably rests somewhere between his proposals and ours.  We want to achieve an understanding in respect of granting flexibility to countries which simply cannot move to a flat-rate, area-based payment without destroying productive agriculture in their jurisdictions.  If what is proposed were to happen in the timescale envisaged, then productive agriculture in this country would certainly be destroyed.  The Commissioner has put forward clear arguments as to why he wants the structures he is proposing to be accepted and I have made clear arguments as to why I am seeking something different.  As a result, we are engaging in a mature political discussion with regard to how we might resolve our differences.  For the reasons I outlined earlier, I would certainly like to be able to have those differences resolved before the end of the year.</p><p>We are much more in sync with the Commission in respect of greening.  It is important that consumers be aware of the fact that there is a measurable and real greening element to direct payments.  At the same time, we must ensure that what we do in this area is implemented in a way which will not cost either farmers or member states a great deal of money and time.  The European Court of Auditors assessed the Commission's proposals in respect of the overall reform of the CAP and predicted that it would cost member states approximately 15% more to implement the new policy than it had to implement the existing one.  That is completely unacceptable.  What is required here is simplification.  Greening measures that are easy for farmers to understand and easy for member states to implement must be brought forward.  At the same time, those measures must provide real value in the context of sustainability, protecting the environment, etc.</p><p>The current proposals from the Commission in respect of the greening measures need to be amended.  However, the principle behind them is acceptable.  The Commission is proposing that in order to qualify for 30% of one's single farm payment, one will be obliged to fulfil three criteria as follows: to protect permanent pasture rather than ploughing it up; to have at least three crops in one's fields if one has more than four ha of arable land; and to devote at least 7% of one's farm holding to what is termed an &quot;ecological area&quot;.  The position with regard to such ecological areas will be somewhat different to that which applies in respect of set-aside because one will be in able to include forestry, hedgerows, wetlands and so forth.  Many farmers already qualify in respect of these three criteria but we are seeking to have them amended.  It is farcical that one would be obliged to grow three crops in a parcel of land measuring four ha.  For arable farmers, this would make no sense.  As a result, I am of the view that the threshold in respect of the amount of land involved will have to be dramatically increased.  The Commission has already stated that ten ha would be more appropriate, we are seeking that it be increased to 15 ha and the European Parliament is of the view that it should be 20 ha.  The debate in this regard is moving in the right direction but work remains to be done.</p><p>Steps are being taken to protect permanent pasture because very small percentages of most countries overall agricultural land is devoted to such pasture.  In Ireland, 85% of our land is in permanent pasture.  There are specific issues which we would like to discuss with the Commission in respect of permanent pasture but we agree with the principle involved.</p><p>The most important point in the context of greening relates to the concept of something being &quot;green by definition&quot;.  A farmer who is operating within an AEO or a REP scheme is already being paid for farming in a sustainable and environmentally acceptable way.  As a result, his or her activities should be green by definition and he or she should automatically receive his or her green payment rather than being obliged to comply with a lesser set of rules, complete additional forms, etc.  The latter would be a waste of time and money.  If what a farmer is doing is clearly sustainable and if his or her activities are being measured to that effect through pillar 2 payments - as is the case with the environmental schemes that are in place - then we would make the case, and we are supported by many other countries in this regard, that what he or she is doing is green by definition and that he or she should get his or her payments.  This is one of the reasons I was so anxious to launch another AEO scheme.  In light of the amount of money available, I placed a limit of €4,000 on the amount of money individual farmers can access in order to maximise the number of farmers who can avail of that scheme.  I could have put in place a limit of €5,000 but fewer farmers would have been involved as a result.  We are trying to encourage as many farmers as possible to consider sustainable farming and to help them to qualify for what may in the future be a green-by-definition compromise.  However, the eventual position in this regard remains to be agreed.</p><p>We strongly support the Commission's proposal to the effect that member states should be mandated to set aside 2% of single farm payment funds for the purposes of issuing top-up payments to young farmers in order that they might be encouraged to farm, invest, expand and grow.  Before the Commission drew up its proposal, Ireland and Hungary pushed really hard in respect of this matter.  The Commission eventually agreed with us.  Organisations such as Macra na Feirme and others have exerted pressure with regard to this matter and they were right to do so.</p><p>Pillar 2 funds apply in respect of rural development.  There are many supports in place in this regard, including disadvantaged area payments - which were hugely important to Ireland in the past and still have a role to play - REPS payments, targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, suckler cow welfare schemes and Leader programmes.  We really have no idea with regard to the proposals that are going to be put forward in the multiannual financial framework, MFF, discussions in respect of the way in which pillar 2 funds should be distributed.</p> <p>It is very concerning and it is very deliberate.  We have a pretty clear picture of what direct payments will look like in terms of the new budget but pillar 2 moneys have been left to be decided on the basis of what are called objective criteria, which means different things to different countries.  Essentially, what has been left is a political bargaining chip because member states will have to come up with an overall compromise on the budget between structural funds, which are regional funds, CAP pillar 1 and pillar 2 and research and development funds.  That will be part of the mix in terms of the budget individual countries get.  We must box clever on that. </p><p> What would be totally unacceptable for this country would be for us to lose on both pillars 1 and 2.  We are probably going to lose a little bit on pillar 1 money, but not as much as some other countries.  We cannot accept losing on both pillars.  If we were to measure how countries are doing on pillar 2 allocations, based on the same criteria used for pillar 1, we are well below the average.  That is because we are a more developed country than many of the newer member states.  That said, countries that are well below the average should not lose even further on pillar 2.  We will fight hard to retain those budgets because they are hugely important for a lot of the farmers the Senator expressed concern about.  Other Senators have expressed concern, in particular about farmers in disadvantaged areas and in severely disadvantaged parts of disadvantaged areas who also need to exist.</p><p> I could also go through market support measures.  In general, this country should adopt an approach whereby there should only be intervention if there is a crisis rather than trying to have intervention too early in which case the Commission essentially sets prices.  Anyway, it will not do it because it will not be allowed to do it.  Essentially, what we are talking about are such issues as intervention, export refunds and aids to private storage, in particular on the dairy side from a butter point of view which works very well for us because it balances out the seasonality of milk production.  What we need is a safety net in Europe because if we have a repeat of 2009 which saw a collapse in milk price, it can trigger a mechanism to stop the collapse in price and allow the industry to recover over time.</p><p> There are also other market support measures that have existed in the past which need to go such as sugar quotas, for example.  We are a strong supporter of the Commission&#8217;s proposal to do away with sugar quotas in 2015, but that is unlikely to happen because the politics of sugar is that countries that have quotas at the moment are making a lot of money from them and they are going to try to hang onto them for as long as they can.  It is my job in the context of a post-2015 compromise or arrangement to make sure that this country does try to carve out for itself an opportunity to get back into the sugar industry if it wants to and if it makes commercial sense to do so.  What I mean by that is trying to access quota should the quota system be extended.</p><p> I hope I have given Members some food for thought.  I invite and encourage anyone who wants to know the detail of any one of the sectors that are being discussed and debated at the moment to contact my office.  We have high quality people involved in the CAP negotiations.  I have not come across a country, regardless of size, that has better people working on CAP than I have.  If anyone wants a briefing on why we have taken the position we have taken, he or she should just ask for it and we will give it.</p><p> I am also organising public meetings around the country, one in each province, in the next few weeks.  We are doing it in conjunction with the <i>Irish Farmers&#8217; Journal</i>and the IFA.  I would encourage Members to come along if they want to.  It is important to get an open discussion going because if we do not have a national discussion on an issue of such importance that impacts on the everyday income of 130,000 farm families, then rumours take hold and I do not want to allow that to happen.  I would rather have a frank, open and transparent negotiating period until we come to a final compromise at the end of the day, which I hope will be something people can live with and welcome.</p></speech>

The Minister has also outlined the position in a comprehensive fashion, which is his <i>modus operandi.</i>  I welcome the clarification on many of the important issues.  I endorse all that has been said so far in wishing the Minister well.  In particular in the agriculture area, it is about wearing the green jersey, especially in the context of CAP reform negotiations.  I am delighted he is receiving such strong support from our MEPs in the European Parliament which will play a key role in the issue.</p><p>  It is interesting that the Friends of the Irish Environment which issued a statement recently has interesting views on the existing proposals.  It said the Minister is opposed to the provision of 30% of the funds for greening which would benefit extensive rural farmers rather than intensive milk and beef production units.  I am not sure that is exactly what the Minister said.  The Minister corrected the record in that regard.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-04a.261" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1128" speakername="Paschal Mooney" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012100400028#BB00500"><p>When I examined the issue of greening – I am sure the Minister is even more familiar with it than I – I noted that farming organisations worry that the European Commission’s plans to make the CAP more environmentally friendly could leave producers drowning in paperwork.  The Minister referred to the matter.  For example, COPA, which represents European farmers and farm co-operatives says the Commission’s greening proposals would introduce new layers of reporting while threatening farm income by requiring, for example, that 30% of direct payments be linked to greening performance.  That is a more global European view whereas we are somewhat unique in this regard.  The Minister explained that, by definition, in many cases this country would be seen to be green anyway in terms of the second pillar.</p><p>To give the context in which all of this is happening; Teagasc documents that without CAP payments Irish agriculture would have made a loss of approximately €600 million in 2009 and direct payments amounted to approximately €1.8 billion.  A poker game is going on.  Of course the Minister must try to achieve a balance.  I wish him well in that regard.  Again, it seems that in particular in the context of the flat payment the IFA seems to be opposed to it, while Friends of the Irish Environment, to which I referred, called the proposed flattening charge a salvation for the farmers on disadvantaged lands in rural areas, which amounts to 70% of the country’s farmland.</p><p>I echo what my colleague, Senator Ó Domhnaill said.  The Minister acknowledged that there are those who are in disadvantaged areas but some among them are even more severely disadvantaged.  Putting it at its most blunt, the context in which the payments are made will be a transforming boost to rural economies with the payments going directly to small farmers and therefore into local economies supporting towns and villages, schools, post offices and local shops.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that it is not just about productive farming; it is also about the impact on the rural economy.  The balance the Minister must try to achieve is on the one hand to protect and develop the more productive elements of agriculture but at the same time to assist the many farming families, which through no fault of their own, in particular in my part of the country in Connacht and Ulster, rely on farm payments.  In turn that will ensure the survival of local economies.  They keep the post office and small shop open.  The challenge for the Minister in fighting the case in Europe is that perhaps they do not always fully understand the nature of the Irish rural economy and the importance of direct payments.  I wish the Minister well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/seanad/2012-10-04a.262" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1121" speakername="Paul Bradford" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/takes/seanad2012100400028#BB00600"><p>I welcome the Minister.  I enjoyed the debate very much.  I would call it a discussion rather than a debate because of the minimal difference between the Fine Gael motion and the Fianna Fáil amendment.</p> <p>It is fair to say that from an agricultural perspective the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party have always worked closely to ensure the enhancement and advancement of rural Ireland, particularly since our accession to the European Union.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Ministers have represented Irish agriculture on the European stage and they have always worked with a sense of unity and purpose.  That may be a vision of things to come in other fields but that is a debate for another day.</p><p>The Common Agricultural Policy is of fundamental importance not just to Ireland but to Europe, and Senator Susan O'Keeffe was correct when she said it is a wonder there is not more of a national reflection or debate on the concept of the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is fair to say that of all the European policies put in place by the European Union and the former EEC, the Common Agricultural Policy has not just stood the test of time but is the one European policy that has done what it says on the tin.  We should stop apologising and in fairness, since the Minister, Deputy Coveney, took office, apologising for the Common Agricultural Policy has disappeared from the agenda.  The Common Agricultural Policy has fed the Continent of Europe and taken starvation off the agenda.  It has supported and maintained farming families and rural communities and enhanced the European environment.  It has been a very successful programme which we should continue to defend.  I appreciate it takes up a significant proportion of the European budget but it is paying for itself time and again, and will continue to do so.</p><p>I wish the Minister and the other Ministers who represent the country well on the European stage in the coming months when they put together the funding package.  Once that is done - I hope it will be done before Christmas to allow the Minister take charge and finalise the agricultural negotiations - his job will become more difficult because he will have to start squaring circles.  We have debated the options and the Minister has presented to the House an interesting picture of where we are heading.</p><p>In the previous Government the agricultural committee struggled to be realistic in regard to the future funding of the agriculture budget.  The consensus, and it was an unrealistic consensus on the part of all of us, and our official policy was that we did not want any change.  It got us off the political hook but we all knew there would be some degree of change.  However, realism has set in and we know there will be change.  The Minister is trying to ensure that change will be managed and balanced and that we will achieve a reasonable compromise.</p><p>In terms of the success of everything European, in the politics of Europe for the past 50 years compromise has always won out.  We are now heading towards a compromise on this issue.  The Minister stated that there will be a rebalancing in that some at the very top will lose a little or, in some cases, more than a little and those at the bottom will benefit.  That is a reasonable overall approach of which I would be generally supportive.  It is difficult to be specific in three or four minutes but that may be the proper direction in which to head.</p><p>An issue I want to take up with the Minister is the phrase that we must ensure the most productive farmers do not suffer an undue rebalancing.  I agree with him to some extent but many people are not classified as the most productive farmers because the opportunity for them to be the most productive farmers has not arisen.  I want to ensure that we do not permanently categorise a group of farmers as people who cannot be most productive.  I appreciate that is a difficult balance to strike because we are trying to support the commercial farmers who are at the heart of production, and that must be maintained, supported and developed, but we must also look at the tranche of people who may not be producing in the desired quantities to see how we can help them move on to a new phase.  We cannot afford to pull up the drawbridge and leave a certain grouping behind.  Previously, certain policies were designed in that regard but I hope the Minister will try to take that into account.</p><p>The Minister has invested a good deal of time on the export market, and he has been in China.  In the past 40 or 50 years China had its great leap-forward economic programmes.  Irish agriculture has had a number of similar leap-forward programmes including James Dillon and the era of &quot;one more cow, one more sow, one more acre under plough&quot;.  That was probably the first time there was a planned development of Irish agriculture.  We then moved on to our accession to the European Economic Community.  We also had the milk quota regime which, for all its faults, produced certain benefits.  We had Agenda 2000 and the single farm payments.  We are now beginning what is probably the fourth leap forward for which the Minister has responsibility and in which he has a deep personal interest.  I wish the Minister well because he recognises the importance of the decisions he will take.  </p><p>We must try to be fair.  The first objective is securing the budget followed by the distribution of the budget allocations, which we must approach with realism and a spirit of compromise.  We have to ensure that there will be a future in farming not just for what we describe as the most productive sector, which must be protected, but that the farm gate and the farming profession will remain open to new generations.  I regret I do not have more time.  I thank the Minister for his presentation, which was very interesting.  I hope he will be back in the Seanad as the debate continues because we have calm, reflective debates in this House and there are issues we will take up with the Minister again.  I wish him well in the negotiations.</p></speech>

Ionadaithe iad ó eagraíochtaí na bhfeirmeoirí.  It is refreshing to hear a Minister say he will accept one of the amendments from the Opposition.  He might pass on that tip to some of his colleagues because it shows there is a sense of co-operation on these issues.</p><p>Sinn Féin is supporting the Fianna Fáil amendment.  In general terms it sets outs out the basic parameters of where the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy needs to go.  I am glad to see that Fianna Fáil has embraced some of our long-standing proposals including addressing the level of single farm payment and the issue of payments to large corporate beneficiaries but there does not appear to be recognition of this issue in the Fine Gael motion.</p><p>Sinn Féin supports the proposal to limit the amount an individual can claim under the single farm payment and we specifically set that limit at €100,000.  That is the position that we, through our Minister in the Northern Executive, will be proposing in the course of the negotiations.  We also support the proposal to make corporations ineligible for the single farm payment.</p><p>Statistics show that in 2011 just 243 of the more than 123,000 Irish recipients of the payment received more than €100,000, yet that accounts for a significant proportion of the payments that come to Ireland.  We believe that those funds could be better used in supporting small to medium active producers.</p><p>To address that anomaly the definition of an active farmer must be tightened up.  It should be based on agricultural activity rather than on income.  That method would protect the entitlements of landowners or tenants who actively farm the land they own or rent.  It is imperative that as many farmers as possible are supported to ensure that farmers remain an active and vibrant part of rural life in Ireland.  There should be an exclusion of certain categories of business such as airports, companies, golf courses and other corporate bodies.</p><p>We do not as yet have a breakdown of the amount of funding which currently goes to those on the higher payments but it is indicative that in 2007 just over 2,000 of the largest beneficiaries received more than €150 million, which is more than the over 55,000 who received payments of less than €5,000.  That amounted to an average payment of almost €80,000 compared to an average of less than €3,000 for the other group.</p><p>There is clearly something amiss in that and it undermines the CAP's own stated objective as being the maintenance of the European model of farming based on farm households.  Is that working?  The CAP has certainly provided a cushion for farmers here and in other countries but reforms must be weighted in favour of the maintenance of family farming, and from the perspective of this State that must be aligned with a strategy to promote the indigenous sector by capitalising on new opportunities in both food and alternative sectors such as biofuels.</p><p>It is essential also that there is a close working relationship between the Ministers for agriculture in the Twenty-six Counties and the Six Counties during the negotiations, and I know the Minister has a very good relationship with Minister O'Neill.  There is a shared future in agriculture between the North and the South which must be developed.  It is important that both departments work together to further the shared goals of farmers on an all-Ireland basis.  The bottom line in all of this must be that any reform of the CAP serves to keep as many farmers as possible on the land.  Fundamental to all of that - there is common ground between all parties on this - is an adequate budget for the CAP if it is to deliver on its primary objectives.  A reduction in the CAP budget would place a serious constraint on the ability of Irish agriculture to develop and grow.  A strong CAP budget is required to secure the future of Irish jobs.</p><p>There is reference in the criteria to the reform of the greening of the CAP.  It is of course essential that the environment, as well as agriculture, is catered for under the CAP reform proposals.</p> <p>However, the greening element of the single farm payment should not bring undue bureaucracy and restrictions on farmers.  It is essential that the greening actions, with their associated outcomes, be clearly described and capable of verification through simple and deliverable control procedures, while the greening payment remains part of the single farm payment.</p><p>The aging of the farming population is a matter of concern that needs to be addressed in the reforms to encourage the entrance of younger farmers.  Domestic measures, including budgetary provisions for schemes to encourage the transfer of lands, also need to take this into account, rather than becoming an easy victim for cutbacks.  Rural areas are suffering severely from high levels of emigration and there needs to be an adequate level of investment in creating sustainable employment in these areas.  Those who become involved in farming as a new entrant or after taking over the family farm may find that it is capital intensive.  Accordingly, it is important that as much support as possible be provided for these new entrants into agriculture.  Funding should not be restricted to young farmers who have become head of a holding for the first time.  All those who express a serious desire to become involved in agriculture should be given every support to do so.</p><p>It is important simplification is an outcome of the CAP negotiations.  There is little benefit in the policy becoming costly and complicated.  For example, the move from a single payment regime to having as many as six would make the whole process far more complicated than is necessary.  One of the main bugbears of farmers is the level of bureaucracy involved in establishing compliance with regulations.  They do not need anymore.</p><p>Guímid gach rath ar an Aire ina chuid idirbheartaíochta san Eoraip.  Tacaímid leis na bunéilimh atá aige.

In Haggardstown, from where I come, this would be known as &quot;a bit of a row&quot;.  He has also said we will not get everything we want in this review, but it is more important to get everything we need.  As we are in the Minister’s good hands and I feel he is on the right track in the negotiations, I will support the Fine Gael motion.

Will the Minister keep an eye on that one?  He is being modest when he claims the proposal for young farmers has been discussed in the negotiations.  As far as I know, it was his proposal.  </p><p>On his recent visit to Ardee, County Louth, the Agriculture and Rural Development Commissioner, Mr. Dacian Cioloş, said we did not have to work on national but on regionalised flat rates.  That is not an option for farmers in my area and I hope the Minister will address the issue.  Does he believe we will have the maximum flexibility we need?  Why are the reform proposals so heavily weighted in favour of a flat rate?</p><p>There has been a discussion about productivity and farming.  We cannot support armchair farmers at the expense of productive farmers.  For Harvest 2020 to be a success, we need to support productive farmers.  I congratulate the Minister on his work so far.  I have no doubt these reforms will be sorted before we take up the EU Presidency.</p></speech>

Having worked in Europe for two years, I am very much aware of how the system works in reaching compromise and achieving progress together.</p><p>Recent briefings from Teagasc and Macra na Feirme touched on the fragmentation of farms.  If one goes back over 100 years when the Land Commission was established, there was a comprehensive roll-out of policy to give land to those who wanted to farm.  Do we again need to develop a national policy of consolidating fragmented farms with agreements with adjoining areas?</p><p>Installation aid was suspended several years ago and 140 applicants were affected.  Could they be included in this year’s budget?  </p><p>Macra na Feirme and Teagasc have pointed out how the numbers attending agricultural college have increased dramatically since 2006.  While this is a good development, the main issue is to ensure they will have land to farm and a decisive policy is introduced to achieve this.</p><p>One issue I am noting as a practising solicitor is the reluctance of some farm parents to transfer lands to a son or a daughter because of issues within family law.  This needs to be addressed.  </p><p>Senator Feargal Quinn referred to farming in New Zealand.  My nephew who works there on farms for five months of the year has told me that one farm on which he worked has over 2,000 cows.  The average farm size and milk production rate in Ireland are still low, while the number of farmers over 55 years of age is high.  We have many young people coming through the education system.  The opportunity must be given to them in order that they can invest in farming and increase milk production levels.</p></speech>

I also fully endorse the Minister's ambition of achieving a positive outcome in the negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework.  It is crucial that we agree to the budget before we move on to deal with other matters.</p><p>The CAP should not create too much green tape.  By definition, farming in Ireland is green.  As such, farmers should not have to deal with further impositions.  We have to look after our young farmers and must also support small farmers and those who were unable to get into the scheme in 2002 for one reason or another.  Some may not have been farming at the time, but they now need to get on the ladder.  I hope a suckler cow welfare scheme will be supported under pillar one.  I am aware that it does not form part of the negotiations, but it is important that farmers have access to such a scheme.  The new CAP will provide support for disadvantaged areas, as will the environmental schemes.  </p><p>I thank the Minister for debating these issues with us and I am sure we will meet him again before the start of the negotiations in 2013.</p></speech>

Emigration is the most pressing issue in Ireland.  The CSO indicates that 87,100 people emigrated from Ireland between April 2011 and April 2012.  This harks back to the worst days of the 1950s, when 1,000 people a week left our shores.</p><p>In addition to this brain drain of the best and brightest of our youth, the level of youth unemployment reached 40% last year.  Unemployment rates climbed as high as 50% among those aged between 15 and 24 years in Limerick city and County Donegal.  The census revealed that 82,000 people under the age of 25 years were out of work.  An entire generation of highly educated and motivated people face a drastic choice between emigration or unemployment at home.  The Government's pre-budget initiatives and the famous jobs initiative promised much, but they have had little impact on the live register in respect of those under the age of 25 years.  All around Europe huge numbers of young people are unemployed and today the President of the European Parliament stated youth unemployment was Europe's biggest issue.  Despite this, the Government's promises have not materialised and the jobs plan became an initiative.  Where are we going from here and what is the real plan to reduce historically high rates of emigration and deal with the issue of youth unemployment?</p></speech>

The statistics released by the CSO last month reveal that just over 87,000 people emigrated from Ireland last year, of whom almost half were non-Irish nationals.  Many of these non-Irish nationals are likely to be individuals who came to Ireland in search of work in the previous decade and are now either returning home or moving to another country to take advantage of new opportunities in the globalised economy.</p> <p>An analysis of the CSO figures shows that almost 53,000 people came into Ireland last year, with 39% of them being Irish nationals returning home.  Many of those who previously emigrated in search of work are coming home having gained skills abroad.  We can now capture that expertise to strengthen the operation and management of companies based here.  We must remember that emigration has been a consistent feature of Irish life.  Even during the Celtic tiger years, Irish people chose to emigrate for career or personal reasons.  Nevertheless, the Government is committed to ensuring emigration returns to being an option rather than a necessity.</p><p>I wish to remind the House of the position the Government inherited when it came into office.  Some 300,000 jobs had been lost in the three years prior to March 2011.  Our banking system had all but collapsed.  We were in the middle of a worldwide economic downturn.  Transformational and structural change has been required to rescue our economy from this situation.  We had become too dependent on a small number of sectors to support our economic performance.  This approach was neither wise nor sustainable.  The new economy we must build will be based on enterprise, innovation and exports.  In promoting this transformation, the Government will have to make progress on a number of fronts, for example, by improving our competitiveness, ensuring businesses have better access to finance, embedding a jobs agenda in the fiscal consolidation which must be carried out, and taking action to facilitate growth in every sector.  We have introduced the annual action plan for jobs to ensure these requirements are delivered to support the creation of employment by the enterprise sector.  We have developed the Pathways to Work initiative to transform our engagement with those who are unemployed.</p><p>The progress we have made in our first 18 months in office has been encouraging, but there is a long way to go.  Despite the very difficult domestic and external economic environment, we are beginning to see the positive impact of the Government's policies.  There was an increase of 6,000 jobs in IDA-supported companies in 2011.  This compares with net losses of 15,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010.  So far this year, the IDA has announced investments that have the potential to create over 6,000 further jobs as the projects come on stream.  It was announced this morning that 30 jobs with Hittite Microwave Corporation are coming to Cork.  It was announced yesterday that 44 new jobs with Aspen Pharmaceutical are coming to Dublin.  The number of jobs in Enterprise Ireland companies started to grow in 2011 for the first time in three years.  In the first eight months of 2012, a total of 4,669 job commitments over the next three years, linked to Enterprise Ireland approvals to client companies, have been secured.</p><p>We are seeing a stabilisation in the level of private sector employment, particularly in areas targeted by the Action Plan for Jobs.  For example, employment in the tourism sector increased by 6,300 in the period between June 2011 and June 2012.  This growth was supported by the measures taken by the Government in cutting VAT rates and reducing by half employer's PRSI on earnings up to €356 per week.  Employment has also increased in the agriculture, accommodation food services and information and communications technology sectors.  This underscores the shift in activity away from the old failed economy, which was based on property, banking and debt, towards a new sustainable economy that is based on enterprise, exports and innovation.  Furthermore, we are creating and maintaining links with Irish people who have left the country.  We have always had a good relationship with the diaspora.  We have been able to build on our relationships with those who have reached the top levels of companies across the globe.  We have now formalised this process of engagement through the Global Irish Network.  At home, we will continue to do all we can, through initiatives like the action plan for jobs and Pathways to Work, to facilitate the return to work of those who have lost their jobs and provide opportunities for all those who want to stay here.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach said in May 2010 that it would create 105,000 jobs.  I am concerned about the brain-drain.  We are sending highly-educated young people abroad.  I will give an example of the Government's lack of joined-up thinking.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's view on it.  The Government's internship programme has been made available to the public, semi-State and private sectors, but it is not available in Leinster House.  We are not giving graduates an opportunity to see our Parliament from the inside, and make changes to it, under the JobBridge scheme.  The point I am making to the Minister of State is that we are not leading by practical example in our Parliament.  The Government initiative is supposed to give graduates an opportunity to stay in Ireland and engage meaningfully with-----</p></speech>

What happened the jobs initiative and the jobs plan?  It was forecast that 80,000 jobs would be created.  What happened them?  How can we keep our young people in Ireland?

There are opportunities for small companies.  Some extraordinary companies are creating jobs every day.  We must recognise the roles of small and medium-sized enterprises and foreign direct investment.  Significant announcements have been made by IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  The backdrop we inherited has meant that our job has been very difficult.  It is important to note that additional jobs have been announced by IDA Ireland since we came into Government.  In 2011, the number of jobs in IDA-supported companies increased by 6,000.  This compares with net losses of 15,000 jobs between 2008 and 2010.  I mentioned the job announcements that were made by Hittite Microwave Corporation and Aspen Pharmaceutical in recent days.  The number of jobs in Enterprise Ireland companies increased in 2011 for the first time in three years.  Some 4,669 job commitments linked to Enterprise Ireland were made in the first eight months of 2012.  It is a very difficult job.</p><p>The Deputy mentioned that 87,000 people emigrated from Ireland last year.  I remind him that almost half of them were non-Irish nationals who were going back.  They might have come here during the boom years to work in the construction sector.  It should also be borne in mind that 53,000 people came into Ireland last year.  The global economy gives people opportunities to go to the UK or the US.  Many young people like to travel when they are educated.  They like to see the opportunities that exist for them.  Many of them come back into the economy again after they have had their experiences.  It is very much a global world.  There is no comparison with the 1950s.  People are highly educated and skilled now.  They have the ambition to travel to New Zealand, Australia or the US.  I am confident that the Government's plan of action will ensure there is a bright future of many opportunities for them in this country when they feel like returning home.  I see the emergence of such opportunities on a daily basis as I do my job at the small company desk.  Extraordinary companies in the high-tech, information and communications technology, health care and life sciences sectors are achieving extraordinary things every day and week of the year.</p></speech>

Tá a fhios againn gur imigh Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta Teoranta as feidhm in 2011.  Tá go leor ceisteanna faoi sin freisin.  Bhí roinnt clár faoi scáth Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, an clár forbartha tuaithe agus an clár forbartha áitiúil ina measc.  Ó shin i leith, tá sé de chúram ar an Roinn socruithe a dhéanamh maidir leis na cláir seo sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Cá seasann an próiseas sin faoi láthair?  Tá sé ag tógáil cuid mhaith ama.  D'ardaigh mé an cheist seo go minic leis an Aire ó thús na bliana.  An fhadhb atá ann ná go gcuirfidh na socruithe atá le déanamh, dé réir mar a chloisim, sórt gunna le cloigne na gcomhlachtaí atá ag plé leis na cláir seo.  Tá na comhlachtaí teagmhasacha, nó cineál comhlachtaí béaldorais, tar éis conarthaí a fháil leis an gclár Leader a chur i bhfeidhm sa Ghaeltacht.  Tá dhá chuid sa chlár Leader.  Níl a fhios ag cuid de na tograí a bhí faoi scáth Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta cén seasamh nó stádas atá acu agus na conarthaí nua le tabhairt amach.  Cá seasann an clár Leader?</p> <p>Tá daoine amuigh ansin atá ag fanacht leis an airgead.</p><p>To summarise, the Leader programme has been handed to next door neighbour or contiguous companies to the Gaeltacht because of the demise of Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, MFG.  The programme itself has been in limbo in the Gaeltacht for the past year, since MFG fell by the wayside.  There are legacy issues with regard to the programme and quite a number of projects have been left in limbo.  A number of people involved in those projects have contacted me over the past year.  For example, one community group in Donegal contacted me because it is €60,000 in the red with the bank.  It has paid €4,500 interest on that loan in the past year, on moneys due to it from Leader.  That group does not know where it stands.  Another group which does not mind me putting its name on the record, Ionad Cultúrtha Baile Bhúirne, is in a similar position.  It is owed €9,000 for a staidéar feidireachta or feasibility study for which it paid and which was to be paid from Leader funds.  However, it has not received its moneys.  I have also spoken to a number of individuals who had Leader projects who have been left high and dry.  They were given part payment and had taken out loans or paid for services and goods, but have not received their funding from the Leader programme.  </p><p>I believe two contracts are being offered to the contiguous companies to ensure the Leader programme continues.  One is for the Leader project from now onwards.  We need this to go ahead as soon as possible so that people can make applications and avail of and draw down the Leader funding so that it is spent in time.  However, I am told that the gun is also being put to their head and that the contiguous companies must also sign a contract to take responsibility for all the legacy projects.  They are not comfortable with that, because there is no sense of what is in the folders or whether the paper work has been done properly etc.  I do not blame them for that.  </p><p>Where do the people concerned stand?  It is very unreasonable of the Department to force them into this situation and they should be allowed get on with the current Leader projects.   The Department has had over a year to find some kind of a solution, legal or otherwise, to resolve the issues around the legacy projects which have been left in limbo.  This is a hugely important issue.  It is important on a personal level for all those involved in the projects.  They need answers because they are being hounded by banks for moneys owed.  It is unfair to leave them in that position.</p><p>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit agus tá súil agam go mbeidh freagra dearfach aige dom.</p></speech>

The Leader initiative was established by the European Commission in 1991.  It was designed to aid the development of sustainable rural communities under the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Leader II, which commenced in 1994, extended the programme to all rural areas in Ireland and was delivered by 34 groups.  While Leader I was a pilot initiative, Leader II was designed to complement the strategy for rural areas in the national development plan for 1994-99.  In addition to an increased level of funding and coverage of all rural areas, emphasis was placed on the acquisition of skills and improved capacity building to ensure the delivery of the business plan for the rural areas.  Leader continued in the 2000-06 round of EU funding and operated in all rural areas in the country in that programme period.  Since 1994, therefore, all rural areas of Ireland, including all Gaeltacht areas, have been included in the Leader elements of the successive rural development programme.</p><p>While initially some 36 groups were contracted to deliver the Leader elements of the current programme round from 2007 to 2013, currently there are 35.  Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta, the group contracted by the Department to deliver axes 3 and 4 of Leader in the rural development programme in the Gaeltacht areas, went into liquidation on 7 September 2011, leaving Gaeltacht areas temporarily without access to the programme.  Progress in the context of the legal winding up of the MFG is ongoing.  In this context, the Department has developed an approach that will facilitate the continuation of the programme in Gaeltacht areas and address the existing rural development programme projects with outstanding claims for payment.</p><p>This has proved to be a complex legal process which has taken time to resolve.  MFG was a private limited company and it is beyond the remit of the Minister or the Department to direct the business of such a company.  The group's liquidation process is ongoing.  I acknowledge and regret that the current situation has caused delay to the delivery of the Leader elements of the rural development programme in the Gaeltacht areas.  However, this delay relates primarily to the need to ensure the continued effective delivery of projects funded under the rural development programme. </p><p>The Department is also responsible for ensuring that any solution is fully compliant with and has the capacity to ensure that all projects are fully compliant with all EU national requirements.  The process of identifying the promoters whose projects are at an advanced stage of development has been established and a system of co-operation with local development companies contiguous to the Gaeltacht areas is in place to facilitate the final checking and processing of payment claims in respect of these projects.  Hopefully the projects raised by the Senator will be included in that.  Many of these files have now been sent to the relevant local development companies, which will be in touch directly with the relevant promoter.</p><p>In the context of the delivery of the axes 3 and 4 Leader elements in the rural development programme in Gaeltacht areas in the long term, I can confirm that contracts have been issued to groups which will now formally replace MFG as the delivery mechanism of the rural development programme Leader funding for the Gaeltacht areas of counties Galway, Donegal, Kerry, Cork, Waterford and Meath.  The Department is formalising arrangements with the relevant local development companies.  While there is a system in place to address the current outstanding commitments in County Mayo generally and future delivery for the Gaeltacht areas of south Mayo in particular, some further work is required to finalise a solution for the remaining areas there.  However, I expect a solution will be reached shortly.</p><p>Local development companies processing Gaeltacht area projects will be provided with adequate and reasonable administration funding, based on the cost of delivering all outputs under the revised contracts, subject to all applicable regulatory limits and conditions under the rural development programme.  The local development companies will provide the Department with projections on these costs so that provision may be made for the additional administrative burden of taking on contracts in the respective Gaeltacht areas.  The final solution will see the future delivery of Leader elements of the rural development programme allocated to relevant local development companies.  This is a significant step forward.  I am confident the Gaeltacht areas of Ireland will be restored to full access to rural development funding in the near future.</p></speech>

The outstanding issue and the main point I would like him to bring back to the Minister is that the contiguous companies being granted the contracts should not be held liable for the sins of their predecessor, MFG.  As the Minister of State has said, they have not been given some of the files, so they do not know what is or is not in them.  It seems very unfair that they are being told they must sign a contract of liability for all of those files and projects, despite not knowing what is involved in them.  It is incumbent on the Minister of State to say to the Minister that he should not insist on this.  The companies should take on the files and projects and process them as much as possible, but they should not be held liable for any work not done or not done properly by MFG.  This would move the process on more quickly and would ensure the people who deserve payments will get them and the programme can move forward quickly.</p></speech>

I appreciate the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, is here this evening, although he does not have direct responsibility for Coast Guard stations.  I had hoped the Minister for Transport, Deputy Varadkar, would be here to respond on this issue, but I appreciate he may have other business.</p><p>This issue also affects communities in Valentia, Kerry, from where my colleague, Senator Mark Daly, comes.  He is working on a campaign in that part of the country.  It also affects communities in Donegal and the north west area.  The Minister of State may recall that back in 2008 after a long campaign to keep the stations at Valentia and Malin Head open, the then Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, announced that the Government planned to keep Malin Head and Valentia open.</p> <p>He also pledged to upgrade all three centres, including the centre in Dublin, to the tune of €2.5 million.  The Dublin station has now been fully upgraded, as has the Malin Head station, following an investment of approximately €721,000.  I understand that Valentia is also to be upgraded.</p><p>In 2011, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, for some reason, engaged the consultancy group Fisher Associates, to carry out yet another review, despite the fact that there were numerous previous reviews.  I wish to know the cost of that review.  The findings of the final report were released on 5 July and one of the recommendations was that the number of rescue stations should be reduced from three to two, with the Malin Head Coast Guard station closing.  So far, the Minister has only responded by saying that the recommendations contained in the report are being considered by his Department and that his officials are due to report back to him some time in October.  This is creating great uncertainty in Donegal and along the west coast.  Historically, Malin Head is the oldest operating radio station in Europe and should be allowed to continue.  Why close a station that has operated flawlessly for over 100 years?  </p><p>It was decided in 2008, following a long and drawn out campaign, that the Malin Head and Valentia stations would be upgraded and kept open.  Their future was secured.  Work on the Malin Head station was completed in August.  That work involved technical, operational and infrastructural developments within the station, which will ensure that it is fully up to standard now and into the future.  It seems crazy that after carrying out that substantial work and after the previous Government deciding to secure the future of the Malin Head station, there would be any question surrounding its future.  It is equally crazy that yet another consultant's report is being considered by officials within the Department.  </p><p>The area where Malin Head and Valentia provide their services, with its large number of islands and inlets, has the longest coastline per station coverage in Europe.  If the Government reduces the number of centres to two, taking into consideration the Dublin centre, it will result in each centre covering 3,700 km of coastline.  That is simply not safe.  A British House of Commons select committee recently highlighted the fact that closing coast guard stations along the British coastline led to an increase in the loss of life at sea.  We are jeopardising peoples' lives in trying to save a few miserable euro by closing down a coast guard station, after spending €2.5 million on upgrading the three centres we currently have.  A report is being considered but a decision was made in 2008 and the Government should not go back on that decision, particularly after an investment in the upgrading of the stations was made.  I hope the Minister of State will have some good news.</p></speech>

I am taking this Adjournment debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>As part of the Croke Park agreement, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport engaged a specialist international maritime transport management consultancy, Fisher Associates, to undertake a value for money review of services provided by the Irish Coast Guard, IRCG, and the marine survey office, MSO.  These reports were published by the Department on 5 July 2012.  The IRCG and the MSO are internal divisions of the Department and are not separate statutory agencies.  Taken together, the reports call for a comprehensive integrated programme of work to enhance maritime safety and emergency response services.  Among the issues identified by the Fisher Associates review was the need to enhance, as a priority, Ireland's capacity to prepare for and respond to major oil pollution incidents.  The review also found that more support is needed for the volunteers in our coastal rescue units, particularly in the areas of improved training courses, oversight and supervision, day-to-day management, risk and quality control.  The review found that a significant backlog in transposing legislative provisions into Irish law needs to be addressed, as does Ireland's additional inspection obligations.  Furthermore, improved administrative and IT systems are needed to support delivery of services and the development of management and accountability systems across the maritime safety services.  The Fisher report concluded that such systems would contribute to alleviating staff shortages and it recommends that realistic fees should be charged for the services provided by the MSO.  It also pointed out the need for improved risk management and for periodic reviews and auditing of operational arrangements.  The report also calls for improved communications, both internally and with stakeholders and other partners, for enhanced service delivery.  </p><p>The Minister has informed the Government that the issues raised in the reports will be examined by the Department and that he proposes to present an action plan in October, addressing the deficiencies identified.  The issues that have been identified in the report for action are serious and must be addressed, particularly in relation to oil pollution response capacity and volunteer training and management.  The Minister has made it clear that he does not propose to accept or reject any of the recommendations in the Fisher report at this stage.  Furthermore, no decisions have been taken at this time in relation to these matters.  In preparing the action plan, the Department will assess each recommendation and will prioritise actions to address the deficiencies.  That process will call for tough decisions to be made.  It is important to recognise that resources available to the maritime services are very limited and must be deployed on a prioritised basis and as effectively and efficiently as possible to address the most urgent needs.  Having robust and efficient maritime safety regulatory arrangements and emergency response services in place will also be crucial for the development of shipping trade and employment, which have a key role to play in Ireland's economic recovery.  </p><p>I also take the opportunity to inform the House that new communications systems have been installed in Malin Head centre as part of the general upgrading of the communications systems infrastructure nationally.  </p></speech>

Lines such as, "That process will call for tough decisions to be made.  It is important to recognise that resources available to the maritime services are very limited and must be deployed on a prioritised basis and as effectively and efficiently as possible to address the most urgent needs," do not read as a vote of confidence in the future of the Malin Head Coast Guard station.  Many of my colleagues, from Fianna Fáil and other Opposition parties, as well as some members of the Government parties, have signed a petition calling for the head of the Coast Guard service and the Minister to come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications to discuss this issue.  That needs to happen soon and I believe the meeting is scheduled to take place on 24 October.  This situation is urgent and the lack of a clear response from the Minister is disappointing.  The Minister should come out at this stage and say, quite clearly, that one of the recommendations of the report is to close down a station but that he is not going to close any station.  That is what should be said now, as a vote of confidence in the staff in Malin Head and the service being provided, and as a reassurance to the communities who benefit from that service, year after year, including the young man whose life was saved just outside Convoy this week as a result of the swift actions by the Malin Head Coast Guard station.</p></speech>

The Minister also points out that the new communications systems were installed in the Malin Head centre as part of a general upgrading of communications systems.</p><p>I would not be overly-pessimistic on this issue.</p> <p>A report has been produced and it must be studied.  When the Minister deals with the report, given the manner in which he does his business, the future position will be clear in respect of the points raised by the Senator with regard to the Coast Guard stations.  The points raised are clear and effective and I have no doubt the Minister will take them on board in his final consideration.</p></speech>

I wish him well in his endeavours.  He is singularly fit and capable of carrying out his duties and responsibilities.</p><p>In the 18 months I have been in the Seanad I have not raised a matter that concerns me as much as this matter before the House.  It concerns some of the most vulnerable people in our community, namely, Down's syndrome children and adults.  The issue is the arbitrary and unilateral closure and withdrawal of residential respite care for Down's syndrome children and young adults in Mountrath and Abbeyleix in County Laois without anything that comes close to meaningful consultation with the clients or their families.  This action has been undertaken by the Muiríosa Foundation based on cutbacks which are not only unjust but grossly misguided.  They are morally irresponsible, medically unsound and there is no monetary value or savings associated with them.  To date, the Muiríosa Foundation has not been able to indicate what savings will accrue.  The move amounts to changing tack and policy.  I see it as a farming out of services by the HSE and the Department of Health to what is essentially a private service provider.  It is a move towards an American model of service delivery.  This would not have occurred under the remit of the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary in Moore Abbey, which operated these services before the establishment of the Muiríosa Foundation.</p><p>Last Saturday week I attended a rally in Abbeyleix.  One would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved and persuaded by the testimonies of the families affected.  Fortunately, our society has moved on but in the past, these children and people with intellectual disabilities were hidden behind high walls.  Our society and community have moved on from that and now these people are being cared for in their homes and communities where they belong.</p><p>As a result of this process there are many instances of elderly parents or parents of advancing years who are trying to cater for and cope with adults with the mind of a child.  There are adults ranging from 35 to 55 years of age who have the mental capacity of a young child.  One parent approached me whose 35 year old son is in nappies 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  This is the level of need and care these people require.</p><p>These families are not looking for much from the State.  They are not looking for handouts but merely for some cover or respite one weekend in six, not only for the children and young adults who have autism or Down's syndrome, but for themselves in order that they can recuperate and recover to face the challenges that come with catering for and coping with these challenging behaviours.  No one wants to abdicate responsibility.  I implore the Minister of State through his good offices and his sense of decency and concern to intervene in this regard.</p><p>The agency concerned receives a significant sum, amounting to €40 million, from the HSE to provide services.  I realise it has a range of services to provide.  However, I would like to think that somewhere within the service level agreement there is a stipulation that it is not possible for the organisation to walk off the pitch without any consultation or concern for these families or to decide to withdraw services in Abbeyleix and Mountrath.  This decision is impacting harshly and with distressing outcomes on 90 families.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to be back in this Chamber, albeit in a different capacity.  I look forward to a fruitful relationship with colleagues here in the months and years ahead.</p><p>I thank the Senator for raising the matter, which I am addressing on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who, as the Senator is aware, has responsibility for this area.  A broad range of needs are covered under the heading of respite.  For some families, it provides a space away from the continuing and cumulative strain of supporting and caring for someone with significant and complex needs.  In other situations, respite enables the child or adult to spend time with friends in ordinary community settings, for example, going for a meal or to the cinema.  For other families, respite ensures that a reliable arrangement is in place if they have a family or work commitment that may take them away from the family home for a given period.</p><p>The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, and I are very much aware that respite services form a vital part of the continuum of services for families and help to preserve the family unit and support family stability.  We are also aware of the impact the absence of respite service provision can have on other services.  However, the health service as a whole must operate within the parameters of funding available to it.  Given the current economic environment this is a challenge for all stakeholders, including the HSE, voluntary service providers, services users and their families.  If respite services were to be exempt from cost-recovery measures, day services and residential services would have to bear the full burden of the necessary adjustments.</p><p>The Senator raised a specific issue relating to the Muiríosa Foundation and Laois Respite Services.  The Muiríosa Foundation, like other service providers, is addressing the increased demand on its services within a more restricted budget.  The standard response that has evolved in the area of respite is for a professionally staffed, centre-based respite facility to offer an overnight arrangement.  Unfortunately, there are significant costs associated with this approach.  The current situation in County Laois is that the house at Fountain View, Abbeyleix, which had been providing adult respite during the past decade, has formally ceased offering respite support.  However, the house has not been closed.  A residential service will continue to be provided at Fountain View but the implications may vary from family to family as a consequence.  Some families will retain their current level of access to centre-based respite.  Others may secure an increase or decrease in this type of respite, depending on what is appropriate in individual cases.  Other families may be directed towards share-a-break options, which are suitable in the case of some individual service users.</p><p>I understand that individual families are being briefed on the rationale behind the current changes and the implications for their family member.  The HSE has informed the Minister that the Muiríosa Foundation has its full support for the proposed changes, which are aimed at providing the best mix of respite services in County Laois generally.  I urge all involved to work together to achieve the most appropriate outcome for each individual involved, having regard to the optimum mix of services that can be provided within the resources available.</p></speech>

It does not get to the underlying problem whatsoever.  Everyone involved including the families affected know full well about the nature of the cutbacks and the strain on resources.</p><p>I caution the Minister of State that the share-a-break model being peddled by the Muiríosa Foundation and its chief executive is fraught with dangers in terms of the health and safety of the clients involved.  It puts Down's syndrome children at risk.  I implore the Minister of State to use his good offices to discuss the matter with the Muiríosa Foundation.  The foundation is only starting to engage with families now after the horse has bolted and the stable door has been closed and that is not the way to do business.  This has come like a bolt from the blue for these families.</p> <p>I understand that no meaningful savings will accrue from what is proposed.  The clients are going to end up back in hospital - in institutionalised care - which will cost taxpayers and society a great deal more in the long term.  Much of the debate in respect of the delivery of health services in recent weeks has been characterised as a struggle between right and left.  I would characterise what is happening in this instance as a struggle between right and wrong.  It is wrong to place children with Down's syndrome at risk, particularly in circumstances where savings will not accrue.  Consultation has not taken place in respect of this matter.  The Government and the Department must realise that unless this matter is resolved through ministerial intervention, those who are affected will end up protesting at the gates of Leinster House.</p></speech>

I cannot say anything further about the specific issue to which he refers but I fully appreciate the importance of the point he has made.  It is fair to state - the Senator has acknowledged this - that the entire health service is struggling.  In the 48 hours that I have been in my new position, it has become clear to me that we are struggling with cost constraints right across the board.  Grappling with this difficulty is a daily, if not hourly, preoccupation for everyone involved.  The Senator's intervention in respect of this particular issue it very timely and useful.  I will ensure that his concerns are communicated to the Minister.</p></speech>
