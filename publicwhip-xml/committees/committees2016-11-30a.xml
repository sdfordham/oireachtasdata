I remind everybody to switch off their mobile phones because they interfere with the recording and transmission of the proceedings.  I welcome Ms Orla O'Connor and Ms Eil&iacute;s N&iacute; Chaithn&iacute;a from the National Women's Council and Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy and Ms Michelle Murphy from Social Justice Ireland.  Today's meeting is part of the committee's post-budget analysis of budget 2017.  The witnesses have also been asked to provide a look ahead to budget 2018, including the measures and proposals they believe could be introduced that would have a positive impact in the areas of gender equality and poverty in particular.  This is a new committee and it is only now that we are in a position to go into more depth in terms of oversight of budgetary matters and input from bodies such as the National Women's Council and Social Justice Ireland are important in that regard.  It is likely that we will have ongoing engagement with both organisations, especially as we engage with those who are policy-proofing budget proposals.</p> <p>  I wish to draw attention to the fact that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I now invite Ms O'Connor to make her opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla O'Connor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016113000002#C00300"><p>On behalf of the National Women's Council I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak here today.  As members know, the council is the leading national membership organisation for women in Ireland.  We are a feminist organisation and we seek full equality for women in Ireland.  We welcome the invitation to meet the committee today and we also welcome the establishment of the budgetary oversight committee because it provides an important opportunity for greater Oireachtas oversight of and input to the budgetary process.  </p> <p>  We commend the commitment in the programme for partnership Government to devote two thirds of budgetary spending on public investment as against one third on tax measures and acknowledge the fulfilment of that commitment in budget 2017.  We recognise the pressures on Government in terms of bringing together the budget but our main comments on budget 2017 will focus on issues of taxation, child care, income, pensions and gender and equality budgeting.</p> <p>  We believe that the tax concessions in budget 2017, such as the reduction in the universal social charge, USC, and the increased thresholds for capital acquisitions tax, CAT, do not represent a strategic use of hard-earned public funds.  Budget 2017 gave us an opportunity to discontinue marginal tax reliefs on pensions, for example, but this did not happen.  The opportunity to redress some of the inequities in our taxation system was not taken.  </p> <p>  On a positive note, the National Women's Council really welcomes the introduction of the single affordable child care scheme.  This is a really important measure.  The council has long campaigned for the introduction of publicly subsidised universal child care and the single affordable child care scheme represents a good start.  However, I must emphasise that it is only a start.  It is similar to many models of child care in other European countries for which we have advocated.  The lack of child care in Ireland is still one of the most significant barriers to women's participation in society, including in employment, civic and political life.  We welcome the fact that there is a universal element within the child care subsidy so that all families can benefit.  This recognises that all families have child care needs which is critical.  We also welcome the fact that payments will be made directly to the service providers.  This is very important in the context of ensuring that State funding is linked directly to quality service provision.  That said, it is critically important that providers of child care do not increase their costs.  There are some gaps in the scheme and we will be working with the Department to improve it before it is rolled out next September.  One of the issues to be addressed is the capping of child care costs so that prices are not increased, thus making child care less affordable for parents.</p> <p>  The council recommended, prior to budget 2017, that the minimum wage be increased to what is called the living wage, that is, to &euro;11.50 per hour.  This did not happen but it remains the council's recommendation in the context of the next budget.  A number of issues arise with regard to social welfare but I wish to focus on pensions in particular.  Pensions are a critical issue for women in Ireland because of the inequities within the system.  The gender pension gap has widened and now stands at 37%.  While we welcome the increase of &euro;5 in pension payments we firmly believe, based on our international research and on consulting widely with women, that a universal pension is the best way to support equality in older age.  We recommend that this committee makes this a priority over the next year and we will also be saying the same to the Department of Social Protection.  This has been a long standing call of the National Women's Council of Ireland.  Currently 84% of those receiving a full State contributory pension are men.  While this payment was protected during the recession, the reduced rate payments on which a majority of women rely have been steadily eroded.  The fact that only 16% of women receive the full contributory rate reflects both the legacy of the marriage bar and a system poorly designed to support individual entitlement or to recognise care.  Rather than addressing these inequalities, the State has allowed them to deepen in recent years by increasing contributory thresholds and making it harder for women to access a full contributory pension.  This is a critical issue for women because of the legacy issues already mentioned and also in terms of how we deal with it going forward.  Currently we are not assisting women to access pensions but are making it harder for them.  </p> <p>  The final issue I wish to deal with is gender and equality budgeting, which goes to the heart of equality for women and to the heart of our budgetary process.  In looking to budget 2018 and beyond, the council wishes to offer its support to this committee to embed a process of gender and equality budgeting that would be in line with the Government&rsquo;s commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government.</p><p>These are commitments we welcomed.  We believe these new mechanisms must be meaningfully developed and delivered.  This is not a tick box exercise.  Gender budgeting, if implemented effectively, has the potential to address structural economic inequalities for women and to allow the Government to assess the extent to which provisions made to improve the lives of women and men are achieving their intended impact.  We have also received funding from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to support the work on gender budgeting and we want to work with the committee to do that.</p><p> Having listened to the address of the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, in the Seanad yesterday, it is appropriate to point out that we have a good deal to learn from Scotland on gender budgeting, which was discussed yesterday.  The fact that in Scotland they produce an annual budget equality statement is a positive step and it is one that could be taken up in an Irish context.  We ask that in budget 2018 a similar statement would be produced that would accompany the budget, which would be the start of a process in assessing budgetary demands from different Departments before they are implemented and, similarly, when the budget is produced that it would be  done after that process.  A before and after process in that respect is critical to having a proper gender budgeting process.</p><p> We thank the committee once again for this opportunity to present our views and we are happy to answer any questions on our submission that members may have.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016113000002#D00200"><p>I thank Ms O'Connor for that.  I will take questions after both presentations have been made.  Members can then fire questions at will but not quite in that they will have to go through the Chair.  I call on Dr. Healy to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016113000002#D00300"><p>We in Social Justice Ireland also welcome the invitation from the committee to be here today.  We welcome the establishment of the committee and we believe the work it is doing is very important in shaping the future.  We have already submitted a 24-page analysis and critique of budget 2017 together with some ideas about the future.  My introductory remarks are based on the fact that this document has been submitted, and we can tease it out as the members wish.</p> <p>  A number of the budgetary measures were welcome, including the increases in welfare rates and the child care programme initiative.  The tax changes could have been fairer, even if the Government was to insist on a third of the available fiscal space going on tax reductions.  It could have done it in a much more fair way.  For exactly the same amount of money, &euro;383 million, it could have made tax credits refundable, thus tackling the work poor issue and giving every person with a job a tax credit of &euro;100.  That would have been a fairer way to proceed.</p> <p>  The long-range issues Ireland is facing were mentioned in the Budget Statement announced by the Minister for Finance but were not taken up in any substantial way.  They include issues such as climate change and the funding of education particularly at third level which is becoming pretty difficult and challenging.  There is also the issue of our changing demographics.  Ireland will have a million people over the age of 65 by 2031, which is only 15 years away, and, of that, 136,000 will be over the age of 85, which is an increase of 132% on the current situation.  We know that will happen and should be planning for it now rather than leaving it until later.  There are other challenges around financing local government, repairing and modernising our water infrastructure, paying our rising European Union contribution, funding pollution-reducing environmental initiatives, the issue of what is required by European international agreements and the need to invest in the building of the rural broadband infrastructure.  Those are some of the long-range issues which have huge implications and which require serious investment but which were not sufficiently addressed in this budget and need to be on the agenda as we go forward.</p> <p>  We have an issue around the coherence of decisions taken in the budget.  For example, in the decisions made on housing, there is a lack of coherence on two fronts.  While there is a plan in place, which is welcome and which we fully acknowledge it is the biggest plan put in place for a long time, we would point out that it is planned to build 47,000 new units by 2021 when currently, according to the Government's figures, 89,000 units are required for social housing.  We will only get half way to achieving that but that does not account for any new need that will emerge from our rising population between now and 2021.  That is one issue.  Another issue is that we believe the assistance being granted to first-time buyers in budget 2017 is short-sighted and will not do anything to tackle the current cause of the problem, which is the lack of supply.</p> <p>  There is a similar lack of coherence, which has not been highlighted as much in the public arena, in the overall health care budget.  The existing level of service together with the new initiatives that are planned to be delivered cannot be delivered for the money that has been allocated.  Either some of the new commitments will not be delivered or some of the services being provided will have to be reduced if the budget is to come in on target.  Our understanding is that this is the requirement now in the budgetary process, that there cannot be supplementary budgets and that next budget will be next December.</p> <p>  Another issue about which we are seriously concerned is the tax take.  The level of revenue remains one of the lowest in the European Union as a percentage of GDP.  The low tax model is not sustainable because in practice it means that Ireland does not have sufficient resources to provide the social and economic infrastructure that we require.  Our infrastructure is below the European continental averages.  It is not possible for us to build the additional infrastructure and maintain it and to do that on the social and infrastructural side generally while having this lower tax take as a very strong commitment.  The issue is not about increasing income tax rather it is about widening the tax base, which is the essential prerequisite to increasing the country's total tax take in a fair manner.</p> <p>  Moving on from the tax issue but closely tied to it is the fact that greater public investment is required.  The Government claimed that budget 2017 had been Brexit-proofed.  What that involves is not very clear but I am convinced that the best way to Brexit-proof the Irish economy is to invest in the infrastructure that we desperately need.  That is what is required.  That would be good for the economy and for society.  Budget 2017 does not address that.  </p> <p>  We would also point to the fact that budget-proofing has been ignored.  Nowhere else in this society or economy would one be allowed to spend a great deal of money without first having a very clear impact assessment.  When organisations in the community and voluntary sector apply for even small amounts of money, they are always asked by the Department or the agency concerned what is their output and what will be the impact, but that question does not seem to have been asked in advance of the budget.  It is something that happens afterwards and there is something fundamentally wrong with that.</p> <p>  Looking to the future, we need an integrated policy framework.  There are five goals the Government needs to work for simultaneously because they are interdependent, intertwined and interconnected in a big way.  We need to build a thriving economy, to move to have just taxation, to have decent services and infrastructure, to have good governance and to do it all in a sustainable manner.  It is possible to do that in a serious way and to do it effectively.  I am talking about good governance.  We welcome very much the improved level of engagement of the Houses of Oireachtas in the budgetary process.  We also believe there is a need to improve the transparency of the budget process in the years ahead and the commitment to do that in the programme for Government is very welcome.</p><p> We have been analysing and critiquing every budget since 1988.  Today, we get less information than we used to get 20 years ago in the budget documentation available on budget night.  Something is fundamentally wrong with that, especially in an era when we have all the modern technology, information and so on.  Those affected are not only the people outside.  It seems to us that Deputies and Senators should have access to all this information.  There is far more information than they are getting at the moment.</p><p> I will suggest a checklist of things the committee might look at for the future.  There is a need to address the issue of the fiscal rules.  The rules were put in place as a political solution to an economic problem and they will be changed eventually - I have no doubt whatsoever about that and I said as much years ago when the idea was being considered before it was put in place.  We discussed this at the Oireachtas committee at the time and what we predicted has come to pass.  We are now blocked from investing because of the rules.  We are blocked from picking up the money we need to undertake investment, although interest rates are low.  We need to substantially increase investment.</p><p> We need to expand the fiscal space as well.  We do that principally by broadening the tax base and recognising that we need to do precisely that.  We maintain that the full year cost of every change in budget 2018 should be available in the budget documentation when the budget is published.  Such information was not in the documentation this year.  There were 2017 numbers for 2017, but where taxation was concerned, in particular, the full year costs were not given.  As a result, the answers to parliamentary questions since then have shown a substantially higher full-year cost for the tax changes introduced in the budget.</p><p> The tax and expenditure carryover should be made available from the beginning.  It is not there.  The independent budget office should be appropriately staffed.  This is critical.  We would be concerned if the Oireachtas decided to farm out that work.  We believe the Oireachtas needs its own office, properly staffed, to do the new job of budgetary oversight required.  We are strongly of the view that this should be done.</p><p> Everyone should have access to analytical models.  For example, one model gets used a good deal and, although it was paid for 100% by the taxpayer, most people are not given access to it.  The organisation using it is able to make a good deal of money on it.  I am referring to the simulating welfare and income tax changes model in the ESRI.  I am not suggesting people should not use the SWITCH model.  However, if it is used, others should have access to it aside from ESRI staff.  All manner of assumptions and issues around modelling arise.  I am keen to see what the models are based on.  I suspect that many people around the Houses would also like to see these details.  Any models being used in the analysis, whether macroeconomic models or models like SWITCH for analysing welfare and so on, should be accessible and available to everyone.</p><p> Probably the most important thing that needs to be noted for the future is the point that unless we increase our overall tax take in a fair way - I am not emphasising income tax and I am making these qualifications specifically - we will not provide the infrastructure and social services for which Irish people have clearly indicated a preference.  Moreover, we will certainly not get anywhere close to the European continental average, especially the EU 15 average, which is where most Irish people believe we should be.</p><p> I thank the committee for the engagement.  Ms Murphy and I are perfectly happy to answer questions or elaborate on anything members may want us to address.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1265" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016113000002#E00200"><p>Thank you, Dr. Healy.  Deputy Calleary has indicated first and we will then hear from Deputy Doherty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1335" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016113000002#E00300"><p>I thank both groups for coming in.  The groups focused on demographics and pension planning.  I thought there was something of a contradiction in what Ms O'Connor said, and I trust she does not mind my querying it.  She criticised retaining the pension reliefs as part of the taxation package.  Yet, she pointed out the pension problem that we are going to have which will affect women and everyone in society.  Should the solution to that problem be totally Government focused?  Should people have a role in it?</p> <p>  What would a gender-proofed budget look like?  How different would 2017 have been if the budget had gone through the gender budgeting process referred to by Ms O'Connor?  Perhaps Ms O'Connor may wish to come back to us with correspondence on that question.</p> <p>  I am intrigued by the comment from Dr. Healy to the effect that more information was available in 1988 than is available today.  That is an interesting benchmark for the committee to reflect on and set.  Can Dr. Healy give us an idea of what the 1988 budget looked like?  Again, this may require further correspondence.  I do not imagine anyone in the room was here at that stage, although I am unsure about the clerk.  How did the presentation look then compared to now?  What information and accessibility has been lost in the meantime?  That could be an interesting benchmark for us to set for the new budget office as those involved assume office next year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orla O'Connor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016113000002#E00400"><p>I will address the first question on the pension issue.  What we are saying is not contradictory in respect of pension tax reliefs.  The National Women's Council of Ireland is recommending a universal pension.  This would be a pension available for everyone that would come from the State.  That should be the priority.  Let us consider what other countries do as well as the needs of women.  Once we start putting in contribution requirements, we are immediately discriminating against people who spend time out to care.  That is what is happening.  We have a system of homemaker credits but they are rather limited.  That is one of the reasons we are calling for a universal pension as a model.  Then, if there is to be a second tier, it should be done through the PRSI system.  No private model of pensions recognises time out of work.  That should not be the case.  The system should be equal for men and women but it is not at the moment.  At the moment the career patterns of women end up changing significantly because of care responsibilities.  No private pension model is going to accommodate that.  When we look at the spend on pensions, we need to look at the income forgone on tax reliefs.  If the tax forgone was invested in a universal pension, then we would have a far more equitable pension model.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the difference gender budgeting would make.  Let us consider the Scottish model.  Gender budgeting is a process all year round that involves consulting women's organisation and involves them in the process all the way through.  It also looks at the individual requests from various Departments and what the various impacts on women could be.  For example, let us consider the Department of Social Protection.  We would be considering factors such as the issues around lone parents.  If a gender budgeting process had been undertaken for this budget, the Government would probably have prioritised lone parents, because they were a particular group that experienced the most in cutbacks.  Issues such as the disregard for lone parents and how to make it easier for lone parents to move into employment are critical.  That is only one example.  The child care scheme would probably have come out well under gender-proofing.</p> <p>  Let us consider the Scottish model again.  As well as looking at individual Departments, the idea is to look at the overall spend and the associated impact on women.  Dr. Healy referred to the models we use in making a calculation.  We need to come up with a model that can look at impacts on women across the board in terms of overall spend.  That is part of the work we want to undertake with the committee.  I suppose that is what I meant when I said that this is not a tick the box exercise.  This can make a real difference to the lives of women.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016113000002#E00500"><p>Reference was made to the pensions question.  We carried out a study, published in 2013, on how a universal pension could replace the old age pension at the level of the contributory old age pension.  We used actuarial numbers produced for the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We costed it through to 2046 and we showed how it could be paid for.  It can be done.</p><p>We have built in all the population increases, the changes in the pension age and all that sort of stuff.  We have worked out exactly how a universal pension might be developed over the years and how it might be tied to growth in the consumer price index, economic growth and so on.  The total net cost would be &euro;140 million.  It would have been funded partly by standard rating, not eliminating, the pension tax break that exists at the moment and a couple of other relatively small changes.  We will publish a fully updated version of that study within a month so it will be available for the budget of 2018.</p><p> The second question was on budget information.  I am delighted that Deputy Calleary picked up on the issue because we have tried to get people to hear about it for a while.  We are of the view that if Deputies and Senators realise that they used to be provided with a lot more information then they might be interested in chasing it.  Let me give an example.  For the first time in my life GNP was not mentioned in the budget documentation this year.  That is extraordinary.  Our organisation has been berated for years for using GDP.  The reason we used GDP was for international comparisons.  We always put in GNP for the total tax take and various other pieces such as how one counts  overseas development aid.  We always got dog's abuse for using GDP, with the point being we should always use GNP, but the Government's budget document does not contain a single reference to GNP, which I find extraordinary.  There are issues about why that has happened and they must be pursued.  </p><p> Let me give another example.  The full-year costs were always given.  In a normal budget one would get the actual proposal, one would get a column that said the cost for this budget period, which is 2017 in this case, and a full-year cost.  Some things are full year cost in year one but a lot of stuff is not full-year cost in year one.  Welfare changes can happen later in the year.  A whole lot of other stuff and even some of the proposed tax changes are not in place for a full year in 2017. </p><p> Let me outline a third issue in overall terms.  The budget has been laid out in a slightly different way.  The document went through budget initiatives Department by Department or budget heading by budget heading.  Let us take health as an example.  It said we are going to increase the budget in health by X and it then showed where that budget was broken down.  At this moment we are not getting that.  What we are getting is the budget will be increased by this, and we are going to send that to the HSE, which will come back to us with a service plan that will implement all of the existing level of service plus these three or five new initiatives we have proposed.  My point is there is no basis for it.  I have pointed at health because we are quite sure that the numbers are wrong in health and we have said so already.  By the way, we have said it before and were right each time, particularly about the health budget.  I am saying it again and we can give more information if people are interested. </p></speech>

I agree with the broad thrust of the excellent analysis from both the National Women's Council and Social Justice Ireland.</p> <p>  Dr. Healy touched on a good point that was picked up by Deputy Calleary.  I hope it is a matter that the committee will consider.  It is extremely frustrating what happened this year and even last year.  Some of the presentation of the budget document changes every year and, therefore, is difficult to follow.  This term we are well used at analysing the fiscal space, how much is available and where it is but one cannot find it in the document without the expertise or help of the general secretaries of the Departments, who very much engage with us but that is after the fact.  A lot of this is about controlling the narrative.  This is the first year that the full-year effects were not produced.  I believe it was a political stroke because it would have made it very clear on budget day that not only was the Government committing the 2017 budget but more than half of the 2018 budget.  We raised this matter a number of weeks ago and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has amplified it today.  The numbers should have been made available.  I hope that the committee can do something in respect of this type of work.  </p> <p>  I would welcome the updated paper on pensions.  The issue has been raised by the National Women's Council as well.  I ask Social Justice Ireland to submit the updated paper to this committee for consideration.</p> <p>  I shall start with the pensions issue and the statistics.  One proposal that we included in our alternative budget this year was on the discrimination between the pension system.  We proposed that the pension band rates be returned to their pre-September 2012 position because women, in particular, were discriminated against because of yearly average contributions and would be on a lower rate as a result of the changes in 2012.  I wish to say to the National Women's Council that the issue has gained no traction in the public domain.  It is a terrible inequality that needs to be addressed.  Simple issues are put forward such as, for example, that standardisation is bad because one will lose a few euro if one is getting a pension or paying into a pension in the first place.  The rates, pension bands and what happened in 2012 has become very complex for people to understand.  Earlier the council cited some staggering figures.  It stated that 84% of people who receive a full State contributory pension are men.  That fact needs to be put up in lights and stated repeatedly.  I ask the National Women's Council to elaborate on the universality of pensions and, in the interim, to address some of the issues that took place in the past that would generate a direct benefit to females and access to full State contributory pensions.  </p></speech>

We have been unable to secure media coverage in a large way although the situation is changing.  Pensions have changed in the last budget.  Although the changes that we hoped for were not made, the issue of pensions was discussed much more as it was at the national economic dialogue.</p> <p>  In recent weeks we were happy to receive a small sum of money from the Community Foundation for Ireland for an outreach programme that will span the country.  We will primarily deal with women over the age of 65 to increase their knowledge of pensions.  While they of course have their own personal experience of the disadvantages of the pension system, we will start to increase their knowledge of pensions by providing training, starting in Letterkenny and Killarney.  We will increase the knowledge of these women and thus their capacity to lobby individually.  We will start to engage them in our own lobbying activities.  We hope that they will start to work at constituency level with their own representatives and local media to get this pension issue in the public eye.  We, as an organisation, agree with the Deputy that this issue needs greater highlighting.  Did the Deputy have a second question?</p></speech>

We know that the new budgetary committee will consider the matter in some fashion.  It is one of the things that we tried to do in the Finance Bill.  We wanted equality budgeting, that would encompass gender budgeting, included in the Finance Bill.  Unfortunately, it was impossible for us to do as we did not have the numbers.  I encourage the National Women's Council to continue its call for equality budgeting to be introduced.</p><p>That would put the spotlight on some of the changes made in 2012 and how the move was predominantly anti-women which was really made under the radar.  I compliment the National Women's Council of Ireland on its work in that regard.</p><p> On the gender pay gap, Sinn F&eacute;in took a position this year in calling for the removal of VAT from hotel bed costs.  We did this because the hotel sector, particularly in Dublin, was thriving but also because we believed the record of the sector was quite poor on the issue of low pay.  Does the National Women's Council of Ireland have any view on the low pay gap?  Are there particular sectors in which the gender gap is wider or is it across the board?</p></speech>

As we understand it, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has appointed an official to work with the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, on the public sector duty.  In starting to analyse its activities from an equality and human rights point of view it will start to bring up particular activities which will need greater resources.  It is a good step, as is the step taken by the Department of Justice and Equality in considering with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform the best ways forward to develop skills across the Civil Service.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has been looking at the issue of gender proofing and done a pretty good job for quite some time through its overseas aid programme.  It is really strict on meeting requirements in ensuring gender equality is a key part of a programme being carried out.  We do not want to underplay the fact that there is expertise in Departments to carry out this work.  There is a step on which to build.  We encourage the committee to start to scope out what has been done and build on it.</p> <p>  As we mentioned in our submission, the IHREC has just provided us with a sum of money.  We will start to work with civic society to build its knowledge of it.  We also intend to start to work with experts across Europe.  I am a member of the executive committee of the European Women's Lobby.  We have built great relationships with experts on gender budgeting.  We will bring them together both to increase the National Women's Councils of Ireland's knowledge and expertise and also to bring that knowledge and expertise to committee members.  We will be organising seminars and so on.</p> <p>  Our hope is we will identify a Department which will commit to working with us to create a demonstration project and put in place some of the recommendations with which we will come up.  We will be conducting a research piece.  If there are particular Departments the committee thinks would be a good place to start, we will be happy to hear about them.  We will also be speaking to the committee once we have conducted research to identify that Department.  We need a Department to commit to working with us to see how the project can be rolled out effectively.</p> <p>  There are several issues with regard to the gender pay gap in the hospitality, retail and cleaning sectors, all of which are problematic because often the contracts are for precarious work0.  Low-paid and part-time work is problematic.  Even in the public sector broadly, it is women who have been affected most by the cuts in pay because of the fact that most of the middle income earners are women.</p></speech>

We all rely on it analysis and the facts and figures provided by it.  On the first-time buyer's scheme - the help-the-builders' scheme - Social Justice Ireland stated it was pointless.  Did it arrive at that opinion before the Central Bank changed the macro prudential rules?  Will it elaborate on the reasons it believes it is pointless?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.28" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016113000002#G00400"><p>We had come to it before the Central Bank changed its position.  It was mentioned in the analysis we produced on the night of the budget.  If the cause of the problem is principally the lack of supply, we fail to see how this initiative will impact on it.  Accordingly, it is pointless in tackling the cause.  According to the Government, there are 89,000 households, not individuals, on housing waiting lists.  There will be a new count soon.  The last time we thought the numbers would have been halved, but, in actual fact, they had not gone down at all, even though the Government used a different methodology.  The 89,000 households are, for the most part, in the private rental sector or homeless.  The Government has a plan to deal with the issue.  The plan is welcome as it is the biggest for some time.  However, only 47,000 units will be produced under it by 2021.  That will still bring us only half way in dealing with the current problem, without any increase in the number of households.  There will, however, be an increase in the numbers on housing waiting lists because the demographics are changing.  It seemed to us that a different approach was required.  Despite all the pushing and shoving, the private sector did not seem to be able to generate a huge number of new builds.  We were proposing something different.  Perhaps the best way to deal with the problem is to look at it from the other side and see if we can take the 89,000 households out of the equation by building social housing for them.  Once they are taken out of the equation, one will have had a reduction of 89,000 households in the number looking for private rental accommodation.  That should change the equation and, I hope, bring supply and demand much closer to each other.  It is not rocket science.  This is economics course No. 101.</p></speech>

While the Government would not admit to this - Fianna F&aacute;il allowed this measure to come into being - the reality is that the scheme will push up house prices because developers claim their profit margins are not large enough to make it viable for them to start building.  The Central Bank's measure is that property prices will increase by close to or in excess of double-digit figures in the next 12 months.  This will increase profit margins for developers and, therefore, supply.  If that were to take place, would that not deal with the issue and, at least, justify the Government's position, even though it would deny that is its agenda?  The scheme will allow developers to achieve the figure of 15% because prices have gone up and, therefore, supply will start to increase in the market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.30" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016113000002#G00600"><p>We do not think so.  There is an issue about the cost of housing, about which there are many arguments.  We are not convinced that putting something in place that will give the developer extra money will generate extra supply.  It seems to us that in that analysis there is a failure to understand the 89,000 households on housing waiting lists will never buy a house.  Their incomes are so far removed from anything remotely close to what is required to get a mortgage to buy a house that they are not at the races.  We will still be left with 89,000 households on housing waiting lists and until such time as the Government puts a social housing programme in place to deal with them, we will be left with the problem.</p><p>Part of the issue is that there seems to be a certain slowness on the part of local authorities to start building.  From talking to people in local authorities, it seems that there is concern that central government is not really serious about building social housing.  There is a belief that it is really trying to get the housing market going again, that it will eventually create one almighty approved housing body that will be given the funding required to provide 100,000 social housing units over a period of time and that responsibility will be taken away from the local authorities.  That is the concern of some of the local authority officials with whom I have had discussions.  My basic position is that money could be made available at very lost, using off-the-books methodology which would require a rental cost approach and removing the ceiling in the differential rent system.  It is clear that there is the capacity to have an off-the-books mechanism to provide the funding needed to build units to eliminate the social housing problem.  Supply and demand would start to come into balance and it would then be very interesting to see what would happen with prices because they are being driven by demand.</p></speech>

I am sorry that I missed the initial presentations, but I had to be in the D&aacute;il Chamber to ask a parliamentary question.  I thank both organisations for all of their fantastic work which really helps to inform our understanding of these important issues every year.  I agree overwhelmingly with what the delegates have said.  I welcome their highlighting of the importance of access to analytical models and the proper staffing of the budgetary office.  I also welcome emphasis placed by them on spending on infrastructure and social services, as well as dealing with the pay and pensions gap for women.  On the latter, I have a question for the representatives of the National Women's Council of Ireland.  They mentioned the fact that precarious work - I would add outsourcing - was a major contributory factor to the pay gap for women.  What would the council propose to address that issue?  I have a few thoughts on it and the delegates may have mentioned some of them in their earlier presentation.  They include banning zero hour contracts, substantially increasing the minimum wage to make it a living wage and so forth.  What does the council believe we should do in that general area?</p> <p>  On the pensions gap, we have been discussing recently how a certain cohort of women who have worked for a long period and made total social insurance contributions which should make them eligible to receive the full contributory pension are not receiving it because they took a break at some point from paid work.  The payment is worked out based on yearly averages, as a result of which a large cohort of women are losing out.  I do not know if the delegates mentioned this earlier, but it suggests to me the pensions gap will actually widen in the coming years.  There is a large cohort of women who are reaching pension age who will be disadvantaged.  I agree with the council's recommendation of a universal pension as against providing private pension tax breaks.  </p> <p>  On the new child care scheme, is the council concerned that it will not start until September 2017?  The additional money allocated to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is very small, which suggests there is not a lot of funding available for the scheme, despite all the fanfare.  It appears that it will not make a significant difference because the amount of money necessary for it to be really effective has not been provided.  </p> <p>  I ask the representatives of the council to respond to these questions.  I will then put some specific questions to Social Justice Ireland.</p></speech>

I will respond briefly to them, but I can provide more details at a later date, if required.  </p> <p>  On the child care scheme, the view of the National Women's Council of Ireland of the decision of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Katherine Zappone, is that it represents a significant policy change.  We are happy that a universal subsidised child care service will be available.  We have mentioned our concern that the funding provided, &euro;80 per month, will not radically reduce the amount people have to spend on child care.  Child care costs are enormous, but the scheme represents a start.  In that context, we are delighted.  We fundamentally support the change in policy and have asked that the committee push for a significant increase in funding for the scheme in budget 2018.  As Ms O'Connor said, we speak to the Minister about the issue on a regular basis and intend to make a submission during the Department's consultation process.  There are a number of issues we want to address, in addition to the issue of funding.</p></speech>

Does the National Women's Council of Ireland believe it would be preferable to move towards a national child care service which was publicly provided rather than subsidising private sector providers?</p></speech>

The issues of precarious work and low hour contracts are also very important.  We welcome the Bill which has been brought forward by Senator Gerald Nash, although we have not yet analysed it in detail, but we are very happy, in principle, that such a Bill has been proposed.  We can analyse it further and make our views known on it.  We believe a significant amount of work is needed in this area.  In dealing with the gender pay gap the issue of child care provision is crucial.  As Ms O'Connor said, it is the major issue in dealing with the gender pay and pensions gaps.  The pension system is based on the male breadwinner model.  The provision of a universal, accessible child care service should, if properly resourced, help to reduce the gender pay gap.</p></speech>

As well as the issues mentioned, I welcome his reference to the fiscal rules and the need to address them.  Will he elaborate on the changes needed in that regard?  I wholeheartedly agree with his general comments.  Does he agree that EU state aid rules are also a major problem?  They are related to the fiscal rules in that they emanate from the same basic neoliberal approach.  We need to address them radically because they are a major blockage to public investment in infrastructure, services and so forth.</p><p>They are a major blockage to the public investment programmes, infrastructure, services and public enterprise we need.</p><p> Dr. Healy mentioned housing.  I agree wholeheartedly with him that we will not solve this problem unless we get back to large-scale local authority housing provision.  I wish to dig into this a little more because it is an issue that has not come up much.  He also pointed to all the other problems in the current approach.  Does he agree with me that there is a very significant cost to the State in the approach being undertaken, as limited and unsatisfactory as it is?  He has outlined the numbers and the fact that the 47,000 units will not deal with the current numbers or those that will come on board.  So much of rebuilding Ireland depends on long-term leasing arrangements of one variety or another, whether HAPs, long-term leasing initiatives or whatever.  What is not being calculated even within the 47,000 is the long-term cost to the State.  All this money will be going out, and the amount will increase exponentially.  I do not think this has been drilled into.  I do not know if the witnesses agree with me or if they have thought about this, but it is a real question we must ask.  How much money will be going out over the years rather than into the creation of a fixed asset for the State and a local authority rather than privately leased housing from the State?  Could the witnesses comment on this?</p><p> My last question concerns an area where we have had some disagreements over the years, namely, the emphasis on not cutting taxes for middle income earners, whether USC, water and property taxes or whatever.  I wish to ask the witnesses about this again.  Social Justice Ireland always rightly emphasises the issue of equality.  Is it not the case that in the context of about 50% of workers, even those who earn what are called middle incomes, effectively no longer being solvent, it is entirely right for us to champion their getting to a point at which their earnings can afford the basics?  To take housing as the biggest cost for people, such is its high cost that housing alone is making people effectively insolvent even if they are in the middle income earning bracket.  The real problem is that, rather than opposing tax breaks at this level, which might bring the middle income earners up a little as well as the low income earners, the area we really need to go after is corporate tax.  I know the witnesses would agree with that, but there needs to be much more emphasis on this and on genuine wealth taxes.  These are the areas where, it seems to me, a huge amount of money is not addressed properly in budgets, even in the discussions surrounding them.  It is addressed by Social Justice Ireland, but it seems to me that successive Governments are just not interested in this area at a time when profits and profit share as against wage share have gone through the roof.  There seems to be no interest in a redistributive tax system, which is what we need to go for, or the recent CSO figures, which I think show that the wealthiest 10% have increased their share of all wealth from 42% to 54%.  This is the problem.  This is what is exacerbating inequality.  We need to target in a very focused way this 10% and profits as the way to redistribute in a serious way.</p></speech>

There is a huge long-term cost to HAP, and this is the challenge.  If the private rented sector is relied on to provide social housing, there will be a significant long-term cost to the State.  That is why we have argued and continue to argue that the social housing element of the housing crisis in which we find ourselves needs to be separated out from and addressed separately to the private rented sector.  We made this argument in our presentation to the special Oireachtas committee on housing.  Of the numbers for housing announced in the budget, the majority, 15,000, are to be delivered through HAP, so only 4,450 will actually be constructed.  This is the real challenge.  The building of a social housing unit is a one-off cost to the State, and the State then has an asset.  If a cost-rental system is then introduced, the State can generate some income from the asset.</p> <p>  Second, to touch on the question regarding income taxes and tax cuts, the statistics show that those on middle incomes earn between &euro;27,000 and &euro;30,000 per annum, so any tax cuts for them will be very small.  What should be done is investment in the social wage or, in other words, reducing their cost of living.  This is done by investing in child care, public transport, health, education and so on because there is no way income tax can be reduced so much as to give middle income earning individuals enough money in their pockets to purchase all these services in the private market.  Therefore, the cost of living needs to be reduced.  In order to do so, there needs to be investment in the collective social wage, from which all of us benefit.  Some of us contribute more than others, but we would never be able to afford all these services on our own.</p></speech>

We published a briefing at the time of the proposed reform and the referendum for an Oireachtas committee that was examining the matter.  This was before the referendum on the fiscal rules.  We pointed out that the measures were quite dangerous.  We set out what would happen, which is exactly what has happened.  What has happened is that we now have the capacity within the country to build the infrastructure and develop services up to European average levels but are hindered in doing so because we cannot access the money due to the fiscal rules.  We pointed out at the time - I believe this even more so now, and we are joined in our concerns by many serious people, big names - that the fiscal rules are not really solutions to the economic issues with which they were meant to deal.  Quite recently, we met with the IMF evaluation unit that is examining the IMF's evaluation of its proposals for Ireland at the start of the bailout.  It is quite clear that it now recognises that it could have got the same results for far less austerity and job losses, which were the two critical issues over which we argued with the IMF every three months during its visits here over all those years.</p> <p>  How can the fiscal rules be dealt with?  There are a number of proposals.  We are not alone in this: the French, the Italians and others have suggestions as to how to deal with them.  One very good one, from my perspective, and which I would recommend, is that money going towards investment should not be counted in the calculation at all.  If one builds a house, as Ms Murphy has said, it is built.  It does not have to be built again next year.  Therefore, it is a kind of one-off investment.  This kind of investment in infrastructure should not be included in the calculation.  This is quite different from wage increases or new employees that will recur in the following years.  However, if this suggestion were acted on, Ireland would have more than sufficient space, and the money is there to be borrowed.  Our problem will be that the time would have passed and the interest rates would have risen before Europe gets around to doing it.  In a decade or two or three, people will look back on this generation of politicians and Governments and ask what possessed them, when money was available at a rate of 1% to Government, not to access it to provide the infrastructure that they will have spent decades having to put in place.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.43" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016113000002#K00200"><p>I take a similar approach to the state aid rules.  We need to recognise that Ireland started out, when it joined the European Union, at something like 75% or 78% of the European average - our infrastructure is not at the European 15 average at all.  I do not think anybody claims that it is and the same applies to our services.  While we would like to have the best in Europe, people believe that we should have at least the European average.  We have to recognise that we are substantially below that.  Therefore, the state aid rules, the fiscal rules and other rules, as well as issues relating to bailouts, austerity and the speed at which we need to reduce debt and so on need to bear in mind that the country at the end of the day needs to put the infrastructure in place to give it the capacity to develop an economy and a society that can maintain itself through the various economic cycles that will come.  We will have crashes in the future, just as we have had them in the past.  That is the nature of the economic cycle.</p> <p>  On the third issue about not cutting taxes on middle-income earners, it is important to note what we have proposed.  For example, we referred to things that would have made a difference to people on PAYE.  Our budget submission proposed to increase the PAYE tax credit; to make tax credits refundable - that would have benefitted low-income people and not middle-income people, but it would have been very positive.  We proposed standard rating so that the benefits of the tax breaks are at the same percentage meaning that somebody on 40% does not get twice the tax break for a pension, or whatever, that somebody on a lower income gets.</p> <p>  We also proposed reform of the research and development tax credit to remove the refund element of that.  The most important one for us was to introduce a minimum effective corporation tax rate.  We have no doubt that that can be done and it should apply to all profits coming through the country and not just what is declared to be profits by some grouping, whether that is a company, the Revenue, the Department of Finance or whatever.</p> <p>  We agree with tax on sugar-sweetened drinks, as well as taxing empty housing or underdeveloped land.  We need to restore the windfall gain tax on rezoned land which had been introduced but was removed in 2015 just when it was starting to make some impact.  It could not have made any impact before that - as there was no land on sale, there were no windfall gains.  The introduction of a financial transactions tax was another example.</p> <p>  In the longer overall approach, we do not believe we need to go as far as even having the European average tax take as a percentage of GDP, but we need to move towards it.  We are a long way below it; along with a few of the eastern European countries we are very close to the bottom in the European tax leagues.  We need to change our approach in that context.  Then we can make choices.  For example, there are issues to do with resource taxes.  We need to think more about how we address climate change and promote environmental protection through the tax system.  There are many issues there.</p></speech>

A number of witnesses appeared before the committee in advance of the budget, including Seamus Coffey from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  He said:</p><blockquote>If one looks at income tax, sales taxes like VAT, corporation tax, which is now above the OECD average, and other taxes, we are close to the average for most of them.  There might be differences in how we collect the money.  With income tax, we are close to the OECD average for the amount of money collected but we collect it in a much different manner from other countries.</blockquote> <p>Can Dr. Healy explain the discrepancy?</p></speech>

There are some quite serious differences when the calculations are done.  When one tax is compared with the same tax elsewhere in isolation, then one can be completely different from the other.  It is necessary to look at the overall tax take.  The OECD has a methodology for doing this.  EUROSTAT has a slightly different version of that.  They will both show comparisons for all the European countries, which show that Ireland's total tax take is down in the bottom four or five countries out of the EU 28.</p> <p>  When that is broken down, the biggest difference is in employers' PRSI, which in a country like France is four times what it is in Ireland as a percentage.  We are making choices.  We argue for impact assessment in advance of the budget and not after it - the kind of stuff I was talking about earlier.  We should be mature enough as a nation to ask ourselves about the choices we are making on taxation.  We need to consider the whole ball of wax, the complete tax take, including local charges, VAT, water charges, income tax, all the pieces of PRSI and so on.  We need to split it out, and see what the comparisons are and what they tell us the choices we are making.  We then need to be mature enough as a Government to say, "We are making this choice for that reason."  Let the evidence speak.</p></speech>

I read the submission from the National Women's Council, which correctly pointed to a significant policy change in this budget.  It is a very specific and welcome intervention to provide child care support for low-income families specifically using registered child care facilities.  The second payment cannot be called a universal payment.  How can it be called a universal payment when a full category of parents - usually women - who are caring for children themselves or are caring through a relative are not entitled to any such payment?</p><p>I have a fundamental concern that we have made that significant policy change and that the implication will be very significant in making it difficult for those who want to care themselves.  For example, in Dublin where property is so expensive, if one form of child care is supported by the State, which is welcome, and another form is not, the other one becomes increasingly unviable with resultant social consequences.  I recently had an exchange with the Minister, Deputy Zappone, in the D&aacute;il about Senator Elizabeth Warren's book <i>The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents Are Going Broke</i>.</p><p>I accept the need to support parents particularly in low-income families where we want to tackle poverty, but I am really concerned that the method discriminates against parents who may want to raise children at home or use a relative.  I cannot understand or accept the word &quot;universal&quot; being used because it see it as the very opposite of universal - if we are supporting one type of care why are we not supporting another kind of care?</p><p>I have a philosophical question.  In a sense we have sold our souls to an American, OECD or European Commission job-activation measure which is all about getting the economy going and getting as many people working as possible, and does not value caring because it is telling a category of parents using one type of caring that we do not value that type of caring.  I do not criticise the intention of supporting those on lower incomes in particular who are using child care, with which I absolutely agree.  However, why should we make this policy change where we do not leave it to the parent to decide what is best?  Historically, that was the approach taken.  Every family and every child is different and living in different circumstances.  The parents are in the best position to choose the appropriate care model.  Why is the National Women's Council supporting a system that discriminates against those who choose a particular model?</p></speech>

There are a couple of pieces.  A core priority in the National Women's Council's work is to increase economic independence for women.  There are a number of reasons for that.  Without economic independence, women are more vulnerable in society.  That is a fact.  In addition, they are more vulnerable to violence, domestic abuse and so on.  Economic independence is a crucial element of women's equality in society.  Providing subsidised child care is a key element of ensuring women participate in the labour market and in other forms of civic engagement.  That is where we are coming from.  We do not at all suggest that providing support for women who are working and women who have the option of staying in the home should be preclusive.  It should not be mutually exclusive.  It should not be one or the other.  The National Women's Council has been talking very clearly about what providing a subsidised model of child care allows.<br/><br/><b></b>The National Women's Council has been working on this for about a decade.  Over the past decade, at least, we have heard consistently on the radio, certainly before every budget, that there needs to be a child care model subsidised by the State and that child care levels are precluding women from entering the workforce.  That has to be addressed.  This initiative is the first step in addressing that.  We reject the idea that it should be a matter of one or the other.  There should be other supports for women who are caring for their children in the home.  The National Women's Council does not suggest at all that there should be one or the other.  That, of course, is a choice that needs to be made by a woman and the family.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.49" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2016113000002#L00200"><p>Is that not what we have here?  The definition in the policy change is such that it is preclusive.  The previous approach was through child benefit and other mechanisms, which were genuinely universal, to target parents with young children, in particular, and support them.  Admittedly, there was an increase to the home carer's benefit but it is marginal.  Some &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million was allocated for hundreds of thousands of people so it is almost negligible.  Therefore, what has been introduced is discriminatory by definition.  I do not hear the National Women's Council arguing for equal supports for individuals at home, largely women.  What we are getting is an non-equal approach.</p> <p>  I have a point on seeking economic independence.  The argument for it goes without saying.  Let us go back to Senator Elisabeth Warren's evidence that giving economic independence to everyone working all the time actually decreases economic independence in the end.  The experience in the United States is that it has led to massive levels of bankruptcy and difficulties, particularly for those couples in a dual-income trap.  Their cost base increased because of the competitive bidding up of prices of housing, health care, child care and so on.  This leads to an economy in which, if anything happens in a family in respect of a child with a disability, special needs, special circumstances, illness or other life circumstances demanding flexibility, there is not economic independence but a precarious economic situation.  Evidence presented very clearly by Senator Elizabeth Warren is that the outcome is not independence.  This is what the United States has created and what we are replicating here.  It is actually an economic growth model that leads to economic uncertainty and difficulties in the long run.</p></speech>

Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett asked us about legislating against precarious working conditions and contracts.  We stated in our pre-budget submission that this should happen.  We have also called for an increase to the home carer's credit.  We seek a further increase in that.<br/><br/>Ms Michelle Murphy has talked about the need for lowering the cost of living across Ireland.  That needs to happen in addition to the introduction of the new scheme proposed by the Minister.  A range of measures need to be put in place.  The initial affordable child care scheme cannot address all the issues the Deputy identified but it certainly makes provision for women who wish to engage in the labour market.<br/><br/>Many issues arise over the activation policies that are in place.  The National Women's Council refers to them regularly.  We have carried out research on young women who are incredibly frustrated by the fact that the activation measures currently in place are forcing them into the very same sectors that are offering part-time precarious work.  This is often due to <i>de facto</i>unconscious gender bias in that the officers assume the women want to go into the types of roles that women go into, thus forcing them into sectors such as the retail and hospitality sectors, where they will be stuck in low-paid, precarious jobs.<br/><br/>There is a range of measures.  If Deputy Eamon Ryan has not seen our pre-budget submission, he should note it touches on a number of the issues he is raising.</p></speech>

We state families must be able to avail of the care that is most suitable for them.  If one wants to care for one's child at home, one should not be forced to use child care.  We hope the proposal is the first step in the Minister looking at the really detailed interdepartmental working group report on early years.  The report considered not only child care providers who provide care in their own homes and the question of how parents who want to care for their children at home can be supported.  One would hope this is the beginning of a suite of measures.  This requires an approach that is much broader than one budget.  My concern, which was echoed by some members of this committee, is the very limited resources allocated to the Department.  There is no multiannual budgeting.  We will certainly be bringing this up when the Minister is having a policy consultation on the strategy for children between zero and six.  I am sure this will come up.  One cannot be prescriptive in terms of how people want to care for their children.  A national child care service has to encompass more than just provision in a certain setting.  One has to enable companies to take the option that is most appropriate for them.</p></speech>

I also agree on pensions.</p> <p>  I see us repeating the same mistake again.  We see certain tasks as work if they are in the paid economy.  If they are not in the paid economy, they are not regarded as work and do not count or matter.  That is what this budget said.  That was a tragedy.  I am not sure if Dr. Se&aacute;n Healy has a view on that issue.</p></speech>

We had a conference last Tuesday in Croke Park on the very issues of universality and access to money.  We went on at some length about the fact that work is more than a paid job.  This needs to be recognised but it is not at the moment because care work is not paid for.  All sorts of caring tasks are done in society that are just taken as a given.  They are done by families and within families.  Since they are not paid for, they are not recognised as paid work.</p> <p>  Our view is that all these kinds of things need to move towards universality.  Therefore, one needs a basic income put into place so every child and every man and woman, including older persons, will have access to a basic income automatically every week and every year of their lives.</p><p>That is always there, that type of universality.  Then, one builds on top of it the fact that every adult has the right to meaningful work.  However, that means people who are unemployed have a right to meaningful work as well.  There is more to meaningful work than a paid job.  We need to think in those terms.  We are thinking about shaping up society and the economy for the changes that are coming.  The changes in digitalisation and technology that are coming down the line are going to lead to major job losses in some sectors.  We need to recognise that even in that world, if we cannot replace the jobs with other paid employment, people still have a right to work.  As such, we need to structure our society for that purpose.  That is what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

I have a meeting to get to that started 20 minutes ago and it is taking a lot of time for people to make a contribution.  That is not specifically directed at Deputy Ryan.  I just want to get my questions on the record, but I really have to run.</p> <p>  Dr. Healy referred to the need to have an adult conversation.  I put it to him that we need to have a conversation in this country about what we are willing to do to have certain services, a basic income and a universal pension.  We will have to pay a lot of tax to fund that.  We are at loggerheads because we do not want to pay excessive taxes, yet we want all of these fantastic services.  It is about having that conversation about how one strikes that balance.  Deputy Ryan has asked about how to broaden the tax base.  What are Dr. Healy's suggestions for doing that because we will be having a conversation about it?  The Chairman has already spoken to Dr. Healy about his suggestion that we collect one of the lowest amounts of tax in Europe.  It does not feel like that for most people.  I acknowledge that Dr. Healy answered on the PRSI issue, but does he have any comments to make around the tax bands and the ways to broaden the tax base, increase revenues and make things a little bit fairer?</p> <p>  I note Dr. Healy's comments that we are underfunding the education sector.  I have an institute of technology in my constituency which is at risk of closing next year.  It was put to me very simply that if it were a private company, it would be going into examinership in January.  That is how badly off it is.  It is not just that institute of technology; it is the entire sector.  While the universities are a little better able to weather the storm, institutes of technology are under severe pressure.  I would welcome Dr. Healy's thoughts on that given the Cassell's report we had in the past number of months.</p> <p>  To the National Women's Council, I note that I do not need to reiterate what everyone else has said about the pensions issue.  It is disgraceful and shocking that women are being so disadvantaged.  I welcome the council's research on that which definitely helps to inform us as to how we fix that issue.  The bottom line is that it needs to be fixed.  The reality is that women were forced out of the workplace through laws we passed and we are now penalising them for it.  I want to get some comments from the council on parental leave and how it might address the gender pay gap.  Sometimes the gender pay gap is thought to be a matter of two people being paid different rates for the same job.  It is actually not that.  It is the average incomes of men versus the average incomes of women and women earn less.  While there are often situations where one is getting paid less for the same work, it is also that one is in lower paid or part-time employment and all of those things.  Access to parental leave might level the playing field a little so that one has access to those higher earning jobs and greater career progression.</p> <p>  Both groups touched in their reports on the situation of under-25s and social welfare rates.  I have said before and repeat for the record that it is clear discrimination on the basis of age.  We expect those people to pay full taxes in employment, yet we do not offer them the same social protections.  I welcome the witnesses' comments on that.  It is good to have it on the record.</p></speech>

We made a presentation and suggested that here should be a very generous water allowance for all households depending on the number of people there and all excess water should be charged for.  It sounds familiar, does it not?  In fact, it sounded really familiar reading this morning's papers.  Most Irish people would be fair about that if the other piece that needed to be put in was there.  That piece is serious and substantial investment to deal with leaks and sewage issues that are not being addressed.  For us, it is quite clear how we should have proceeded in the first place.  The problem was that it got caught up in a whole lot of other stuff that did not necessarily have a great deal to do with water but had to do with people suffering with too much austerity, which I have already talked about.  Some of the pressure for that, at least, came from outside the country.</p> <p>  On public sector pay, we are very aware of the fact that any increase in public sector pay, not just this coming year, but any time, involves a choice about resources.  Obviously, people need to be paid the going rate for the job, whatever that happens to be, but in times of scarce resources choices have to be made between infrastructure, services, pay and a range of other issues.  We suggest very strongly that all sectors of society should be engaged in that process.  Formerly, we had a process for doing that in social partnership, which was perhaps imperfect albeit not as bad as it is sometimes portrayed to be.  I am not saying we should go back to social partnership as it was, but I am saying that unless we involve all sectors of society in the decision making this requires, parts of society will not support the decisions and one will wind up to the broken approach to development that we see in politics in Britain, the USA and, possibly, other European countries.</p> <p>  The only thing I said in the public arena at the Brexit forum organised by the Taoiseach was that I was interested in, supported and welcomed the fact that there was a great deal of focus on the consequences of Brexit.  Until I stood up and made the point, however, there was not one comment on the causes of Brexit.  Unless we deal with the causes of Brexit, that type of thing will come again from another country in another space.  It could even happen in Ireland.  The issues that have to be addressed in that context are very close to the issues that have to be addressed when choices are made with relatively scarce resources between pay and tax and tax cuts and infrastructure and service development.</p> <p>  Certainly, we need a conversation on the cost of universal services.  The numbers we have looked at very closely over a long time suggest we can deliver universal services and infrastructure at a level that is at the European average but for slightly less than the European average tax take.  However, we cannot do it for as little as we have at the moment.  Deputy Chambers said it did not feel like we were a low-tax country.  I accept that a lot of people feel that way.  It is partly due to a certain kind of socialisation into the idea that we are high-tax country.  It is never presented that tax is a contribution we make as citizens to the development of our own infrastructure, services, protection and all the rest of it.  If we compare ourselves to the Nordic countries, they take 50% of our tax take again on top of what we have.  They have no issue about it and cutting it is not in issue no matter who is in government because they deliver services and infrastructure.  People see it and want it to be in place.</p> <p>  Does Ms Murphy want to refer to the issue about under-25s?</p></speech>

The poverty rate in that age cohort has increased dramatically since the welfare cuts were brought in.</p><p>The problem now is that the cut is almost embedded in the system so it seems that under-26s will always be at a disadvantage.  </p><p> In terms of the underfunding of education, institutes of technology are probably feeling the heat the most at the moment.  The Cassells report made a number of specific recommendations about what route Government could take in order to fund education.  It was really disappointing that the Minister announced another consultation on budget day.  It will not address the issue.  We will have another year of consultation.  Will somebody then be willing to make a decision and say that we need more funding for higher education and then make the difficult choice about how that is done?  We should have a discussion about whether we want the service and whether a student charge should be introduced.  Even if that is done, the amount of State expenditure and funding will have to be increased.  That is a discussion that needs to be had in the context of the question about services and taxes.  We need to broaden the base.  Many people do not feel low taxed, which goes back to the social wage issue I spoke about earlier because people have to buy services in the private market.</p></speech>

I thank the Deputy for her support for many of the positions we are putting forward, which is really heartening to hear.  There is a really low take-up of parental leave in Ireland because it is not paid.  The National Women's Council has welcomed the introduction of two weeks paid paternity leave.  In addition to that, there is a need for the introduction of paid parental leave.  We will continue to push for that and we hope to see committee-wide support for it.<br/><br/>In terms of the gender pension gap, there are a range of steps that need to be taken.  It would be really heartening and welcomed if the committee put a motion forward to prioritise the issue of pensions over the next year and, in particular, to push for a reduction in the gender pension gap.  That could be done by suggesting an open consultation on the introduction of the universal pension and by the introduction of a homemaker's credit backdated to 1973.  If those two steps were taken in the first instance we would be a long way closer to reducing the gender pension gap.  I can send around our most recent submission on the universal pension so the committee has the information.  <br/><br/>We have been pushing for gender inequality budgeting.  There will be a &euro;5 increase for contributory pensions, but because it is<i>pro rata </i>it will not have the same benefits for women as it will for men.  There are all these introductions of what seem to be very promising first steps to increasing people's economic sustainability, in comparison to the past seven years, yet they are not doing what they need to for women and what they are doing for men.  Gender inequality budgeting would allow the women of Ireland to see how much the Government prioritises their economic independence and general well-being.  It would empower women to argue for particular actions to be taken if they could see very clearly the difference between the impacts of Government decisions in each budget.  That can only be done if really effective gender inequality budgeting is introduced.  Gender inequality budgeting should not just look at expenditure, which is what we focused on today, but also on revenue.  That is being done in Austria, Sweden and Scotland.  We will be bringing together experts on that, which we can bring to the committee's attention.  We will invite the committee to ask them to appear before the committee.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate it.  I will start with the National Women's Council and then move to Social Justice Ireland.  I was delighted to hear the National Women's Council describe the child care work of the Minister, Deputy Zappone, as breakthrough work.  I was gobsmacked at the cacophony of negativity that it was greeted with.  The witness summed it up well.  It is the first step in a fundamentally different direction.  I was stunned to hear so many people stand up and just give out about it.  For every person I heard compliment it, I heard five people say it did not go far enough, which was very disappointing because the Minister should have been supported in what she was trying to do.  The National Women's Council has struck the balance well by recognising it as a step and, critically, as a fundamentally new direction for the country to get somewhere.  I want to acknowledge that.  It is nice to see some positivity rather than all the negativity the Minister has been subjected to since the budget.  I just wanted to point that out.</p> <p>  Are the witnesses finding that the pay gap, which grew by 2% during the recession, is steady across the ages?  Is it narrowing?  Are we fixing it at younger ages between men and women or is it maintaining for men and women in their 20s, 30s and 40s?</p></speech>

There are a number of things that are effective.  We talked about the activation policies for young women.  Our concern, as I said, is that the activation policies are pushing young women into the same sectors they have been in previously.  If that is the case, and that is what is being reported to us at the moment, it is a worrying continuation of one aspect of the gender pay gap.  Other than that, a small increase in the minimum wage will not get us very far.  We would like the introduction of the living wage, which would make an enormous difference.</p></speech>

It would be very powerful to be able to see that.</p> <p>  I have started to read through the National Women's Council universal pension idea.  It is expensive; it was costed at about &euro;700 million.  That is a chunk of change in anyone's book.  There are an increasing number of people who have either retired or are close to retirement, particularly women as was pointed out earlier, who are finding they do not meet the contributory pension eligibility criteria and do not qualify for the non-contributory pension because they are a so-called dependent.</p> <p>  I have looked in the last few weeks into the minutiae of the detail and it turns out that if one works for ten years, one gets the full pension.  If people were unfortunate enough to work for three weeks after their leaving certificate back in the 1970s or if they work for 25 years, they could find themselves with less.  Typically what is happening is worse than that.  As men worked and got the stamps, it is nearly always women who were unfortunate enough to be signed up to a month's work or a year's work and then there is a big gap.  As the witnesses pointed out, it has not gone back far enough in terms of the home-makers and so on.  How big a problem is the National Women's Council finding this is?  The witnesses have clearly done a lot of thinking around the State pension.  Deputies have a very strange view of the world.  They are a bit like doctors, who might think that everyone in Ireland is sick because they only ever meet sick people.</p><p>Deputies only tend to meet people who are in trouble, so they do not have a very good sense of what is actually going on.  I guess both groups here would have a view on this.  How big an issue is it for men and women?  It seems to be mainly for women nearing retirement who are finding out that they have been absolutely destroyed because they worked for one or two years in their early 20s.</p></speech>

The greatest number of phone calls, e-mails and letters we receive relate to the gender pension gap and we have a time responding to them.  This was our rationale for looking for funding from the Community Foundation for Ireland.  We have been lobbying on this for a long time.  We engage with and support those women in redirecting them to other supports they might be able to utilise but we are starting to engage with individual women across Ireland and to build up their capacity to push for pension justice on an individual level and within their communities.  It is an enormous issue.  As I said previously, we will send our submission to the committee and this will provide it with a very rounded view of the difficulties women face.</p></speech>

It is &euro;140 million.  The interesting thing about it is that different costings have been done on this.  For ten years, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners maintained that it would cost &euro;3 billion to do it.  We commissioned a study in 2013 and brought it before a committee.  It showed quite clearly that the actual figure at that point was &euro;140 million.  The committee then brought in the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners and the first thing they did was cut their estimate from &euro;3 billion to &euro;700 million.  The committee then asked us whether we would be prepared discuss the matter and get our technical people, who produce the actual spreadsheets, to sit down with officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue.  It was actually Revenue that was really doing the calculations.  We said we would do so.  An hour after that meeting began, Revenue halved its figure to &euro;350 million.  There was no further engagement on the issue.  We stand by our figure and we are also producing a fully updated version of it.  Like the 2013 figure, it is based on actuarial numbers used by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance and the actual costings and is clearly done on the basis of population projections.  We will use the new population projections on the basis of the new census.  Finally, we show how it can be paid for through standard rating and a number of other small changes - nothing dramatic.  Given that the figure is &euro;140 million, it is not a huge amount.  It is a totally different type of animal to &euro;700 million in a budget context.  It would put the equivalent of a full contributory pension into the pocket of everybody of that age.</p></speech>

We have made our proposals here but we have those proposals as well so we are updating the cost based on the new census projections.</p></speech>

If the committee is meeting and doing the algebra of raising and spending money, in the context of the latter, we would have to put in &euro;714 million.  That is what I am interested in.  Is there an 80-20 version of that says that if one was to do that for everybody, it is the Rolls Royce solution but is too expensive on its own but that a number of people who are falling between the stools and unfairly penalised for having worked for a month 35 years ago could be catered for?

The proportion of the people in receipt of less than the full contributory pension is a very high proportion of the number in receipt of some form of contributory pension.  An awful lot of people out there fit into the categories mentioned by the Deputy, for example, they worked for a few weeks after their leaving certificate and then did not have the actual numbers.  In effect, people get percentages.  Many people get &euro;172 rather than &euro;230.  Another very large group of people gets substantially less than that because they did not have those ten years.  That is what the ten years earns a person.</p></speech>

This is an open question.  The committee is looking at a full-year budget for the first time.  In terms of gender equality, be it in respect of opportunity, retirement age and the pay gap - the entire gamut of gender equality - does the council have a top three list of items it believes the committee should recommend to the D&aacute;il for next year?</p></speech>

During the debate on the Social Welfare Bill in the Seanad, a commitment was made in the context of producing a report on the impact on lone parents of social and economic changes that have taken place since 2002.  We would be really interested in seeing the results of that.  If it was done in an appropriate manner, and we can certainly feed into framing that, it would be interesting.  The prioritisation of lone parents is key because they have been one and remain one of the most disadvantaged groupings.  The third item would be driving the gender equality budgeting process.  It is tricky choosing between that and the increased resourcing of child care.  If the Deputy would accept a fourth item, it would be child care.  Those would be the three items on the list.</p></speech>

It is not a smart thing to do.  There are other ways of helping.  It is not about less support.  My belief, rightly or wrongly, is that if people are paying taxes, it is empowering.  They feel that they have a right to demand more of their State because they are paying for it.  I am wary of taking lower income workers out of the tax net.  It is not about penalising anyone.  There are other ways to use the money.</p><p> Would Social Justice Ireland like to see lower income workers out of the tax net or should there be some amount of payment as a psychological tool so that people feel that they have a right to demand justice, equality, services, fair play and so forth?</p></speech>

Much of the time, this is not recognised by anyone except the people themselves.  They get a great deal of abuse for being "freeloaders" even though they pay VAT, levies and so forth.</p> <p>  Taking people out of the tax net and lowering what they pay in tax have little value to people on low-to-middle incomes if services and infrastructure do not replace, and more than replace, the money that has been taken away.  There is a balance to be found between the money that people are contributing to society in tax and the investment in services delivered for same.  Ireland's problem is that our infrastructure and services are far below the European average and our tax take is commensurate with that, and if we want to give people an advantage, we reduce taxes further instead of increasing infrastructure, for example, broadband and social housing, or improving services, be they health, education or something else.</p> <p>  The tax take should rise over time towards the European average - it does not necessarily need to reach it - principally through broadening the tax base.  That money should then be used for investing in better services and so on.  In this way, low-income people would pay a little bit of income tax, but their infrastructure - social housing, broadband and public transport - and health and education services would be much improved.</p> <p>  We are suggesting that this be done via five budget priorities, although one is governance, which might not cost much.  The Government needs to consider the idea of a vibrant economy.  There should be adequate investment in programmes that we have identified as needing it.  Social housing and rural broadband are the two obvious ones.  Their development would be good for the economy, the individual and society in many ways.  We have thoughts on many other programmes, but those are just two.</p> <p>  We have gone on and on about decent services and infrastructure this afternoon, but it is important that they be improved.  For this reason, we would invest in broadband and social housing.  We would also invest in health, education and welfare.  Welfare rates-----</p></speech>

That last addresses the working poor issue.  A minimum effective corporate tax rate should be introduced and there should be good governance.  For example, resource the independent budget office properly and expand the ongoing social and economic dialogue to include all sectors and cover all issues, not just pay.</p> <p>  I will provide a practical suggestion on sustainability.  Promote the idea, and publish shadow national accounts.  This does not mean that the national accounts be dropped.  Rather, a new set should be developed alongside them.  Several other countries have done this.  These accounts include the cost of, for example, environmental damage and the value of unpaid work.  This provides a different picture of the economy and society and leaves one in a much better space when trouble hits and a decision needs to be made.  Shadow national accounts may show the impact that one would not see from just examining the standard national accounts, GNP, GDP and so on.</p></speech>

Where we would be?  No, I agree wholeheartedly.</p> <p>  I will ask a simple question to which there may not be a simple answer.  Social Justice Ireland is on the national media a great deal concerning homelessness and it works in that area.  I am not referring to housing, but emergency accommodation for the men, women and, God forgive us, children who are out there tonight, and have been out there last night and the night before, freezing.  I am not discussing clever, integrated services that get people back into homes.  I am discussing a country in which people do not freeze outside at night.  Aside from an integrated service, how much would it take to stop just that bit from happening?  Has Social Justice Ireland a sense of what a Government cheque would need to amount to in order to stop men, women and children from being cold and homeless tonight?</p></speech>

Two years ago, the homeless agency had a strategy and claimed that type of homelessness could be eliminated within 18 months.  It cited a figure, although I do not have it to hand.  Such an amount would not have solved the social housing and private rental issues, but it would have solved that.  The figure is available.  It has probably increased since then because the number of people in homelessness has increased.</p></speech>

I want to go back to a point made by the Chairman on the level of taxation.  This committee spent some time looking at where we are at regarding public spending.  Reference was made to Mr. Seamus Coffey, who said that we are a lower tax economy and a lower spend economy, however the majority of that lower spend and lower tax is in social insurance as seen in pensions.  Mr. Coffey said that when one actually strips out other European social spend, and when we look at the national accounts and strip out social insurance contributions including employers' PRSI, and we strip out the fact that Ireland has a really low State pension, which is paltry - a lot of other countries have a contribution-based pension - then according to Mr. Coffey actually our total spend on other public services and out total revenue raised are in and around the European average.  I contacted Mr. Coffey and asked for the data on this and I am still waiting on a  reply.  That is, however, what he told the committee and it is my understanding that he knows this stuff quite well.  If we assume that he is broadly correct - there may be technicalities - and if we assume that what he is saying is directionally correct, would the National Women's Council and Social Justice Ireland be in favour of moving in both places?  Would they say that they want to see higher social insurance contributions of probably a mixture of individual contributions and employer contributions, and that we would move from a relatively flat-based pension support system to a contribution-based system?  This would mean that people on higher incomes would end up with higher pensions so it is not a perfect choice.  What is Dr. Healy's view on that?</p></speech>

I wish to be very clear on this.  Our proposal has been that there should be two separate initiatives.  One is the introduction of a universal State pension along the lines that we have spoken about, put the cost of it down and go for that.  On the other side we have also proposed that the State create its own pension fund into which any worker could put money throughout their lives that would be managed by NTMA or such a body with a similar level of competence, and that would basically be able to outperform, we would think, market-driven stuff where lots of profits must be taken from the funds.  In the context of our proposal, it would simply be the State that was supporting it.  This is probably the best way to do it because the critically important thing for us is that with the changing world into which we face, people are going to have much more uneven engagement with the world of employment throughout their lives.  The idea of a permanent job for life, in the same place and paying a family wage is long gone.  The new world of work would be much better served by universal pension on one side, basic income in the normal working years and pension contributions if people want to top up by putting in whatever they like and have the State run the fund.  We could leave the pensions funds there that are currently there but the proposal would be that the State would also provide one that was reliable and not likely to take half of the fund or people losing huge chunks of their pension funds simply because the people who are running the funds are taking a huge amount of the money - which has been the experience of people over the years.</p></speech>

We are meeting to consider the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 26 - Education and Skills, in the amount of &euro;136 million.  I will repeat the following for the benefit of those members who were not present at the start of the meeting.  The committee will have an opportunity to review the additional allocations being sought on an item by item basis; to focus on the reasons the additional allocations are being sought by the Department of Education and Skills; and to review the targets set for the relevant items, the resources available for them and the expected outputs and impact of the activities concerned.  An opening statement has been submitted to the committee and will be published on its website after the meeting.</p> <p>  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.134" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2016113000002#A01000"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for accommodating us in the taking of the Supplementary Estimate.  I am seeking an additional &euro;136 million, of which &euro;100 million is capital expenditure and &euro;36 million is current expenditure.  As members can see, some of the subheads show savings, while others show increases.  </p> <p>  The original allocation for primary and post-primary capital expenditure was &euro;427 million.  An additional allocation of &euro;100 million was recently sanctioned by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to facilitate the delivery of further large projects and the payment of the minor works scheme grants in 2016-17 to primary schools.</p><p>We will complete 48 major projects on the capital side and we have a strong pipeline of work ahead.  As members will be aware, a tranche of new builds was approved in April and a further tranche was approved in October.  This money allows us to continue this pipeline of work, which is driven by substantial pressure on school places.  We are currently providing funding for approximately 20,000 additional school places per annum.  The strong and beneficial population growth we are experiencing is exerting significant pressure on schools.  The population bulge, which continues at primary level, is now moving into secondary level.  For this reason, the balance of projects is moving more towards secondary level, which tends to involve larger, more complex buildings.</p><p> The other element is an increase of &euro;37 million being sought for increased superannuation payments in 2016 in respect of teaching and non-teaching staff in certain first and second-level schools.  This additional sum will cover the additional lump sum and related costs of a projected 488 extra retirements in 2016 above the original estimate.  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;11 million is being sought for increased superannuation payments in respect of institutes of technology staff in 2016.  This extra allocation will cover the additional lump sum and related costs of 59 more retirements in 2016 than originally estimated.  It is difficult to forecast the scale of retirements from year to year in the educational sector.</p><p> On appropriations-in-aid, an estimated shortfall of &euro;18 million is being factored into the 2016 Supplementary Estimate due to an overestimation of the level of receipts to be brought to account in 2016.  The 2016 allocation in the Revised Estimates Volume provided for overall estimated receipts of &euro;505 million to be brought into account.  However, it is very difficult to accurately forecast the exact impact of teacher retirements and increasing teacher numbers on the level of superannuation contributions payable in a given year.  The impact of previously announced reductions in the rate of pension related deductions adds to this difficulty.</p><p> There are also expected to be savings on a number of subheads, which offset the total amount required in the Supplementary Estimate.  Estimated savings on primary teacher salaries of &euro;24 million are being projected.  These savings arise mainly as a result of lower than anticipated substitution costs, which are difficult to forecast owing to the complexities associated with estimating them.  There are three individual substitution rates and, depending on the nature of the absence being covered, a personal rate may be paid.  The increased number of teachers retiring has also contributed to this saving as those retiring have usually reached the higher points in the incremental salary scale but are generally replaced by new teachers who are starting at the lower end of the scale.</p><p> To address grants to schools, education and training boards and other institutions, my Department's budget for 2016 included provision to fund the implementation of an arbitrator's recommendation for pay increases for grant funded school secretaries and caretakers.  The first phase of the multi-annual pay increase under the arbitration process came into effect from 1 January 2016 and the full amount for this payment was provided in the subhead for this year, leading to savings of &euro;6 million in 2016.  The full funding will be needed in 2017 and beyond for future phases of the arbitrator's recommendations.</p></speech>

Savings of &euro;24 million on teacher salaries have been forecast arising from lower than anticipated substitution costs.  While this substantial saving is clearly welcome, the Minister is only allocating &euro;10 million next year for a pay increase for young teachers.  If teachers are working harder or substitution is not costing as much as provided for, surely there is scope to make further improvements in pay for young teachers.</p> <p>  May I address other issues or should I confine my contribution to subhead A3?</p></speech>

The capital budget is being increased by &euro;100 million from &euro;427 million.  While I welcome the decision to build more schools, the proposed increase amounts to approximately 25% of the original capital budget for the year.  How many additional school places will be provided as a result of this increase of &euro;100 million compared to the number planned in respect of the original provision of &euro;427 million?  Have costs shot up dramatically or are additional projects and school places planned?</p> <p>  The question asked in the media is whether the Department has run out of money and whether it is able to pay the bill for projects that are due for completion.  It has also been suggested that this increase reflects a pre-election splurge that has gone wrong.  In other words, too many projects were announced in the rush before the general election.  While I am sure all these projects were necessary and welcome, is it the case that they were not planned for financially?  This is a legitimate question in light of the substantial increase required in the capital budget.  All the Deputies present will fight to secure as much of the capital budget as possible for our own areas and schools in general.  However, this increase appears to suggest extremely bad planning by the Department.</p> <p>  The minor works grant is included in the capital budget.  Have the grants been allocated or will they be allocated by the end of the year?  For how much of the &euro;100 million increase does the minor works grant account?</p> <p>  In my constituency, schools which had been informed that building projects were due to proceed to construction next year have now learned that they will not proceed as planned.  It has been suggested that the money required has been spent by the Department and that funding is no longer available.  Is this a widespread problem?  Has the programme of major capital works the Department announced last year slowed down because costs have increased or did the Department not provide sufficient money to complete it?</p> <p>  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;11 million for superannuation for institutes of technology staff will cover lump sums for 59 retirees.  This works out at approximately &euro;189,000 per retiree.  Is that figure correct?</p> <p>  I presume Deputies may make a further contribution when the Minister has responded.</p></speech>

The &euro;6 million savings arising from the full amount of the arbitrator's award have been included in the subhead for costs in respect of secretaries and caretakers.  How much was spent in this area in 2016 and how was it calculated?  Was each school allocated a standard increase or did the Department take account of the hours worked by secretaries and caretakers?  I understand schools have flexibility with regard to how they spend this money.  Schools are under great financial pressure and I have heard anecdotally that caretakers and secretaries are having their hours cut.  Will the Minister provide some clarity on the issue?</p> <p>  Replies to several parliamentary questions indicate that the allocation for the ancillary grant has remained steady in recent years.  Does this not mean the grant has reduced in recent years given that school enrolments have increased in the same period?</p></speech>

He referred to a saving of &euro;24 million on primary teachers' salaries.  That indicates that there is room to further address the issue of pay inequality in the teaching profession.</p> <p>  There is quite an increase of &euro;100 million in capital expenditure.  Was there a huge underestimation of how much would be needed to complete projects?  There is huge concern in my constituency about the number of primary school projects that have been announced.  They are badly needed because, as the Minister knows, places cannot even be found for some primary school students who were displaced owing to a recent school closure.  There is concern about insufficient investment in second level schools and that we will reach a stage where children will not be able to find places in such schools.  Is there a need for a review of expenditure on secondary school projects?</p> <p>  In respect of the allocation of &euro;37 million for superannuation payments to teaching and non-teaching staff, will the figure increase year on year?  Is there an exact way of forecasting what will be needed in future years?</p></speech>

I will give every Deputy an opportunity to make comment and revert back again to the Minister for his closing remarks.</p> <p>  To a certain extent, I am in agreement with my colleagues.  It is always important to see extra investment in education, something for which we have all been fighting in the D&aacute;il Chamber and at this committee.  Having proper sustainable development in the right area is equally important.  I understand this is the largest Supplementary Estimate placed before the House for many years, which is significant.  The saving of &euro;24 million on salaries should have been reinvested to address the issue of pay inequity, to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio, to provide extra resource teachers and possibly to restore teachers for the Traveller community.  Some of it could also have been invested in professional development education courses for teachers.  It is an opportunity wasted.</p> <p>  Regarding non-teaching staff, the school secretaries and caretakers I know are doing sterling work and it amazes that they have to be paid from the ancillary grant which does not cover their full pay.  Caretakers, in particular, have an onerous job which includes having to deal with sophisticated electronics and boilers and work with cleaning staff.  There is a lot of hustle and bustle both inside and outside school in terms of opening and closing hours and I do not think they are rewarded sufficiently for what they do above and beyond their salary.</p> <p>  I welcome the &euro;100 million investment, but we need to ensure it will add value to get more bang for our buck in addressing real needs, as Deputy Thomas Byrne said, above and beyond what was projected.  I would certainly like to see investment in my area.  There are competing demands from various schools in all of our constituencies and it would be interesting and helpful to get feedback on that issue.</p> <p>  I said we would hand back to the Minister, but there are now two Government Deputies present and it would only be fair to give them an opportunity to speak.  Does Deputy Jim Daly wish to speak?</p></speech>

The saving on substitution costs is a once-off and not a basis on which we could fund a pay increase in the longer term.  There is always an estimating element in deciding different issues and, as we see, superannuation and substitution costs are particularly hard to forecast.  Just because there is a saving in one subhead does not mean that we can change pay levels that are negotiated centrally.  The central negotiation of pay levels takes place within the Lansdowne Road agreement.  We have used the flexibility within the agreement to make provision for new entrant teachers, an issue on which we negotiated with the TUI and the INTO.  At the same time, in this school year which started in September provision was made for an extra 2,260 teachers.  Provision is being made for an extra 2,400 teachers next September.  We always have to balance the appetite for pay increases with the need to invest in services.  Deputies will know that a lot of the money went to services with a particular priority, including special educational needs and so on.  It is a balancing act.  I was happy to be able to sit down with the trade unions and negotiate not just on new entrant pay levels but also in other areas such as permanency and flexibility in the use of Croke Park agreement hours, as well as dealing with other issues that are important to teachers.  It is important that we have a well motivated teaching force and respond to pressures that are emerging.</p> <p>  On the increase in the construction budget, the original provision was smaller than in the previous year and the increase is necessary in the context of pressures that are emerging.  It is not late; it was flagged much earlier in the year when I attended a meeting of the previous committee.  It is not something that is happening at the last minute or an indication of bad planning.  We were able to release a block of school projects in April and October.  That shows that the Department's planning approach is delivering a consistent flow.  The number of schools at which construction work is taking place on site is largely the same as it was last year.  The increase in costs in the past two years is in the order of 35%.  Deputy Thomas Byrne is right that there is pressure on costs as we see a recovery in the construction sector.</p> <p>  The allocation for minor works grants came to &euro;28.5 million.  I understand it has been paid out; therefore, it is gone.</p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne mentioned that in the programmes school projects were described as due to go to construction.  When flagged, it may be a misnomer, but I understand it means that a process is due to start which will lead to tendering.  If a project was included was in the 2015 programme, it did not mean that it would go to construction in 2015.</p></speech>

However, the supply chain which involves planning, design, approval, tendering and so on, is of such a length that cannot be fully determined.  Therefore, we cannot say it will happen in month X or Y because it depends on the complexity of the work on the site.  We have often come across additional traffic or conditions to be applied in the planning phase, meaning that the school has to come back and obtain approval from the Department.  It is not by any means a perfect science, but it means that the process is due to start in the particular year.  Some projects will move very rapidly through the process, depending on their nature.  To try to deal with this, we have introduced what are termed rapid builds.  Because of this concern and the need to move more quickly the Department has developed a variety of faster track initiatives.</p> <p>  I have details of average retirement lump sums.</p><p>The average retirement lump sum of primary teachers is &euro;89,000; of second level and community college teachers, is &euro;83,000; of ETB staff, both teaching and non-teaching, is &euro;48,000; and of IOT staff, teaching and non-teaching, is &euro;59,000.</p></speech>

This is due to the phasing.  The pay increase of 2.5% in the hourly rate of grant came in on 1 January 2016.  In addition, the introduction of a minimum hourly rate of &euro;10.25 was introduced.  The ancillary service grant was increased in 2016, from &euro;147 to &euro;153, to enable primary schools to implement the first phase of the arbitrator's recommendation and also to provide for a pay increase under the FEMPI Act for grant-funded school cleaners.  Primary schools that had insufficient funds to pay the minimum hourly rate of &euro;10.25 could apply to the Department for top-up funding and this application process resulted in &euro;107,000 being allocated to 133 primary schools.  Further increases in the ancillary service grant will be made to enable schools to implement the future phases of the arbitration recommendation.</p> <p>  This came from an arbitrator's recommendation.  Obviously, the schools have to determine how they deploy across their requirements.  This will result in a 10% increase over the phasing.  The full increase is 10% between 2016 and 2019.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin raised whether we need to step up capital funding.  We have a step-up in capital funding for the coming year.  It is a &euro;40 million increase.  That is recognising both the cost pressures and the pressures of the bulge moving from primary to post-primary.  The cost of a primary school place is considerably lower than a secondary school place so that as that bulge moves on, it is considerably more expensive.</p></speech>

I was talking to a planner recently and that is the view.</p></speech>

The Department breaks the country down into 314 squares within which the population projections, both at primary and at secondary level, are forecast against the available places within that catchment.  It is where we anticipate the growth in numbers which are documented by children who are coming through the scheme or from other population indicators, such as those of the CSO and our own school data.  We use that to forecast.  That is the basis on which we identify an area that has a shortage of school places, either at primary or secondary.  We then look to identify whether the best way to provide those extra places is the expansion of existing schools or new builds.  That is the process.</p> <p>  As the Chairman will be aware, sometimes people would like a particular type of school.  The Department looks at the whole catchment and all the school places available to it.  It does not look at the preferences of parents in planning the buildings.  There could be spaces available in one school and a lot of people want another school, and that can result in pressures which we all know about.  I suppose, as the Deputy rightly says, if we had more money we could provide more options.  The policy has been to live within the available capital that we can get for this purpose and to provide for the growing population areas.  I think we stay on top of those, but there can be difficulties with individual parents.</p> <p>  The forecasting of superannuation is a tricky matter too because staff have a certain degree of flexibility in when they time their exits.  We have to anticipate what that might be from year to year and that gives rise to difficulties in forecasting.  That is one of the big reasons for the Supplementary Estimate.</p> <p>  This is perhaps one of the biggest Supplementary Estimates, although it is probably not as big as some of the other areas because Health, Social Protection and Justice all had increases.  I suppose this was flagged.  The &euro;100 million, which is the mainstay of it in terms of substantive change, was flagged much earlier in the year.  It reflected the genuine pressure on the building programmes that we needed to respond to.  It has been helpful that we have been able to do that and we are building on that for next year as well.</p> <p>  As Deputy Thomas Byrne and others have often said, the bigger capital problem is in the third level area where we do not have anything like a capital programme commensurate with our ambitions.  This will be an issue where we would be hoping in the upcoming mid-term capital review we can look to try to  increase capital allocation in the higher and further education area.  The total provision in the higher and further education area is relatively small, at approximately &euro;50 million.  It is a small capital budget compared to the pressures.  That is wrapped up in the wider discussions the committee is having.</p> <p>  I think I have dealt with the issues.  Did the Chair have another issue?</p></speech>

It would need a substantial decision that this was a policy priority within the education budget.  That has been the approach for a considerable number of years.  I suppose we are trying to keep pace with curriculum pressures, pressures to provide resource teachers, pressures to look at class size, etc.  In any given period, one is looking at how to share out the available funding in the best way within the education system.  Over a long period, this has not been the top priority.  We have been more focused on the immediate impact on pupils, in terms of teaching and access to teachers, curriculum, buildings, etc.</p></speech>

That aside, schools are to a certain extent like small businesses.  Smooth administration is hugely important and is of great support to the principal and the teaching staff and we cannot underestimate the work of secretaries and caretakers.  Indeed, in many cases, it is helping to facilitate wider community activities after school hours as well.  That is correct too because there needs to be a more efficient use of school buildings, in terms of the community.  I accept that is a wider issue.</p> <p>  I propose to go back now and conduct the round of spokespersons.  I call Deputy Thomas Byrne.</p></speech>

When I did the sums based on the number of staff the Minister stated were retiring, it came to &euro;189,000 per retiree.  That was different from the average figures the Minister gave and it would not be low enough to include their pensions.</p> <p>  There is an extra &euro;100 million, less the funding for the minor works grant.  How many extra school places have been achieved this year?  The note stated there were 1,000.  Is it the case that there are 1,000 extra school places for that &euro;100 million because that is certainly a lot of money?</p> <p>  The Minister mentioned that the capital budget will increase next year by &euro;40 million but he is adding &euro;100 million to this year's figure.</p><p>Is that &euro;40 million on top of the new figure for this year or is there a cut in the capital budget of &euro;60 million next year?</p></speech>

However, more is needed.  Schools are under pressure, hours are being cut and secretaries and caretakers do a fantastic job which is often undervalued.  They are absolutely vital in a school but schools have had to make choices.  I would like this to be addressed more effectively.</p></speech>

There is a huge concern that, a few years down the road, there will not be enough second level schools in the constituency which I represent.  I wonder if this is reflected in other constituencies.  Primary schools are badly needed because of population growth but when children who are now in junior and senior infants get to sixth class there will not be enough places in second level schools.</p></speech>

In the Newbridge, Kilcullen and Kildare catchment area of Kildare South, many in the educational field believe, as I do, that a secondary school is merited.  The data brought forward by the Department, however, state that it is not, though these data included fee-paying schools and this should not be the case.  I accept that birth rate is only one of the measures used but housing prices are going up steadily again in Dublin and we are going to see many families with small children moving out of Dublin and into the commuter belts of Kildare, Wicklow, Meath and other counties.  Their children will not have been born in those commuter areas but, all of a sudden, much higher numbers may be starting school than anticipated by the birth rate figures.  I accept it is a wider issue but we cannot make this point often enough.</p></speech>

Funding is provided from two subheads covering the pension and gratuity costs of former IOT staff.  The number of IOT staff retiring fluctuates from year to year and the scale of these fluctuations is not possible to precisely predict.  The fact that these persons are not employees of my Department but of 13 IOTs, and are paid on those bodies' payrolls, adds to the complexity of the estimating process within my Department.  The average costs of the gratuities, that is lump sums, fluctuates throughout the year as staff of differing service and grade levels retire.  The 2016 allocation allows for the payment of 145 gratuities to newly retired employees of the IOTs, at the current average gratuity rates.  However my Department now anticipates that the number of gratuities payable to the new retired IOT employees will be 204, an extra 59.  Accordingly, a supplementary allocation of &euro;11 million is being sought from the IOT subheads.  The supplementary allocation will allow for the payment of an additional 59 gratuities to retired IOT employees at current average rates and associated increases in the cost of servicing the ongoing pension payroll.  This will increase the overall cost of these subheads from the &euro;65 million originally provided to &euro;74 million.</p> <p>  I will get more detail for the Deputy as to what exactly the breakdown of the extra money is.</p></speech>

If a person retires on 1 January they will get the full pension for that year.</p> <p>  The total capital allocation for the education sector in 2017 was to be &euro;599 million, as announced in September 2015, but it is being increased to &euro;690 million, though &euro;51 million of that increase is due to the payment of PPP unitary charges previously issued, leaving a real net increase of &euro;40 million.

Deputy Nolan asked about secretaries and caretakers.  I am not an expert on this but some schools have them and there are various thresholds.  There are some historical posts, many of which were suppressed during the FEMPI years because it was a discretionary area.  They are funded through capitation.  The level of capitation is always under scrutiny and we hope to be able to increase it, which is the fairest way to provide them and better than picking out some schools for secretaries and not others.</p> <p>  Deputy Martin suggested we might not have enough schools at second level and I take her point on this.  Since I took this job we have approved three new primary schools for 1,500 children and nine new secondary schools with 9,000 places.  The ratio is moving towards second level because the bulge was at primary level and has now moved on.  The planning is responding to that but that is not to say that there are not pressures.  A lot of schools start in temporary accommodation and the process develops - that is the way the system works.</p> <p>  Deputy Byrne asked about the &euro;100 million but one cannot neatly assign it to specific projects.  However, as a rule of thumb, a 1,000-pupil post-primary school would be approximately &euro;19 million while a primary school for between 450 and 500 would cost &euro;5 million.    </p></speech>

The number of projects on site is 60.  The number identified to commence in 2017 is 42.  That is the projection.  They are released in blocks.  Thirty-six were released in April and 21 in October.  There is a continuous flow of projects.  Forty-two in all are expected to pass through the gate during 2017.  They are at various stages of readiness.  Some are only checking out disability and fire certificate requirements and they will go to tender.  From 1 January, there will be a new tendering requirement to protect subcontractors.  This will apply to some of the projects.  The 42 will be coming on stream during the course of 2017.</p> <p>  The Deputy is correct on the fiscal space.  If one spends &euro;100 million, the EU counts only &euro;25 million in year one.  Then the figures proceed to &euro;50 million, &euro;75 million and &euro;100 million.  One uses the fiscal space in tranches so one gets a certain amount of advantage.  That will be  a feature in the capital review in that the provision will be available as a potential way of considering additional capital.</p> <p>  Approximately &euro;20 million was spent on prefabs in 2016.  This is up on &euro;18 million in the previous year, and &euro;16 million in the year preceding that.  The programme has been renewed.  Some years ago, before circumstances became more difficult, there was a pretty high ambition to proceed more rapidly, but we are now rebuilding the programme.  It is for this reason there has been an increase from &euro;16 million to &euro;20 million.</p> <p>  The number of rented prefabs was 984 at the end of 2015.  We have not got the most up-to-date position yet but that gives an idea of the scale.</p></speech>

I appreciate the opportunity to be here.  I am joined by my colleague, Liam Woods.<br/><br/>Approximately one year ago, <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>ran an extensive article, entitled &quot;Inside the HSE&quot;, in which I was quoted as saying that we do not have a single collective national understanding of what we want from health care, particularly when it comes to how much we want to spend and invest in our system.  One year later, I am genuinely delighted to be before this Oireachtas committee to provide input on what I hope will be a major step in developing clarity for the first time in terms of what we, as a nation, wish to achieve, how much of our overall Exchequer funding we are willing to invest and what we can realistically expect from our health services.<br/><br/>To my mind, this clarity and consensus has never really been achieved at societal, political or health service level.  This has resulted in the progressive evolution of a platform whereby health has become a political football - political in the sense of using both a small and a big P.  Fully 80% of services are of a very high standard, such as those seen recently on the RTE documentary &quot;Keeping Ireland Alive&quot;.  However, these services are often overshadowed by the 20% of services that are not delivered as well as we would all like.  This arises to the extent that many people describe our health services as third-world in nature without stopping to consider the excellent services that are delivered day in and day out by staff in hospitals and in communities throughout the country.  It is important to acknowledge today what is working well.  I am keen to step beyond the usual headlines - to use RTE's strap-line from the programme &ndash; and paint a picture of our health care as it is delivered currently and the positive impact it is having on patients, service users and staff.<br/><br/>My focus today is not on structures.  I am of a view that over the decades there has been an overemphasis on the importance of structures to the detriment of putting the patient at the centre of all we do, integrating how we deliver care and ensuring that patient safety and care quality is our utmost priority.  My focus today is more on a number of important themes, principles and considerations, such as the need for a decisive shift from the acute hospital sector to the primary and social care setting due to changing demographic profiles, the impact on our health services if we fail to make this shift and some suggestions on how such a significant shift could be funded.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, 80% of our health system is of a very high standard.  Despite the resource constraints faced by the health services over the past six years, numerous improvements - too numerous to mention today - have occurred throughout all areas of the health services.  Stroke treatment is an excellent example.  Each year, more than 500 stroke patients receive thrombolysis to dissolve clots in arteries that cause strokes.  In addition, some 150 people have had thrombectomy procedures, whereby obstructing clots were removed from large brain arteries to prevent devastating strokes.  This places Ireland in the top three countries in Europe delivering acute stroke therapies.  We are seeing similar positive outcomes for people with major heart attacks.  Approximately 85% of patients received primary angioplasty within 90 minutes.  This compares singularly well internationally.<br/><br/>Our success in diagnosing and treating cancer is well known and follows a difficult centralisation programme that, like many other areas in health care, became a political football for many years.  However, thankfully, the views of the clinical experts prevailed and the outcomes are positive today.  I have no doubt that we will face other decisions in health care very soon that will be equally contentious and will involve situation where local views diverge from those of clinical experts.<br/><br/>Another major success in the Irish health service is the improved uptake of childhood and school immunisation programmes.  The figures compare well with World Health Organization targets.  For example, in 2015 over 65,000 children were immunised.  For the 6-in-1 childhood vaccine, there is a 95% uptake.  For the MMR vaccine at 24 months, the uptake is 93%.<br/><br/>While we continually hear and read criticism of our mental health services, significant improvements are seldom mentioned.  For example, the numbers on the child and adolescent mental health services waiting lists continue to decrease.  Furthermore, in 2015, 95% children were admitted to age-appropriate child and adolescent inpatient units, compared with 25% in 2008.  Moreover, one in every 100 adults in Ireland is estimated to have received suicide prevention training through applied suicide intervention skills training and safeTALK.<br/><br/>I could spend the entire 20 minutes discussing other improvements, such as the success of the quit smoking initiative, the increase in numbers of community intervention teams throughout the country and so on.  However, I wish to move my focus to the horizon and to the future of health care in the country.<br/><br/>The positive examples I have outlined show that despite the challenges faced by our health services over the past six years, which was a recessionary period, there has been a positive trend in awareness, early detection and the provision of the right care in the right place at the right time.  This means we are living longer, ageing better and learning to live with ill-health.  In fact, these improvements to our health care system in recent years mean that we are adding approximately 20,000 people over 65 years of age per annum to our population.  This figure is projected to increase by 4%, or approximately 188,000 people, between now and 2021.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Irish longitudinal study on ageing, TILDA, reports that 64.8% of this over 65 age cohort live with multi-morbidity.</p><p>This is defined as the presence of two or more chronic conditions.  Treating an older population with the presence of chronic disease is costly and getting more costly.  A graph in my written submission shows the relative cost of inpatient treatment by age category last year and projected to 2022.</p><p> While it is good news that we are likely to live longer, it carries with it new challenges in the required changes to our health service.  Unless we plan for these changes now, we are going to run into significant difficulties in ten years' time.  In fact, we are facing those difficulties already, as we can see in the 5% to 6% increase in the presentations to our emergency departments year on year and the impact that this is having on our acute hospital system and, in particular, available bed capacity for elective work.  Our data show that we are doing more emergency work and less elective work each year.  It goes without saying that, as the number of emergency admissions increases, there is reducing space for elective activity.  This trend is set to continue unless something changes.  If it continues, all work will be emergency work and we will be unable to accommodate elective work.</p><p> Committee members will have heard many times in the course of their work witnesses highlighting the need for us to shift our planning away from the acute hospital setting towards primary care.  However, this necessitates a "decisive" shift towards primary care and for us to be clear about what we actually mean when we say this.  To me, this means doing things in acute care settings that can, and should, only be done in acute care settings.  Historically, we would have engaged in a simplistic restructuring exercise to achieve this.</p><p> As we are all well aware, the HSE was created with a big bang.  Politically and legislatively, it was easy, but it was not necessarily a good idea and not well thought through.  The rationale behind the establishment of the HSE was to centralise operations.  This type of structure, coupled with an unexpected economic recession, led to a command and control-type system that disempowered those tasked with service delivery.  It also tended to stifle the creativity and innovation required of a sustainable, adaptive organisation.  Overall, we have learned that 105,000 staff cannot be managed from a central location.</p><p> Following a decision by the Government in 2011, we are now at a stage of advanced progress in slowly unwinding much of that.  Seven hospital groups, nine community health organisations and the National Ambulance Service have been established.  While not a perfect structure, significant consideration has been given to these new health care delivery organisations, which are premised primarily on patient population flows.  These new organisations now require to be left alone and given time to embed and grow as the main operational delivery arm of the health service.  Whether these structures are the most optimal has become less important than the need to implement them fully, including by providing them with sufficient management capacity and then allowing them a period of at least five to seven years to bed down properly before evaluating them and considering any further change.</p><p> In much the same way that restructuring does not provide the easy solution, simply increasing the numbers of acute hospital beds is not the easy solution either.  The committee will have heard many people, including representative bodies, calling for an increase in our acute bed stock.  If I may, I will put this in context.  The health system uses 3.5 million bed days per annum.  When adjusted only for demographics for the next 30 years, this number of bed days will have to grow to 6.4 million.  That would be unsustainable in cost and staffing terms.  There would be a requirement to add in excess of 300 beds per year.  The current cost of the public hospital system is &euro;5.3 billion per annum and we would require double this spend to deliver a doubling of capacity as well as providing capital funding for new facilities.  We would do far better to invest in the development of primary and social care services to support people in their communities.</p><p> To achieve the decisive shift away from the acute hospital setting to primary care and social care, a significant additional resource is required.  However, such a resource will take time to develop, given how we are funded currently.  To overcome this, a considerable rethink is needed of some of our existing policies, particularly in terms of how to fund sustainably the type of supports that we need as we grow older, whether that be long-term care, home care packages, home help hours or aids and appliances.  It will also require a rethink of our capital funding investment.  A change to multi-annual service planning and budgeting would also assist in supporting longer term planning for the demands on our resources.</p><p> Currently, we have a health planning environment that is tied to an electoral cycle as well as a 12-month fiscal public service budgeting cycle.  Both of these factors essentially drive short-term decision making and their resultant outcomes.  The change cycle in health is longer than 12 months.  An annual budget-service plan cycle hampers, rather than facilitates, improvement and reform.  Instead, we need a capacity to plan that allows and supports longer term decision making and promotes an environment of strategic thought based on evidence.</p><p> Closely aligned to this, and a matter on which I have commented publicly in the past, is the need to build a general public consensus concerning the maximum appropriate and feasible investment in health and social care for the next 15 to 20 years.  In other words, how much are taxpayers willing to hand over for the health service they want?  This consensus would have to bear in mind the realities of the economic cycle at any given point in time and competing pressures for Government funding.</p><p> I will turn to the issue of a fair deal for primary care.  Our population is getting older and their care needs are becoming significantly more expensive.  How do we sustainably resource this into the future?  We tackled part of this problem a number of years ago through the introduction of a successful scheme that gave a good degree of assurance for the older population around their long-term care, namely, the nursing homes support scheme, or fair deal.  It is a fair question to ask why we do not have such a scheme or level of assurance around care that is not long term.</p><p> One of the policy issues that should be considered as we examine the future of health care is whether we are going to put in place a demand-led funded environment that guarantees the supports for people moving on from the acute phase of their care to live their lives where they wish to, which by and large is in their own homes.  Such a scheme would allow the likes of expensive home care packages to be funded into the future, but we need to reach a settled view on that.  Otherwise, our system will become increasingly unsustainable.</p><p> The HSE's programme for health services improvement has 12 major programmes under way, constituting in the order of 500 subprogrammes.  For the most part, these are patient-centred projects that will happen over three to five years and are designed to enhance service delivery to patients and service users.</p><p> There exists a perception that the health services can undertake these major improvement programmes for free or, to put it another way, carry out such major transformation while continuing to provide the same level of services as last year without getting any extra money.  This does not happen in large industry, and it has dawned on health systems internationally that transformation programmes need to be funded.</p><p> The committee will have heard from many witnesses about the number of transformative processes that are under way in our health services with varying degrees of success.  To date, all of these programmes have been funded from within existing resources, but then we question why we have not seen a quantum shift in health care performance in Ireland.  This is one of the reasons that we have been talking for decades about a decisive shift towards primary and social care, but not actually achieving it.</p><p> I wish to tell members about a health service where this issue is being taken seriously.  In the state of New York, a major health service reform, called the delivery system reform incentive payment programme, DSRIP, is being undertaken.  The aim of DSRIP is to improve significantly the way Medicaid beneficiaries receive their health care in order to reduce that cost and deal with the issue of chronic disease through integration and the avoidance of hospitals.  The aim over the five-year implementation period is to cut costs by $17 billion.  However, it is recognised that, in order to make that saving, there must first be investment.  An overstretched system cannot easily move resources from one part of its service to another in order to effect change.  We know that we must move resources and spend out of the acute sector and into primary care, but if we were simply to do that now, we would probably collapse our overall system.</p><p> New York calculated the saving over time and decided to invest up front part of that saving against a clear roadmap and clear deliverables, as a result of which the service providers in the state participating in this programme have been provided over the five years with $8.5 billion to fund the cost of transformation.  This is the reality of health care transformation.  DSRIP will promote community-level collaborations and focus on system reform, specifically on a goal to achieve a 25% reduction in avoidable hospital use over five years.  All DSRIP funds will be based on performance linked to achievement of project milestones, thus paying for value.</p><p> In the UK, the King's Fund reached similar conclusions about what was necessary to effect effective transformation in the NHS.  In Northern Ireland, a recently published expert panel report, entitled "Systems, Not Structures - Changing Health and Social Care", recommended that a ring-fenced transformation fund be established to ensure its transformation process was appropriately resourced.</p><p>I make no apology for saying that if ongoing and future transformation is not funded in this jurisdiction, particularly in an overstretched and growing health care economy, we will not achieve the transformation which members expect or desire.  It is as simple as that.</p><p> Another important consideration that is often overlooked when we discuss deficiencies in our health service is the level of annual capital funding.  Members will be aware of some of the mega-projects in health such as the children's hospital.  Through other committees, many will be aware of some of the lesser-known capital projects, including the upkeep and repair of many existing buildings and pieces of equipment in the health sector.  We will spend approximately &euro;375 million on capital developments in health this year across primary care, mental health, acute care and a wide other variety of services.  Of great concern to me is the amount of money available to us between 2017 and 2021 in the capital space to pay for our ambulances, x-ray machines, MRIs and all those types of equipment on which we critically depend.  That sum is &euro;2.25 billion.  However, that sum does not meet the &euro;3.64 billion that is required to meet the long list of priority replacements to maintain safety and quality in our health care system.  We have, therefore, an immediate problem.  There is a mid-term review of the capital programme in 2017 and health needs to be very high on that agenda.  I will seek to ensure that all those who have the responsibility for carrying out that review are aware of this capital challenge.</p><p> Looking at the next ten years, we need to be spending in the order of &euro;9 billion in health capital to address issues of infection control and ageing equipment.  This takes cognisance of the fact that we replaced a lot of equipment at the height of the economic prosperity, most of which is now ageing very rapidly.  This includes critical equipment such as our ambulance fleet.  As this exists as a quality and safety concern it becomes even more of a priority.</p><p> Often forgotten within our capital budget is the funding of e-health.  I will not spend too much time on this as members have previously heard from the CIO, Richard Corbridge.  Health, like every other sector, needs ready access to good information to improve and sustainably deliver quality cost-effective services.  The delivery of integrated care, with a strong primary care focus, is predicated upon having effective technology to allow for easy access to the appropriate clinical advice independent of the care setting and across care settings.  In other industries in Ireland this is a given.  The farming sector, for example, has an electronic record to trace animal identification and movement for all sheep, goats, pigs and bovines.  We need to redesign our systems at every opportunity to ensure that the true benefits of an e-health programme are available to patients and staff.  The current electronic health record business case envisages that, by 2020, clinicians will be able to access digital information about patients appropriately, and by 2025 we will see a digital fabric throughout the health system including a system that is also accessible and in the hands of the people of Ireland.</p><p> This is a ten-year journey which will put in place a set of solutions built around the individual health identifier.  It is not a big bang but an evolution of today's systems.  It is not an immediate large investment but rather a commitment to incrementally evaluate the success of digital over a ten-year period and continue to add to the investment as benefits can be seen and success is clear.</p><p> Obviously, health care cannot be provided, nor can space and equipment work, without people.  Despite considerable attention, attracting and retaining certain cohorts of our staff remains a considerable challenge at both national and local levels.  Recent OECD reports identify that the health system in Ireland has a low number of doctors when compared with other jurisdictions.  The work of the clinical programmes within the HSE has demonstrated this at a specialty level in Ireland, in specialties such as orthopaedics, obstetrics, ICU and neurology.  Typically, we need to double our number of doctors to deliver on the models of care set out for our population.  As part of the development of hospital groups, future recruitment of medical staff will be part of the group structure.  This will allow for significant flexibility in the rotation of staff across hospital sites and allow for an enhanced training experience for doctors and will reduce the vacancy level of sites with traditional recruitment difficulties.</p><p> A committee appointed by the HSE regarding reform of the processes for creation, approval recruitment and appointment to consultant posts has concluded its work and developed a paper, Successful Consultant Recruitment and Retention, which is available and which we have shared with the committee.  Recruitment in the health sector is and will remain an ongoing challenge for the foreseeable future.  Policy decisions regarding the level of training places, salaries, terms and conditions for health sector workers are required in order for the Irish health services to remain an attractive destination for our most qualified staff.</p><p> In conclusion, I thank all members of the committee for the invaluable work that they have undertaken.  I am sure the evidence given to this committee so far has been an eye-opener for some members in terms of how complex and challenging the delivery of health and social care services can be.  The simple-fix solution may not be as simple as it first seems.  I am of the belief that, with the correct strategic approach and a close re-examination of some of the policy constraints within which we are obliged to function, we can better meet the challenges that face us with an ever-increasing demand for our services over the next ten years.  This is especially so in relation to seed funding for our major transformation programmes to allow us to be able to invest now to generate more efficiencies later.  It also applies in relation to the need for multi-annual planning and budgeting.  The level of capital investment in the health sector is an area that also requires close consideration.  Above all, it is important that we all work together to build the best health service that we can and that we can restore the public's confidence in the services that we deliver.</p><p> I will close out by taking the opportunity to thank all of my colleagues who work so diligently delivering services right across the country in such challenging circumstances. </p></speech>

He posed the question of how much the taxpayer was willing to hand over for the health service at once.  Can he address this question in the context of recent OECD figures which show that Ireland is very close to the top in terms of health spending?  Even if we just take the taxpayer-funded element of that, we are still very close to the top.  Is he saying that we need to spend more than any other OECD country?  Is there not an issue about getting much better value for money with the existing spend?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien also said that the question of whether the structures were optimal or not has become less important than the need to implement them fully.  That remains an open question for this committee, given the frequency with which the issue of structures has come up.  It is hard for us to accept the case for implementing and bedding down structures that are not necessarily optimal.  Attempting to close off discussion would be an issue for the committee as it is a very live issue for us.</p></speech>

It is my view, as it would be that of other people in similar roles in other jurisdictions, that there are no perfect structures and that whatever structures we have at any given time, it is always possible to argue that a different structure would be preferable.  There is also, however, very significant evidence from restructuring processes around the world of the impact of restructuring.  Following a study of the context and processes of the mergers of health care providers in England, Professor Naomi Fulop has produced a report which shows that structural changes typically lead to delays to service improvements of at least 18 months, that there tends to be a loss of managerial focus on services leading to a risk to patient safety and that the expectation of cost savings, generally speaking, are not realised.</p> <p>  A satirical study, A Surrealistic Mega-analysis of Redisorganisation Theories, made the serious point that, around the world, one can observe a pattern across many countries whereby one poorly planned, top-down restructure invariably leads to another.  We are well into a process in which the hospital groups, in particular, are beginning to bear fruit in terms of the alignment of services, as are the CHOs.  If we decide to stop that there will be a price to be paid, as there was when the eastern regional health authority was stopped before it got to a certain point.  We will not necessarily be able to produce a structure to replace it which would be perfect, or less imperfect, than what we currently have.</p> <p>  We are spending a very substantial sum of money on health and there is an opportunity, through some of the processes currently under way involving groups and CHOs, to use the funding better by the realignment of services.  I am not saying we need to spend an ever-increasing amount on health care.</p><p>In order to allow strategic change planning, we need to plan ahead over a longer time horizon than we do.  For example, the HSE did not know what its budget for 2017 would be until budget day, and, as it stands, it will not know its budget for 2018-----</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien is making the point that the taxpayers must decide how much they are prepared to spend on the health service.

He referred to the cost of equipment and said, to paraphrase, we bought a lot during the boom and it could do with being replaced.  Why are we buying equipment?  Normal process in businesses is that large plant would be leased and maintained by a service provider.  Why is this not common practice in the HSE?  I understand some is going on, however it seems we are front-loading money on equipment and then, I assume, the HSE needs to employ engineers to maintain it.  It seems completely contrary to how it is done in a normal corporate entity.</p> <p>  It is concerning that we would not set out to have a perfect structure and then, maybe, move back a little from it.  We are always using the word "ambitious" in the committee.  Would we not try to be ambitious to have the optimum structure?  I am probably wearing people out speaking about the alignment of the seven hospital groups and nine CHOs.  We have raised it on numerous occasions and examined the structure we have been given in one of the documents.  If one does not have a defined population with a person in charge of the population, how, in God's name, can we quantify what we need, audit what is happening and compare with similar defined populations?  It seems very strange that we would not have defined borders.</p> <p>  Is there any infographic that shows us how the HSE will get from the current structure to the new structure?  What sort of dead wood, for want of a better word, can we get rid of in the process?  Are we just, yet again, adding another layer to the administration?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien spoke about the positives.  I do not see many positives on the ground.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned improvements in waiting lists for mental health services for children and adolescents?  Could Mr. O'Brien elaborate on where we were and where we are?  What would he consider an acceptable time for a child to wait for mental health services during his or her formative years?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien said some of the information the committee is receiving might be an eye-opener.  None of us needed to join this committee to have our eyes opened, given that we see operations cancelled due to lack of beds and escalating numbers of people on trolleys, and that we hope to God we will get a bad frost so we do not have a major flu epidemic.  None of us needed to join this committee to have our eyes opened unless we had been living under our beds.</p></speech>

Deputy Kate O'Connell raised the issue of lease maintenance contracts for high-value and diagnostic equipment across the HSE.  The new children's hospital will be in the frame of lease maintenance contracts.  I do not know why it has not percolated beyond in terms of capital spend and capital investment in plant.</p> <p>  I would like to tease out hospital groups.  There are various views as to whether they are coalescing properly with the CHOs.  The HSE establishes a hospital group and gives it independence.  Will there be any overarching national policy that will set down parameters for the hospital group in terms of the type of investment it will make and the services it will provide?  For example, if all seven hospitals decide to do left hips very well, who will do the right hips?  Will there be a national policy that will filter down to ensure we have adequate services in all specialties across the country and that we do not have unnecessary duplication?  Given that we are giving the hospital groups independence and their own decision making processes and budgets, how can we ensure we have adequate cover, particularly for sub-specialties, across the country?</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien said we needed to make a decisive shift from acute hospital settings to primary care.  Probably one of the key issues in making this decisive shift will be negotiations around the GP contract and the delivery of chronic illness care in the community.  What does Mr. O'Brien think would be necessary in the contract, without showing his negotiation hand?  What are the broad parameters of what is required regarding the detail of the contract for chronic illness and manpower and manpower planning for this inevitable and decisive shift from acute to primary and community care?</p> <p>  We talk about our aging population and the demographic bulge that is evident a short time down the road.  Yet, judging by our investment in geriatric services and specialties, we do not seem to be planning in accordance with what we know is going to happen in training, recruitment, retention, expanding training programmes to ensure we have sufficient capacity and manpower to deal with those challenges.</p> <p>  Do we need a division to oversee the roll-out of primary care, or should it be done by the hospital groups?  How should we do it to ensure we get primary care running efficiently in tandem with the acute hospitals?  Over the years, we, and everybody else who has examined health systems across the world, have consistently said primary care is the way health care should be delivered in the years ahead.  Yet, the minute a budget adjustment is required, primary care always seems to be hit first, and then everything falls back on the acute hospital setting.  We have strategies in place to deal with the winter initiative, such as cancellations of elective surgeries when there is overcrowding in hospitals.  At what stage do we realise we cannot keep doing this and that primary care has to deal with the capacity issues in the acute hospital system?</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien made many references to the trend that we are moving more towards emergency and away from elective procedures.</p><p>My position is that the HSE is not serious about tackling this.  I see no evidence of a systematic plan to deal with the issue.  From the response to a parliamentary question I tabled recently, we learned that, from 1 January to 16 November, Tullamore hospital instigated the full-capacity protocol 511 times.  That is a phenomenal figure.  It suggests that the full-capacity protocol, which I understood was supposed to be a response to an emergency situation, is now becoming more or less a way of life.  I agree that we are heading in the direction of more emergency and less elective care, but I put it to Mr. O'Brien that he is not in any way serious about dealing with that.</p><p> In responses to other parliamentary questions I asked, I learned that not one of the 14 primary care centres to be built is to get any additional staff.  Everybody talks about the need to invest in primary care.  Mr. O'Brien said that a significant resource will be required.  How would he quantify a significant resource?  What will it be?  I am sure he knows.  I am disappointed that he did not provide the information earlier but perhaps he would enlighten the committee on what significant resource will be required to begin the move from dealing with emergencies.  The full-capacity protocol is a recognition that there is an emergency situation at a hospital and that drastic measures must be taken.  It appears that hospitals are in an almost permanent state of full-capacity protocol.  I am familiar with the protocol because I worked in the unions when it was first discussed.  At the time, we were given to understand that it would seldom be used but now it is almost permanently in use.  I do not see a plan to move from emergencies only over to primary care, so I would be interested to hear about that.</p><p> There was a reference to 20% of what happens in the health service not being of a high standard.  What areas have been identified as not being of a high standard?  What plans are in place to bring them to a high standard?</p><p> We are all aware of the difficulties with recruiting and retaining staff in our hospitals.  We are also aware that a significant amount of money is spent every day on agency staff and outsourcing to the private sector.  The Minister has said repeatedly, and I agree, that using agency staff is not good value for money.  However, I do not see a plan to convert agency hours into directly employed hours.  Is there such a plan?  I do not believe there is one but if there is, perhaps the witnesses would share it with us.  As part of that plan, has the HSE set targets for the number of hours currently provided by the private sector or by agencies that will be converted into the best value for money, which is direct labour?</p><p> Finally, does the HSE have a timeline for the conclusion of the discussions on the GP contract?  That will be central to planning for the future.  A number of my constituents are GPs and they ask me regularly if there is any news on it and whether there is a timeline.  If there is no deadline, it will be an open-ended process.  This is being held forth as something that might solve some problems but we are already way behind in those negotiations.  We all accept the GP contract is out of date.  The negotiating bodies are ready to begin the process.  Does the HSE have a timeline for it?</p></speech>

The traditional method has been the application of capital in the capital development plan to purchase equipment.  Both members referred to what we would call managed equipment service, MES, contracts which are now being examined intensively as part of the national children's hospital proposal, which was mentioned, and also at a wider level for use across the HSE.  We have looked at models internationally, such as the Karolinska Institutet, which has entered into a major MES, and into an innovation and joint venture arrangement with the Philips corporation, which was the successful applicant, on the back of that.  We have done some assessment of that and we are very open to it.  There is a certain amount of equipment leasing within our system at present.  The HSE must seek prior approval to borrow, a point that arose previously.  Leasing is a form of borrowing and it requires prior approval of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is not an obstacle.  I am just stating that it is part of the process.  We estimate we need approximately &euro;62 million per year in capital to maintain the equipment base of the health environment.  If we were to examine that on a funded basis over a five or ten-year period, clearly it is an annual amount which is not a capital sum but which would be required to be an increased revenue sum.  The HSE is very open to the idea of considering accessing capital equipment in that way, which is somewhat innovative.  It would still require revenue funding instead of capital funding to pay that increased cost.</p> <p>  On maintenance, we have a small number of biomedical engineers who are very capable.  Our national lead is based in Cork and is very strong on all of this.  It is his data I was quoting when I referred to &euro;62 million.  We have a small resource ourselves.  Much of the contract maintenance is carried out by the providers of equipment.  Some of it, and it is an increasing amount, has been taken on board by us as a cost efficiency measure.  We do not have an excess of such people but we must maintain them because they help us to drive value and drive down the cost of maintenance contracts, which typically can last seven years and can be up to 7% of the cost of the equipment.</p> <p>  We are very open to the MES idea and we are pursuing it.  We have carried out research on what is working best internationally.  There has been mixed experience with this.  In Sweden, when the full appraisals were carried out, they determined that it would make more sense for the county councils, which run the health environment there, to provide the capital but to proceed with an MES without the use of the private sector, because they were avoiding interest costs and a profit charge.  There are a few variants regarding what that might look like and we are exploring those at present.  The core point is that part of the wider future for the hospital and health environment is that there is a choice between funding a revenue stream or a capital stream, but it needs to be funded.  It is not free if we go with MES, but it can prove productive.  Typically, those contracts internationally are for two life cycles of equipment.</p></speech>

I will attempt to cover all of them by grouping some of the topics together.</p> <p>  Regarding the core relationship between acute and community or primary care, Deputy Kelleher asked an interesting question on whether we should let the hospitals effectively control primary care.  To be honest, that is the last thing I would do.  These relationships are explored in different ways in different jurisdictions.  However, I believe that if we did that, which effectively would be giving hospital groups control of the health care system, we would end up with a more hospital-centric rather than a less hospital-centric care system.  To look at that through the lens of the issue of alignment, there is a legitimate discussion about the alignment between those two sets of organisations.  My back-stop position is that they should be kept separate.  There is a big job of work to be done within hospital groups, whatever boundaries they have, around the relationship between larger and smaller hospitals and more rational use of the resources.  There is a separate piece of work to be done to build strength in our community services.  If they were put into one place in singular organisations, as happens in some jurisdictions at this point, it would be a retrograde step for the development of community health care services in Ireland, which are coming from a lower base of resource.</p> <p>  The reality is that our hospitals have had more investment and historically have had slightly stronger management processes.  If they were given control over primary care, I do not believe it would benefit the long-term aspirations we have for a decisive shift towards primary care.</p><p> On the alignment of boundaries, I will tell the committee a short story.  Five years ago, when I was in the special delivery unit, all hospitals and community services were organised in what were called integrated service areas, ISAs, of which there were 17.  On a geographical basis, that meant that one person had responsibility for hospitals and community services.  Around that time, as we were heading into the winter, with my job being to manage trolley crises, we organised meetings in every ISA.  Despite the fact that there were common governance structures and processes and singular management, the first thing representatives of the special delivery unit had to do was introduce community service colleagues to hospital colleagues.  The structural approach was not the solution.</p><p> I was at a lecture given by Professor Rafael Bengoa who recently led the process in Northern Ireland where they have integrated trust areas.  He made the very same point.  They have not provided the solution and system issues need to be addressed.  I am really dealing with the potential argument that has not been made that what we should do is have singular structures that combine both hospitals and community health organisations.  Something like this was tried in the past but was not successful.</p></speech>

The point I was making was it might have been possible if each citizen stayed within a geographical territory to avail of primary, social, mental health and acute care services.  In a country of this size, with its distribution of tertiary and quaternary care services, as is already the case, we can expect to see patients travelling great distances to avail of specialty services.

I recognise and absolutely accept that there is a concern that when one looks at the hospital groups map, some of them transect great swathes of the country, making a map-based alignment of hospitals and the respective community health care organisations, CHOs, very difficult to conceptualise.  The point I made in my opening statement was we were already seeing some benefits from within the groups and although there may be very strong arguments in favour of changing them, we must recognise that will carry a cost also.</p></speech>

As Deputy Kate O'Connell pointed out, it is not an eye-opener.  Nevertheless, it is very confusing.  Can Mr. O'Brien imagine what it is like for a patient who is trying to navigate through it?  It is next to impossible.  It seems that when we look at it from the outside or even close enough to the inside, the structures have been almost deliberately set up to make it difficult to achieve accountability and for patients to access services.</p></speech>

None of us has any difficulty in visualising it.  Although I do not intend to speak for the committee, we all get the idea that there must be a grade 4 hospital and an academic centre.  We cannot just draw straight lines between places.  The point is that there is a hospital group, as well as a certain amount of CHOs.  The borders are clear.  If we divide the number of primary care clusters - 97 - by seven, it comes down to the definition of borders.  As the Chairman indicated, it is about accountability and, as Deputy Louise O'Reilly stated, patients having pathways.  We are not saying we cannot imagine the reason the borders wiggle; we are asking why they are not defined and clear, or why we cannot quantify exactly what is going on in the case of personnel, treatment services and what we own as a state in an area.</p></speech>

Patients live in communities.  In mapping primary care networks it is envisaged that there will be primary care clusters or networks for populations of between 50,000 and 90,000.  They fit within community health organisations and map groups of local authority areas.  In other areas they relate to entire counties, which makes much sense vertically.  In other words, we start with the patient, look at his or her community and have a primary care focus which fits within community health organisations.  It includes other elements such as social care and mental health services and so on.  We can all accept that this makes sense.  It gets complicated when hospital groups are layered on top.</p> <p>  I will return to an earlier point about the hierarchy I have described to the committee.  I am not suggesting the following is in the minds of members, but it is in mine.  If it were my choice, the last thing I would do is re-amalgamate the hospital groups.</p></speech>

In 2012 the then Minister initiated a process called the Higgins review which considered a set of criteria for hospital groups but which did not take into account community health services.  I will come back to Deputy Billy Kelleher's specific questions about the creation of the hospital groups.  As a result of their creation, the ISAs no longer functioned.</p><p>The HSE sought to deal with the implications for community services, where it had a particular concern and that is where the report on the community healthcare organisations, CHO, which is population and geographically-based, comes from.  That then leads to the discordance between the two.</p><p> In regard to Deputy Kelleher's specific questions on hospital groups-----</p></speech>

He has given us the background as to how they came about.  What is the rationale for operating two separate systems when we are looking for integration and know that integration is so important?</p></speech>

I need to own that fact because I was not the person who made those decisions.  Let us look at the example of the mid-west, where we have a hospital group and a community health organisation whose boundaries are coterminous.  We do not have the complicating factor of boundaries.  That previously was an integrated service area.  If they were present, the people who now work in that area, one running the hospital group and the other running the community health organisation, would tell the committee that both sets of services are running more effectively under separate management, albeit with coterminous boundaries than used to be the case when they were a single organisation.</p></speech>

Internationally there is a dialogue taking place about funded bundles of care across care locations and population-based funding.  Those devices are being used independent of structure to fund the right care pathways for citizens.  It is possible to provide a basket.</p> <p>  We have models of care and the committee may have had presentations from some of the clinical programmes already that define the optimal ways to provide care, that is, if our funding environment incentivises such a provision.  In the context of the mid-west, for example, if home care packages are available to the hospital or in the community before a person came to a hospital and if that is incentivised in both the service model and financially, it can act structurally independently and can incentivise behaviour. </p></speech>

Will he list the impediments to getting the borders aligned as they are in the mid-west?  How can one transfer funding from an acute setting to a primary care setting if part of the CHO belongs to somebody else?  How does one track that money and make sure it is going to the right place and being used in the right way?  It seems clear to me there is some impediment either on the part of the HSE or the hospital groups.  I doubt it is in primary care because that service does not have enough power yet.  What is the impediment to getting the borders at this point, when we are all working so hard to sort out this situation?

Let us take the Ireland east hospital group, as I think it was discussed here recently and Deputy Kelleher asked a specific question on it.  It runs from Wexford to Kilkenny, St. Columcille's, St. Vincent's, the Mater and then to Navan.  There is an articulated rationale for that group but that rationale could not apply in a community setting.  One could not have a community health organisation that followed that track and transected Dublin in that way.  If one started from a community based approach, one would never draw the map that way for community services.</p></speech>

May I come back to Deputy Kelleher's question?</p> <p>   Deputy Kelleher asked about the independence issue in respect of hospital groups.  Independence is a word that has been thrown about a lot in the debate around hospital groups.  It is important to stress that there is no definition of what independence means.  Some people have perceived it to mean something like a foundation trust status in the NHS.  Others simply think it means operational freedom to do a set range of tasks in a way that makes operational sense at local level.  The truth is at one end or somewhere in between.  It is clear that hospital groups will be funded by a central entity against a set performance set of standards using activity-based funding, which drive behaviours.  Mr. Liam Woods has spoken about that and can do so again.  We would never go back to the type of thing that happened under the health boards, best illustrated by breast cancer surgery where there were 37 hospitals dabbling in breast cancer surgery resulting in sub-optimal outcomes.  At central level, individual hospital groups will have to be authorised to provide services that are evidence based, sensible and meet a population need based on our population size and distribution.  They would never have the freedom to go back and reintroduce cancer services of a scale and type that are not appropriate.  Some hospital groups get distracted by this notion of trust status, particularly because it has been in the air for such a long time.  I do not believe that the public sector environment in Ireland would move in the direction of the types of freedoms that foundation trusts have in the UK., which gives them freedom to decide the number of staff they will have, what they will pay them, to step outside of national procurement contracts and all that type of thing - I do not think that will ever happen and it is something of a distraction - all we are really talking about is the opportunity for a set of hospitals - in which it makes some sense to put them together - to decide how services will be organised across their sites.  An example was given at a previous meeting of the interoperability that is now occurring between the Mater and Navan hospitals and that is making some sense.  There are similar examples between Beaumont and Cavan hospitals.  While there are those kinds of ground-based operational freedoms, they would not allow hospitals to go off and deliver services, or to use the example, to become left hip specialists.  That would not be permitted by the funding model.</p> <p>  In terms of the GP contracts, there is no set timeline for that.  I was asked about my ambitions in this regard.  My view is that we need to re-establish the primacy of the generalist.  In our health system, as in so many, we have tended to make sovereigns of specialists.  One GP colleague put it to me in this way.  In general practice, the patients stay the same and the conditions change; in specialist hospitals the condition stays the same and the patients keep changing, which can be rather annoying from their point of view.  We need to have a health system that over a period of time recognises the specialty that is general practice, puts general practice at the heart of prevention and chronic disease management and gives it a full range of access to diagnostics.  The general practitioners who refer patients to hospitals should not be second guessed by junior doctors there with only a fraction of their experience in general practice.  We need to fund general practice in order to do that.  We must recognise the workforce base, if I can use that term, in general practice right now is stretched.</p><p>We have not been retaining GP trainees in the numbers we once did.  We also have an age profile that is concerning.  Consequently, whatever we do or do not agree during the GP contract negotiations, it will not be possible to implement the ideal general practice primary care service in one fell swoop.  We have to recognise that there is a workforce development issue which will probably take ten full years to address.  This will be a long journey rather than a single event.  Those are my broad ambitions and hopes.</p></speech>

Recognising what is currently a scarce commodity of experienced general practitioners, we need to look at how we can support general practitioners with other allied health professions in order to ensure that they can design processes which work optimally for the populations they are trying to serve.  That will require the extraction of resources from the acute sector over time.  It will require over time some reconfiguration of the acute sector so that some facilities that we currently regard as acute facilities effectively become primary care facilities.  That will be difficult.  Local communities may not necessarily be delighted with that.</p> <p>  In regard to the issue of agencies, the only reason the health service depends on agency staff currently is because of its inability to fill permanent posts.  No health service manager, apart from in rare exceptional circumstances, wants to have a dependency on agency staff, either in medical or nursing.  The Deputy will be aware that currently there is a real challenge in recruiting permanent staff notwithstanding our willingness to give permanent contracts.  It is a major difficulty for us.  Every conversion improves sustainability and quality and also improves the financial bottom line.</p></speech>

I am already convinced.  I just do not believe that Mr. O'Brien has any plan and I consequently cannot help but come to the conclusion that he has not prioritised the conversion of agency staff into directly employed staff.  Mr. O'Brien is presiding over a health service that is a deeply unattractive place for health professionals and support staff to work in.  He knows this because they leave the health service.  The health service cannot recruit , attract or retain staff.</p></speech>

I mentioned earlier the number of recently qualified general practitioners who I see tweeting from Australia and Canada.  I am also very much aware of the numbers of our own graduate student nurses who will inevitably seek employment off shore in our nearest neighbour and so on.  There has always been a pattern of people adding to their skills and experience by going abroad for a period of time.  The difficulty at present is that they are not being attracted back.  Part of that is the economic reality.  The salary situation and the take-home pay effect of gross salaries, which is very different to our nearest neighbours, is having a significant impact.  Unfortunately, that then creates the situation where the staff that we have are working under increased pressure, which makes it even more difficult to persuade others to come and join them.</p></speech>

We have shared quite a bit of data with the committee but we can share whatever else we have not shared.  I refute the Deputy's point.  There is no unwillingness or lack of desire to maximise the number of permanent contracted directly-employed staff versus agency staff.  We cannot fill posts with staff that do not exist.  We cannot allow services to be less safe by refusing to employ agency staff where we can get them.  Even the employment of agency staff is becoming extremely difficult right now for all the same reasons.</p></speech>

At local level, hospitals undertake exit surveys so they have some awareness of the reasons.  Some of the reasons are things Deputy O'Reilly referred to, such as the desire to travel among younger students and the nature of the work, which can be stressful at times.  That has been reported and, in our dialogues with the INMO and our own staff, we are very aware of that.  Income and the earnable net income have become a challenge.  Opportunities for education and development are also an incentive and are desired by staff so the extent to which we provide that, which is quite extensive, is an attractor.</p> <p>  I will make a point on agency staff.  The acute system reduced agency staff in gross terms by &euro;39 million last year, so there has been some success at conversion.  It continues to do that this year.  We have had some success converting clinical agencies specifically.  There is still a very high number of agency staff.  It does not negate the discussion.  We are making some progress.</p></speech>

It is certainly true that a number of hospitals have been close to or on full capacity protocol for much of the year.  That is why they are included in a list of nine priority sites that we are seeking to address this year as part of the winter initiative.  This is a symptom of a system that is too acute sector focused and is at the heart of the need to transform the system to a more primary care focused system.  What the Deputy is saying is correct.  I am not disagreeing with her in any respect but I am saying it is very much a symptom of the way the overall system is functioning, which is not as it needs to function in the future.</p></speech>

I will come back to some of the themes raised by my colleagues.</p> <p>  The restructuring fatigue issue was highlighted by Mr. O'Brien.  That matter has come up a number of times with other witnesses who appeared before the committee.  When the hospital groups came before us, they said although they are not perfect, they have changed patient pathways for the better but that issues arise with regard to resources, a lack of capacity and inpatient beds.  Will Mr. O'Brien outline the steps the committee would need to take to ensure that we have a functioning group system throughout the country?  All of the hospitals in the Saolta hospital group in the west are HSE-run hospitals, which is a completely different scenario to what is happening in the east, which has voluntary hospitals.  There are challenges in this regard.  For us to come forward with a report that works for the health service in Ireland over the next ten years and to have the most effective health system in the short, medium and long term, we need to be able to deal with these challenges if we are seriously looking at a non-restructuring solution or, at least, trying to minimise restructuring.  Will Mr. O'Brien go through the steps that need to happen for an effective group system?</p> <p>  Will Mr. O'Brien spell out the link between the acute hospital system and community care?  Who will be responsible for oversight of the step-down facilities required when someone needs to leave hospital when their care comes to an end and they need to go to a step-down facility or a nursing home?  What is the governance structure between the hospitals and our primary care centres?  Mr. O'Brien needs to elaborate on this.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien made reference to acute hospital beds and said that simply increasing their number is not the easy solution.  He made reference to the importance of community care and step-down facilities.  We are all in agreement that if we had properly functioning community care and primary care centres it would alleviate bed capacity issues in our hospital system.  The clinical director of the Saolta group, Dr. Pat Nash, came before the committee.  The group stated University Hospital Galway, which is a centre of excellence model 4 hospital for seven counties, is not fit for purpose and cannot expand due to physical space issues.  Even if we had functioning community care, we would still need extra bed capacity.  The group made reference to the need for a new hospital at Merlin Park on State-owned land.  What are Mr. O'Brien's views on this?  Improvements in the ability to treat people and medicines mean that we will have an ageing population and that there will be a great need for acute hospitals.  We will still have very sick people who will need to go into hospital.  Does Mr. O'Brien agree that we need an independent assessment of bed capacity in Ireland?  By this I mean independent of the HSE.</p></speech>

He also came before the committee at the start of this process.  I am now a hell of a lot more knowledgeable of the system then I was back then and it is very beneficial to have Mr. O'Brien before the committee again.  We are focusing on number of areas we see as critical for our report to give the health system an opportunity to succeed.</p> <p>  An issue that keeps arising is the lack of accountability throughout the entire HSE.  I will ask Mr. O'Brien a very direct question.  In the structures under which he operates, can he bring about accountability?  Is the system so far gone that it is impossible for him to do so?  What would make it possible?  If we do not have accountability in health system we will not solve the problems.  This theme has arisen with group after group which has come before the committee over the past four or five months.  Is it possible for Mr. O'Brien to do the job he was employed to do in the current circumstances?  Do we need to introduce legislation or changes to allow him fulfil his role?  For how long has Mr. O'Brien been in his current position?</p></speech>

He states that both roles mentioned will be filled as soon as is practicable.  This is of concern to me.  Why is it so difficult to get people in place for such critical roles?  The HSE should go about recruiting for a particular critical role and appoint a group to advertise and interview, or do this internally.  A working group should be established to acquire these individuals, a timeline should be set and they should be appointed.  To state that the positions will be filled as soon as practicable is too open.  I would much prefer to see a statement that these roles will be filled by the first quarter of 2017.  This would create a target for which somebody would be accountable.  If the person is in place, that would be great.  If, however, he or she is not, we could ask why that is the case.</p> <p>  I agree with Mr. O'Brien that it is very difficult for anybody to make an assumption on whether the hospital groups are working if they are not working optimally.  The seven hospital groups came before the committee.  I was very impressed by the set-up in the mid-west and felt it is working quite well because of the structures in place.  It carries out routine procedures in its category 2 hospitals, which frees up capacity in its category 3 hospitals.  I thought this was a very simple way to do business which improves efficiency.  The next obvious question is why this does not happen in all of the other groups.  It should be happening and we should make it happen.</p> <p>  I asked each hospital group whether it recruits as group or individually and I received different answers from the various groups.  Recruiting as a group should be the only way it is done.  To go back to the area I know best, which is Kerry, it is extremely difficult for Kerry University Hospital to recruit but it is not as difficult for Cork University Hospital.  If the group recruited, the doctors, nurses and consultants could be assigned so there would be no cherry-picking by people who want to go to where all the activity is.  We would have much more successful outcomes.  This system exists in the mid-west where recruitment is done by the group, but the latter is not done in the area from which I come.  It should be compulsory.</p><p>Again I return to the question of whether it is possible to make this happen.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned the success of acute stroke units.  There is no acute stroke unit in Kerry University Hospital, a category 3 hospital.  There is no cardiologist in the hospital.  It depends on a phone call up and down from Cork once a week.  These are structural issues that can be addressed if tackled properly.  The people in Kerry to whom I speak say the people in Cork, if they are of a sympathetic mind, might come down and help us but, if they are not, there is nothing we can do about it.  The cost of recruiting staff through agencies is three times that of recruiting staff directly.  If a group recruitment system were in place whereby staff were sent to the less attractive areas, this issue would be solved and the less attractive areas would become more attractive with the increased staffing.  One problem solves another.</p><p> Regarding the shift to primary care, do the witnesses have any figures or data as to what kind of investment is needed in primary care to make it work and subsequently take the pressure off the hospital system down the line?  From the first day this committee met, the message of investing in primary care to help solve the issues further up the line has been coming across.  Mr. O'Brien mentioned the New York model.  New York had a specific savings target and investment budget.  Do we have anything like that?  If not, we should seek it.  If we know what to invest in with a degree of - I will not say certainty - hope that if the work is done, significant moneys will be saved further down the line in the hospital system, then it is worth investing in it.  Do the witnesses have any figures that would help us in this area?</p><p>  Mr. O'Brien mentioned IT although he said he would not spend much time discussing it.  It comes across to us that IT is one of the most important areas in which to invest to allow savings to be made and the system to run efficiently.  Do the witnesses have any figures as to the amount of money needed to invest in IT to get us to where we want to be?  This is critical.</p><p> Regarding Mr. O'Brien's issue with 12-month budgets, I do not know of any organisation that does not operate according to such budgets.  The whole country operates this way.  By what system does Mr. O'Brien suggest we operate?  What different model could we consider?  Nearly every organisation I know works according to an annual budget.  What would Mr. O'Brien like to see done differently to this to help the HSE do its job?</p></speech>

I will try to be brief in my comments and questions.  The terms of reference of this committee are to provide a single-tier system that provides services in a timely manner based on need rather than ability to pay, which effectively means patient-centred care.  In our planning, patient-centred care tends to be forgotten about, unlike structures and governance.  My questions therefore concern patient-centred care.</p> <p>  First, what do the witnesses think will trigger the transfer from hospital-centred care to primary-centred care?  We have a capacity problem in general practice but also with public health nurses, therapists and psychologists.  A range of personnel make up primary care, not just general practitioners.</p> <p>  Second, Mr. O'Brien mentioned transitional funding, which seems to be absolutely essential in any transformation programme.  How would such transitional funding be targeted?</p> <p>  Third, there is a problem with integration of GP and hospital services and there is a gap between the two.  The trigger of the transfer of people from general practice to hospital services tends to be immediate.  There is no transition between hospital and GP services.  I would like Mr. O'Brien to comment on how this transition could be filled.</p> <p>  There is a problem with governance in our hospitals and within the hospital groups, and there is very little GP input into governance in the hospital groups, which leads to much frustration among general practitioners.  There is also very deep frustration among consultants in the hospital groups that their voice is not heard.  There is a gap in the governance between what it is intended to do and how it is delivered.</p> <p>  Finally, regarding bed capacity, I believe 600 beds are occupied by people who are on delayed discharges.  This is a huge rate of bed occupancy which does not fulfil an acute need.  Perhaps Mr. O'Brien could comment on how delayed discharges and transfer to community services could be bridged.  There has been a huge withdrawal of or reduction in publicly-funded chronic care, which has been transferred to privately-funded chronic care, and the gap in this regard needs to be addressed.  Publicly-funded chronic care is very important but seems to be decreasing rather than increasing.</p></speech>

I was appointed as acting CEO in 2012 and became the director general in 2013 on the passage of the legislation that created those changes.  By this stage, if the statements of the time were to be believed, the HSE would not exist.  It was my expectation at that time that many of the changes we are discussing around hospital groups would be much more advanced than they currently are.  The intention was that each hospital group would have a board appointed to it on an administrative basis, that is, without legislation, and that legislation would follow to create those hospital groups as legal entities.  As we know, that has not happened.</p> <p>  At a certain point during my time in the HSE, it appointed boards to two of the hospital groups, namely, mid-west and what we now call Saolta.  General practice was well represented on both boards, as were other local and relevant interests.  Unfortunately, the process of appointing other boards has not progressed, although the Minister is currently progressing it and, as recently as last week, on a ministerial basis, appointed or reappointed a board for the mid-west hospital group and is progressively intending to do so for all the other hospital groups.</p></speech>

The exception is the Children's Hospital Group, which has a ministerial appointed board.  The Children's Hospital Group is in a slightly different position for a variety of reasons.  In terms of the six acute hospital groups, two had boards and four did not.</p> <p>  In addition, the process of appointing chief executives for those hospital groups is difficult.  The level of interest in those roles was small and the potential to recruit outside of our system or to attract any international interest was adversely affected by the level of remuneration, which was not competitive in terms of those fulfilling similar roles in other jurisdictions.  Ultimately, at my request and that of Mr. Woods and his predecessor, the brightest of our own staff were prepared to stand forward and take up those roles.  The chief executives we currently have in place were appointed on an interim basis outside of the recruitment process simply because those recruitment processes carried out by the Public Appointments Services had not been successful.  That having been said, and the committee having met them all, they are all doing pretty good jobs and making a good contribution.</p> <p>  On the two posts the Deputy asked me about, I used the term as soon as practicable because, contrary to what one might expect, I have very little control over those processes.  When the post of deputy director general fell vacant this time last year I commenced a process of seeking the necessary approvals to refill that post and to create the additional post.  That led to provisional approval in August which enabled me to engage in the dialogue I needed to engage in with the others who were affected, which included the issue of the communication the Deputy has there.  We then had to get into a further process which required the individual job specifications to be signed off, not only by myself and the Department of Health but also by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, before we could invite the Public Appointments Service to proceed with the recruitment process.  That is why I was ambiguous about the deadline.  I can tell the Deputy, however, that the Public Appointments Service has kicked off that process and we expect to have the individuals in post in the first quarter of 2017.  I do not have the level of control over timetabling that one might imagine.</p></speech>

It would seem, even from the answer on that one issue of some critical positions that need to be filled, by Mr. O'Brien's own admission, it is outside of his control.</p></speech>

Contrary to what might be expected, the head of a public service organisation - this relates to the conversation on Deputy Kelleher's questions about future trusts - does not have control in the formal sense over the numbers of staff that an organisation is able to employ, their rates of remuneration or, ultimately, above a certain grade, the blend of structure of his or her management team where he or she requires levels of approval which go beyond his or her parent Department or the Department under whose aegis he or she operates to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and those processes take a little while.  Ultimately, the Public Appointments Service is responsible for carrying out the campaign and it will do so efficiently and effectively, but at the point at which I was telling the management team - which was what that communication was - that this was to happen, which I needed to do in order to involve it in some of the process, I could not be specific about the timetable because I did not have control over when those approvals would come and I used ambiguous language.</p></speech>

In our submissions to the Department when this was being mentioned as part of the Government formation process, our central point was that this should not be an acute bed review; it should be a total bed review taking into account long-term care beds as well rather than only acute hospital beds.</p> <p>  I touched on the governance issues around hospital groups.  The delay in the appointment of boards has led to some ambiguity in the sense that we have groups which, by general public comment, are intended to have various operating freedoms but the reality is that the directorate of the HSE remains fully accountable for them and the legal authority that they have currently is through the delegation structure set out in the 2004 Act.  I receive a delegation from the directorate and Mr. Wood receives a delegation from me and he parcels that out to the seven group chief executives and their authority is very much HSE authority, but, as was said, there are very different mixtures of underpinning governance in the different hospital groups.  Saolta and the mid-west group, with the exception of St. John's, are essentially statutory hospitals where the governance is simple in that sense in that we can give full authority to an individual and state something is his or hers and he or she is accountable for it.  In hospital groups which have a mixture of statutory hospitals and voluntary hospitals and the level of control of the group chief executive is through ownership of the budget and the service level arrangement with the voluntary hospitals, that is of a different quality.  Obviously, we have had to take the view that we work with the raw material we have.  There is no policy direction currently as to what way that will ultimately be resolved and the HSE does not have a position or has not taken a position, one way or the other.  In other words, we are not saying they should all be statutory and we are not saying they should all become voluntary.  We are saying all these groups are slightly different and there may have to be an eclectic set of arrangements, provided they are effective, clear and straightforward in relation to each group.  We are not saying they all have to be exactly the same.  There is a diversity in the health system.  That is the way it developed.  Some of that diversity has been good and some of it not so good.  Mr. Woods will address the issue of Saolta and beds, etc.</p></speech>

The Deputy is correct in saying that some hospitals are running at capacity and do not, for example, as referred to by Deputy Harty, have significant delayed discharged.  In the context of Galway, there is good access to community services, there are relatively few patients clinically appropriate for discharge who cannot be discharged and the hospital is in that sense running at high capacity.  Galway is putting in a 75-bed block which will open in February next and that is replacing existing capacity.  We are looking at proposals to see can we also then retain another 30 beds because we see a need in Galway for increased capacity.  Those 30 beds would be available within the existing facility and would require some upgrade.</p> <p>  Deputy Brassil mentioned that Dr. Pat Nash had referred to the Merlin Park site as a potential location.  In many ways, in Galway it has long been thought that Merlin Park - even parking on the campus in Galway would indicate that it is difficult and challenging - would be a suitable site for another hospital over time.  It has not happened yet.  Some services, as part of the group's overall service design, are moving to Merlin Park.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien addressed the independence issue.  On the notion of an independent review, it is already determined to be so.  HSE has data that would help inform that but the review itself would be independent.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how groups could work effectively if there were no restructuring, if I understood the question.  In a way, where we see it working well is that there is a strong view of what the appropriate clinical pathways are and that they are adhered to.  There are some examples of that working well, for instance, in neurology.  I am not sure if Dr. Colin Doherty from St. James's was here but we were at the Joint Committee on Health recently.  There is a model working which is connecting GPs, patients and neurologists, freeing up space in St. James's, providing better care for patients, and linking effectively with GPs and speedily providing GPs with advice online.  On the idea of enablement through technology to manage care transitions, there will always be transitions between care locations independent of the structure.</p><p>The management of those transitions, and the use of technology in that context, is really important.</p></speech>

Social workers would perform this role in University Hospital Galway.  When patients are returning home, it is organised in connection with community services.  This is done by Tony Canavan and his team in Galway.  The rules governing movements to nursing homes are prescribed under legislation.  The fair deal process comes into operation when people are in hospitals to oversee their potential transfer to nursing homes.  Approximately 60% of those who avail of the fair deal process go from community settings to nursing homes, rather than from hospitals to nursing homes.  There are people within the hospitals who have dedicated responsibility for that.  They work with the community services.  Capacity on the nursing home side in the west is more likely to be owned by the HSE, but the community services identify spaces.  There is a bed bureau in place in the north city area of Dublin.  Community services advise hospitals of where the spaces are to ensure there is quick movement.</p></speech>

The number was 649 a couple of months ago.  I suspect it will be approximately 540 when the weekly census is published today.  At any point in time, a number of people will be in this category.  That number is too high.  Sometimes we hear the argument that it would be better if this were controlled from hospitals or from the community.  The net problem is that regardless of who is in control, there are limits on total supply and total capacity.  It is for that reason I mentioned in my opening remarks the issue of making non-fair deal as demand-led as fair deal is.  If the hospitals controlled it, they would ultimately have exactly the same capacity and the same budget that the communities have now.  I would be concerned that this would turn the hospitals into magnets for access to home care.  In the past, for various reasons we have sought to prioritise egress from hospitals.  This has had the effect of leading to blockages in the community.  This has meant that the route to get to home care has been through the hospital.  This has had a perverse effect.</p></speech>

Clinical directors have said here that a plan for a new hospital is needed.  The suggestion we have heard that old wards will be opened on a congested site shows a lack of vision, in my view, from the HSE and the Department with regard to the needs of the 800,000 people who live in the hospital's catchment area.  This is just one example of where we need governance and management structures and groups that work and are effective.</p></speech>

This is probably relevant to the point made by Deputy Brassil about the assignment of individuals across locations within a group to provide care on multiple sites during the training phase or in permanent employment.  The groups are focused on the latter aspect of this issue.  I will come to the actual recruitment mechanisms in a moment.  Joint appointment across sites is happening and we will see more of that.  I think we will be increasingly dependent on rotation from larger to smaller sites to maintain appropriate staff levels and the right kind of clinical input, which is a point that has been mentioned.  This is part of group planning.  We can give the committee documentation on the recruitment process itself.  Voluntary hospitals tend to recruit for themselves.  Approximately half of the total acute service resource is in voluntary hospitals.  The statutory hospitals recruit through the national recruitment service.  Truly national campaigns are sometimes run.  A recent campaign to recruit emergency department nurses asked for applications to all points.  The recruitment service will support somewhere like Limerick in running its own competitions locally.  It does the same in Galway.  Local units are supported in running competitions.  There can be back-end administration around Garda clearance and contracting that does not necessarily exist on every site.  The interviewing and the creation of competitions is done locally.</p></speech>

I mentioned DSRIP earlier as an example because I do not believe, given the current pressures on the hospital system and the amount of work that is waiting outside the doors of the hospital system, that we can expect any time soon to be able to extract the type of funding from hospitals that is necessary to develop the primary care system to the point where it is viable to do that.  I believe it is going to be necessary to pump investment into primary care so that the transition can take place.  The negotiations on the GP contract are central to our understanding and conceptualising of that.  Just before the economic implosion, efforts were made to remove funding arbitrarily from the hospitals and invest it in primary care.  The net effect of this was that the hospitals went into meltdown and all of this was unwound in the course of a year.  I think the concept of transitional funding is absolutely central to whatever it is the committee ultimately recommends, or whatever it is that any one of us would like to see by way of transformation in the health system.  DSRIP is just one example, but it appears to be a very successful example.  I shared a book with the committee earlier that gives details of some other examples in other parts of the world that may be of help.</p> <p>  A couple of Deputies have referred to the governance issue.  I sit here in a very unusual position.  I occupy a job which, as the Chairman will know, I did not actually apply for.  I am both the chief executive and the chairman of the largest organisation in the State, bar none.  I took up this position in the expectation that I would probably have it for a shorter period than I have had it for to date.  At some point, when there is a settled view about hospital groups and so on, there will need to be legislation so that accountability rests where authority lies, which is not the case at present.  I would not wish to see a legislative revision of the health service that does not address the fact that we have one person operating as chairman and chief executive of the largest organisation in the State.  It is a very uncomfortable position to be in, as I know the Chair is aware.  This brings me back to the issue of accountability.  This year we introduced a new accountability framework for all of those who hold budgets within the system.  It has been effective.  It has been difficult to do that in the past because - not to put a tooth on it - we have entered a number of years - probably five years of service planning - where everyone has known that the level of funding provided was not equal to the level of service committed to.  That recurrent supplementary funding of &euro;500 million or &euro;750 million has had to be provided is evidence of this.  In the current year, the Oireachtas voted a revised budget - not a supplementary budget - which was able to bring that cycle to an end.  This enabled us to say to all the budget holders across all of their domains that they can no longer simply say the job is undoable.  That has a fundamental impact on the psychology of accountability.</p><p>I also believe that just as clinicians, nurses and other professionals are accountable for professional standards to professional bodies, we need to recognise that management, administration and leadership in the health system, where it is provided by people who are not members of those professions, should be similarly regulated to prescribed professional standards so that we have an equal playing field in the health care setting.  Without it, we are not valuing that discipline in health care to the extent that we should and we are not providing equal accountability.</p></speech>

The previous time I met Mr. O'Brien was at the Committee of Public Accounts but he will be glad to hear there will not be the same level of grilling.  I welcome the fact there is an accountability framework in place.  That was a separate issue in respect of contracts.  Notwithstanding the remit of this committee, it is still in the abstract and at present we have to deal with what we have.  There is an onus to operate the HSE in as best a way as possible.  I welcome the fact Mr. O'Brien is avidly recruiting.</p> <p>  Does the Keane report, which was mentioned earlier, specifically deal with the retention of staff?  Morale is very low and I wonder what plans the HSE has to address staff morale?  We have to deal with the here and now and retaining staff is more difficult than recruiting staff.  Will he outline his views and suggest a solution?</p> <p>  In his opening statement, Mr. O'Brien mentions multi-morbidity.  Does the HSE have a long-term strategy to address that, to examine the change in demographics to see what solutions it has and if there will be a significant cost to the taxpayer on account of that?</p> <p>  Deputy Brassil mentioned IT in regard to health records.  What level of investment is required to create electronic health records and how has it progressed?</p></speech>

It was announced in the budget that &euro;35 million would be allocated for mental health services but we found out later that only &euro;15 million would be available to be spent.  The reason given by the Department of Health was that it was not possible to spend the other &euro;20 million.  Is that a decision of the HSE?  Does the HSE stand over that, that is, there is no where to spend &euro;20 million on mental health services, if it had that additional amount this year?  When is it expected that the HSE service plan will be delivered?</p> <p>  A motion was passed two weeks ago that stated that any unspent money allocated to mental health would be retained year on year.  Has that been communicated to the HSE?  Is Mr. O'Brien confident that the &euro;15 million that has been allocated to the HSE will be drawn down and spent on mental health in this 12 months?</p> <p>  Let me describe the morass of trying to get information.  I had two people online this week trying to find out the geographic areas of the 14 mental health teams.  I went online and spent all day Saturday and Sunday doing research on mental health.  It was impossible to find out online where the 14 mental health teams were.  This committee has allied health professionals, trade union professionals, lawyers and yet six months into this process, we are still finding new layers of structures in the HSE.  It is impossible to find out how the system actually works.  One example is from the HSE website.  If one looks up mental health services, one will see that information is only provided for one area, Limerick, north Tipperary and Clare.  If one lives outside those areas, one will not find out anything about the services.  The page on infant mental health is blank.  There is another page on mental health services in one's area, but it only is corporate waffle.  There is a link to more corporate waffle and then it links back to the first page.  It is a loop and one cannot find out the structures of the health services in the country.  To find out the health services available, one would think that by putting in one's eircode, the website would bring one to the services in that area.  Instead, professional researchers cannot find out the information.</p> <p>  Currently the Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill 2016 is going through the Seanad.  When a similar Bill was enacted in the UK, it dramatically changed accountability in the NHS.  Is this Bill on the radar of the HSE?  Is Mr. O'Brien preparing for the very serious decisions that will fall from it?  One of the issues with the HSE is the lack of delineation of people's roles in it.  I often find that one gets a commitment from a manager and when the manager moves on, the new manager will say it has nothing to do with him or her.  Under the Corporate Manslaughter (No. 2) Bill, management churn would no longer allow staff movement to effectively negative the decision, or the lack of decision-making.</p> <p>  The leader of the mid-west hospital group states she would have no difficulty giving money from her budget to the community.  That is because of the incentive.  If she transfers money to primary care facilities, they can keep people out of hospital, which drives down the waiting lists.  The primary care managers then know they can get people into the hospitals quicker.  There is an incentive.  </p> <p>  One point that keeps coming up week after week is the perverse incentives in the health care system to encourage people to simply waste money.  I have heard the arguments about the different alignments for hospital groups and community health organisations.  Let us look at the services in County Wexford.  If one has mental health issues in north Wexford, one goes to Wicklow while if one is in south Wexford, one goes to Waterford.  We are in the Ireland East Hospitals Group but the county councillors sit on the health committee for the southern group.  It is just all over the place.  The Wexford manager must be driven demented going from one area to another trying to co-ordinate everything.</p></speech>

Our data show that we are doing more emergency and fewer elective procedures each year.  If these trends continue all work will be emergency work and we will be unable to accommodate elective work.  When do we reach that point?  Will Mr. O'Brien indicate whether it will be next year or in five to ten years' time?</p> <p>  I am concerned about the amount of money available between 2017 and 2021 in the capital space to pay for our ambulances, X-ray machines and MRI scanning equipment?  The &euro;2.25 billion, however, does not meet the &euro;3.64 billion that is required in order to meet the long list of priority replacements so we have an immediate problem.  If there is no additional funding, can Mr. O'Brien give an indication of how that plays out?  Will funding be provided for years one to three - 2017 to 2019, inclusive - and then one hits a cliff or is the budget stretched over five years and the problems start kicking in during 2017?  Will Mr. O'Brien give the committee a flavour of the situation?</p></speech>

I call on Mr. O'Brien to respond.</p></speech>

I will begin with the more straight forward questions from Deputy Browne.  The service plan was approved by the HSE directorate in draft form last Thursday and submitted to the Department of Health on Friday.  Under legislation the Minister has 21 days to consider that plan.  He does not have to take the full 21 days, so I would expect that within the 21 days the plan will either be approved, rejected or amended, whatever the process is.  The normal process is that within a day or so of its approval, it gets published.</p> <p>  In respect of the mental health allocation of &euro;35 million versus &euro;15 million, this is in my view an application of reality.</p><p>When the development of services is being prioritised, as is being done by that money, and that development is predicated on the recruitment and deployment of staff, as we enter a year and begin the process of recruitment, we need to know that in the second year we will have the full year cost and that we can pay the wages for the full year.  There is, however, the reality that with the approval of the budget in November or October or a service plan in December, one will not be able to spend that full year cost in year one.  That has been the pattern in recent years.  The formula arrived at is that sufficient funding would be made available in 2017 to fund full year expenditure of &euro;35 million in 2018.  Experience indicates that this is about the right approach.  It is our approach to retain any unspent moneys where they are on unspent, which includes mental health.  I believe that the &euro;15 million that is allocated and which will be addressed in the service plan when published will be appropriately expended in 2017 on mental health.</p><p> With regard to structures, I acknowledge that there is an issue with the website.  It is not a good website, but there is a national information line on 1850 241 850, from 8 a.m. until 8 p.m. Monday to Saturday, where staff are available to answer such enquiries.  As of last week a new live chat feature was introduced on the website which gets through to the same people.  We recognise that it is not always the easiest website to navigate and that this is more of a problem with the website than it is with the services.  Nonetheless, it needs to be addressed.</p><p> Reference was made to a mismatch with the health fora.  The community healthcare organisations' report makes clear that they were structured in a way that would align well with the regional assemblies, which were priority policy at that time, and with an expectation - not our decision, of course - that at a future point the health fora would be realigned to those regional assembly boundaries.  That speaks to one of the mismatches identified by the committee.</p><p> As to when we would run out of elective capacity and the issue of our approach to the multi-mobility, I will ask my colleague Mr. Woods to address that and then I will come back to the other points.</p></speech>

The HSE undertakes about 94,000 elective inpatient cases per year.  In total, the HSE does 1.6 million cases per year.  The elective capacity is reducing at around 1,000 to 1,500 per year and it is being replaced by a greater volume of emergency work, and day case volume is growing.  That is the trend within the data on what is happening in the current service provision.  There was a question about multi-----</p></speech>

Whether we could call it a crisis or not, our capacity to do scheduled care does not match the rate at which we take on people seeking scheduled care.  That is a big problem.  Some of the things we have already discussed potentially address that in refocusing towards primary care.  At the moment, however, we have seen up to a 15% increase in referral from primary care to some specialties since January.  We have seen a 5% increase in referrals from community to emergency departments in the current year.  To some extent it would be speculating as to what the future rates would be, but certainly we are seeing those kinds of trends.  We had 1.3 million attendances at accident and emergency departments per annum, which are up 5%.  GPs see about 25 million-----</p></speech>

Is the increase due to an absence of appropriate services such as out of hours or at community level?</p></speech>

The commentary that we have shows there is a significant increase in out-of-hours work which is up 11% in the current year in the GP space.  That has a higher propensity to give rise to hospital referrals.  I would emphasise that only about half of our total attendances at accident and emergency departments first see a GP.  Many people are self-referring, are walk-in and are not going the GP route.  There are multiple factors there.  It could be pressure in the GP environment but also a higher level in the community of people who are self-presenting to hospital.  Those are the kinds of drivers for the increase.</p> <p>  Our current capacity is a concern for us and it is a key focus towards the end of this year to try to address some of the longer waiters.  Our current capacity in terms of delivering scheduled care is challenged.  The committee would have heard some of the hospital groups say they are trying to create dedicated elective space, to protect some space from emergency take, to allow for the rational doing of work on a surgical basis such as day surgery units, for example, on stand-alone sites, and that is happening at the moment.</p> <p>  There was a question on multiple co-morbidities.  There is a plan for frail elderly management which is to deal with that issue.  There is investment in this, with a number of other programmes in chronic condition management, of about &euro;9 million to do some pilots this year and next year.  The plan itself has been documented by Dr. Siobhan Kennelly who is a geriatrician in Connolly Hospital.  That would involve moving resources and has involved nurses and geriatricians moving into the community, attending at nursing homes, particularly private nursing homes where there may be limited or no service available, and looking to see to what extent they can reduce presentation at accident and emergency departments resulting from infection or fairly simple health care needs.  That plan has started at the moment and work is undertaken in some hospitals.  St James's Hospital did some very specific work in addressing the needs of frail elderly last year, and very successfully.  There is other work under way specifically in areas such as COPD and cardiology where there are relatively significant numbers attending emergency departments that are potentially avoidable and could be treated in the community, with some support.  There is investment going into those areas, but as the discussion here has flagged, it will need to be much greater in the future.</p></speech>

Retention is an issue for each of the hospital groups.  I should have said this in response to the earlier question.  One of the primary objectives is to develop a strategic plan for the way services are distributed throughout those groups.  There is guidance issued from the Department of Health relating to each of those.  That work has not progressed at the speed originally intended.  Some of the issues around retention and recruitment are the way services are distributed across hospitals, the way rotas are structured and, for non-consultant hospital doctors, the extent of Ireland's compliance with the European working time directive.  In the past two years we instituted the introduction into every hospital of a lead non-consultant hospital doctor, a bit like one would see in American television programmes of a lead resident or a chief resident, to represent the interests of non-consultant hospital doctors in the management process of the hospitals to ensure their situation is dealt with better.</p></speech>

Ireland is really late to the party on joined-up health records.  A decade of not just underinvestment but pretty much no investment in some of our platform systems has resulted in that.  As in some other spaces, however, that means we are not in the difficult position of having to rip out recently invested systems.  We do not have that legacy systems problem.  Two weeks ago I signed the memorandum of agreement with the Department of Social Protection which will allow us to roll out the individual health identifier.  This will be rolled out in 2018.

The maternal and infant electronic health record will go live over the weekend as a first instance in Cork and, I believe, in Tralee.  This is an electronic health record for mothers and infants, which is a significant success.  We have already done significant implementation on the national integrated medical imaging system, NIMIS.  It is in 38 sites throughout the State.  We are undertaking a programme of work around the national medical laboratory system, MEDLIS, which is laboratory implementation.  To join that all together, and in a way I share the Chairman's frustrations, electronic health records globally are already expressed in the business case and we are very keen to get that moved on.  The maternal one will go around all 19 units in the State over the next 30 months.</p></speech>

The HSE's IT investment is approximately 0.4% of its budget.  There is a necessity.  Committee members have made points about the need for integration and managing boundaries across care.

The way that it works is that, legally, we submit an annual capital plan at the same time as our service plan.  Most of it is now devoted to large projects rather than little ones.  I referenced the matter in my opening statement, and I thank the committee for indulging the length of that statement.  Without a significant uplift in capital for the next ten years, we will be spending the greater part of our money on the large, Government priority, flagship projects of which the committee is aware.  We will not be replacing the bread and butter, day-to-day equipment, which means that the equipment will increasingly fail and not be available and that we will not be operating some of our less fashionable services from environments that are not optimal for patient outcomes.</p></speech>

Does that mean that the HSE will spend all of the money in the first two to three years, when everything is grand, only to fall off a cliff unless there is a supplement or will problems with key equipment not being replaced start kicking in next year?</p></speech>

We can only spend a certain amount of it each year.  One could not frontload it in that way and then run out of money.

A well-functioning organisation should be able to display its management structure on a one-page diagram.  The diagram before me of senior management within the HSE bears no relation to what is happening on the ground in terms of the hospital, community health care organisation, CHO, and mental health service systems or primary care teams.  This issue has been raised by many of the groups that have appeared before us, including staff groups represented by their trade unions.</p> <p>  One suggestion has been to consider a geographical division of the country into three or four health authorities, each with defined responsibilities for its senior people in terms of service delivery.  Defined responsibility is lacking at the moment, as it is difficult to get to the person who is in charge of something. Deputy Browne mentioned how it might be a different person in charge of something from one month to the next.  There is no clear line of sight in terms of accountability or budget spend.  Has the HSE given any consideration to a geographical division of the country for its management structures so as to have a clearer line?</p> <p>  Will Mr. O'Brien comment on the level of confidence among staff in the workability of existing structures?  We have asked almost every group that has appeared before us about whether it believes that the existing structures could deliver.  The answer has generally been "No".</p> <p>  Regarding the delivery of community services, can the HSE provide a management structure diagram in respect of each CHO?</p></speech>

Those teams have 14 geographical boundaries for reasons that are laid out in A Vision for Change.</p> <p>  Regarding the Chairman's larger questions on confidence and geography, in addressing the CHOs, we ensured that they could be grouped in a way that corresponded with regional assembly boundaries, which in turn are groups of local authority boundaries, in recognition of the fact that, when one considers health in its widest sense, there is considerable crossover and a need for correlation between local health services, local authorities and local Garda boundaries.  This significant issue was taken into account.  From a structural point of view, particularly on the community side, there would be no impediment to organising along those regional lines if that was desired.</p></speech>

We did not want to break the fundamental unit in the previous environment, which was the local health office.  There was no particular need to do so.  I will respond to the direct question that was asked by expressing my view that there is a good degree of confidence among staff and managers in CHOs that they can significantly improve the quality, extent and organisation of the services for which they are responsible.  I think there is a significant degree of frustration within the hospital groups, particularly at senior level, about the fact that their journey has become unclear.  They would have expected that by now, legislation would have been introduced to provide for boards and to make accountability very clear.  The hospital groups would have expected to have a degree of freedom they do not currently have.  That would be the primary source of frustration.</p> <p>  I am happy to repeat what I said at the time, which is that the hospital groups were not all created equally.  Some of them will be more successful than others.  At various points in time, their boundaries, organisation and number may need to be revisited, reviewed and changed.  I believe that in principle, we are already seeing benefits from the hospital groups.  Some of those benefits were referenced previously by some of the chief executives.  I return to the Chairman's point that the decisions which were made when the hospital groups were being created came from one place and the decisions which were made when the CHOs were being established came from another place.  I believe the boundaries for the CHOs are well evidenced and sustainable.</p></speech>

We had an instance of that last week so I ask members to adhere to that request, please.</p><p>Before referring to the two items that we are to address today, I extend a welcome to the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald and her officials.</p><p>The first matter is the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2016 to be followed by Supplementary Estimates for Vote 20, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Vote 22, the Courts Service.</p><p>In regard to the matter of the Judicial Appointment Commission Bill 2016, I am advised that Article 17.2 of the Constitution provides:</p><blockquote>D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann shall not pass any vote or resolution, and no law shall be enacted, for the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys unless the purpose of the appropriation shall have been recommended to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann by a message from the Government signed by the Taoiseach.</blockquote> <p>Standing Order 179(2) of the Houses of the Oireachtas provides that:</p><blockquote>The Committee Stage of a Bill which involves the appropriation of revenue or other public moneys, including incidental expenses, shall not be taken unless the purpose of the appropriation has been recommended to the D&aacute;il by a Message from the Government.  The text of any Message shall be printed on the Order Paper. </blockquote> <p>As the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2016 will involve a charge on the Exchequer and no message, as mentioned, has been printed on the Order Paper this morning or prior to today, it is not possible to proceed with the Committee Stage of the Bill at this time.</p><p>The select committee was unanimous in its intent to address the Bill today but, unfortunately, I must indicate to my colleague members that we are not in a position to proceed to address this Bill because of the fact that the money message, as it is referred to, is not on the Order Paper in advance of our sitting this morning.  Would members like to comment before we bring this matter to a close and proceed to the next item, the Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Justice and Equality?</p><p>I will afford an opportunity to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, the mover of the legislation, to make a brief comment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2016113000002#B00200"><p>As the Chairman said, I am the mover of the legislation.  It is important to put it in context, as well as the decisions made previously by the Oireachtas.</p><p>The legislation was passed on Second Stage on 26 October.  On that day D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann made a decision, pursuant to Standing Orders 84A(3)(<i>a</i>) and 141, to refer it to the Select Committee on Justice and Equality.  During the course of the debate on Second Stage the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport spoke on behalf of the Government.  They said they would not oppose the Bill which, in many respects, they welcomed.  They stated it was their intention to bring forward Government legislation shortly.  At no stage during the course of that debate did either of them suggest the Government would seek to obstruct the Bill by preventing it from receiving a full hearing at the Select Committee on Justice and Equality.  On 19 November the committee decided that the legislation did not require to be subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny and it was agreed that Committee Stage would be taken today, 30 November.  At no stage has a complaint been made about the orders made by the committee made on 9 November.</p><p>It is important to bring into focus the background to this dispute and the efforts made by the Government to subvert this legislation and ensure it will not be brought before this Oireachtas committee for consideration.  I was contacted by the Government on the evening of Tuesday, 22 November and asked whether I would withdraw the Bill which was to be considered by the select committee today.  The reason I was given was that the Government was under pressure to get the Courts Bill through the Oireachtas, especially the part dealing with the reappointment of the costs accountant.  I was asked by the Government, on the basis of the urgency of the Courts Bill, to agree to allow an adjournment until 14 December in order that the Courts Bill could be dealt with today.  I refused that request.  It is instructive to note that, in fact, the Courts Bill is to be taken by the committee tomorrow.</p><p>On Wednesday, 23 November I was again contacted by the Government amd asked whether I would withdraw my Bill in order that it could be subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny.  Again, I refused, politely.  During the same call I was asked whether I would agree to withdraw the Bill and then work with the Government on its Bill.  At that stage I mentioned that there was a particular urgency because the Government had indicated that it was not going to appoint judges because of the insistence of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport that it not do so until a new statutory regime was in place.  At no stage during my discussions with the Government last week did anyone mention that it was going to raise an objection to this legislation because it involved what is referred to as a charge on public expenditure.</p><p>I am now aware, from speaking to members of the select committee, that it is being suggested sections 10 and 11 of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill involve a potential charge on the Exchequer.  I have my own views on that matter and do not necessarily agree with the suggestion made.  Section 10 states:</p><blockquote>(1) The Minister may make available to the Commission such services, including staff, as the Minister may determine from time to time with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.<br /><br />(2) The Minister may second or assign to the Commission such of his or her officers as he or she may determine, with the consent of the Commission and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to be members of the staff of the Commission.</blockquote> <p>Section 11 states: &quot;The expenses incurred by the Commission in the administration of this Act shall be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&quot;.  Even if it involves expenditure, every real politician in this room and the country knows that it would be minor.  What has happened, however, is that because it involves some minor technical details of expenditure, the committee requires a message from the Government in accordance with Article 17.2 of the Constitution.  The Government has made a decision not to grant that money message, as it is referred to in the Oireachtas.  The sole purpose or reason the Government is invoking this constitutional provision is not that it has any concern about the expenditure of public moneys - it is aware that the public moneys expended would be minimal - but to solve a political problem for it.</p><p>Although I am the person who is sponsoring the Bill, it will have consequences for all Members of the Oireachtas in the future.  There are many Second Stage debates in the Oireachtas and many Bills are then referred to a select committee.  There is no doubt that we could find in every tranche of legislation examples of where some minor expenditure could be incurred.  In this case it appears as if the Government does not want the legislation to be placed before a select committee and that it will simply use its veto and seek to invoke, inappropriately, Article 17.2 for the purpose of trying to get itself out of a bind.  That places this committee in a difficult position.  I know that all members prepared for this hearing and that they have considered the Bill carefully and tabled amendments.  I would have thought that as an act of courtesy to you, Chairman, and the committee, if Government knew it was going to invoke this measure, it would have been communicated to the committee earlier than yesterday.  I was notified yesterday of its intention to do so.  I believe that even the Chairman was not notified of it yesterday.  I understand he was only notified this morning.  It showed extreme disrespect to the committee and the Legislature by the Executive branch of the Oireachtas.  It is important that this dissatisfaction be epressed.  It needs to be described for what it is - a stroke by the Government.  It is trying to stop the Oireachtas from doing its job and introducing legislation.</p></speech>

It is critical that it be advanced.  I am shocked.  I could not believe it when I heard this morning what had happened.  It is an outrageous bureaucratic manoeuvre.  That is all it is and the only thing we can call it.  It strikes a blow at the autonomy and functioning of the select committee in a way that flies in the face of the so-called new politics.  I just cannot believe it.</p> <p>  The committee discussed whether we needed to subject the Bill to pre-legislative scrutiny.  Based on our input, we decided that we would not do so, that we wanted to move ahead.  This is an incredibly well functioning committee.  When dealing with other Bills we decided that pre-legislative scrutiny was necessary.  We have been through that process in dealing with another Bill.</p> <p>  I want to make two points.  There is no point in accepting any Opposition Bill on Second Stage if the Government is going to behave in this manner as it makes an absolute mockery of the process.  I do not understand what a money message is.  I gather it is a message placed on the Order Paper, giving permission to proceed.  If this is not a bureaucratic manoeuvre, could the Government not simply do it now and proceed with the Bill next week?  I do not fully understand the mechanics involved.  However, I understand that if the Bill is not allowed to continue and we do not overturn this attempt, there will be no point in any Opposition Bill moving beyond Second Stage.  This has serious ramifications for what we call new politics - it is nothing of the sort.</p></speech>

That is singularly important.  It is vital that appointments be based on merit in the appointment and ranking of the different members.</p> <p>  I read again the speech of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality on Second Stage and at no stage did she mention anything about invoking Article 17.2 of the Constitution.  The Government allowed the Bill to pass and the Minister mentioned how it was a useful framework.  She also mentioned how the Department of Justice and Equality had engaged with stakeholders and that the Bill was progressive and provided an interesting basis on which to engage in consideration of reform.</p><p>The Minister said there is common ground on Bills and that she would not oppose it but she hopes to come up with her own Bill.  It was disingenuous to allow this Bill go through Second Stage and to present, as Deputy Daly has mentioned, a bureaucratic stroke to the committee at such a late stage, without respecting the Chairman.  The Minister is the Deputy Leader of this State.  We hear repeatedly about the programme for partnership Government which states:</p><blockquote>The new political landscape in Ireland presents a historic opportunity to radically reform Irish politics &ndash; to fundamentally change the relationship between Government and the Oireachtas, and with it the relationship between the Irish people and their parliament.</blockquote><p>It is said to be a partnership between Government and Parliament.  It is when it suits the Government.  The Government says it wants to be part of this change, not only to shape it but also to help drive it.<br/><br/>We have seen how this Bill has progressed through the Houses.  We are here at this select committee, prepared for the amendments and to progress this, but as Deputy O'Callaghan has said, the Minister is addressing internal governmental issues and we have a de facto Minister for justice who is not here, Deputy Ross.  The Minister has allowed another member of the Cabinet ride roughshod over the Executive, the Government, and undermine this Parliament.  That is wrong.  If the Minister wanted to achieve what is in A Programme for a Partnership Government, a partnership between the Government and the D&aacute;il, she would have respected that process and mentioned that there were issues around Article 17.2 when she made her presentation to the House.  To allow it to progress, to allow Deputies put forward amendments in a constructive fashion over weeks and to pull it at the last moment is wrong and undermines the rhetoric the Government uses repeatedly in our Parliament.<br/><br/>I am really angry about how this has been stroked to suit one Minister who has forgotten about his own portfolio.  The Minister for Justice and Equality needs to exercise her own authority as Minister and T&aacute;naiste.  She could have facilitated this, with constructive amendments from the Department, by allowing this Bill to go through Committee Stage.  Instead, it has been blocked, undermined and pulled at the last minute.  It is a waste of the time of Members who have put significant work into drafting and amending this and it undermines everything the Minister and the Government has said about new politics.  This is a dark day for what this partnership Government was intended to be.</p></speech>

To listen to the righteous indignation of some Deputies, one would swear we are never going to consider this legislation again.  Am I not right in understanding that at some point soon we can carry out pre-legislative scrutiny of Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill and maybe of a Government Bill too?  Surely it is important to get the work of the committee right rather than rush along according to a timetable orchestrated in a way I cannot fathom but that does not seem to have anything to do with getting the work right.  The Bill is so deeply flawed in so many ways that pre-legislative scrutiny was probably essential.  It was regrettable that it did not happen.  I understand why it was decided not to have it but the grounds for that no longer apply.  If there is an opportunity to get the process right it is better to do that.  The delay is not inordinate.  It would be better to concentrate on our role than to focus on what Minister is doing what.  If Deputies have prepared amendments, the work is done and the benefit will come to the committee when it gets an opportunity.</p> <p>  There has been tremendous cross-party co-operation and continuing that kind of co-operation would be much more effective than going down a route that might make the committee work less effectively or coherently.  Deputy Daly recently agreed to pre-legislative scrutiny of a Bill.  I look forward to this Bill coming back for pre-legislative scrutiny and Committee Stage.</p></speech>

It is very unfair to say that Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s work has fallen well short because any Bill that any of us puts forward will require tinkering of some kind.  He has put a lot of work into the Bill.</p> <p>  This smacks of very dishonest work.  It really calls into question how things are done.  The notion that the process is being thrown out the window to keep Deputy Ross on board a fragile Government is a load of rubbish. </p></speech>

The Chairman has been here much longer than me and can perhaps confirm this.  I respect Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan, his profession, qualifications and experience.  However, without the benefit of the available resources of the Department of Justice and Equality, I think even he will admit that there might be issues in his Bill that need to be worked out.  Therefore, it is only appropriate that the time be given for a thorough examination of it and that it come back to this committee and the D&aacute;il in the appropriate way.  The Deputy does not have a monopoly on views on the subject of the Bill.  The programme for Government sets out a similar aspiration.  I see no reason both Bills cannot be debated, if not together then in close proximity to one another to make sure that Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s views and those of his party and others are taken into consideration.  None of us can do anything in isolation in the present D&aacute;il.  We have to work together and that includes this process.</p></speech>

He admitted that on Second Stage.  It is not a case that there might be issues, there are issues, as recognised by the person who moved the Bill.  That is the very reason for a legislative process, with Committee and Report Stages, when amendments are put forward to rectify problems.</p><p>If there are issues with legislation in the eyes of the Government, it is the responsibility of the Government to propose amendments on Committee and Report Stages.  That is why Bills do not stop on Second Stage.  It seems that if they did, many more Opposition Bills would be passed.  At the moment, they go into a black hole after Second Stage.</p><p> I understood we were changing the way we do politics in the Thirty-second D&aacute;il.  That is clearly not the case.  It is very disappointing and downright insulting to the committee that a decision which was supported by all members of the committee, including Fine Gael members, is not being upheld now.  The Fine Gael members in question are rocking up in here today to say we should have pre-legislative scrutiny, but no such case was made when we decided to take Committee Stage today.  It is cowardly to support legislation on Second Stage only to block it when the time comes for amendments to it to be debated on Committee Stage.  The whole point of the amendments is to improve the legislation and perfect it as much as possible.  It needs to be improved, as Deputy O'Callaghan has recognised.</p><p> It would be preferable if the Minister and her Government colleagues were to vote down legislation on Second Stage, rather than pretending to support it only to show on Committee Stage that they are not really supporting it.  Such an approach to legislation is not good for politics, in my opinion.  I remind Deputy Brophy, who has described the Bill as "deeply flawed", that the Minister does not share his view.  If the Deputy's view is that there are so many issues with the Bill, he should have voted against it on Second Stage.  It is very irresponsible to allow a "deeply flawed" Bill to pass Second Stage and move on to Committee Stage.</p></speech>

The points I have to make might assist the committee in its consideration of this matter.  I remind Deputies O'Callaghan and Jack Chambers, in particular, that new politics works both ways.  As Deputy O'Callaghan mentioned on Second Stage, the confidence and supply arrangement provides for a ten-week period for bringing forward a Government view on legislation before it is considered on Committee Stage.  The Bill we are discussing was introduced less than five weeks ago.  Deputy O'Callaghan told the D&aacute;il on that occasion that this "brings us to the beginning of January 2017 and I want my legislation before the committee at the beginning of January".  What has happened in the meantime?  I accept that when he brought the matter before the committee, it decided not to have pre-legislative scrutiny.  I would like to make some points about that decision.</p> <p>  New politics envisages that legislative proposals will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny.  When I publish my Bill next Tuesday, I will ask the Chairman of this committee to provide for it to be the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny.  When Deputy O'Callaghan brought his Bill to this committee, he also booked time in the D&aacute;il next week for Report Stage.  His party agreed to allocate Private Members' time for this Bill in advance of this committee having any discussion on it, in advance of any amendments and in advance of any timetable coming from the committee.  I do not know how Deputy O'Callaghan decided that the Bill would be considered on Report Stage next week, but I have to say it does not smack of new politics to me.</p> <p>  I accept the point that there is a range of policy issues arising in this context.  I respect the work that Deputy O'Callaghan has done on this Bill and the contribution he has made to the discussion in this area.  I think he will share my view that since the foundation of the State, the Judiciary has served this State very well.  Regardless of the system that is used for the appointment of judges, my personal belief is that there has never been any fear that judges will not behave impartially after they are appointed.  I have made this view very clear all along.  I have spoken of my respect for the Judiciary.  I have emphasised how well this country has been served by its Judiciary.  Times move on, however.  Views have changed regarding the best method of appointing the Judiciary.  That is what is under consideration in the Bill that Deputy O'Callaghan has proposed and the legislation I have been working on.</p> <p>  I believe there is common cause between the Bill I will be introducing and the Bill that has been published by Deputy O'Callaghan.  There is agreement on the need for a new system of appointing judges.  I do not believe that reflects in any way on those who have previously been appointed.  Instead, it takes account of the best modern approach to recruiting the most suitable people.  While I recognise that there are special requirements in any judicial appointment, that does not mean lessons cannot be learned from changes in selection processes generally.  I believe those lessons should be applied to this arena now.  After 20 years, it is time for change.  We have seen a sea change in selection processes in other areas.  The challenge we face is to decide how best to go about making improvements in this area.</p> <p>  The reality is that although we have a common objective, there are proposals in Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill that run directly contrary to the contents of the programme for Government.  Of course he has a right to make such proposals.  Members of the D&aacute;il have an important role in making proposals.  Of course some of them will be contrary to Government policy.  I note that Deputy Clare Daly has tabled a number of amendments that directly contradict what is in the Bill at it stands.</p></speech>

I mention the Deputy's amendments to make the point that there are real issues of difference here.  The Government members of the committee have such issues as well.  We are bringing forward our own Bill.  We have given priority to the drafting of that Bill in accordance with our own legislative proposals.  I have already said, those Government proposals will be subject to pre-legislative scrutiny immediately.  I believe the side-by-side consideration of both Bills as part of the legislative process would be in the best interests of the production of the most effective set of legislative proposals.  I think the examination of both Bills in this way, with both of them being subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, would be an example of new politics.  It would certainly be preferable to a rush to legislating for this important constitutional area.</p> <p>  I have a series of concerns about certain points in Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.  I believe there is a constitutional issue in it.  Other issues that arise from it also need further development and change.  I accept that this is what happens on Committee and Report Stages.  I will not pretend that there are not substantial differences between my approach and that advocated by Deputy O'Callaghan.  I refer, for example, to his proposal for an independent chair and his approach to the composition of the new board.  In light of the complex choices that are before us, I strongly submit that working co-operatively on pre-legislative scrutiny of both Bills would be in the interests of the production of the best legislation possible.  I have already suggested that to Deputy O'Callaghan.  I am happy to work closely with him in a co-operative way.  I can arrange for officials in the Department to meet him to go through the details of our approach and to explain how it differs from his approach.</p> <p>  I believe our Judiciary is of the most profound importance to the State.  I am sure all members of the committee will agree we should follow the best procedures for ensuring the best people are selected.  That is of profound importance.  That is why I believe everything possible should be done to ensure we examine this legislation in a detailed way, as opposed to rushing to Report Stage next week as Deputy O'Callaghan had envisaged.  The timeframe that was available would have left me unable to make the kind of detailed amendments I would want to make.  I would certainly have been able to make them by January if we had gone down that route.  Equally, the Government decided yesterday to appoint judges where there are vacancies and that will happen next week.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Callaghan's motivation in proposing this legislation, as I understand it, was his concern about delays in judicial appointments.  That issue has been addressed.  I suggest we need to take the time to examine this legislation and engage in pre-legislative scrutiny, rather than following the accelerated process proposed by Deputy O'Callaghan.</p><p>Those are the main points that I would make.  I hope it has cast a light on the approach that I would like to see for this legislation, which I think would be the most productive way forward.</p></speech>

That is a parliamentary matter.  The Bills Office decides on that in contact with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, which then contacts the Taoiseach.  That is the how that process works.  There is a period of up to ten weeks ahead for private Members' Bills in which a message could be put on the Order Paper.</p></speech>

The T&aacute;naiste referred to pre-legislative scrutiny.  I am happy to do that if we know at the end of the process that the Government is not going to pull the same stroke again.  There is no point in a private Members' Bill going through pre-legislative scrutiny if, when it is about to go to select committee, it fails to get the money message from the Government.  If the T&aacute;naiste can give an assurance that this stroke will not be repeated in January or whenever, then I will go down that route of pre-legislative scrutiny.  I ask for that assurance now.</p></speech>

What I saying is that if Deputy O'Callaghan agrees to have pre-legislative scrutiny of both Bills, then the progress of both Bills can be assessed at the time and we can decide as the Bills go under pre-legislative scrutiny what the best way forward is.  That will be a matter for discussion within the committee and perhaps between Deputy O'Callaghan and myself.</p></speech>

This matter will be addressed by the committee in determining how we proceed.  The T&aacute;naiste has indicated that we are going to have a further Bill referred to us in the coming week.  We will have to decide in joint session as to how we will address both of these matters.  I appeal that we do so in a calm and serious way.  With respect to the T&aacute;naiste, I am not in any way referencing what she has said here today.  This committee prides itself on being a parliamentary committee.  We are not a committee of Government and we are certainly not a committee of the Department of Justice and Equality.  We are a committee of parliamentarians and we cherish that independence and our representative make-up.  That is very important.</p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste made a point about a two-way street.  There is a two-way street here.  I remind the T&aacute;naiste and her officials that when the Department of Justice and Equality has been anxious for this committee to address Bills of its own authorship, the committee has been very facilitative, not only prior to the summer recess but, also tomorrow morning, when we convene at 9.00 a.m. in the D&aacute;il Chamber in order to accommodate the T&aacute;naiste's request to address the Courts Bill.  We understand and appreciate the importance of it and the consequences of its not being addressed on Committee Stage or its being delayed.  This committee has been very co-operative and that is the spirit that will maintain.  However, to reference the T&aacute;naiste's own remarks, it is a two-way street.</p> <p>  That is the closing comment on this matter.</p></speech>

I would also like to thank the Minister and her Department for the briefing material that has been circulated to the members of the committee.  I remind members that in accordance with Standing Order 184, discussion should be confined to the items constituting the Supplementary Estimates.  I must insist on this.  In order to commence our address of these matters, I invite the Minister to make her opening contribution.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.505" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2016113000002#E03100"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for making time available today to consider the Supplementary Estimates for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Courts Service Votes.  The Supplementary Estimate requirement in respect of the Garda Vote is &euro;10 million and an additional &euro;2 million is required for the Courts Vote in 2016.  The additional requirements will be offset by surrender balances at year end in respect of the other votes in the justice group: prisons, the Property Registration Authority, justice and equality, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, the Valuation Office and the Policing Authority.</p> <p>  The additional funding for the Garda Vote in the current year is the final part of the funding package announced by Government earlier this year.  It is largely due to the sustained response to tackle gangland crime, fund the continuation of Operation Thor, with which the committee will be very familiar, and to ensure that measures to prevent international terrorism are continued throughout the year.  This funding is in addition to the &euro;40 million already provided in the Revised Estimates for 2016.  That was provided in October.</p> <p>  The Government has consistently made clear that we would fund whatever measures were needed for An Garda Sioch&aacute;na to best tackle the challenges it currently faces.  We have backed up these assurances with the approval of substantial additional funding to support large-scale policing operations, which members of the committee and the Chairman will have seen in Dublin and around the country.</p><p>The additional funding will ensure that garda&iacute; may continue to confront and dismantle criminal networks.  The funding will be utilised across a number of subheads, including: overtime expenditure, which is expected to be over &euro;90 million in the current year; travel and subsistence; and the purchase of additional operational equipment for specialist units, etc.</p><p> There is no question but that this investment is yielding results.  For example, Deputies would be interested to know Operation Hybrid has been established to co-ordinate the response to violent crime in Dublin and to address concerns about public and community safety.  As of October, 38 arrests have been made and five charges have been brought in connection with recent shootings.  In addition, 23 firearms have been seized and over 9,000 lines of inquiry conducted.  In excess of 14,350 high-visibility checkpoints have been implemented with significant support from the armed support units and a major amount of CCTV footage, mobile phone traffic and forensic evidence is also being examined.  The committee can see how the funding I outlined is being put to very good use in terms of Garda operations.</p><p> The goal of this budget allocation is focused on the key objectives of strengthening the law to get tougher on serious and repeat offenders and investing in the capacity of the Garda to enforce the law effectively.  I will not go into too much detail.  Operation Thor is a multi-strand national anti-crime and anti-burglary operation.  It is a significant stepping up of the response to burglaries and we know patterns of crime change.  There was a pattern around the country regarding burglaries.  This operation has provided a very swift return on the Government's  investment made in Garda resources and that is reflected in the figures recorded by the Central Statistics Office, which indicate a reduction of 26.3% in the level of burglary crimes.  In the first six months of this year, there were 36% fewer burglaries than in the first six months of 2015, underlining the impact of Operation Thor since it was established at the end of last  year.  Everybody would welcome that success.</p><p> There has been concentrated activity throughout the country as a result of Operation Thor.  I have already spoken about Operation Hybrid and Operation Thor has brought about more than 30,000 crime prevention patrols, with 38,500 targeted checkpoints nationwide.  There  have also been approximately 2,500 arrests and 2,900 charges, covering a range of offences which, in addition to burglary, have included handling stolen property, possession of firearms and drugs offences.</p><p> A number of technical adjustments are also included in the Supplementary Estimate, including the reallocation of a capital expenditure underspend of approximately &euro;20 million in the building programme to other areas.  One often gets that underspend with very large capital projects as it can be quite difficult to predict precisely the pace at which they develop and the spending of money.  We have reallocated that to capital expenditure in important areas like information and communications technology, ICT.  There is a major ongoing ICT programme and we have reallocated some of the money there, as well as to transport, including for the purchase of 191 extra cars for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be delivered by the end of the year.  There is also &euro;9 million in respect of unspent buildings capital that will be carried over to 2017 to meet costs relating to the completion of the divisional headquarters at Kevin Street in Dublin, Wexford and  Galway, all of which are under way.  This will ensure the effective use of the capital allocation on a multi-year basis.</p><p> Even allowing for the capital carryover adjustments, it is projected  that over &euro;90 million will be spent on Garda capital in 2016.  Under the transport heading, in 2016 alone, 520 new vehicles have come on stream to ensure that garda&iacute; are mobile, visible and responsive on the roads and in the community to prevent and tackle crime.  As I stated, before the end of the year another 191 vehicles will be bought at a cost of &euro;4 million.  This area has been neglected because there was no capital investment and stock had run down very considerably, as all Deputies realise.  That is now being replenished.  There will still be &euro;4 million under the capital plan for new vehicles next year.  A constant programme of replacement is needed for those vehicles.</p><p> It is expected that &euro;53 million will be expended in Garda ICT capital in 2016.  There will be significant expenditure on new systems.  There will be new rosters and a duty management system to facilitate better management of resources, with a cost of &euro;1.5 million.  There will be investigations management systems to ensure enhanced management of crime investigations.  This will ensure that PULSE does not just record incidents but that it also follows through on investigations.  The cost attaching is &euro;5.7 million.  There will be technology to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, at &euro;1.6 million, and Microsoft upgrades, at &euro;5.2 million.  I am very pleased we have been able to start the work on the Schengen information system II this year as we are one of the few countries in Europe that does not have interoperability with other countries on that system.  This allows the Garda to work with international colleagues to develop the Irish Schengen information system II.</p><p> Aside from capital, there are a number of other overruns and savings in various subheads, including surplus receipts mainly relating to pension-related deductions, which are being rebalanced as part of the Supplementary Estimate process.  I am particularly pleased that an additional amount of almost &euro;3 million is being provided in subhead A2, maintenance of Garda premises, which provides funding for improvement and maintenance works to the Garda estate to support the effective discharge of the force's functions.  This where garda&iacute; can do this work in local Garda stations and although they are essential, they are smaller items of work.  That is in contrast to larger-scale refurbishment with which, for example, the Office of Public Works and the Garda would be involved.  As well as the relatively routine maintenance expenditure, significant improvements have been carried out at a wide number of locations throughout the country.  These smaller non-capital projects are addressing security and health and safety matters in  particular.  In addition, a large number of Garda stations have received minor but necessary upgrade works to provide enhanced facilities for both members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the public.  There is a large-scale refurbishment programme that must go on, given the state of many of the Garda stations around the country.  We must continue to invest in that area.</p><p> The Government recently agreed a five-year reform and high-level work force plan for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This is ambitious and has not previously been attempted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is a new departure that marries reform with resources.  The resources in terms of personnel are backed up by the substantial capital investment already earmarked, as I outlined, for critical ICT systems, the transport fleet and Garda stations under the capital plan for 2016 to 2021.  It is in the programme for Government and the supply-and-confidence agreement that we will increase the overall size of the Garda organisation to 21,000 by 2021.  This will be made up of 15,000 garda&iacute; but also a doubling of the number of civilians and the Garda Reserve.  The recruitment for the Garda Reserve will start mid-year.  This high-visibility policing will fulfil a key commitment in the programme for Government and is a direct response to what the public have told us they want to see happening.  The funding secured for 2017 ensures we can make a strong start in realising this vision for the overall work force; 800 Garda trainees, up to 500 additional civilians and 300 new members of the reserve are to be recruited next year.  These are ambitious targets but we will certainly focus on delivering them so we can reach the overall target in five years.</p><p> The net additional Supplementary Estimate requirement of &euro;2 million in the courts Vote is made up of a gross expenditure of &euro;3.5 million offset by a surplus in receipts of &euro;1.5 million.  The additional requirement is mainly accounted for by ICT capital expenditure to meet video link investment costs of &euro;1 million and other essential ICT infrastructure, including network upgrades and replacement of various parts.  Those costs are &euro;1.5 million as well.  The additional requirement also includes certain costs associated with works required for the second Special Criminal Court, reflect in the annual public private partnership payment in respect of the Criminal Courts of Justice.  The additional receipts, which offset, in part, the cost of the Supplementary Estimates, mainly comprise income collected in the court examiner's office due to residual liquidation cases being dealt with by the office.</p><p>The final element of income from this source will materialise during 2017.  The introduction of the Companies Act 2014 has ceased the requirement for fees to be paid on company liquidation cases dealt with by the examiner's office.  The underspends in the other Votes across the justice sector, which are offsetting the cost of the Supplementary Estimates, mainly arise in payroll savings due to a longer lead-in time than expected for recruitment in some areas.  Such savings will reverse in 2017 as recruitment plans are in place.  There are other savings in a number of administrative and programme areas, including in the immigration area.</p><p> I recommend the Supplementary Estimates for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Courts Service Vote to the committee.  I am happy to address any questions the members may have on them.</p></speech>

I have a few questions on it.  We have had positive results from Operation Thor and there has been a welcome shift in the figures.  The Minister outlined that 520 new vehicles will be purchased in 2017.  Does she have an indication of the number of vehicles that will be installed with automatic number plate recognition, ANPR, technology?  How many vehicles have had that technology installed to date?  It is an important technology for crime surveillance and road traffic issues.  Many garda&iacute; would mention it to me as being a priority technology.  Given that new vehicles are being purchased, it is important that they would have this technology installed.  There were previous announcements about an investment in ANPR technology.</p> <p>  Regarding recruitment towards meeting the targeted figure of 15,000 garda&iacute; provided for in the confidence and supply arrangement, it is projected that there will be massive increase in Garda retirements.  In the three-year period from 2018 to 2020 there will be a significant number of retirements.  Has the Minister planned as part of the Garda recruitment process to offset the number of retirements to ensure there is not a large reduction in Garda numbers? There have been fewer retirements this year, and the same will be the case next year because of the recruitment embargo in the 1980s.  Are there budgetary plans and projections for Garda recruitment?</p> <p>  I have a concern about the underspend of the allocation for prisons.  It is important that the Minister and the Department focuses on some new programmes around penal reform and on what can be achieved in the prison system.  If money from the allocation to prisons is being returned to the State, I would prefer to see it allocated within the system towards new programmes or reforms.</p> <p>  The elephant in the room with respect to these Supplementary Estimates is the funding of the Labour Court agreement if it is approved.  There are some welcome improvements in Garda pay and conditions.  What is the Minister's plan to fund those?  What discussions are taking place at Government level towards funding that agreement, which will probably occur and which many garda&iacute;, particularly younger garda&iacute;, deserve?</p></speech>

The ICT funding we allocated would cover that technology if the Garda decided to install it in vehicles.  The goal would be to have a fairly comprehensive usage of ANPR technology because it is incredibly helpful in crime detection.  I am informed there are some vehicles with that technology installed in every division.  Clearly, the operational decision that has been taken is to make sure that throughout the country some vehicles have this technology installed.  The goal would be to move to a fairly comprehensive management of ANPR technology with new vehicles.  I will see if I can the get a more detailed breakdown on the approach to this and I will forward it to the Deputy.  Essentially, it is an operational decision.  From a policy point of view, I would fully support it.  The funding it would provide would be intended to cover the increasing use of ANPR technology in vehicles.</p> <p>  On the issue of Garda retirements, that has been built in, following discussions with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to ensure we reach the target figure of 15,000.  It has been agreed that to reach that figure, taking account of retirements which will average approximately 300 per year, we would need to recruit 800 garda&iacute;, but that can be subject to review as we note the level of retirements.  The agreement we have come to on the number of garda&iacute; that will go into Templemore is based on an assessment of the retirements not only over a year but over the five-year period.  Plans have been made on that basis.  The retirements will average 300 per year but it is difficult to predict the number precisely.  We have had detailed discussions on the numbers we would need to recruit, taking account of retirements over the entire period, to reach the target figure of 15,000.</p> <p>  I will deal with the Deputy's last question and then return to the prisons issue.  I am awaiting the outcome of the ballot and I have full respect for that.  What I have said about it, and what I hope will happen, is that every garda in the country who has a vote in that ballot will have all the information on the offer on the table.  I understand that is what both Garda associations are ensuring.  If there is an agreement and if it is passed, there will be budgetary implications.  I welcome the recommendations from the Labour Court which seeks to address the concerns articulated by the representative bodies about Garda pay and conditions, including those of new recruits.  There is also access to the new dispute resolution mechanisms.  That is part of the agreement.  Once the outcome of the ballot is known, and if the proposals are accepted, and I hope they will be, the additional budgetary cost will be the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In that regard, officials of both Departments can have initial discussions but until we have the outcome of the ballot, we will not be going any further on that.  The most important thing at this point is to give the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, AGSI, and the Garda Representative Association, GRA, the time and the space to discuss the issues that are before them.</p> <p>  On the prisons issue, I understand the savings in this area are due to the fact that there has been a slowness in recruitment.  I am told that in quarter 2 of 2016 the Public Appointments Service carried out a job analysis of the recruit prison officer role and designed a revised competency framework for use in the selection process.  The previous one to that was done in 1998.  We made a decision to recruit more officers in 2016 and it coincided with significant changes in the service.  It was considered appropriate that the job analysis should be revisited.  The principal aims were to identify whether the job had changed and also to consider the evolving nature of the role.  The size of the prison population has shrunk since 2008 and an increasing emphasis is being put on the rehabilitation of prisoners.  Technology continues to change the balance of prison officers' duties and a higher proportion of their time is spent in contact roles while information technology is increasingly used for monitoring and management of the prison population.  This large item of work was done and it has meant that there has been an underspend because that delayed the recruitment, but it is intended that the first classes of the new recruit prison officers will begin their training at the end of quarter 1 in 2017.  The Irish Prison Service, IPS, is also recruiting prison administration and support officers who are due to commence service in January 2017.  The fact that the funding is in the base is important.</p></speech>

The issue Deputy Chambers refers to will arise obviously next year, but I am discussing the Revised Estimate for 2016.

I will not ask any further questions on that.  I expected that but just wanted to check.  I am always critical of underspending by Departments and I do not think I should be any less critical of the Department of Justice and Equality.  Normally, I reserve it for the Department of Education and Skills, which is overspending this year.  My query relates to the capital building programme.  The Minister referred to &euro;29 million due to delays in certain projects and, of course, that happens.  How imminent is the draw down of that &euro;29 million in those particular projects?  Are we talking about months or years?  The Minister can be specific if she wishes.  I do not mind.</p> <p>  I refer to &euro;8.7 million in respect of aircraft.  The Garda operates two EC135s and a Defender.  I stand to be corrected, but I understand the two helicopters were acquired in 1997, or at least one of them was.  Is there an operational ceiling on that or is there a major programme to keep the aircraft airworthy?  I assume the considerable increase in budgetary spend of 52% might, in fact, relate to that.  If its operational life is coming to an end, is there a plan in terms of the budget to acquire another EC135 or similar aircraft?  Is the Defender aircraft a Garda aircraft or does it belong to the Air Corps?  Does it have a duality of use?  Will it appear in the Defence Estimates or as part of the maintenance budget?</p> <p>  My question on clothing and maintenance has been covered somewhat by my colleague, Deputy Jack Chambers.  There is an additional &euro;1.7 million for uniforms for student garda&iacute; and the armed response unit in Dublin.  Can the Minister provide a breakdown of the type of equipment associated with the uniform of the armed response unit?  Are we talking about body armour?  Is that included in the term "uniform" or are we literally talking about fabric here?  Perhaps, the Minister can be a little bit more specific for me.</p> <p>  As a member of the committee, I note that the figures provided by the Department from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and which were assessed by the CSO recently were nothing short of remarkable on a 12-month basis in regard to my own constituency and Garda division.  In my division, which includes the constituency of Deputy Jack Chambers, there was a 40% reduction in burglary, which is extraordinary.  These are CSO figures and, as such, are not coming out of the Department.  I add the caution that we know there is a reduction in the reporting of crime, which is always a concern, but from my perspective and perhaps from that of the Minister, we can only allocate resources where we know about the issues involved.  As my local Garda inspector has been saying during my 12 years in public life, constituents should always be encouraged to call An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na even if a matter is minor because otherwise they will not know.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.518" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2016113000002#H00600"><p>The answer to the Deputy's question is that these are not projects which will slip back months and years.  For example, the project at Kevin Street is being built a cost of &euro;33.539 million.  While there have been various problems with it, the projected completion date is now the second quarter of 2017.  It is estimated that the project might slip by six or seven weeks, but it will be completed in 2017.  In Galway, the project cost is &euro;31.181 million and there have been some weather-related delays there.  There was some underestimation of the complexities of the concrete elements of the structure by the contractor and there was a staffing issue for a vital subcontractor.  Those are the reasons for some of the delay.  However, the projected completion date, which was September 2017, is now the fourth quarter of 2017.  The projects are going ahead and there are very practical reasons for any underspend, as I have outlined.  The projects will be completed in 2017.</p> <p>  Deputy Farrell is right to say the position regarding aircraft needs to be reviewed.  My understanding is that a new aircraft will be needed by about 2020.  That is one of the matters the Department will be discussing in the context of the mid-term capital review next year.  Obviously, we want to ensure that appropriate and safe aircraft are available.  That will be up for discussion in the first instance in the review of the capital programme.</p> <p>  The budget for uniforms, including for the armed response unit, includes equipment.  That is an operational decision.  I have responded positively to any requests I have had specifically for equipment for the armed response unit.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for his comments on burglary reductions.  People will confirm that it is the situation albeit I always note that if one is the person who is burgled, it is one burglary too many.  That is why we have to be vigilant.  Clearly, targeted operations, like Operation Hybrid or Operation Thor, work.  We also saw with the targeted operation on sham marriages that the incidence of those decreased completely.  When we put Border operations in, in particular under the new North-South task force, on which the report was presented to me just two weeks ago, we saw really good success.  There was a targeted operation in the Border area on rural crime and there was good success in terms of finding machinery and bringing people before the courts in the North and the South.  While there are issues in relation to what gets reported, notwithstanding that and notwithstanding either the issues identified by the CSO on which it is still working, there has been a huge success in preventing crime, interrupting burglaries and protecting the public.</p></speech>

It relates to individual cameras for garda&iacute; on the beat.  Can the Minister outline or determine whether there is a sufficient allocation within the budget to investigate the use of cameras?</p><p>It was done previously, but does the Department wish to pursue it further with the Garda Commissioner?  Has a formal or an informal report been received from the Commissioner on the trial usage of cameras?  Would there be future budgetary implications if the trial was deemed to be a success?</p></speech>

It is fast-changing and other police forces are using it, for example, to conduct risk assessments when called to a house to deal with domestic violence.  However, a number of issues arise.  I have discussed the matter with the Garda Commissioner.  If new technology can be used, we want to support its development.  It forms part of the ICT investment and the Commissioner is examining the matter, but I will ask her for a report on it and forward it to the Deputy.</p></speech>

I do not for one moment suggest knowledge of this, but it is my understanding that Ireland has not signed up to the Schengen agreement. or did I not notice it happening while I was dozing?  Is there a relationship between the Schengen agreement and the SIS II?  Will the T&aacute;naiste elaborate on the matter in order that I might have a better understanding of what is involved in the SIS II?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-30a.527" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2016113000002#J00800"><p>To confirm, this does not involve an extra spend; it is about a reallocation but all within the justice group of Votes.  There is no extra money involved.  It is about reallocating money from areas in which there has been an underspend and moving it to areas that we have prioritised, for example, ICT and the purchase of Garda vehicles.  There was an underspend in the areas I outlined.</p> <p>  As to SIS II, there is no connection with the fact that Ireland is outside the Schengen agreement.  It is called the Schengen information system.  The second generation of the SIS is a state-of-the-art EU-wide IT system that allows for an easy and automated exchange of information between national border control authorities, customs and police authorities in different jurisdictions.  It is one of the important tools member states are using to exchange information, particularly on terrorist threats.  We use other methods also, but there is a move at EU level - I have attended many meetings and chaired a number of others in the Department of Justice and Equality - to try to ensure we will have the best possible interoperability, while respecting the need for data protection and other issues that arise.</p> <p>  As the investment in information technology had been stopped for a number of years, we are behind, but I am keen to accelerate investment.  It is a complex matter from an IT point of view, but we are working on it with a number of groups from within the Garda and specialist agencies, including at European level, to ensure we can reach the point of proper interoperability between the systems in order to deal with criminal activity and irregular border movements.  The current concern is that we exchange information in a timely way to tackle terrorism.  There needs to be greater interoperability between systems and member states in real time.  It has been a complicated discussion and it is expensive, with the total amount being very substantial.  The timeframe for implementing the necessary systems and structures to support the integration of the SIS II has been provisionally estimated at between 18 and 24 months at a cost of between &euro;18 and &euro;22 million, but this substantial investment in information technology is necessary.</p></speech>

The Bill currently says that the Road Traffic Act 1961 to 2014 and the current Bill shall be cited collectively as the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2016.  It has since been drawn to my attention, however, that there is a collective citation in the Vehicle Clamping Act 2015 according to which Part 5 of that Act and the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2014 are to be cited as the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2015.  This was missed earlier this year when the Public Transport Act 2016 cited the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2014 in section 8 of the Public Transport Act as the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2016.  This creates an issue around whether the collective citation has unintentionally dropped from within its ambit Part 5 of the Vehicle Clamping Act.  I have taken legal advice on this technicality and the proposed wording will ensure that nothing in the collective citation is lost.</p></speech>

It has been raised repeatedly as a matter that might be included in successive road traffic Bills.  In the end it has always been deferred.  When I became the Minister for Transport. Tourism and Sport the current Bill had already been passed by the Seanad and it was restored to the Order Paper for the D&aacute;il after the election.  I decided that this time around written-off vehicles should not be left as the also-ran issue of road traffic law.  I decided to introduce an amendment to the Bill to address, for the first time on a statutory basis, the question of written off vehicles in Ireland.  I shall begin by speaking on how things stand currently.  Under existing voluntary arrangements some vehicle insurers submit notification details regarding total vehicle right offs to my Department's national vehicle and driver file, NVDF.  On receiving these details, records relating to such vehicles are locked down on the NVDF so that no further transactions can be recorded against them.  This means there can be no renewal of motor tax or change of ownership for the vehicle.  The locked down status of these vehicles can be altered only if the NVDF receives confirmation from the insurance company involved in the original notification that an incorrect vehicle right-off categorisation had been relayed to the NVDF.</p><p>There has long been agreement that this approach - being as it is entirely voluntary - is not satisfactory.  The current road safety strategy includes a commitment that the Road Safety Authority, RSA, would carry out a consultation on the matter for the good of developing policy to legislate to ensure that unsafe, written-off vehicles are taken out of circulation.  The RSA completed this consultation.  While the RSA proposals have merit they are also highly complex and would take a great deal of time and cost to implement.  They would also require a great deal of additional time and consideration to work out fully.  I decided that we could not let the matter wait any longer.</p><p>I, therefore, decided to address this matter now in a way which will work and which will have practical benefits.  I am not precluding further developments in future, but I am determined that we should lay the groundwork now by taking real action on this question.</p><p> I am proposing to place the current voluntary arrangements between the insurance industry and my Department on domestic write-offs on a statutory footing.  All insurers will be statutorily required to notify my Department of category A, irreparable and fit for scrap only, and category B, useful for viable spare parts only write-offs, so that these vehicles' records can be locked down on the NDVF and their circulation within the national fleet prevented.  It is not necessary to cater for category C and D write-offs as these vehicles are capable of being repaired and returned to use on the public road.</p><p> I know many people would like to take this further as I also would.  I considered and I am still considering additional measures, for example, to do with imported vehicles.  However, this is very complex and if I had gone down this road, it would have led to the inevitable and unacceptable result that yet again a road traffic Bill would have been passed without any measures to address written-off vehicles.</p><p> Relevant legislation is already in place in both road traffic and consumer law dealing with written-off vehicles.  It is currently an offence to drive a dangerously defective vehicle in a public place under road traffic legislation while under the Consumer Protection Act 2007, car dealers are obliged to give full disclosure of the history of second-hand vehicle to potential buyers.  Under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980, a vehicle being sold should be free from any defect that would render it a danger to the public.</p><p> I know Deputy Munster wants to address her own amendment on written-off vehicles.  I am glad to see that we are both on the same page with respect to this important issue.  I believe her amendment has great merit, but it is covered by the amendments we have proposed.</p></speech>

The Minister has included pretty much all I had intended to do.  The details are on the national vehicle and driver file.  The Minister said he would not have been able to put this forward for this Bill had he dealt with the imports.  Will he continue to investigate finding a way to deal with vehicles imported and sold here when they have already been written off in another jurisdiction?</p></speech>

Shortly after I came into office I saw a "Prime Time" programme that dealt with the importation of written-off vehicles.  We do not know the extent of it but it was quite alarming.  I am determined to deal with it and I asked my officials to look at that.  It is very complex.  We are still looking at it and we are consulting the Attorney General.  We will pursue the problem.  We do not have all the data and we are not quite sure how far it goes or how extensive the problem is.  We could have something prepared in a few months, but we do not want to delay the legislation specifically for that.  I just want to go ahead with tackling the issue of written-off vehicles now with the commitment that we are pursuing this.</p> <p>  We could almost have a road traffic Bill every week because there are ongoing problems every week that we want to address.  At some stage we have to say we will go ahead, but we are certainly addressing that problem.  We are about half way there.  We have opened up the problem, but to address the imported ones will take a little longer.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, driver impairment through alcohol and drug misuse is still a large contributory factor in road traffic accidents.  The list, however, of banned substances in sections 4(1A) and 5(1A) is very limited in that it only lists the main illegal drugs, namely, cannabis, cocaine and heroin.  Based on current national and international prevalence data, the drugs to be targeted initially in this Bill are cannabis, cocaine, opiates and benzodiazepines.  However, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, study, on whose recommendations this Bill is based, is heavily reliant on a 16 year-old study, Driving Under the Influence of Drugs in Ireland, Results of a Nationwide Survey 2000-2001.  In particular, the study indicated that cannabis and benzodiazepines were the most prevalent drug in driving under the influence of drug cases, followed by opiates, methadone and cocaine.</p><p>While it might be the case that these drugs remain the most widely used in Ireland, it is also the case that over the past 16 years, drug use in Ireland, as elsewhere, has evolved significantly.  In particular, the use of psychoactive drugs has become more prevalent in that period.  According to the EU drug markets report 2016, Irish people are the largest users of illegal psychoactive drugs in the EU.  According to the survey of people aged 15 to 24 on the highest levels of use in the past year, Ireland was at 9%, Spain and France were at 8% and Slovenia was at 7%.</p><p>Eight psychoactive substances are not included in the Schedule of banned substances in this Bill.  Another limitation of the Bill is that it ignores the possible misuse of legal prescription drugs which can be worse than alcohol for impaired driving.  In particular, the misuse of prescription benzodiazepines, such as Valium and Xanax, has increased significantly over the past 15 years with numbers of people seeking treatment for addiction to benzodiazepines has more than doubled since 2009, according to the Health Service Executive.  While benzodiazepines are often prescribed as sedatives for use in the treatment of anxiety disorders and insomnia, they have become increasingly common as recreational drugs.  Recent statistics show that benzodiazepines were the main problem drug of 547 people who sought treatment for substance abuse in 2012.</p><p>While it is recognised that the Bill cannot take a zero-tolerance approach to individuals driving after having consumed such prescription drugs, any provision which caught drivers abusing these drugs would strengthen the Bill significantly.  At the very least, there is a need for a parallel health education initiative to go with this Bill, especially to inform drivers of the dangers of driving while taking prescribed medications.  Last year in the transport committee, Professor Denis Cusack of the MBRS called for as much.  A parallel health education initiative is needed to encourage and support drivers with medical conditions to take their prescribed medications in accordance with health care advices and medical fitness to drive guidelines.</p></speech>

The approach the Department has taken with regard to the list of specified drugs is one that has been discussed in great detail with the MBRS.  This Bill, in addressing drug driving, is not based on the MBRS report referred to by the Deputy but on more recent experience of the bureau on testing specimens for drugs and best international practice.  I have also consulted with the bureau in light of the proposed amendments to expand the list of drugs.  While I appreciate the motivation for these amendments, the bureau's advice is very much against extending the list at present.</p><p>There are many complications.  One of the risks is of mixing together drug intoxication and road safety matters with misuse of drugs provisions.  British legislation in this regard, similar to that proposed in the amendments, approaches the matter from a different angle.  The Road Safety Strategy action No. 77 relating to drug levels states &quot;legislate for the introduction of zero tolerance approach to illicit drug driving and impairment approach for other drugs.&quot;  This continues to be the basis for the new driving under the influence of drugs provisions.</p><p>The drugs included in the current Schedule are the most prevalent illicit drugs, namely, cannabis, heroin and cocaine.  The proposition of including specified limits referred to in the literature as <i>per se</i>levels for all the drugs in the misuse of drugs legislation would be novel when compared to other jurisdictions.  Even the UK has not gone this far.  The common approach is to select drugs known to be used by drivers, based on prevalence data.  Setting levels for all drugs is not practical for many reasons.  These include the lack of data proving impairment, selecting appropriate levels and the fact not all drugs in the misuse of drugs legislation are a concern in driving under the influence.</p><p>The Schedule taken from British law with the proposed limits for drugs such as benzodiazepines sets the legal levels at super therapeutic levels so as not to capture people on prescribed medications, taking medications on prescription, with the difficulty being the biovariation between individuals on such medications.  Drivers with significantly lower levels than these could be seriously impaired.  Although the old impairment offence remains, it could be argued they are driving under the legal limit for the drug and thus should not be prosecuted.  This would be an unforeseen consequence of such a change and contrary to road safety.</p><p>The proposal of including the table, which appears to be a copy of the section 5A annex of the England and Wales legislation, does not fit with the road safety strategy action either.  I note the proposed THC, tetrahydrocannabinol, level is higher than that in the current text of the Bill.  On the other hand, the proposed amendment would exclude cannabis acid which should be there if we are to make serious limits for that drug.  The MBRS has advised that the other illicit drugs proposed for inclusion in the amendment, ketamine, LSD, MDMA, and amphetamines, are not, in the bureau's view, significantly prevalent in Irish drivers.  The remaining drugs proposed, Nos. 10 to 17, inclusive, are all benzodiazepines, except No. 14, methadone, and are not illicit drugs although may be misused.  These are again covered by existing measures combined with impairment.</p><p>The bureau is committed to continue to monitor changing societal drug use.  The results, over time, may lead to adding to the drugs to be tested, which in time may be reflected in future legislation.  As a general comment, the Department did not consider it possible to set limits for certain classes of drugs which were not illicit, given the difficulty of deciding on levels at which people might be impaired, but would depend on the person's use, level of medication, length of time on medication, weight, mass, gender, etc.  The setting of limits for drugs is in the early stages of acceptance in the scientific and legal communities.  As this Bill works, we should consider expanding the number of levels and categories.  While the expansion of illicit drugs specified will be considered over time, it was considered best to begin with a small number of the most common illicit drugs in the first instance.</p></speech>

I served on the southern regional drugs task force in recent years.  Cocaine, cannabis and other inhibitors are very prevalent in the south-west region.  What the Minister is suggesting will create mayhem for garda&iacute; in Garda stations.  Garda&iacute; will know if people have taken drugs but will not necessarily know what drug they have taken so they will have to bring them all into the station.  There will be queues of people at Garda stations waiting to be tested for drugs because the list is phenomenally long.</p> <p>  In the context of modern methods of testing for drink driving, the person who has had three pints of Guinness is worse off than someone who has taken drugs.  There are some drugs that one is allowed to take and then to drive.  In terms of a test for safe limits of alcohol, the Minister is saying that those who drink three pints are safer drivers than those who have had three drops of whiskey.  A person can be prosecuted for taking cannabis, heroin and some other substances but there are other drugs being taken for social purposes which will be excluded.  The Minister must revisit the list.</p></speech>

It is very hard and I understand what the Deputy is saying.  For all other drugs, the position remains that the presence of a drug plus intoxication to the extent of being unable to control the vehicle is an offence already.  Under the existing impairment offence section of the 2010 Act, section 5, the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, MBRS, tests for seven different classes of drugs, including opiates, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines and others.  It is very difficult at this stage to say exactly what the levels will be but what we are doing, unashamedly, is starting with the ones which we actually know are the most common drugs.  We will look at how that works over the next few months or years and then consider other drugs.</p></speech>

This is under constant surveillance but we know from the MBRS that these three are the most commonly used drugs and in that context, the testing for them will be the easiest to implement.  If that works, we will extend the list.  We are quite prepared to look at that.  In fact, we are looking at it at the moment.  In the interests of getting this Bill through, we want to go ahead with the ones we have.  We do not want to continuously, month by month, add drugs to the list, one by one.  That would just make it totally impractical.  We will certainly look at it and we are considering extending the list but we want to go ahead with these three now.  This is urgent.  I do not want to say anything to alarm people but it is very urgent that we get this particular Bill through because of the number of deaths on the road.  As everyone here knows, the numbers are increasing by 20% per annum.  We want to include drugs, specifically.  That is one of the main tenets of this Bill but we do not want to continuously delay this legislation because we are adding on bits and pieces here, there and everywhere which may be beneficial.  I guarantee that we will be adding to the list and the Deputies can see the frequency with which road traffic Bills come before the House.  I guarantee that this will be under constant surveillance and we will take a sympathetic view of the suggestions that have been made today.</p></speech>

I am not sure of the answer to that question but I can report to the Deputies on Report Stage or before then.  There is no effort here to obstruct this, I can assure the committee.  It is just a matter of deciding to go ahead with what we have got while continuing to consider other drugs.  Even if we were to include some that are on the list now, we would still have to consider others on the list as we go along.</p> <p>  In this area, the science and forensics is developing all the time, as is our understanding of the damage these drugs do to peoples' capacity to drive.  It is an area that is constantly being monitored but we just want go ahead with what we have now.

While I acknowledge what the Minister has said about extending the list, I believe that this the time to try to incorporate as many of those drug types as possible.  It is disappointing that they have not been included.  That said, I will withdraw the amendment on the basis that there will be some form of legislation coming forward in the next 12 months that will include many of the drugs referred to in my amendment.  If these drugs can be included in the legislation in Wales, with a method for testing for them, there is no reason we cannot do the same here.  There are as many people using the new types of hallucinogenic drugs as there are using cocaine, cannabis and heroin.  This is something that we need to be on top of, so to speak.  I ask the Minister to give a commitment that he will come back to the House on this matter and is not just sympathetic to it.  I ask him to come back to the House soon with legislation that includes many of the drugs that are prevalent in society today.  If he can do that, I am happy to withdraw my amendment.</p></speech>

I would like to clarify whether they will be imposed by way of by-law.  The arrangements for by-laws can be convoluted and until they are introduced in a composite way, they can delay the introduction of new proposals.  This can be clumsy.  For example, significant advertising must be undertaken.  There is a complex regime surrounding by-laws.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p> <p>  It is important that we do not give the impression that the imposition of the proposed speed limits will be automatic because there would then be an expectation that they will apply to every housing estate.  People will be disappointed if that does not happen.  The proposal lets designers off the hook.  Garda&iacute; cannot be deployed in every location to enforce speed limits and, therefore, roads have to be designed to a particular standard.  There must be self-enforcing measures, particularly when designing new housing estates, which will achieve the proposed speed limits in order that we do not make the same mistakes again.  Good design means that the motorist cannot see and must slow down on particular bends, for example.  It is important that there should be dialogue between the Department and the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to make sure a standard is built into the design of housing estates to achieve speed limits without enforcement.  Will the Minister indicate how they will be applied?</p> <p>  If it is intended to reduce speed limits and, at some point in the future, revert to the original speed limit, does the Bill permit that?  How that would happen?</p></speech>

I come from a local authority background and the process of introducing by-laws is lengthy.  Given the legalities and paperwork, many county managers prefer to pool all the by-laws into one book and, therefore, the proposed speed limits could take a few years to introduce.  There will be a rash of applications to reduce the speed limit on housing estates to 20 km/h.  Will the legislation fast-track them?  Could individual municipal districts legally alter speed limits?  Obviously, they will have to consult the Garda.</p> <p>  The legislation will have major implications for the position of speed signs.  For example, if a crash occurs, there will be questions about whether it occurred inside or outside the speed limit zone if a sign is moved, and about where one defines the entry to an estate from another controlled speed limit zone.  When a motorist enters a village or a town, he or she usually enters a 50 km/h zone but the speed limit will change when he or she enters an estate.  There will be a legal quagmire in this regard.</p></speech>

Deputy Munster asked about the definition.  It is being examined by the Attorney General.  It is a bit of a problem.  We have a problem with her definition because it is more difficult than we anticipated to define a "housing estate".  Apparently, it could be interpreted to include five houses alongside a dual carriageway.  We, therefore, have a difficulty, which is an ongoing problem that we are addressing.</p> <p>  I refer to Deputy Murphy's questions.  The speed limit will be introduced by way of by-law.  I accept her point about the process being convoluted and about delays but the proposal must go through the prescribed public consultation process.  Sometimes, that causes a delay but it is thorough.  Traffic calming is a matter for the local authority.  She is correct that the speed limit will not be introduced automatically.  It is up to the local authority.  Her comments about the design of roads and self-enforcement are probably outside the scope of the Bill.  It is a long-term issue and she is correct that housing estate design should be considered, particularly in the context of speed, and that applies to current estates.</p> <p>  With regard to the amendments, I accept there is a need to control the speed of vehicles in residential areas.  I am not opposed to the principle of making provision in legislation for the application of a 20 km/h speed limit.  I also wish to ensure the right to apply appropriate speed limits on regional and local roads continues to rest with local authorities.  A major practical difficulty with the amendments in respect of a mandatory centrally imposed default speed limit of 20 km/h or 30 km/h relates to the designation of what constitutes a housing estate or, indeed, a residential road within a housing estate.  Throughout the country, there is a vast variety of estates of different types, size, configuration, location and population which no single legal definition, including this one, can satisfactorily encapsulate.  Many roads in our cities and towns, while having houses located on them, are also substantial routes for traffic, including, but not limited to, rush hour or commuting times.  Examples of such include James's Street on the south side and Church Street on the north side of Dublin.  How would the proposed definitions apply to such areas?</p> <p>  I am supportive of the Deputy's intention but I do not favour default 20 km/h or 30 km/h speed limits as proposed.  By the nature of their definition, they are too discriminatory and do not cover all envisaged residential development scenarios.  Elected councillors supported by expert advice from local authority road engineers have statutory responsibility for evaluating varying local conditions and are best placed to decide on the most appropriate special speed limit by-laws and associated traffic calming measures that should apply to any particular road, including residential, under their remit.</p><p>My Department's guidelines for setting and managing speed limits reiterate these responsibilities and provide guidance on such.  These guidelines encourage the use by local authorities of the special speed limit of 30 km/h in residential areas, accompanied by the introduction of appropriate signage.  Other publications such as the traffic management guidelines and the design manual for urban roads and streets also detail the options available to local authorities to facilitate traffic-calming measures and promote reduced vehicle speeds in housing estates and residential areas through modifications to the built environment, modifying road design with traffic islands, interrupted sight lines, pavement displacements, etc., an approach which is equally as important as setting an appropriate residential speed limit.  This addresses Deputy Catherine Murphy's point.</p><p> Regarding the provision of a 20 km/h special speed limit, I have, in addition to the existing 30 km/h special speed limit available to elected local authority councillors, already made provision for the lower 20 km/h limit in the Bill.  Once the Bill is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas, local authorities will have the option to impose 20 km/h special speed limit by-laws in respect of roads for which such a limit is deemed necessary.  My Department continues to support local authorities in implementing speed-reduction measures in residential areas by providing, through the aforementioned publications, detailed advice on the application of special speed limits and appropriate traffic-calming engineering measures, as well as dedicated funding for the provision of appropriate signage in residential areas.</p><p> One of the issues of concern raised by the Jake's Legacy campaign relates to the absence of legal powers for local authorities to apply speed limits in residential areas where the relevant roads have not been taken in charge by the authorities.  My officials are exploring such a lack of powers with the Attorney General's office to see if a solution can be found that would be suitable for future legislation.</p><p> I met the Jake's Legacy group on one occasion.  Members of the Oireachtas, my Department and others have responded to this tragedy and to the very worthy campaign in a fairly proactive manner.  Some of the measures taken in the Bill are a direct response to that campaign and the tragedy to which it relates.  This is one of those measures.  It is being put in place in the hope that such events can be prevented and in response to something very traumatic which has happened.  That is why the measure is included in the Bill.</p></speech>

Local authorities very often say that they cannot do something until a raft of matters are dealt with because they must carry out the totality of a scheme.  It is very frustrating because it delays matters around which there should be flexibility.  I can see the point in providing the flexibility in the Bill for the individual local authorities to consider specific proposals as opposed to a generalised approach.  This probably overcomes the issue of the definition to some degree.  It permits lower speed limits where they have not previously been permitted.  The typical answer of local authorities has been that they were not legally allowed to apply lower speed limits.  That is a valid finding in the report.</p> <p>  Regarding the estates not taken in charge, the current situation in which the extension of duration is permitted to a planning permission can mean that people cannot petition to have their housing estate taken in charge for up to 17 years after planning permission has been granted.  These are often the very estates in which there are large numbers of young children.  Why would it not be legally permissible to have speed limits applied to estates that are not taken in charge?  They are built to particular design standards.</p></speech>

I suppose the question of by-laws is a problem in that they operate in a kind of one-size-fits-all manner.  I have some sympathy for local authorities in that regard.  We must give them the flexibility because what suits one estate does not suit another and the application of an overall 20 km/h limit would be dangerous.  I share the Deputy's frustration about the delays.  However, if such thorough procedures are not in place, there will be complaints on the other side that there has been no thorough procedure, so I would prefer to leave it the way it is.  This is a big step.  It gives local authorities a lot of power.  It will be interesting to see how they exercise it.  It is probably right that we give them the power but we will review how they exercise.  I am of the view that they should do exercise it fairly ruthlessly, given, as the Deputy noted, that the only real priority is the safety of the children who live in these estates.  We will enter into a somewhat experimental sphere now to see what happens, whether it works and how the local authorities exercise the power.</p></speech>

I understand much of what the Minister said.  However, part of the problem, the frustration and the danger arises from the local authorities not taking action to install proper traffic-calming and safety measures within residential estates.  To be fair to local authorities, the big stumbling block is the lack of funding received to implement these road safety measures.  As other Deputies have said, there is also the reluctance of local authorities in not being to the fore or acting swiftly enough sometimes on speed limits and by-laws.  There are several aspects to the issue.  If it is not covered in legislation, then there will not be much chance of pressing local authorities to address through by-laws.  The matter will be left to lie.  The second part of the amendment states "30 kilometres per hour ... shall only be applied in respect of a road or roads".</p><p>Surely that would narrow down the definition of what a "housing estate" would be.</p></speech>

I am proposing a number of technical amendments here to Part 3 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.</p> <p>  Part 3 of the 2010 Act replaces the existing legislation for fixed charge offences and in particular provides for the so-called "third payment option", with which everybody is familiar.  At present, motorists who receive a fixed charge notice have 28 days in which to pay the charge and if they do not, a further 28 days in which to pay the charge plus 50%.  If they have not paid at that point, court proceedings would be initiated.  The third payment option adds to this system a notice issued with the summons to court allowing the person to pay the original charge plus 100% not later than seven days before the due date of court proceedings.  If they do so the court proceedings are discontinued.  The operation of the third payment option will reduce the burden on courts and will also end the practice of motorists going to court and claiming that they never received a fixed charge notice.</p> <p>  For the new system to be brought into effect, we need to make a number of changes to the 2010 Act.  First, we have to ensure that the first fixed charge notice sets out in its entirety the procedure concerned up to and including the third payment option.  Currently, the legislation does not provide for this.  Second, we need to make changes to account for a clarification in policy to state that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and not the Court Service, will be issuing the summon.</p></speech>

Deputy Munster's amendment is almost identical to my amendment.  The substance of it is already covered in the amendments I am proposing, which are more wide-ranging in various areas.  Section 78A of the Road Traffic Act 1961 requires motor insurers to provide details regarding insurance policies to the Garda, the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland and the Minister.  The difficulty with section 78A is that it does not specify what details are covered.  In section 19 of the Road Transport Bill 2016, I am setting out a list of the details to be provided by insurers and I intend at this point to make a number of amendments to the section.  I am proposing to replace the words "unique identification mark" with "vehicle registration number".  It was always my intention that the vehicle registration number would be provided but it has been drawn to my attention that the phrase "unique identification mark" could be interpreted as either the registration number or the vehicle identification number.  I am now proposing to change the wording to remove the ambiguity.  The current list of details to be provided by insurers consists of six items labelled (a) to (f).  I am proposing to add a seventh, namely, the licence or learner permit number of the policyholder and any named drivers.  This is a crucial piece of information in ensuring that records provided by insurers can be matched correctly to drivers.  As a consequence of this amendment, I am also proposing to remove the word "and" from the end of subsection (e) and add it to the end of subsection (f).</p></speech>

There is a lacuna here.  Anybody who wanders around the streets of Dublin at night will see these groups and will be concerned about regulation.  I will address the current situation.  In response to the concerns being expressed by Deputy Munster, which are primarily safety issues, Dublin City Council and the National Transport Authority, NTA, have obtained legal advice about their respective powers to regulate pedal-powered rickshaws.  I understand that discussions have recently taken place between Dublin City Council and the NTA which have agreed to make an approach to regulating pedal-powered rickshaws.  This would require the drafting and introduction of primary legislation.  My Department is now engaged with the NTA to frame the policy clearly to guide any detailed legislative drafting, with passenger safety being the key focus.  I will consider actively the legislative proposals that emerge when this work has been progressed, following which I will be in a position to outline an indicative legislative timeframe.  The Deputy has identified something.  This needs something.  I will not do it in this Bill but I will do it.  I can do it in this Bill but the Bill would be delayed.  I can tell the Deputy that I am going to do it and it is being addressed.</p></speech>

I will summarise the two amendments we have put down on the regulation of rickshaws.  No agency currently has the authority to regulate rickshaws.  The NTA, which regulates small public service vehicles such as taxis or hackneys, cannot regulate them because a public service vehicle is defined as one which is mechanically propelled.  The Minister provided feedback on his Department and Dublin City Council and set out that local authorities do not feel they have the authority to regulate or license rickshaws because they are not pedal-powered vehicles.  This is aside from the other issues in relation to pay rates and lighting of vehicles, never mind their licensing.  While Dublin City Council made draft by-laws to regulate rickshaws in 2013, these were withdrawn on legal advice.  This is because the great majority of rickshaws are neither pedal-powered or mechanically-propelled, rather they are battery-assisted.  This means that under current legislative definitions, they are not small public service vehicles or taxis, which are defined as mechanically-propelled vehicles.  Hence, the National Transport Authority is not authorised to regulate them.</p> <p>  The amendments we are putting forward, in addition to those tabled by Deputy Munster, alter the definition of "small public service vehicle" to include battery-powered, pedal-powered and non-mechanically powered vehicles and seek to create a new category of public service vehicle now to be called "public service rickshaws".  This includes all rickshaws including mechanically-powered, manually-powered and cycle-rickshaws.  This would clean up the legal lacuna the Minister has mentioned and would mean the NTA would become the authorised body for regulating rickshaws nationally.  The amendments also oblige the NTA to make certain regulations in respect of rickshaws.  These include that rickshaws must be licensed, that drivers can be subject to background checks and that vehicles can be inspected for roadworthiness.</p></speech>

I understand that it was not his intention to deal with the matter in this Bill, but I encourage him to look at accepting some of these amendments as an interim measure ahead of the more comprehensive legislation he may have in mind.

These are commercially-operated vehicles.  While there might be three types of rickshaws, pedal, battery-supported and mechanically-operated, there are issues of fair competition and road safety too.  I see them at night when they can shoot across town without due consideration.  Sometimes, they may not be properly lit up.  If one is a cyclist, one is obliged to wear a hi-vis garment whereas these people operate in casual gear with no lighting, which is why something has to be pushed forward quickly here.  I support the Deputies in this regard.</p></speech>

It is right to say there is a problem.  The reply I gave, which is that Dublin City Council and the NTA are looking at it, appears to me to fail somewhat to meet the justifiable impatience I sense at this meeting.  There is a certain amount of concern, which I share.  I will not include provisions in this Bill because of some questions that need to be answered.  It needs time.  I refer to the legal definition of "vehicle", who will test the safety of vehicles, whether there will be licences as with taxis, how the fares will be set and by whom, who will regulate fares and issues around the regulation of drivers.  All those issues are being discussed by the NTA and Dublin City Council.  I could say I will include provisions now but that would delay the Bill.  That is the reality.  However, I will get on to the NTA and Dublin City Council before Report Stage and come back to Deputies to say what is happening and proposed in more detail.  To be fair, I have not given them nearly enough detail here.  Primary legislation will be required and that legislation must be sound.  I do not want to rush it and have a flaw there.  I will report back to Deputies because I acknowledge that this is a problem and that we will have to regulate.  Perhaps the issue needs an injection of urgency.  I hope that is adequate for Deputies.  It is the realistic situation.</p></speech>

There must be something.  It is disappointing because there is a Revenue issue, a social issue, a safety issue, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, and then there is the whole regulation of it.  It is dangerous.  The Minister has seen it in the city at night himself.  It is actually quite dangerous.</p><p>Rickshaws are fun, but those who provide them do not, as far as I am aware, adhere to traffic laws, including on using one-way road systems.  There is a crying need for regulation as otherwise there will be a serious accident.  For example, should rickshaws providers be permitted to use cycle lanes, bus lanes and so on, as they currently do?  It appears that it is a free-for-all for rickshaw providers, while other public transport services are regulated to the hilt.</p></speech>

The point I am making is that the Bill deals primarily with urgent issues such as drugs and written-off vehicles.  The Deputy has raised a specific issue, the urgency of which does not match the urgency of some of the others we are addressing in the Bill.  I do not want the Bill to be delayed for months; I want to see enacted as soon as possible.  I agree with the Deputy on the need for proper regulation of rickshaws.  I will seek an update for her on the problems caused and a timetable for what is being done in that regard.  As I said, I do not want to see the Bill being delayed by other issues which are not at its core.  Road safety is too important and lives are at stake.  If we get the Bill through such that drug testing can commence, we can save lives.  If at this stage we were to try to have the rickshaw issue addressed in the Bill, it could be delayed for months and I do not want to see that happen.  I am happy to commit to addressing the rickshaw issue urgently if the Deputy is willing to withdraw the amendment.  I will forward to her the timetable in that regard once I receive it from the NTA and the DCC.</p></speech>

For example, if a person was seen using a mobile phone while driving and he or she was stopped by a garda, would the garda have to check the phone to see whether the person was making a telephone call or texting?

It has been an offence since 2006 to hold a mobile phone while driving.  Regulations were introduced in May 2014 by the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, which prohibited texting from hands-free mobile phones, for example, mobile phones held in a cradle on the dashboard.  This addressed a loophole which had allowed people to text while driving as long as they were not holding the mobile phone.  The penalty in this case is a fine not exceeding &euro;2,000 on summary conviction.  In-car technology and communications equipment is evolving rapidly.  In some instances the technology is increasing road safety.  However, we still face a huge problem in the number of people who continue to use mobile phones while driving.  I have been informed by the Attorney General's office that this year to date 22,170 people have been caught driving while using a mobile phone.  I will be monitoring this issue with a view to making changes in policy, as necessary.  I will be interested to see whether the increase in penalty points in the United Kingdom to six on conviction for driving while using a mobile phone has an impact in changing driver behaviour.</p></speech>

In fact, it has been outlawed in England, Scotland and Wales.  There is a myriad of different operators in this country charging different amounts of money, and the appeal process is very deficient.  Is this specifically providing for an independent appeals process?  There is an independent appeals process of sorts at present and, to be honest, from what I see it is making up the rules as it goes along.  It is unfair to motorists because there are different arrangements for each clamping organisation.  One can be charged up to &euro;120 for the most minor infringement.  Does this provide for the NTA to be the independent appeals mechanism?  Is what is provided for here the policy position that will inform the decisions it will make as the independent appeals body?</p></speech>

The NTA will do that.  The changes proposed in amendment No. 39 are technical amendments to section 4 of the Vehicle Clamping Act 2015 and are designed to correct an error in the Act.  The Act has implications for the regulation of clamping activities wherever they are operated and, upon commencement, the NTA will assume the function of regulating clamping activities in relevant clamping places in accordance with the Act.</p> <p>  A number of Deputies have made inquiries about the Act's commencement in recent months.  The NTA required a period of time to recruit a small number of additional staff and to put in place the necessary back-up support to ensure the reasonable operation of its new duties under the Act.  That period is now complete and during final discussions with the Department in recent weeks regarding commencement of the Act, it was noticed that section 4(1)(b) required the NTA to publish in full a draft of any proposed regulations in a national newspaper as well as on its website.  The requirement would result in possibly 20 or more pages of draft regulations being printed in a national newspaper, which would not only look very unusual but would also cost a considerable and totally unnecessary amount of money.  Such a requirement on publication is not what is required in similar and analogous cases.  My intention, therefore, is to amend the Act to bring this publication and consultation provision into line with those used elsewhere.  The amendments will require the NTA to publish in full any draft regulations on its website and then publish a notice of the draft regulations in a national newspaper.  This is in line with the requirements elsewhere in other similar legislative measures.  During the consultation period the NTA will also be required to make available for inspection a copy of the draft regulations in its office as well as on its website.  The NTA will still be required by other provisions in the original Act to consider any representations it receives in response to any such consultation.</p> <p>  These amendments will allow for the speedy commencement of the Act, which many people have called for.  As amendment No. 39 amends the Vehicle Clamping Act 2015, it is necessary to amend the long Title to this Bill to reflect this.  That is the substance of amendment No. 52, which also adds reference to the long Title to the agreement on mutual recognition of driving disqualifications between Ireland and the UK, which is dealt with in section 25 of the Bill.</p></speech>

Noel Clancy said at the time that the Government and Irish society needed to reflect on the number of young learner drivers who drive cars unaccompanied in contravention of the law.  He also said it was important to reflect on the question of how many unaccompanied learner drivers are on the roads of Ireland on any given day and how many parents and family members allow their cars to be driven by these drivers.  He further called on the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to implement legislation to provide that allowing one's car to be driven by an unaccompanied learner driver is an offence and would make the car owner and driver equally accountable in law.  My amendment addresses this issue.</p></speech>

When the Deputy speaks for the Clancy family he is speaking for a large number of people in this country.  When I saw that case reported on the news the night it happened I rang the head of the Road Safety Authority and asked what the situation was and whether legislation should be introduced to remedy the awful problem highlighted by the Clancy family.  She agreed that it definitely should be addressed.  Strengthening the law with regard to unaccompanied learner permit holders is something I have asked my officials to examine in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, whose advice will have to be sought as to the barriers to introducing such an offence on the registered owner of a vehicle.  My officials will also liaise with the Garda as to the enforceability of such a proposal.</p> <p>  It is a serious problem.  We do not know the extent of it but the fact that it had to be highlighted by a death and a court case such as this is unacceptable.  A learner permit holder who is driving when unaccompanied is not meeting one of the key conditions attached to their permit and therefore is driving unlicensed.  This is already an offence which carries three penalty points on payment of a fixed charge notice and five penalty points on conviction in court.  Furthermore, the cost of insurance working group, chaired by Deputy Eoghan Murphy and in which the Department is a participant, will introduce measures to deal with unaccompanied driving.  I understand that its report will be finalised and presented to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, before the end of the year.  That is the insurance aspect.  However, I am not satisfied with the safety aspect.  I assure the Deputy it is now being addressed urgently.  It is a pity it took a court case such as that to address it.</p></speech>

If the Minister feels that way, why does he think my amendment does not address the issue?  Why is further consideration required?  That is one element.  In general, however, this amendment, if enacted, would be very helpful to parents.  I am at an age where I see teenage children who are driving their mother's or father's car or seeking permission to do so.  They pressurise their parents.  They argue that even if it is the law the garda&iacute; do not bother with it and that it will be grand.  The amendment gives parents further armour to be able to push back against that argument, which we know takes place in households throughout the country.  The parents can say that if their child is caught driving illegally, they will be in trouble as well.  It is a serious matter and this is a neat amendment which will address it.</p></speech>

I would have to hear very cogent arguments as to why it cannot be addressed in this legislation.  It is an anomaly and it appears to be something straightforward in terms of making a legislative change.  I do not see what the difficulty is with the amendment.</p></speech>

I believe it is fine in principle.  The reason I am reluctant to accept it now is that I wish to examine it more closely to see what the implications are for other areas of legislation for drink driving and whether it would undermine those offences in any way.  We will probably need serious legal advice on it.  The other issue is that the regulations to which the amendment refers are the road traffic regulations 1999.</p><p>They are not the correct regulations.  The 1999 regulations were replaced in 2006.</p></speech>

I appreciate where Deputy Ryan is coming from and I ask for the situation to be reviewed.  I am concerned about making people guilty and over things like the onus of proof.  How does one prove that the parents took a casual approach?  Many years ago, young people took the keys and went out the back of the house to learn to drive.  It is a delicate situation and this could cause more damage to families.  I know where Mr. Clancy came from and I know the family well.  The first anniversary of this tragic incident is approaching and it highlights the difficulties.  The laws are in place and garda&iacute; have checkpoints.  They are aware of the age of a driver and I am asking for Garda reinforcements under the existing legislation.</p></speech>
