No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated 23 March 2013, from Mr. Pat Geoghegan, secretary of the Irish Environmental Forum, regarding the Environmental Protection Agency.  The correspondence is to be noted.  Mr Geoghegan has raised issues regarding the competency of the EPA.  It appears that his interpretation of a report on air quality differs from that of the Department.  His latest letter suggests the emissions from certain industries are costing &euro;1 billion.  If that was the case, I am sure it is a matter that would feature in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Therefore, I ask the Irish Environmental Forum to be more specific about the failures of the EPA.  It will be up to members to follow up on this issue when representatives of the EPA appear before the committee on 27 June.</p><p>  No. 3B.2 is correspondence, dated 15 April 2013, from Professor Niamh Brennan, former chairperson of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, regarding the committee's examination of Special Report No. 77 of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  The correspondence is to be noted.  This matter was discussed in the earlier part of our meeting.</p><p>  No. 3C is documents relating to the committee meeting of 25 April.  No. 3C.1 is correspondence, received on 22 April, from the Health Service Executive regarding briefing papers on matters to be considered at today's meeting.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 3C.2 is correspondence, received on 25 April, from the Health Service Executive regarding the opening statement.  The correspondence is to be noted and published.</p><p>  No. 4 is reports, statements and accounts received since our meeting on 18 April.  Items Nos. 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 are listed.</p> <p>If members wish to raise queries, they may do so now or else contact the clerk if they want them to be included in the agenda.</p><p> The work programme is now on screen.  At last week's meeting members expressed concern about the fact that the committee was examining the accounts for 2011 when the accounts for 2012 should have been finalised.  This matter was raised in respect of the broadcasting fund, but it has wider implications, especially at this time of the year.  I have been advised that the same issue will arise in respect of IDA Ireland, the representatives of which are scheduled to appear on 30 May.  It might be appropriate to defer that meeting until September and we may schedule other business for that day.  If we delay the meeting with IDA Ireland, we will be able to carry out a more complete and up-to-date examination.  This is an issue we will consider as we invite witnesses to appear.  It is proposed to reschedule the meeting with IDA Ireland and to take its accounts for 2011 and 2012 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Is the agenda for our meeting with representatives of the Dublin Docklands Development Authority on Thursday, 2 May agreed?  Agreed.  It will be held at 10 a.m.</p><p> At our meeting on 28 February we left open the position on Vote 26 - Education and Skills, as further information was required.  The Department has since furnished detailed information and I ask for members' agreement to note the Vote.  The Accounting Officer is due to come before the committee again to deal with specific issues.  It would be appropriate, in preparing for the next meeting, if the Vote was not part of our agenda, particularly as the information requested has been submitted.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

To give the background, it may be useful to explain that the HSE is required to produce two sets of accounts each year - the financial statements prepared on an accruals basis and a cash-based appropriation account for Vote 40.  The accounts in question provide two views of the same set of financial transactions and balances, with different forms of analysis and detail.  Two audit reports also issue.  The HSE publishes the accruals-based financial statements each year, with its corporate annual report.  The statements for 2011 were presented to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann around the first week of June last year.  The HSE's appropriation account for 2011 was published by me, together with all of the other appropriation accounts, last September.  The audit of the HSE's financial statements for 2012 is almost complete and I expect to sign off on it around mid-May.  The audit of the appropriation account for 2012 is ongoing and should be completed by July.</p><p>  The appropriation account indicates that the HSE's gross expenditure in 2011 amounted to &euro;13.9 billion.  The outturn was approximately 4% below the 2010 gross expenditure level and 8% below peak expenditure in 2009.  Appropriations-in-aid in 2011 amounted to &euro;1.45 billion, down from &euro;3.5 billion in 2010.  The decrease reflects the ending of earmarked health contributions collected through the PRSI system with effect from 1 January 2011, when the universal social charge was introduced.  The outturn for 2011 was close to the amount appropriated by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, resulting in a surrender of just under &euro;16 million.  This was achieved after provision to the HSE of an additional &euro;148 million by way of a Supplementary Estimate in December 2011.  Two thirds of the additional provision was for increased spending under subhead B6 which covers spending on medical card schemes and community services.  The outturn for these services was &euro;2.58 billion, which was 6.8% above the original Estimate for the year.  The provisional outturn for 2012 indicates that spending in these areas continued to run ahead of the Estimate provision last year, ending approximately 9% up on the Estimate provision.  This was one of the main reasons a Supplementary Estimate, amounting to a net &euro;360 million, was also required in 2012.</p><p>  The financial statements present an analysis of the HSE's expenditure that distinguishes between pay and non-pay elements.  The HSE's direct pay expenditure in 2011 amounted to just over &euro;5 billion, or 36% of the total spent.  This included pension payments to retired staff totalling &euro;567 million and payments to agency staff amounting to some &euro;177 million.  Grants to outside agencies in 2011 amounted to &euro;3.5 billion or 25% of the total.  This includes funding of the order of &euro;2.5 billion to voluntary hospitals and other major agencies providing services on behalf of the HSE, mainly in the disability and mental health sectors.  A further &euro;1 billion was distributed as grants to some 3,000 smaller agencies, including community and voluntary bodies providing a wide range of services ancillary to the HSE's activities.  A significant part of that grant funding is also applied in the payment of staff salaries and pensions.</p><p>  The audit report on the financial statements draws attention to note 35 which deals with the matter of entitlement to means-tested medical cards.  At the end of December 2011, a total of 1.7 million medical cards and 126,000 GP visit cards were in issue.  The total related expenditure in 2011 was in the region of &euro;1.8 billion.  Administration of the card issuing and renewal system was centralised in July 2011.  Changes were made in the related control systems and procedures were standardised.  Following the centralisation, over 231,000 applications for the renewal of expired cards were processed.  Of these, 97.5% were renewed.  However, 1.2% of applicants were found not to be eligible for a new card and almost 1.3% were found to be eligible for the more limited GP card instead of a full medical card.</p> <p>The review process did not record the financial impact incurred, such as the cost of services provided in respect of ineligible persons while they held cards.  This matter is being examined in more detail in the course of this year&rsquo;s audits and, depending on the outcome, I may report further on the matter.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.32" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013042500005#E00175"><p>I thank you, Chairman and members for the invitation to attend today's meeting to discuss Vote 40, Health Service Executive and the Annual Financial Statements 2011.<br /><b></b>Prior to the meeting we submitted an information pack to the committee, which among other matters, provided an update on the recommendations in the committee&rsquo;s recently published report on the Health Service Executive.  We will be happy to take any follow-up questions on the information provided or other related matters.  I propose therefore to keep my opening statement brief.</p><p>  The HSE delivered a balanced Vote in 2011 and delivered the national service plan commitments within its funding provision against very challenging resource constraints, both in financial and staffing terms.  It is a statutory requirement of the Accounting Officer that no overspending of the Vote takes place.  In practice, it is almost impossible to achieve an exact break-even position on a gross Vote outturn of &euro;13.687 billion and it is inevitable that, in accordance with prudent management, a small surplus will be returned to the Exchequer.  The surplus surrendered in respect of 2011 was &euro;15.781 million, which amounts to 0.1% of the net 2011 allocation of &euro;12.46 billion.  A Supplementary Estimate of &euro;148 million was voted by the D&aacute;il to the HSE at the end of 2011.  This comprised &euro;58 million due to a shortfall in funding in 2011 arising from a lower than anticipated uptake in the early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes implemented at the end of 2010 and; &euro;90 million to meet deficits in services, specifically in the community drugs schemes, the acute hospital sector and child welfare and protection services.</p><p>  The &euro;148 million Supplementary Estimate was offset by savings of &euro;40 million in the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Health.  The HSE reported a surplus in the revenue income and expenditure account of &euro;98.426 million for 2011, compared to &euro;123.924 million for 2010.  A substantial element of this surplus is technical in nature and is attributable to the differences between the differing bases of accounting under accruals and Vote accounting rules.  Funding for capital projects in 2011 amounted to &euro;345.424 million, of which &euro;204.31l million was expended on HSE capital projects and &euro;132.755 million on capital grants to service providers.</p><p>  Developing a robust and fit-for-purpose financial system is a priority for both the HSE and the Department of Health.  In that regard the Ogden review was commissioned by the Department of Health in May 2012 and the report was completed in July 2012.  The review looked at financial processes; budgeting; reporting; performance management and escalation and governance and leadership.  The key purpose of the review was to recommend where the focus of a strategy for financial performance management should be.  The recommendations ultimately led to the Department of Health commissioning further work to focus on implementing change in relation to key issues highlighted in the review.  This further work was commissioned in July 2012 and a report was issued in September 2012 and was undertaken in the context of predicted continued significant financial overruns and a need to provide assurance to Government and to the troika in relation to the financial position of the health sector.</p><p>  The report highlighted the need to take immediate action to improve the financial management systems in health.  A key priority for me on my appointment in August 2012 was to stabilise HSE finances and to implement the actions outlined in the second review, the PA review, commissioned by the Department.  The engagement of PA by the HSE is one of the first steps in the financial reform of the health service which is a central element of the overall reform programme.  This work is well under way and is due to be completed in the coming weeks and will lay the foundations for further financial reform.  The appointment of a new chief financial officer to the HSE is also central to driving forward the changes needed to develop the finance function in the context of the wider health reform programme including: money-follows-the-patient and universal health insurance.  The selection process to fill this post is currently under way and is due to be completed shortly.</p><p>  The HSE has an internal audit directorate, led by a national director and includes very experienced audit staff.  The directorate also avails of external specialist support, particularly in the form of ICT audit.  The work of the internal audit directorate is overseen by the HSE's audit committee.  The directorate regularly briefs the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the results of its work.  A substantial body of internal audit reports are completed each year, covering a wide range of topics.  HSE internal audit reports are periodically released.</p><p>  I am committed to further strengthening the internal audit function of the health service as a key control measure during the period of structural transition that lies ahead.  Financial reform in all its forms is a key component in the ongoing health reform programme and one that will continue to be a major focus for us.  That concludes my opening statement.</p></speech>

The witnesses are welcome.  I was struck by something in Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s opening statement.  The HSE does not have a good track record in terms of staying within budget.  In the Supplementary Estimate he outlined amounts of &euro;148 million in 2011 and &euro;360 million in 2012.  I was curious to hear reference to the return of a surplus.  Could he outline more detail on the matter?  The terms &ldquo;surplus&rdquo; and &ldquo;HSE&rdquo; are not linked in the public mind.</p></speech>

The terms are not very much linked in the public mind.  However, in Vote terms, following the granting of a Supplementary Estimate at the end of the relevant financial year the amount of cash-on-hand at the closing date was in excess of the requirements of the service at that point in time.  The requirement is to return the surplus.</p></speech>

I am not doing this to get into a finger-pointing exercise or a blame game, this is the responsibility of the Oireachtas &ndash; of the Government in the first instance &ndash; to vote the moneys.  We have fallen well short in 2011 to the tune of &euro;148 million and then in 2012 to the tune of &euro;360 million.  They are not trifling sums of money.  It is not a small margin of error, it is a significant shortfall.  That suggests to me that we consistently underestimate and under-fund the HSE.  Does Mr. O&rsquo;Brien agree?</p></speech>

If we break them down, &euro;58 million arose directly from a lower than anticipated uptake in the early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes.  In that instance it is a mismatch between the expected number who would avail of the schemes and the number who did.  To that extent one could say there was an inadequacy in the estimation of the outflow and therefore the resulting financial impact.  A total of &euro;90 million was to meet deficits in services which means that the cost of those services exceeded what was expected.  I refer in particular to community drugs schemes which were demand-led.  One could take the view either that those responsible for preparing the estimate of the likely cost of those under-shot, let us put it that way, or one could take the view that insufficient money was provided.  That is very much a judgment call.</p> <p>If one looks back at the year and taking account of what in relative terms was a small return of funding proportionate to the overall funding, it was necessary for there to be a Supplementary Estimate for the HSE's vote to be balanced in that year.</p></speech>

Consequently, the hospital sector ended last year with a &euro;271 million deficit.  We also know there were challenges in the area of the medical card scheme and the related schemes.  Therefore, the overall cost of providing those was substantially in excess of what had been expected at the beginning of the year.</p></speech>

The reason I ask this question of Mr. O'Brien is not so much with an eye on 2011 but more with an eye to the future and the &euro;721 million earmarked for savings this year under the HSE's national service plan.  I want to ask Mr. O'Brien some questions in this regard.  From where does he envisage these savings coming?  I ask particularly in light of my understanding that up to the end of February 2013, the HSE was demonstrating a net overspend of &euro;13 million.  In other words, the HSE already is in deficit position and were Mr. O'Brien in a position to give me a more up-to-date figure, I would appreciate it.  Given that it is now the end of April, what is the deficit's current size?  From where are these savings of &euro;721 million to come?</p></speech>

A copy of the service plan was included in the prepack provided to members and the relevant page is page 3.  As Deputy McDonald will see, the primary care reimbursement service, which is related to both legislative changes and other efficiencies, is to produce &euro;323 million of those savings.  A further &euro;106 million is attributable to pay and flexibility arrangements arising under the existing public service agreement.  There are unallocated pay savings of &euro;150 million, which in broad terms is what was anticipated under Croke Park II, as well as &euro;108 million in other measures that are detailed elsewhere in the target and &euro;34 million in terms of statutory income.  A big proportion of these savings is attributable to changes in the cost of providing service by way of workforce-related matters.  The substantial other component relates to changes in the cost of providing schemes, which are the product of changes in eligibility and co-payment issues with some reductions in costs, particularly under the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, agreement, and a number of changes that we are pushing forward, for example, in the medicines management programme, which is designed to increase the number of lower-cost drugs that are prescribed as a proportion of the total.</p></speech>

Some of those already are already having a positive impact but the great proportion of them are not scheduled to have had an impact in the first quarter.</p></speech>

The Deputy has mentioned some of those risks and I will reiterate them.  At present, it is clear the Croke Park II agreement has not been achieved and &euro;150 million of savings are associated with that or with a replacement for it.  In addition, a further &euro;106 million has been specified as being related to pay and flexibility arrangements under Croke Park I.  Clearly, while the health service has proved to be an effective environment in which to extract flexibility issues in recent years under Croke Park I, obviously I have some concern that, in the current environment, we would need to be certain of the industrial relations environment and the Croke Park II environment in order to be absolutely certain of delivery in that regard.  However, for the present time, as the Deputy is aware, at a central Government level a process is now in place by central Government, which is designed to address the result of the Croke Park II ballots and until we know the outcome of that, it is difficult to be certain what will be the outturn in respect of those two issues.</p></speech>

Clearly, the Minister is innately aware of the importance of these savings.  However, as I stated, this is a matter that is not specific to the health service.  This is a public sector-wide issue and as recently as its recent meeting this week, the Government has made clear its intention to further this issue.  For the time being, it is not appropriate for the HSE to begin to consider alternative ways to leverage that kind of cost reduction.  This is because first, this is not profiled until 1 July onwards or in other words is a second-half issue.  Second, in the absence of measures that reduce our costs, it would be extremely challenging to begin to extract that level of saving from the direct provision of services.  As it would have a highly negative effect on the provision of health care, for the time being it is appropriate for us to await the outcome of the process the Government has initiated.</p></speech>

I have instanced nurses but I could equally refer to his clerical staff.  There was a controversy around the issuing of medical cards for a long time and the time-lag involved.  Even if Mr. Tony O'Brien will not tell me, I hope that he told the Minister that there are significant numbers of staff in the service that he manages who simply cannot bear another cut.  I also hope in respect of this &euro;150 million that Mr. O'Brien, somewhere in the system, has his thinking cap on in terms of alternative methods of finding that money other than skinning public servants again.  Let me hasten to add, I view medical consultants in a different category from others I have mentioned.</p><p>  In respect of medical cards, there was some change to the eligibility criteria in respect of the over 70s and I understand that would result in a reduction of some 20,000 in the number of those holding a full medical card.  The HSE did something that I thought was a little sneaky in changing the criteria for assessable income and, therefore, eligibility, and also in removing matters such as home-improvement loan payments and excluding the &euro;50 per week travel-to-work expenses.  This was done quietly, and over the Easter break.  Mr. O'Brien has obviously taken the decision to do that.  I need not tell him that it will cause difficulties for persons across the State and we will hear about it in our constituency offices but I want to press the issue with him.  Did the HSE issue a press release on this matter?  Did it brief the media?  It was done very quietly.  In the course of discussions in the Oireachtas, my colleague, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, asked repeatedly for an account to be given of where the 40,000 drop would happen in the medical cards.  We could identify 20,000 in respect of the over 70s.  We could not find the other 20,000 until we got this e-mail over Easter.</p></speech>

I should emphasise that the decisions were not HSE decisions but Department of Health decisions and I do not think a broad-based communication to every Member of the Oireachtas by the HSE can fairly be characterised as sneaky.</p></speech>

For the over 70s, there was a change in the income guidelines, from &euro;700, if it was a single person, down to &euro;600, but on the basis that if one was between &euro;600 and &euro;700, rather that get a medical card one could get a GP visit card.  Then, for couples, it was double that - &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,400 - and the same rules applying in that one could get a GP visit card if one is within the &euro;1,200 and &euro;1,400 assessment.</p><p>  In terms of the under 70s, we did say - we set it out in our service plan - that there would be a review of cards.  There were two aspects on which that is being carried out.  One is in terms of the reduction of what is known as the assessable income as part of the income guidelines, and it is the home-improvement loans.  The other one was that the first &euro;50 in regard to travel-to-work expenses and depreciation of cars be disallowed when making one's calculations in terms of whether or not one would be entitled to a medical card.  That was set out in the service plan.  It was over that period, the end of March, that the policy and the legislation to give effect to it was in train but we did flag it up.  It was notified in that regard.</p><p>  It is important to note that we did say that 100,000 new persons will be availing of medical cards this year.  An additional 130,000 GP visit cards will be availed of this year as well.</p></speech>

I made my point.  Mr. O'Brien may not have considered it to be sneaky but the reason I make that charge - perhaps it is more correctly said to the Department of Health - is because questions had been asked repeatedly in terms of from where these 40,000 reductions were coming.  The over 70s matter was flagged comprehensively and was understood, but in the case of the additional portion it was like trying to get the third secret of Fatima.</p><p>  On the previous occasion Mr. O'Brien was before the committee, in the committee's report in respect of the HSE we had raised the issue of consultants signing off on private insurance forms and the difficulties arising from that.  Can Mr. O'Brien update us on where that sits now?  Are they complying with it?  Are they doing it within the 14-day window?  Are there still moneys outstanding and if so, how much?</p></speech>

The 14-day period is 20 calendar days.  It is 14 working days.  The number of days taken for consultant sign-off is reducing steadily.</p> <p>In 2010 it was 62 days, and in 2012 it was 44 days.  We are very confident that as this year progresses, it will indeed be 20 days.  Obviously, we are conscious that there is a tail and, therefore, a certain amount of catch-up to be done.  One of the issues of concern is that as we reduce the period taken to process claims on our side, which includes both the preparation of the documentation and the signing off by the primary consultant, we are experiencing a lengthening of the tail on the other side.  Of the time taken between the conclusion of treatment and the receipt of the relevant funding or income from the private health insurance sector, about 60% used to lie on our side.  As we progressively reduced the proportion of time, we are seeing a corollary increase in time so that the overall time that it takes for us to get the cash is increasing.  At present, there is not a hard and fast deadline for the private health insurance sector to return funding.  We are in active discussion with the Department of Health, particularly in the context of the impending legislation which will remove the issue of private bed designation, to examine how best we could arrive at a situation where there is timely payment of the income once the forms are signed.</p></speech>

For example, as set out in the briefing document provided for the committee, alongside this, we are increasing the number of sites that use the electronic claims process.  About 51% of claims, by value, come from sites that use this process.  By July, there will be an additional 22% of claims and by the end of the year 80% to 90% of claims will be in that space also.

There has been no official sanction in that respect.  I want to mark for Mr. O'Brien the clear contrast about which I am certain in the treatment of this issue for this set of workers and other workers within the HSE system, which I find extraordinary.</p><p>  I am conscious of the time, but I want to ask Mr. O'Brien a final question on an entirely different topic.  What lessons has the HSE learned from the death of Savita Halappanavar?  I am not going into the area of policy or legislation.  At the time, however, I was struck, particularly in the initial phases - Savita died on 28 October 2012 - that the HSE was slow and a bit clumsy in dealing with the family and her husband, in particular.  What are the lessons the HSE has learned and what reassurance can Mr. O'Brien provide that lessons have been learned from an operational point of view?</p></speech>

We have specifically sought to provide time for Mr. Halappanavar or his representatives to engage with the chairman.  A copy of the final draft report was provided for him in advance of the inquest.  Naturally, during the course of the inquest, they did not wish to engage because they were obviously fully occupied with the inquest.  They have now sought a meeting with the chairman of the review panel which will lead quickly to the publication of the report.  I do not intend to say anything further about the matter until I have had sight of the report.</p></speech>

I understood from Mr. Halappanavar that one of his primary worries at the outset stemmed from the fact that he had made contact with the HSE.  His wife had died and had been brought back home to be buried.  He had heard nothing from the HSE and made contact with the system.  Without getting into the precise medical or care details within the hospital - I fully understand that is a separate day's work - I have an anxiety that that was Mr. Halappanavar's experience.  I am asking in a general sense whether Mr. O'Brien has independently examined that turn of events.  Does it raise concerns for him in terms of how the system interacts with a husband who loses his wife, or anybody else who loses a person in traumatic circumstances, that it is left to them to initiate the contact?  That is worrying.</p></speech>

Clearly, the circumstances of the death of Savita Halappanavar are tragic in every respect.  As I have said before, the situation in which Praveen finds himself is appalling.  Having said that, I do not think it is appropriate to get into a detailed discussion at this forum about what did or did not happen at any given point in time in advance of the conclusion of the report commissioned from an international expert.  That report will cover all aspects of the care provided and circumstances surrounding the death of Savita Halappanavar.  It will be published shortly and there will then be an opportunity for all aspects of the matter to be discussed.</p></speech>

As the Deputy is aware, I also took the step of writing to HIQA and requesting it to carry out a statutory review of the wider issues involved.  It is carrying out that process.  The emphasis of what we have done in the aftermath of the death of Savita Halappanavar has been on putting in place processes designed to find out exactly what happened, what went wrong and what can be done in the future to avoid a recurrence.  The process, therefore, is one of seeking to learn and improve.</p></speech>

We have an average number of days of 62, 44 and 30.  Can we receive a list of a number of hospitals indicating how many days they might be out, without naming the hospitals, in order that we can get beyond the average figure and look at the detail?  It seems that it is a very ambitious target to reduce the number of days from 62 to 30 in 2013.  I would like to see, perhaps during the course of this meeting, somebody giving us that information, the names of hospitals the HSE is dealing with, from the worst case down.</p><p>  I call Deputy Connaughton who will be followed by Deputies O'Donnell, Dowds, Harris, Donohoe and Fleming.</p></speech>

Of the figure of &euro;721 million, how much of it has been achieved to date, now that we are one third of the way through the year?</p></speech>

As I said in earlier statements, there are significant issues concerning pay-related savings arising from Croke Park II and, by inference, Croke Park I.  However, it is the position that the Government intends to provide measures which will achieve these savings.  In terms of their profile in the year to date, we are on target, but the savings have not been profiled at this stage.</p></speech>

In March, we released 400 more places than would have been expected.  Anyone who would otherwise have been waiting to take up - and was due to receive - a place in the community right now has already been allocated one.  The two measures taken together mean that no one has been disadvantaged.  Anyone coming from a community setting who was due a place has already been given it as we accelerated the release.</p></speech>

I know an individual who thought he would be offered a place for his mother last Thursday, having waited for the normal four-week period.  He is waiting to see if it will happen today.

That person's position is not disadvantaged with respect to what it would have been.  However, we have also put in place a provision whereby any individual from whatever situation who believes he or she is experiencing undue hardship on foot of the temporary arrangement can contact the HSE and his or her circumstances will be examined.

The first factor was the relatively late flu season and the other was the significantly higher than normal proportion of such patients attending at accident and emergency departments who required admission.  As a result, it was necessary to implement a variety of measures to free up capacity in acute hospitals.  One of the rate limiting steps on acute hospitals is the number of persons delayed in them pending discharge to long-term and, or, transitional care.  We have put in place a significant number of additional transitional care beds.  Due to the balance of risks involved, we have prioritised for a brief current period persons in acute hospitals who are being discharged for the precise reason that they are at greater risk in hospital and, more particularly, on foot of the risk factors which exist in respect elderly persons with respiratory illness who are excessively delayed on trolleys in emergency departments.  The temporary arrangement has been for the benefit of older persons in all situations to ensure that those at greatest clinical risk have had their needs addressed.</p></speech>

It seems to have produced a particular demand for respiratory care for older persons which resulted in a much higher proportion of admissions among attendances.  As the Deputy may be aware, that resulted in a significant increase in the number of patients recorded on trolleys awaiting admission.  To manage that safely, it was necessary to make the change.  It is a temporary measure and an appropriate response to a particular that issue that arose.</p></speech>

It is the intention in 2013 to secure further reductions in our reliance on agency staff.  Due to the huge opposition from nursing union, we have had a small take-up of the Government-approved, graduate-nurse programme, which was a direct initiative to reduce our reliance of agency staff.  In essence, given the employment control framework under which we currently operate, there will continue to be a need for agency staff in the health system.</p></speech>

An issue arose in terms of the amount of money that was spent, which is the subject of an internal audit report.  Fire safety regulations were not complied with which would have been had the project been appropriately procured in the first instance with the estates directorate.</p> <p>We have ensured for the benefit of the 18 residents that the facility is as safe as it possibly can be.

We need to understand these figures clearly if we are to have a proper understanding of it and assist in terms of the analysis of the state of the HSE on this issue.

The amount that can be produced in cash terms this year is the cumulative effect of improving the front end processing and turnaround times with consultants.</p></speech>

My point is that taxpayers' money is left unclaimed.  The HSE works on a cash basis - a Vote basis.  It strikes me that there is a fundamental, inherent problem in the billing system.  With the consultant issue, some of the days are out of sync.  The HSE is looking to reduce the days for its own preparation by half, from 44 days to 21 days, to prepare the documentation for the consultant.  It is also looking to reduce the days for the consultant from 44 days to 30 days.  This strikes me as extremely ambitious.</p></speech>

This would have a positive impact.  The HSE has &euro;7 million above profile for the revenue side to date this year.  If the &euro;20 million was brought in, it could have a significant impact on the revenue budget for the HSE.  The problem is that at the end of every year we have these supplementary budgets and not enough is done about looking at how the systems operate within the bodies.  It is within the HSE's grasp and wherewithal to find a minimum of &euro;20 million this year.  How does the HSE propose to do this and what targets has it put in place?  Has the HSE appointed someone to head up a project team to ensure these targets are achieved?</p><p>  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I am concerned about getting value for the taxpayer, but more particularly about ensuring the HSE has the resources to deliver front-line services.  Mr O'Brien would agree that the amount of time taken for a bill to go to the insurance company - 51 days from the time the patient is seen - is unacceptable.  The HSE waits 240 days on average from the date the patient is seen for the money to come in.  That has to have an impact on how the public are treated by the health system.  How will the HSE make these targets?  What benchmarks will be put in place?  What is the timeframe for achieving them?  Has a project team been in place?</p><p>  I hark back again to that &euro;61 million worth of unsigned forms.  Does that refer to forms where the documentation has been handed to the consultant but the consultant has not signed it, or does it relate to internal documentation that the HSE has not prepared so the consultant can sign off on it?</p></speech>

What is at issue is those that are over time.  To maximise inflows of cash, the first thing we need to improve is the preparation of forms for sign-off by consultants.  As we have outlined, one of the critical success factors in those hospitals that have performed best is the electronic claims process.  In terms of claim value, our hospitals have that for approximately 51% of claims.  We have another tranche coming on in July and by the end of the year we want 85% to 90% of hospitals to operate in that space.  That will enable them to reduce the period they require to do this work.</p></speech>

It is self-evident that there is an issue with the consultants, but clearly there is also an issue with the turnaround time within the hospital structures.</p></speech>

That is why we are rolling out a system that has been proven effective in a number of hospitals, to the point at which, by the end of this year, in claim value terms, hospitals that account for 85% to 90% of claim value will operate that electronic claims system. That is the process by which the administrative period before consultant sign-off will be addressed.  It will enable the forms to be provided to consultants more quickly, nearer to the date of care and in accordance with the agreement reached through the Labour Relations Commission.  We will be working with them to turn those claims around within 20 days by the end of this year, although we want to bring the average for this year down to 30 days, bearing in mind there is a transitional process.</p></speech>

There is an income programme group, chaired by Mr. Stephen Mulvany, the current national director of finance, which is working with each hospital to identify the outliers and put in place the appropriate action.  He is unable to be with us today.  Mr. Barry O'Brien is outlining the industrial relations process regarding that and the agreement with the representative bodies.  I must provide a caution, however.  At the end of December 2010, the debtor days tied up in the consultant sign-off were approximately 62, while by December 2011 that had been reduced to 50 and by December 2012 it was down to 44.  However, those improvements have been offset by extended periods on the other side of the line, which we do not control.  So while we must and will do everything we can to reduce the interval on our side, both in the hospital and on the consultant side, there is concern on our side, which we have expressed before, that some of these gains are simply offset by an extension of the period of time taken for the money to be received.</p></speech>

I acknowledge attempts are being made to tackle the difficulties associated with it.  Prescription drugs account for 17% of the overall budget compared to 9% in Britain.  The State pays 50% more than EU average.  The troika has fingered us on this because it sees it as a saving that would impact positively on the people.  The individual cost of some drugs in incredible.  For example, a drug used to treat schizophrenia costs &euro;99.89 in Ireland, while the generic version costs &euro;4.10 in Britain.  A sum of &euro;1 million could have been saved in 2010 if generic cholesterol pills had been prescribed instead of a branded drug.  Why is our drugs bill so high?  Will the measures we are moving towards implementing lead to a significant improvement in reducing the bill?  Will it be brought into line with that in similar EU member states?</p></speech>

Last week we launched a medicines management programme in regard to two categories of drugs - statins and proton pump inhibitors.  One of the factors which has been referenced by Professor Michael Barry, our clinical lead, in this instance is an analysis which shows that for drugs of comparative value in terms of their clinical effectiveness, there is a tendency to prescribe the dearest as opposed to the cheapest.  Therefore, we have engaged in a significant programme of educating both the public and prescribers of the relative value involved.  The aim is to switch prescribing behaviour towards prescribing drugs of equal clinical value but of much lower cost.  There is significant potential in this regard, notwithstanding the fact that it remains the case that 49% of the top ten prescribed drugs by value are generic.  It is not all a negative picture, but there is significant room for cost reductions by enhanced prescribing of generic or lower cost branded drugs.</p> <p>That is one part of the picture.  Another part of the picture is, obviously, related to the market price of drugs in this country.  As the Deputy is aware, the Department of Health in association with the troika is commissioning a study - a comparative study - through the ESRI of the relative costs, which will provide a more informed base for that.  The key issue - the thing we can do most about most quickly - is changing prescriber behaviour and consumer behaviour.  There are significant gains for the health budget, but also for individuals.  In PPIs, for example, last week it was demonstrated that by switching to the lowest cost drug in that category, those who are paying from their own pockets for their drugs could save &euro;300 per annum, with similar things across the spectrum.  So we will be rolling out a whole series of preferred medicine guidance in relation to those things, clinically based through the medicines information centre throughout the course of this year and so far we are having a very positive response to it from prescribers.</p></speech>

It is balanced - negatively balanced - by those drugs that are most expensive also tending to come with the heaviest marketing budgets and consequently that is the name that tends to be in a person's mind when they are considering prescribing.  We also have to recognise that general practitioners operate in fairly pressurised environments - they have a waiting room and they have patients.  At the point at which they are describing what to prescribe, we need to make it as easy as possible for them to know at that point what the cheapest clinically effective option is.  In tandem with this medicines management programme, which is a broadly based thing, we are also developing a desktop system which will enable them from their prescriber screen to see clearly which will be the cheapest alternative.  We are intending to roll that out during the course of this year as well.  So we have to make it as easy as possible for professionals to make the right choice on the basis that by and large that is what they will wish to do.</p></speech>

It is too early to see the hard data, for example, on last week's launch on the PPIs and the statins.  The reaction back to our offices from those who have received the preferred medication guidance has been very positive and in fact numbers of people have encouraged us to consistently do this, do more of it and to be constantly coming out with messages.

I am obviously aware of the speculation that relates to that.  The current arrangements are based on negotiation such as the IPHA deal last year.  Clearly negotiation is a two-way deal.  One can only negotiate someone down to the level they are prepared to negotiate down to.  That having been said, the IPHA deal at the end of last year will produce &euro;400 million over four years that otherwise would not be available through the reduced cost of those drugs.  Further legislative developments such as reference pricing, however, will produce even greater benefits for us when that comes in.</p></speech>

Some of the bigger markets have a bigger range of players and are more attractive to some of the generic off-brand manufacturers than a small market such as Ireland.  So it is difficult to compare the ability of our negotiators simply based on the cost outcome.  When one is negotiating as opposed to legislating, it is a different thing.  As we move towards legislation for reference pricing, that will be a game changer in terms of the price of medications in Ireland.</p></speech>

Clearly we need to have the drugs, but if we could have them at, for example, a 50% reduction it would leave the health services in a much better place financially.  What percentage savings can we expect?</p></speech>

We have done that in order to be conservative and not overly risk-taking.  We have put in place a savings target of &euro;20 million in relation to the medicines management programme, which is relatively modest and should be achievable.  We have not yet built in for the impact of reference pricing because it is not yet legislated for, but we would expect that to have a very significant impact on the cost of drugs.  To be fair, it is worth saying that the average ingredient cost of an item prescribed for the GMS has fallen from a peak of &euro;18.97 in 2009 to a period where year to date in 2013 that is down to &euro;13.43.</p></speech>

There is a way to go, but it is important to stress progress has been made.  Also we are seeing changes, as I said, in prescriber behaviour, which will affect the overall number of prescriptions issued and the move towards always using the preferred drug, which will be the lowest priced clinically effective alternative.</p></speech>

We reimburse based on list price and would not have visibility of these types of two-for-one or three-for-one offers that periodically - or perhaps even more often than periodically - are in play between distributors and prescribers.

These things are done confidentially between retailers and distributors and are against the published list price which is different.  So we are not really in a position to deal in that space.  Again the approach to reference pricing will have a significant impact in that area.  The extent to which this goes on is governed to a large extent by market conditions and market conditions here at present facilitate that type of practice.  A reference-pricing environment will make it much harder for people to play those games.</p></speech>

They are only viable with high list prices.  Within the margin provided by a high list price one can perhaps afford to offer two or three units and still have a positive margin.  That is true of the market in general.  To bring it down to something simple, a packet of ibuprofen-based pain relievers on a high street this side of the Border can cost up to &euro;5 but costs &pound;0.79 in Newry.  A reference pricing environment which brings pricing to the lowest level will not afford the opportunity for multiple units to be supplied in the envelope of what can then be argued is an inflated list price.  There would not be the market conditions for this.</p></speech>

If a private operator has been screwing as much money out of the State as possible, traditionally we have been too compliant because we do not see ourselves as being the State.  I hope we can make progress in this regard because it would be so much more beneficial for all of us and would give the HSE more leeway in perhaps putting money into other areas of the health service.</p></speech>

It is important to stress the reason drugs companies do this is for them market share is a tradeable commodity and goes to the value of their brands, stocks and shares.  That is the incentive for them.  The reason they are able to do it is they can sustain a higher list price within which they can make these swaps.  Once market conditions do not facilitate the maintenance of the higher price, they will not be able to do it anymore.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.428" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013042500017#R02000"><p>Yes.  To recap - I am quoting from the Vote return - on 31 March the position was that we had underspent by &euro;25 million on the capital side and overspent by &euro;7 million on the revenue side, giving a net difference of &euro;18 million.</p></speech>

I ask Mr. O'Brien to reassure me that the &euro;25 million capital underspend is not just lagging behind and that we will not see an advancement.  Is it a timing issue which is presenting the figures in a better light?</p></speech>

I would like to stress that many of the largest savings targets did not fall in the first quarter.  Therefore, while it is a relatively good position to be in, it is not necessarily a predictor of where we will be at the end of the fourth quarter.  We have identified various risks and have spoken about some of them.</p></speech>

Will Mr. O'Brien explain how this occurred?  How can the Oireachtas specifically pass measures and Ministers herald the fact that &euro;35 million has been ring-fenced for mental health services, with significant detail provided on what it will result in, and then read on the front page of a national newspaper that a large part of it will not go anywhere near mental health services?</p></speech>

However, the recruitment process was not capable of putting all of the staff in posts sufficiently early to be able to absorb the &euro;35 million in pay costs.  In part, this was because the overall headcount reduction required last year meant the position taken was that progress needed to be seen on the downward trend in the existing headcount before recruitment could commence for these posts.  Inevitably, this meant the posts would not be filled by year end.  There was what is known as a time-related saving with regard to these posts.  In other words, the money provided was sufficient for the full year cost but the full-year cost of the staff did not arise.  The money was used in mental health services but not for these posts.</p></speech>

We are in the process of recruiting to fill a significant number of these posts and some of the personnel were in place by the end of the year.  A total of 338 of the posts have been filled; another 40 personnel are on their way in the door and offers have been made to four more candidates.  We cannot fill 20 posts.</p> <p>We are waiting on the next cohort of psychology students to finish college in June.  We are awaiting documentation in the case of a further post.  The majority of posts will be filled.  An additional &euro;35 million has been provided for posts that are commencing in 2013.</p></speech>

We are completing last year's recruitment of posts and are already progressing this year's posts, even in advance of securing the other reductions that are required to balance our overhead.  We need a swing of 4,000 to accommodate these posts, but we are not waiting for that to be delivered.  There is an element of risk in terms of compliance with our ceiling requirements, but if we did not do it, we would produce the same result as last year's and we would not have a reasonable chance of recruiting for the posts in the year for which the money was provided.  There will likely be a time-related saving, as we will not have all of the staff in post for the full year, but the money in question will still be available for mental health.</p></speech>

The issue of agency staff was mentioned.  Can we have the figures?  The information that we have been given may be different to that provided to Mr. Barry O'Brien.  According to the information that is available to me, the agency costs were 10% higher this January at &euro;18.9 million than they were in the previous January and 6% higher than the 2012 monthly average.  Is this the case?  Regardless, what is the current position in terms of agency staffing compared with this time last year?</p></speech>

The HSE is being told to reduce its numbers and, therefore, it must take on agency staff.  However, there is an issue of credibility.  The 2012 service plan did not reach its target.  This year's service plan alludes to a reduction but does not set a target.  Has the issue been included just to make a reference to it?</p></speech>

We referenced another issue with agency staff in our March report on the HSE, namely, the number of retired and former HSE employees who are back working in the health service as agency staff.  We have pursued this issue with a number of Departments.  For example, the Department of Education and Skills can tell us that there is only this or that percentage of such staff.  It can be specific.  It can even identify which schools are using retired teachers for substitute work.

It was a recommendation of our report.  It seems logical.  Everyone has a PPS number.  Many medical graduates, for example, nurses, are leaving college and trying to get employment.  If staff have taken incentivised leave from the public service and are returning as agency staff, they are receiving public sector pensions and public sector wages simultaneously.  This is an issue and it has been clear Government policy not to do it.</p></speech>

We face a challenge.  An agency can provide health care staff to various users that are not directly under the HSE.

We have indicated to the agencies that we do not want to be offered staff who have already retired from our services.</p></speech>

The witnesses may not be in a position to answer today.  A matter was mentioned in our report but has not been included in their briefing note on the recommendations arising from that report.  We recommended that, when signing a contract with agencies, the HSE ask them to include people's PPS numbers, thus enabling the HSE to carry out its policy.  This is an important issue.  At a time when we are reducing numbers, people are leaving college seeking employment in the health service and should not be deprived because of someone who is earning a second income.  If the witnesses considered this matter and reverted to us at a future meeting, I would be grateful.</p><p>  Turning to our report, Mr. Tony O'Brien told the committee in October: "I believe that the absence of contemporary accounting systems - unified accounting systems of the type one would expect to see in an organisation of this size and complexity - is a significant contributory factor to that challenge".  He was referring to budgetary and financial management.  Appropriately, he made the point that everyone was viewing the health service at a time of declining budgets and was trying to attribute all of its financial and budgetary problems to same.  However, the HSE has rarely, if ever, lived within budget.  I listened to Mr. Tony O'Brien and read the briefing notes.  How many legacy systems is the HSE still depending on?  How would he like to see a unified approach progressing?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.474" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013042500019#T00700"><p>The desired outcome for everybody would be a unified system rather than many legacy systems.</p><p>  I would like to make a couple of other points.  Politicians expect agencies such as the HSE to set targets.  However, on review, it is evident that no hospital has reached them.  One example is the accident and emergency targets set for last year.  The target set for discharge and admittance within six hours of registration was 95%, but this was achieved by only 67.3% of hospitals.  The target discharge or admittance within nine hours to be met by 100% of hospitals was achieved by only 64.4%.  As such, no hospital reached either of these targets.  Is the HSE setting targets that are deliberately over-ambitious or does it genuinely believe they are achievable?  Most people would like to believe that when they attend an accident and emergency unit at any hospital, they will be seen and discharged or admitted within nine hours.  However, not one hospital managed to achieve thie target.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.475" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013042500019#T00800"><p>The Deputy is correct.  There is significant room for improvement in the performance of emergency departments.  The targets are set based on where, from a quality point of view, we need to get to.  It would be wrong to set a target which, if achieved, would not get one to where one needs to be.  Based on experience in other countries and what the evidence shows us, in terms of what would be a good-appropriate experience, in an ideal world we would be moving towards a target of 100% within six hours.  For example, up until recently in the United Kingdom there was a four hour target.</p><p>  What we have seen is the impact of the targets, including the intermediate targets for trolley numbers and so on three times a day.  The work of the special delivery unit has been to bring a slightly different focus to the urgency attached to improving patient experience time in emergency departments.  While these targets have not been met throughout the year, there was a significant improvement in terms of the number of patients recorded on trolleys and so on.  In recent weeks, owing to the matters we discussed earlier, the situation has disimproved and we have had to take particular actions to try to improve it.  Nonetheless, it remains appropriate to set as a target what would in truth be the acceptable level of performance and seek to move incrementally towards it.  Clearly, 67.5% is not an acceptable outcome.  What it tends to hide is the extent to which there have been improvements in processes and flows in individual emergency departments.</p></speech>

I have read the HSE's note on the issue.  I recall that when we discussed it previously with Mr. O'Brien's predecessor, there was a huge variance in where there was absenteeism, both in terms of geographic location and, more interestingly, job descriptions.  As I recall, the level of absenteeism among doctors was low, while among nurses it was slightly higher but, again, very low.  However, it was dramatically high in some areas, reaching almost double digits, among grades and positions within the health service and in some parts of administration.  Can Mr. O'Brien give a breakdown of the current level of absenteeism?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.479" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013042500019#T01200"><p>That information is published in our performance reports.

The Deputy is correct in his recollection that the level of absenteeism in the medical-dental area remains the lowest.</p></speech>

The level of absenteeism among nurses is 5.3%; among health and social care professionals, 4.27%; among management-administration staff, 4.75%; among general support staff, 5.52%; and among other patient and care clients, 5.44%.  Equally, almost 90% of all absences are certified.  There is a proactive management process in place for the management of attendance across the service.  It is identified as an issue that needs constant management.  We have made incremental progress and the level of absenteeism has stabilised at 4.8%.  While a target of 3.5% has been set as the norm, the current absentee level compares well with other 365 day, 24-7 services, particularly in Britain and Northern Ireland.  The level has reduced from a high of 7% in 2008 to 4.79% today.</p></speech>

I will be brief as I am due to speak next in the D&aacute;il on a Bill.  </p><p>  I would like to focus on a number of areas but will commence by returning to the issue of the payment of consultants and the delays in this regard.  In Mr. O'Brien's view, what is the reason for the delay in consultants signing off on forms?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013042500019#T01800"><p>I suspect the reasons are variable among the different categories of consultant.  One reason could be a lack of understanding of the negotiated agreement, while another may be that for them individually, signing the forms triggers a process which will have income flowing to them and the hospital.  They may be insufficiently motivated in that direction or there may be timing considerations for them, which could relate to a number of extraneous factors.  I do not believe there is any badness or malice involved.  I believe it is question of understanding the importance to the public service of having the benefit of that positive cashflow.  In some instances, it probably relates to the wide range of demands on their time and seeking to motivate them to give sufficient priority to this issue, as opposed to the other aspects of their work which they may believe are more important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.485" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1007" speakername="Paschal Donohoe" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013042500019#T01900"><p>I agree that it is unlikely there is any badness or malice involved.  However, this does influence when they are paid.  If a consultant knows that signing a particular document will influence when he or she will be paid, it will be a reasonably influential factor in how he or she allocates his or her time.</p> <p>There is a clear pattern as many of the consultants, until the progress demonstrated today, were waiting a very long time to sign these forms.</p></speech>

Those with the right to private practice generally speaking protect the right and those who do not have the right are in many instances jealous of that right.  It would be strange for people, having done the treatment, not to take the next step, which enables the private health insurance company to provide the financial reward for the work.</p></speech>

Having done the work, why would these people not look to be paid for it?  I can imagine for a cohort of people, payment could be a secondary matter.  For the magnitude of delay, it is striking that so many decide not to get paid quickly.</p></speech>

The agreement reached through the Labour Relations Commission is an important part of the process under way in each location, with discussion support to the outliers as part of that.  In the round, we are seeing progress, and I am most interested in that.  Clearly, there are many outliers on which we must focus.</p></speech>

I have no experience of this in the pharmaceutical industry but I do have significant experience of the practice in the supply of goods to retailers.  If we are not tracking it at our end in how the State purchases goods, does it not mean that the people from whom we buy goods are receiving quite a significant margin increase?  My understanding is we buy the goods from a distributor.</p></speech>

The manufacturer will supply the goods to the distributor.  If there is promotional activity going on to influence the price at which the distributor buys the goods, the margin the distributor is receiving off the price at which the State is buying the goods is significantly enhanced.  That is the case if the goods are being received at a promotional or discounted price.</p></speech>

There are a couple of specific topics I wish to deal with, with one having been discussed already.  The drugs and medicines bills is one of the biggest items of expenditure.  The EU and IMF, as part of the troika, is looking to examine this issue, and the use of generics, because the HSE is spending 17% of its budget on medicines, which is double the percentage in the UK.  Many of the items cost more than 50% more than the European average.  As an example, Zyprexa is used to combat schizophrenia; it is &euro;99.89 in Ireland but the generic version is available in the UK for &euro;4.  The Irish version is approximately 25 times that price.</p><p>  Everybody in the HSE, the community at large and at the EU, Government and IMF level knows we pay too much for medicine.  How are these prices arrived at?  Who from the HSE sits in with the senior executive from international drug companies to decide pricing?  Will the witnesses describe such a meeting and the level of people representing the Irish taxpayer at that meeting?  Who would be on the other side of the table?  Would they be senior sales people from companies, many of whose turnover would be bigger than Ireland's GNP?  I want to be assured that there is a balance of strength at the table.  Who are these people and what are their grades?  From where would they come and what would be their commercial experience in dealing with the biggest multinationals in the world?  How are these prices set in meetings with representatives of the manufacturers?</p></speech>

The HSE representatives do not meet with people from the manufacturers of drugs but rather the industry puts up a front.  It pays for an association to speak to the HSE.  Are there separate discussions?  I am worried that if the big manufacturers have a cosy committee representing it, they will only seek to protect the cartel.  Does the HSE and Department not have a one-to-one discussion with people from individual companies.  We could be writing cheques to them for &euro;500 million, &euro;600 million or &euro;700 million.  Are the meetings with intermediaries?</p></speech>

It is the start of the problem.  We are now beginning to establish that the Department of Health and HSE does not negotiate and talk turkey on a one-to-one basis with individual companies.  We are operating through a federation or committee that the manufacturers have put together to speak to representatives.  It will hold an industry line.</p> <p>I am shocked at the amount of money.  Do the witnesses understand that this intermediary group is preventing them from talking turkey with the individual companies whose products they are buying?  We will move on.  I ask the witnesses to change their procedure and not to negotiate with intermediaries any more, but deal with the companies whose products they are buying.</p></speech>

I want to know the process.  I am not interested in the reductions yet.  The IMF, European Commission and the European Central Bank have adjudicated, if adjudication was needed, that we are not getting proper value for money.  The process that has led us to the deals we are getting is not satisfactory from the taxpayer's point of view.  Those bodies have decided that, although we have been saying it in this committee all the time.  The witness will tell us that they got 20%, 10% or 5% off, but we are still paying too much.  I gave one example.  The HSE is paying 24 times the price of what an equivalent product can be purchased for 90 miles up the road.  I think the reason we have not been getting value for money at all is that the witnesses have never spoken to the companies on a one-to-one basis, where the HSE is locked into a room and tells the company that if it does not provide the product at a certain price, the HSE will talk to another company.  I do not understand it.  One would not buy a car the way the HSE is doing this.  It is like going to the Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, and asking it to get one a good deal on a car.  The SIMI is there to represent its members.  One will never get a deal if one is dealing through a trade association or body.</p><p>  We will move on from that.  Will the witnesses tell me the grade of the people - I do not need to know the names - representing the Irish taxpayer at these meetings as opposed to the representatives of companies whose turnover is bigger than Ireland's GNP?  What is their grade and what level of commercial experience do they have?  I am trying to find out what happens in the room where these prices are fixed.  I believe there is not an equality of negotiating ability.</p></speech>

I do not need the person's name.  This is not personal.  From my point of view, this is going from bad to worse.

I was trying to establish the process of who talks to whom in the companies.  We have established that the HSE does not even talk to the suppliers directly, but through an intermediary.  Does anybody from the Government's new procurement office in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform lead these talks?  What is that office's role?  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, tells us there is a new procurement office across the public service.  What is its role with regard to this topic?</p></speech>

There is legislation going through the D&aacute;il on the pricing of supplies of medicines.  It is nearly completed.  If this legislation is passed, has the HSE calculated how much savings there will be?  The Oireachtas is anxious to pass this legislation as it will allow the HSE to secure savings in its drugs and medicines bill.  Before the legislation was drafted I am sure somebody proposed that if this new legislation was in place it would be possible to achieve X amount of savings.  What savings can be achieved if this legislation is passed or what case did somebody put about the savings to be made?</p></speech>

We would have been engaged in modelling various scenarios for the impact on our overall drugs expenditure of various scales of reduction in the price of drugs.  That information is available to the Department and used by it in making the policy decisions, which are the responsibility of the Department and the Ministers rather than the HSE.</p></speech>

We suggested with regard to PPIs that a switch to the lowest cost drug would have a value in excess of &euro;10 million in a full year in one drug category, and that reference pricing should relate to the lowest cost-effective drug.  In other words, we believe the preferred medicines programme we now have in place should be a basis for reference pricing in the future.  One can go through every drug category.  One would not be able to switch all patients because there are issues of tolerance and acceptability, so there has to be discretion at the margins.  However, it is possible to calculate in every drug category what the effect of a major switch towards the lowest cost branded or generic drug would be.  That type of information is available to the Department.</p></speech>

If there are serious savings to be made for the taxpayer, it is in everybody's interest that the legislation is finalised as quickly as possible.</p><p>  I will move to the issue of waiting times for first appointments for outpatients.  There are 388,000 people waiting for such appointments.  Is that up or down or a good figure?  It is a phenomenal number of people.  Will the witness put the figure in context?</p></speech>

That overall figure is being subjected to validation.  In other words, we would expect to find within that total persons who have already had their first appointment at another location or who have perhaps moved location.  There is likely to be significant duplication within that, so the process of validation will have a significant impact.  One of the reasons for putting the time and energy into developing a single consolidated view was to facilitate that type of process.  That then allows us to put in a primary target list to enable chronological provision of appointments, subject to clinical need, and to take that forward.  In context, each month approximately 160,000 outpatient appointments arise in our system.  That would be a mix of first and follow-up appointments.</p></speech>

Within that list, therefore, one will find some patients who will have been listed for more than four years for certain procedures.  Some of them will have had those appointments elsewhere but others will genuinely have been waiting, orthopaedics being one example.  The purpose of the list is to identify the longest waiters so we target resources at them and, as with the inpatient and day case, progressively eliminate long waits and ultimately bring down the longest acceptable wait.</p></speech>

It is an unusual one, but I picked it up in Appendix 3 on page 195, the last page of the accounts.  It is a figure of &euro;18,262,000 for security.</p> <p>I understand why one needs security in hospitals as there can be difficult, troublesome and violent patients and patients who need to be separated.  I am sure the garda&iacute; need to be called on occasion.  Will Mr. Woods give me a breakdown on how that &euro;18 million is tendered?  Does each group of hospitals do its own?  Is it done centrally?  Does a security firm in Cork look after the Cork hospitals and a security firm in Galway look after the Galway hospitals?  Are there local arrangements and local contractors or is there central purchasing?  What arrangements are in place?  Some &euro;18 million is a large figure.  It is unfortunate that we have to spend this money; let us be clear about that.</p></speech>

Fundamentally, the Deputy asked if it is contracted locally or if it is negotiated at some higher level, but I will have to come back on that.</p></speech>

Somebody contacted me in regard to the security contract for the Limerick group of hospitals, involving the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, the Mid-Western Regional Maternity Hospital and St. John's Hospital.  I am sure the contract is for &euro;1 million or more.  I was told the company that has the contract got it in 2005 for a three-year period.  It got a one-year extension to 2009 and a further one-year extension to 2010.  However, the contract has not been put out to tender since.  I hope there are not people without tendered contracts.  When the HSE is giving us the note on security, it might specifically cover the Limerick group of hospitals.</p><p>  Could we have a note on what is in that framework contract in regard to general security demand at front doors and special security arrangements?  I am sure situations blow up in hospitals.  People will know that at busy weekends, extra people are needed in addition to the standard complement.  Will the HSE explain the framework and how it works, with particular reference to the issue I raised?</p><p>  I wish to move on to home care packages.  I refer to the accounts for 2011 and supporting older people.  A total of 15,270 people benefited from the home care package at some point during the year.  In the Revised Estimates for 2013 published last week, that figure has been reduced to 10,870, a reduction of 30%.  Why has there been such a reduction in the number of home care packages?  They are for elderly and disabled people whom we are trying to keep at home.  Is it any wonder there is a waiting list for the fair deal scheme and people in acute hospitals when the HSE has cut the number of home care packages from over 15,000 to just over 10,000 for the current year?  It is a massive reduction.  Why did the HSE single out that area for a 30% cut?  We all know there are reductions everywhere.</p></speech>

We said the totality of the budget available in 2012 would be the same available for home care packages in 2013.  Given that we did not achieve our full target, it will be an increase in 2013.  The number of people benefiting can depend on the duration for which a person can have a package, but the totality of the money has not been reduced in 2013 for home care packages.</p></speech>

At the end of a year, one can look back and see how many people had the benefit of those packages.  That will depend on the length of time.  In other words, these packages are recycled.

In the same period, the HSE reduced the number of home help hours from 11.1 million in 2011 to 10.3 million in 2013, which is a 10% reduction.  The elderly and people who are ill at home are bearing a disproportionate cut when one looks at the home care packages and at the home help hours.  The number of people in receipt of home help hours has been reduced somewhat.  There is a disproportionate cut in those two areas for elderly people in their homes.</p></speech>

Coming from the midlands, I am conscious that a number of people must be transported from midland hospitals and other hospitals to Dublin.  Some of the vehicles used are not wheelchair-accessible.  Would the HSE not have a standard policy?  One cannot get a new taxi licence nowadays if the vehicle is not wheelchair-accessible.  The response I received from the HSE the other day to a parliamentary question was that the patient could bring his or her fold-up wheelchair on the bus if he or she could carry it on.  I was shocked that the HSE would give out contracts in this day and age for patients, many of whom could be orthopaedic patients, whose basic requirement is that transport be wheelchair-accessible.  Does Mr. O'Brien agree with that?</p></speech>

The whole issue of patient transport services is up for re-procurement and will be progressed in the context of discussions with the newly established National Procurement Service.  The overall category of transport services is to be addressed across the entire public sector and those discussions have begun.  However, I would have to say I agree with the Deputy that patient transport should be wheelchair-accessible.</p></speech>

There is a write-off of bad debts in the accounts.  I am not sure if the figure is &euro;14 million or &euro;15 million but why would the HSE be writing off money it is owed?  The people who owe money include those who have not paid accident and emergency charges, among other things.  How much of the debt on the balance sheet is over one year old?  We have talked about days and weeks for the consultants to put their claims in but I am equally concerned about money that is owing to the HSE for over one or two years that the executive might never see.  How much was written off and what is the mechanism for writing off bad debts?  Can we do anything to collect some of the money that is owing?</p></speech>

That level is set at &euro;30,000 per individual incident.</p></speech>

It is hard enough to get money in.  When it is in the accounts and has to be written off as uncollectible, one must ask whether it should have been in the accounts in the first place or perhaps the issue is a lack of effort made to collect the debt.  People will not get away with not paying their property tax.  If An Post started writing off all of its debts for unpaid television licences, nobody would pay for a licence.  There must be some mechanism in place to ensure that people cannot just walk away from their debts to the HSE, with the executive then writing off those debts after a given period.</p></speech>

I ask the witnesses to outline the scenario there and while they are gathering the information, I wish to ask one final question on legal costs.  There appears to be &euro;80 million in the accounts for the State Claims Agency.  This is an issue that we raise regularly.  Everyone here is probably aware of the case in the courts last week which resulted in a settlement of &euro;1.4 million for an eight year old girl who suffered severe injuries at birth.  The HSE admitted liability but I wish to know what lessons can be learned so that we can avoid such absolutely avoidable problems.  The court heard that three publicly appointed consultant obstetricians at the hospital were on holiday and a locum consultant obstetrician was on duty.  The HSE accepted responsibility for not having the appropriate people on site.  Who is running a hospital where the only three obstetricians can go on holidays at the same time?  Surely there should be better management of staff than that.</p><p>  I have a list of four of five of these types of cases, which I will not go through now because I am sure the witnesses are well aware of them.  My main concern is to ensure that lessons are being learned from cases of negligence.  I also worry that all such cases are going to the State Claims Agency because that means that the HSE simply writes a cheque for several million euro every few months, depending on when the settlements come through.  It should be a bit more painful for the HSE to have to pay out such sums and in that way, it would learn lessons more quickly.  I accept that there will always be cases where something goes wrong and for the people affected, no money will ever compensate them for the lifelong injuries they suffered or the life-changing events they went through.  However, I am worried that lessons are not being learned.  </p><p>  I ask the witnesses to give us a figure for the number of cases on hand at the end of the year and the estimate of the eventual cost.  According to the accounts, the HSE is making settlements to the tune of between &euro;70 million and &euro;90 million each year.  I know the State Claims Agency takes the process out of the hands of the HSE, but what kind of risk assessment is done each year by the board and the risk managers employed by the executive?  Is there an analysis done of the cases settled to ascertain whether there are common threads running through them, in order to ensure that certain avoidable risks are not recurring?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.570" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2013042500023#X00800"><p>Every case that results in significant harm to any individual is regrettable and a tragedy for that individual and his or her family.  The State Claims Agency operates in the wider public interest in the way that it approaches claims and in its efforts to bring down the overall cost to the taxpayer of meeting these liabilities as they arise.  Some of the claims referenced by the Deputy are, by their nature, aged because they have resulted in court proceedings over a number of years.  The point of learning is actually much closer to the adverse event than the issue of settlement.  One of those cases mentioned by the Deputy goes back to 2004.  In each instance of an adverse clinical event an appropriate review is carried out, under the auspices of either the local or national incident team, depending on the seriousness of that event.   Through a clinical governance process, led by a director of quality and patient safety, the HSE ensures that the maximum learning is derived as near as possible to the time of the adverse event rather than waiting until later on.  The risk management process is very much focused on learning from these events as they arise.  The Deputy has instanced a case where there were clear opportunities for learning at that time.  While the overall settlement issue is something that is kept under review, the focus of learning is much earlier.</p></speech>

When does the HSE decide that an adverse medical event is such?  The HSE can only learn from such events at the time of their occurrence, rather than four years later when there is a case before the courts.  I would have thought that if the executive believed that an adverse medical event had occurred, leading to an injury to a patient, it would issue an apology to the person concerned at that point and would not wait for five years to apologise, when the case is before the High Court.  Would it not be better not to give barristers a few hundred thousand euro each, on both sides, for four years or more while the State Claims Agency does its job?  The HSE could cut that &euro;866 million bill in half if it took action as soon as the adverse medical event was confirmed, rather than waiting for four or five years.  Most people who go through a difficult experience in a hospital want to know what actually happened and who was responsible.  They want somebody to admit they made a mistake and to say sorry.  We have seen that many times.  The word "sorry", if uttered genuinely, could save a fortune.  If people were up front and put their hands up, within weeks or months of the event, some of the cases might not proceed to court at all.  How many of these cases of adverse medical events are prevented from proceeding to court through proper people management?</p></speech>

Many of these cases result in larger settlements because of significant lifetime needs arising from the adverse incident.  It is unlikely that they will go away, particularly in a case where there has been a major adverse consequence from surgery, or a failure to provide appropriate treatment which has resulted in significant harm and additional care needs.  We need to have a situation where the health service is confident enough to be honest with patients about what has happened.  That is the thrust of the work of our clinical governance system that is ongoing.  Many of the cases coming to court predate the contemporary approach to these issues.  There is a necessary timelag with these cases because it takes time for the true need to materialise in order that an appropriate award can be made.</p></speech>

Are the people concerned not covered by private insurance and is it the case that they cannot afford to pay?  How are write-offs made?  When does the HSE stop chasing people for the money?  If a person ignores a bill for long enough, will the HSE go away?</p></speech>

Some of them are technical.  If someone is admitted through an accident and emergency department and pays a charge, but it subsequently turns out to be a notifiable infectious disease, the charge may have been invalidly raised or it could turn out to be the case subsequently that the person has a medical card.  There is also discretion under legislation for the HSE to write off a debt in cases of extreme hardship and there are such examples.  In the case of road traffic accidents, if people do not pursue a case, the HSE does not seek the cost, but it may have been recorded.  There are technical reasons, including hardship and reaching a figure of 12 months, we make provision against a debt.  However, we continue to seek to collect it.

As I listened to some of the representatives of the HSE, they do not have some of the figures because they are not readily available.  Given the amount of manual work involved, surely it is a priority for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to sanction some business plan to allow this system to be put in place?</p></speech>

It has been a priority of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform since 2006 to encourage the HSE to bring forward proposals to put in place a single national financial management system.  We have had engagements during the years to encourage this.  A proposal emerged and when various technical issues were raised from time to time, the proposals tended to revert back to the HSE and the Department of Health for clarification and elaboration.  The most recent proposal, on which there has been engagement with CMOD, is a different technical solution and approach to the proposal that was on the table up to 2010.  Apart from exhorting and expressing the same concerns the committee would express about the management of information, we cannot force the HSE and Department of Health to produce a product.  When they produce products, we engage with them and evaluate the products presented.</p></speech>

It was considered by the committee about a year and a half ago.  In reference to the comments made, the structural arrangements within the health environment are changing and our proposals need to reflect these amendments. Meeting the underlying requirement for a single processing engine for the HSE is in our collective interests in dealing with the committee in terms of the health environment and in reporting to the Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p></speech>

I read in a report that the HSE has approximately 70,000 vendors - people who provide goods and services to it.  Most of the answers given today, in response to the aged debt issue that was raised by Deputy O'Donnell and other matters, would be on the tip of the tongue of most people in the commercial world.  They would need to have that knowledge at their fingertips.  The HSE does not function in that way, for some reason.  Mr. O'Brien and his officials have to understand how the members of this committee grow tired of the same argument - that no proper system of accounting, analysis or management is in place - being put again and again.  The public is growing tired of it too.</p><p>  I read somewhere that the SAP system runs right across some of the eight or nine centres of accountability.  It appears from my analysis that while it might not be possible to buy it off the shelf, it has been checked and used by commercial entities all over the world.  If this software product has been identified, it should not be beyond the HSE to arrange for it to be applied.  I do not suggest this is the solution.  I do not know.  I know it is being used in some parts of the organisation.  Surely Mr. Heffernan's department wants to see this resolved.  The sooner that is done, the better.  Our report mentions it.</p><p>  I am not content merely to produce a report, lay it before the Houses and give a copy of it to Mr. O'Brien in the HSE.  We want to see some action on foot of it.  Quite frankly, I do not consider his replies today to amount to a great deal of action.  It does not appear to me that he is greatly exercised by it.  I would hope that he would be.  I am not making this directly personal to anybody.  It is frustrating that two big organisations - the Department and the HSE - do not seem to be getting to grips with a huge problem that is mentioned time and again in reports.  There is no clear pathway to defining the cost, getting the product, putting it in place and getting the problem sorted out.  I ask that the report be taken seriously and that the matter be dealt with by the HSE and the Department.  We can revisit it when the witnesses are here at a future date.</p><p>  I would like to touch on the matter of payroll.  How much does it cost the section in question to deliver payroll to the HSE?</p></speech>

Just over 200 individuals are working in payroll.  I estimate that the total cost is just over &euro;20 million.  I would like to come back to the committee with a precise figure.  Not all of the figure relates to people.  Some of it relates to system cost.</p></speech>

Has a comparison ever been made between the cost of providing the payroll system in-house and the cost of a commercial solution that might be outsourced?  It costs approximately &euro;22 million for over 200 people to provide it in-house.  I know there is a problem in this regard because of the Croke Park agreement.</p></speech>

We have looked at the differentials in cost and at the capacity to have a single payroll nationally.  Before we talk about how the HSE payroll is delivered, the first objective is to have a single payroll running nationally.  We would get value from that in terms of the numbers I have mentioned.  There could be staffing amalgamations, etc.  Further potential financial savings arise when one compares outsourced and insourced solutions.</p></speech>

That would be the biggest single gain.  There would also be a big intelligence gain.  It is rather like the point the Chairman made previously about a single national financial system.

It was discovered that there was some adherence to the rule - I will not say there was little or no adherence to it - across the sector.  Has that changed?  I have looked at Tallaght Hospital, for example.  If we went back to that scene again, would the HSE get a lot of change in there today, as distinct from what was found when HIQA spoke about this?</p></speech>

There have been wholesale changes in its governance arrangements.  There has been a significant restructuring of the board.  The changes in the way the hospital is managed at an operational level have brought about significant improvements in the whole spectrum of activities within the hospital.</p></speech>

That has been done right across the hospitals.  We have a comprehensive scheduling initiative in relation to the issue of quality and safety.  It is one of the areas that is monitored by the managers as part of their monthly review.  We have stipulated that at least ten meetings must be held by senior management with senior managers of organisations that are over a threshold value.  We have also stipulated certain guidance with regard to who needs to be in attendance at such meetings to ensure all the relevant information is available and to make sure appropriate management of the arrangement and the funds that are given to the organisation takes place.</p></speech>

We plan to enhance it further in the cases of organisations we fund to the tune of over &euro;20 million.  That is where we are starting it at this point in time.  We are going to have a centralised approach to the management of some of those arrangements not in the hospital sector but in the disability sector.</p></speech>

Recently, I had to submit a parliamentary question to try to extract the information, despite the fact it was promised at a meeting of Oireachtas Members.  I suggest to Mr. O'Brien this is an area that should be examined in terms of savings.  Much of the information for both the Oireachtas parliamentary question system and the HSE system should be held locally or centrally and it should be easier to get the information provided in a more timely fashion for Members.</p></speech>

A further report related to the HSE's internal audit and findings.  Will Mr. O'Brien comment on these?  With regard to the internal audit having found various problems within the system throughout the country, have these problems been addressed?  I would like to go into more detail on this, but will not do so today.  Is there a mechanism within the HSE for a rapid response to the queries raised in the newspaper article or in the HSE report?  Will Mr. O'Brien tell us whether there will be cutbacks because of the cash reserves people have?</p></speech>

Every internal audit report has a set of recommendations and these are coded in the normal way as to severity.  These are first processed in their setting and every report is also considered centrally by the national management team in terms of the applicability of what has been found and the lessons to be drawn for the entire system.  Also, on an exception basis, reports are brought to the board, depending on their universal applicability.  The internal audit function then follows up to establish whether the recommendations are being complied with.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, I have taken steps to further strengthen the internal audit function, including the use of outsourced audit personnel, specifically to beef up our capacity with regard to section 38 and section 38 issues.</p><p>  With regard to the accumulation of surpluses by voluntary bodies, clearly there is room for discussion if the level of funding we are providing is contributing to a situation in which large surpluses are being developed by any voluntary body.  We would be obliged to examine the extent to which that should be taken into account in the award of public funding to that body, given the overall constraints that apply to us.  This applies to both larger and smaller voluntary bodies.</p></speech>

A report is presented to the Cabinet on an ongoing basis, which sets out the totality of the savings to be delivered under Croke Park I, such as the &euro;106 million.  A significant level of savings is also to be delivered from the Primary Care Reimbursement Service, PCRS.   The troika was interested in hearing how we are delivering those savings.  They were very interested in hearing about the savings on drugs and the potential for further savings in that area.  They were also interested in the ESRI report and this was the subject of a separate meeting before the general meeting in regard to finances.</p><p>  Our message on the finance side was that we are currently on track in terms of the moneys for this quarter, but that there are significant challenges in terms of the savings to be delivered over the course of the next month.  However, we were delivering on target and adhering to the programme we had set out.</p></speech>

Clearly, the troika has some wider policy objectives, which relate in particular to the price of medicines discussion we had here today, and it also has views on input and labour costs.  The interaction between the HSE and the troika is very much focused on the discussion of how service plan is progressing, particularly from a financial point of view.</p></speech>

It was mentioned earlier that it was a case of hardship.  Most of those people are suffering hardship.  They have been approved for 24/7 care in a home and their families are anxious they get that.

To reiterate, the important interrelationship between this current temporary change and the acceleration of 400 additional places, over and above the normal number of places that would have been released in March, means there is nobody who would have been in a place this month who is not already in that place.  They have got those places sooner than would have otherwise arisen.  This was essentially motivated by the same concerns, to keep the system flowing in the interest of patient care.</p></speech>

The first item we are dealing with is the minutes of the meeting of 28 March.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  There is a presentation from Dr. Alyne Elizabeth Delaney and Dr. Stephen Hynes, so I welcome Dr. Delaney from the innovative fisheries management research centre at Aalborg University in Denmark and Dr. Hynes from the socioeconomic marine research unit at the National University of Ireland, Galway.  I thank them for taking the time to travel and giving their time to be here this morning.</p><p>  The sub-committee wants to get an academic view and we are all aware of the various reports carried out by the witnesses, some of which relate to the issues this sub-committee has identified for discussion.  We look forward to hearing their views.  As the witnesses may be aware, the joint sub-committee was established to focus on the community's socioeconomic position and promoting sustainable industry; the main industries identified by the sub-committee are aquaculture, island and coastal fisheries, inshore fisheries and specifically angling, as well as tourism.</p><p>  Before beginning I draw the witnesses' attention to the matter of privilege.  By virtue of section 17(2)<i>(l)</i> of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call on Dr. Delaney to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>

As members may know, I am an anthropologist who has worked in fisheries management and coastal community development in Europe for approximately ten years.  I am also a scientific expert for the European Commission's scientific, technical and economic committee for fisheries.</p> <p>In my research, I approach this from the aspect of an anthropologist who is interested in people and culture and who is also interested in trying to find ways to get social science data into the management process.  I must offer my apologies.  We have had some IT security issues so my presentation is not available on the screen but we have made some photocopies so, hopefully, the members will be able to follow it.</p><p> Basically, in much of my work I am very interested in social sustainability.  When I think of society and the social aspects, I think of communities and people.  As one finds with biological diversity, it is the richness and diversity of the communities that help make the society strong.  The committee might have requested my presence today due to one of the reports I wrote with some people in Arranmore.  In that report I talked a good deal about how a number of EU policies and directives now call for integrated management.  In the past, much of the management carried out was very much on a sectoral basis, such as fisheries and transport.  At European Union level and in many places in the United States there is a movement towards integrating that.  It is not just fisheries or economics, for example, but economics, social and the environmental aspects integrated together.  The work I am trying to do is concerned with social, economic and environmental sustainability.  In the report we talked about Arranmore.  It is an island community and we discussed how there are policies and conventions which call for a special consideration of island communities.</p><p> With regard to policy and the concept of social sustainability, some of the specific policies I have worked with and researched include the marine strategy framework directive, the integrated maritime policy and the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, which is currently being revised.  Hopefully, there will be a final outcome soon.  These directives and the CFP try to integrate the conservation of the fish stocks with sustainable communities.  It is a priority of the maritime policy to integrate economic and social well being in a sustainable way.  For somebody like me who is conducting research into communities and social sustainability, one issue is how to go about achieving sustainability goals.  One way to look at it is through impact assessments.  The principles of impact assessment often help policy makers avoid unintentionally creating some inequities among various sub-groups.  When one looks at island and coastal communities, for example, people from the outside might think of fishermen or the shore side sector.  There are numerous sub-groupings.  A decision that might impact the pelagic fisheries is different for the coastal fisheries.  When I carry out community profiles and social impact assessments, one of the key things I focus on is understanding who all the relevant sub-groups are and not to miss any of them, so one can at least be informed when one makes a decision and not indirectly impact a group simply out of ignorance because one did not know it was there and how it might be impacted.</p><p> A social impact assessment is a systematic appraisal of the quality of life of the persons and the communities whose environment might be affected by the policy changes it is planned to make.  When one talks about the quality of life, one looks at the daily way in which the people live, work, relate to each other, organise to meet their needs and basically just cope as members of the society.  It is a question of how the policy impacts them in their daily lives.  Often, when one hears about social impact assessments one hears about socio-economic impact assessments.  A socio-economic impact assessment is pretty much an economic impact assessment although they are not the same.  I do not know if Dr. Hynes will talk about this but he can tell how economic impact analyses address how efficiently investments of capital and resources are returned in present and future benefits to society.  They focus on resource supply and demand, prices and jobs.  When I conduct a social impact assessment I am also interested in employment and jobs, so there is some overlap, but there is a considerable difference in the focus and sometimes the approaches and methods.</p><p> When I conduct a social impact assessment, and this is an example of ways to get the social and community aspects into the management process, I look at the demographics, ethnic character, family structure and community organisation and try to figure out how vulnerable or resilient these communities and people are.  As I mentioned earlier, it is important to look at the recreational anglers, for example, and how they will be impacted versus the small scale fishers versus the trawlers.  It is really important to examine the social structure.  That includes various organisations and businesses.  There are also various management and political considerations.</p><p> Why do we do this?  It is to try to avoid inequities among the different groups, and to try to include them in the decision making process.  There are five critical issues on which one must focus.  One looks at vulnerability, including economic vulnerability.  One tries to understand the existence of alternatives at community level, for example, one might be looking at alternatives in fishing such as other species or methods.  One also considers outside the fisheries and whether there are other policies that can be put forward to help people innovate and branch out into other industries.  That is the issue of alternatives.  One also looks at two related concepts, resilience and adaptability.  Are there structures in place that enable them to recover from the change?  For example, a salmon ban might have hit a community quite hard but at least they can fish for something else.  Then one looks at cumulative impacts.  There might be a salmon ban and a closed area.  Suddenly, after five or six different policies, they are not able to adapt.  They cannot bounce back from so many changes.  When one is making policies it is important to look at not just one specific policy and issue but at what else is happening that also impacts them.  One ban might not have a huge negative impact, but if it is coupled with other things it might.  There is also the issue of community support, such as whether there are Structural Funds available for them.</p><p> These are the five critical ideas I tend to focus on when I look at communities and try to understand how they will be impacted.  Basically, I focus on the business, economy and the various sectors that are impacted, such as the shore sector.  Obviously, numerous jobs are tied into certain industries on the islands.  As an anthropologist, I focus a good deal on people and society.  I carried out an impact assessment in the Netherlands, where many ship owners and people had to leave the fishery.  There was a specific age group, from 35 years to 50 years, in which the people did not have higher education and whose wives, due to their cultural and religious beliefs, left school at the age of 16 years.  This group was particularly hard hit.  People aged 35 years and under tended to have more education and, perhaps, other opportunities.  However, the specific age group I mentioned would have the most difficulty in adapting to the change.  That is also an example of looking at demographics.  It is not just different ethnic groups one might uncover but also different segments of the population who would be impacted differently.</p><p> As an anthropologist, I consider heritage and quality of life very important.  I have worked in Europe and around the world.  I have seen that once one starts to lose certain ways of life, one does not get them back.  That is a shame because including the different groups adds to making a society healthy.</p><p> A final point is about my work with the European Commission.</p> <p> With regard to my work with the European Commission, it is difficult because we do not have the data, especially at the social end of things.  In much of the work I do, what would really be useful at the scientific end and the community end would be opportunities for collaborative research, because the locals have a lot of ecological knowledge and they know what is going on.  By including people in the process, we ensure they buy into it and feel more strongly about it.  Not only do we learn from them, but it helps to build rapport.  When proposals and derogations come in the European Commission asks for our advice, but we do not have the data.  It is difficult for me as the social scientist to comment when I do not have the data.  One thing that would really be useful would be finding ways to do collaborative research with local people.  That could help or hurt their cause but, either way, it would result in data, which would help scientists and managers to make decisions.</p></speech>

I will talk about some of the work we do in the socioeconomic marine research unit in NUI Galway, which is relevant to the work of the sub-committee, particularly with regard to the proposed report on strategies for promoting sustaining coastal and island communities.  Six issues were identified and we have done a lot of work on two which are very relevant - namely, socioeconomic profiling of coastal communities, and the provision of key statistics on the different marine sectors.  The four industries of interest here are aquaculture, fisheries, sea angling and tourism.</p><p>  I will speak about the presentation slides, which I hope members have in front of them.  I will give an overview of some of the work we do, particularly in regard to the profiling we do and how we define what we call &quot;ocean and coastal economies&quot;.  I will speak a bit about the marine sectors and the data sources we use to define those sectors.  As far as I can, I will give a bit of a regional perspective and I will speak about some other work we do that is relevant to the sub-committee.</p><p>  Much of our work is funded through a Beaufort marine research award, under the marine research sub-programme of the National Development Plan 2007-2013.  That award was granted for work in this area following consultation in regard to foresight exercises as part of the development of the Sea Change strategy.  A gap identified at that time was the lack of information in Ireland in regard to the value of marine sectors, the numbers employed, coastal communities and what is going on in the coastal economy.  On the back of that, the unit was set up in NUI Galway.</p><p>  We have been attempting to develop a methodology whereby we can get statistics together on ocean-related activity.  We define the ocean economy as including economic activity which indirectly or directly uses the ocean as an input or produces a good that is used in some marine-related field.  From that, we distinguish the coastal economy, which includes any economic activity that takes place in some predefined spatial area adjacent to the sea - along some coastal strip.</p><p>  In terms of the ocean economy, activity can take place anywhere on the island of Ireland.  For example, one could have a marine engineering consultancy in the midlands.  It does not have to be in the coastal domain.  In the coastal profiling we have done, we have tried to define statistical coastal regions from which we could get data together.  There is a coastal definition used by EUROSTAT and that is at the NUTS 3 level.  On the map, it is shown as the green area extending out to the shoreline.  That is what EUROSTAT defines as the coastal economy for Europe and it has put together statistics in regard to that area.  However, someone in Ballinasloe or Nenagh will not really consider himself or herself coastal.  It is a very broad definition in the Irish case.  We have looked to see whether we can refine that definition in terms of the coastal area and what statistics we can get together.  We looked at coastal counties - the counties adjacent to the shore - which is the cream-coloured area on the map, and at defining a coastal electoral district, ED - an ED adjacent to the shore - to reduce it to a smaller but a much more relevant scale, although it is much more difficult to get data for.  We have produced a report.  I will not go into this, but I refer to the different sources and the different spatial scales on which we can get data.  We can get a lot of information on unemployment levels, population levels and other population-related statistics from the census data down to the ED level.  We can look to see if there is any difference between the coastal EDs and the national average in EDs or we can go up to the county level.  It is more difficult when we are trying to get economic data and trying to define the value of activity taking place at the coastal ED level, because it is not generated by the Central Statistics Office.  In terms of GDP, one can get that at the NUTS 3 level.  One can get income <i>per capita</i> at county level but even at that level, it comes with a health warning from the Central Statistics Office.  We have attempted to produce estimates at the coastal county and shoreline electoral district levels.  These are just estimates which are based on the share of the population in these areas as a percentage of the county or at the NUTS 3 level.  If we talk about the shoreline ED level, that is about 25% of the total GDP produced in the country, as a rough estimate.</p><p>  The ocean economy is purely marine-related activity.  I have some figures, to which I will return.  We are talking about 13 sectors, including marine services, shipping, tourism, hi-tech marine commerce, marine resources, fisheries, aquaculture, seafood processing, by-products such as seaweed-related products, and renewable energy.  There is also a marine manufacturing sector which we distinguish.  We can get the statistics on some of these straight from the CSO in terms of the annual services inquiry or the census of industrial production, but in regard to what we refer to as these emerging industries in the marine sector, that data cannot be got in that it is buried in some other sector and it is very difficult to pull out that information from the CSO.  We then have confidentiality issues if the industry is very small.  Data is a major issue here.  We did a company survey for those small emerging sectors when we were developing methodology to get this data together.  We went out and found these companies.  </p><p>  The other aspect I should highlight here that is of importance is marine tourism, which we estimate is one of the biggest, or the most highly valued, sectors in the marine economy, and yet it is very difficult to get data in this area.  We have estimates of the total tourism value from F&aacute;ilte Ireland.  It has estimates ranging from 3% to 10%, depending on how broadly one defines marine tourism.  In 2002, a survey done on behalf of the Marine Institute asked visitors how much of their activity was marine-related.  It was able to estimate the value at that point in time of marine tourism expenditure in Ireland.</p> <p>It is a particularly difficult one to get an accurate reading on and yet, in terms of rural and coastal communities, it is probably one of the most relevant.  When people think of the marine economy they think of fishing and aquaculture, but shipping and marine tourism have a bigger share of the overall marine economy, even though fishing, aquaculture, seafood processing and so forth are obviously vital to rural coastal communities.</p><p> In terms of figures, the marine economy in 2007 was valued at &euro;3.4 billion, which was approximately 1.4% of gross value added and equated to approximately 1% of national gross domestic product.  In total, the sector employs approximately 17,000 full-time equivalent individuals.  I must point out that we are operating with a time lag here.  These figures are quite out of date, representing, as they do, the situation in 2007, which was the peak of the business cycle in Ireland, although in one sense, it is a good baseline year to use.  We are currently updating these figures but the most recent year for our profiling is still only 2010. </p><p> Interestingly, if one looks at the share of activities, marine services are most relevant in terms of value, at 66%.  However, in terms of employment, the marine-resource-related sub-sector has the highest share, which includes fisheries, aquaculture, seafood processing and so forth.  Those areas of activity are the most important from an employment perspective.  These are what we refer to as &quot;established&quot; marine sectors and are the sectors one readily thinks of when one thinks of marine activity.  They account for about 94% of all marine-related activity.  There are also what are known as &quot;emerging&quot; sectors, which were highlighted in the EU's Blue Growth strategy as areas with high potential for growth in the future.  While we are in the middle of updating these figures, it is interesting to note that these emerging sectors have seen growth between 2007 and 2010, despite the fact that that was a very difficult economic period in general.  Growth has been recorded in both turnover and employment numbers, whereas some of the more established sectors have seen a decline in the same period.  However, growth was not recorded in all of the emerging sectors.  Our best estimates indicate that marine tourism, for example, declined in that period.  However, general tourism figures have improved recently and one can assume the same is true for marine tourism.  </p><p> The regional distribution patterns are quite interesting.  If one looks at marine economic activity at county level, counties such as Donegal, which have quite low rates of income <i>per capita</i><i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the rest of the country, have some of the highest shares, in terms of value, of marine economic activity nationally.  Of course, that relates back to the marine resource element and the very strong fisheries and seafood processing industries in such counties.</p></speech>

There could be someone in Tipperary, for example, who is producing navigation instruments or there could be an engineering firm in Roscommon which is involved in the marine area.  One does not have to be on the coastline to be involved in marine economic activity.  Obviously, though, such activity is mainly concentrated along our coast.</p><p>  Other areas of activity within our unit that are of relevance to this committee include the work of my colleagues in developing an input/output analysis of the different marine sectors.  My colleagues are extracting data for the marine sectors from the national input/output tables produced by the Central Statistics Office to gauge the multiplier effect of  marine-related activities.  We have also been looking at financial models for the aquaculture and fish farm production sectors.  The unit has been examining the marine recreation demand of the Irish public.  </p><p>  A lot of this data has already been used in the development of the integrated marine plan launched by the Government last year.  Also, the initial economic assessment had to be carried out as part of the overall assessment needed for the marine strategy framework directive and we have been working with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on that.  As part of that work, we conducted a survey to assess the attitude of the general public to the marine environment and to get some indication of the marine recreational activities they undertake.  It is quite obvious that almost everyone surveyed would probably take a trip to the coast to take a walk along a beach but our study showed that participation in on-water activities is very low.  It is interesting to note that those who do participate in on-water activities can be broken into distinct groups.  Those who undertake passive activities will only undertake one such activity per trip, whereas those engaged in more active activities tend to do a few activities during any trip to the coast.  That is interesting in terms of clustering activities in the context of promoting tourism in certain areas.  Certain activities can be clustered together successfully.</p><p>  We were also involved in the report prepared by Inland Fisheries Ireland on angling, which is due to be published shortly.  We were involved in the preparation of the questions and in some of the analysis contained in that report.  We also do a lot of work on what can be referred to as non-market marine ecosystem services.</p></speech>

From an overall economic perspective, Dr. Hynes' contribution highlights the importance of coastal areas, while also pointing out the dependence of coastal communities on marine-related activities, whether that is fishing itself or fishing-related services.  It is interesting to note that the service sector employs more people and generates more income than the actual fishing.  That is not really surprising, given the many challenges facing coastal communities, not least those outlined by Dr. Delaney in terms of the restrictions placed on local fishing activity.  Often, a lot of the economic benefit of certain activities is obtained by few people.  In other words, the bigger operators are catching most of the fish and the smaller operators living in the area are unable to catch the fish swimming past their door.</p><p>  I come from Donegal, which has a number of island communities.  One of the legislative changes introduced by my party, Fianna F&aacute;il, in government in 2006 - that is, the banning of salmon drift-net fishing - was disastrous in many ways.</p> <p>It was based on scientific evidence but ignored social, cultural and traditional factors because this was a way of life for many people.  Coupled with other restrictions on the fish that could be caught in certain areas, it brought about major economic and social deprivation for those islands and along the coast of Donegal.  How can we change that?</p><p> Inland Fisheries Ireland would argue differently, that we cannot go back and open up salmon fishing, even on a controlled basis.  I would argue against that because the figures show, as does Dr. Delaney's survival plan for the Donegal islands, that there are 250,000 to 300,000 salmon moving into that area.  The rivers are stocking again.  The major challenge is not the problems at sea, but pollution in rivers and the complete lack of policing of the rivers to prevent poaching while salmon are moving upstream.  The seals along the coast are also causing major problems with the salmon stock.  They are catching large numbers of salmon when they go into an estuary before heading upstream.  The decision to ban drift net salmon, without dealing with some of the other issues, was wrong and has had major social consequences.</p><p> The committee met with representatives of the island communities in Donegal.  What is Dr. Delaney's view of how the salmon ban could be lifted on a sustainable basis?  Could that be considered?  Will the current review of the CFP see policy change to protect smaller regional fisheries that are not hard-core economic fisheries but where the communities could benefit economically and socially?  Depopulation of coastal communities in the west is a major issue.  Some of the CSO figures in Dr. Hynes's report show depopulation is happening more rapidly in coastal areas than in other parts of the country.  How can we stem that?  Is there a need to ensure any decision taken at European or national level is socially proofed?  A single decision in a small rural area has a knock-on effect on the local economy.</p><p> Previously it was a way of life in island communities for young people to follow their fathers into the fishing sector.  When leaving school early was banned, those people were caught because their way of life was removed.  A small compensation package was made available but in the overall scheme of things, it was peanuts.</p><p> It strikes me that the CAP and CFP both cover traditional ways of life over the generations.  Transfers into Ireland of &euro;1.5 billion under the CAP are available to farmers, through environmental schemes in particular.  On the fishing side there has not been any scheme made available at a European level for fishermen on an annual basis.  Is that a mistake?  Is it too late to turn back the clock or should it be looked at for those who have been disenfranchised as a result of policy decisions at European level under the auspices of scientific research and conservation?  In agriculture, there is compensation available for the decisions that are taken on that basis and that is not happening for the fishing sector.</p><p> The fleet capacity is linked to compensation.  The smaller fishermen would have fleet that is deteriorating and losing value.  If some fishing activity was to be reopened and the changes outlined in the document took place, with the easing of the salmon ban and area 6A regulations, is there a need for a centralised fund to upgrade smaller fishing vessels of up to 15 m?</p><p> I have seen in the past 15 years young people leaving rural areas because European regulations and Government decisions mean there is no employment.  That is wrong and at European level, small coastal communities must be protected.  It is fine to say this will happen in reports but things are not working out that way on the ground.</p><p> If changes were introduced on regulations within the 12 mile limit on the fish that are caught or on the salmon ban to allow locals to catch mixed stock inside the 12 mile limit, or if the salmon ban was lifted on a phased basis over a period of time, what would the economic benefit be to rural communities?  Anecdotally, what would the witnesses' view be?  That is a relevant question for NUI Galway as well because this has a major impact on the island communities off Connemara and the western counties as far south as Kerry.</p><p> In Donegal this had a major impact.  I remember in the 1980s, my father was an inspector with the Department of the Marine and he would visit Burtonport pier and similar piers along the west coast of Donegal.  All the boats would be lined up and 60 vessels would be landing salmon.  There are no vessels coming in with any fish at the moment in some of those ports.  It is sad to see but we must find a balance between conservation and allowing people to continue a way of life, and to remain at home if they want to, continuing the traditional way of life they always had.  How can this committee argue with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and Inland Fisheries Ireland in a manner that might persuade them?</p> <p>How can we present the arguments in a manner that might be attractive to those various State organisations?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.676" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013042500007#F00200"><p>I thank both witnesses for their presentations.  I was born, reared and grew up in a coastal community and spent part of my life involved in the fishing sector and with a small farm.  Therefore, I am acutely aware of the current situation and the disgraceful policies that have been pursued for political interests over decades.  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill mentioned one of these, the salmon fishing industry.  I remember that debate and remember the arguments being made here that the policy being pursued was madness, because in closing down one sector we were automatically putting pressure on other sectors, such as crayfish and lobster fishermen and gill netting.  This is exactly what happened.  People who were involved in the salmon sector moved on to the other sectors and now we have huge pressure in those sectors.</p><p>  The issues come down to policy and social sustainability.  The template in regard to regulating the situation is the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, which is concerned with the integrated conservation of fish stocks, with sustainable exploitation of resources.  However, there is no mention of equity and distribution.  We are all aware that two areas of the fishing sector currently are in the hands of fewer than 50 people.  Where is the equity in that regard?  Where is the equity if we make multimillionaires out of 23 people and close down other sectors and pauperise people involved in white fishing?  We have a situation in our coastal communities currently where if we had a proper managed policy directed by fairness and equity, we would have a fantastic sector that would include onshore investment and an onshore workforce that would complement those communities and keep them vibrant.  </p><p>  The reality is totally different.  For example, when the <i>Tit Bonhomme</i>  sank early last year, four out of the six crew members on board were non-nationals.  Fishing boats have huge running costs and fishermen do not receive the prices to which they are entitled for prime fish.  There are also huge costs for insurance and to ensure observance of the code of practice.  These costs make it unviable for young Irish people to work offshore.  There is no incentive for them to do so as they cannot get a reasonable or decent income.  That is the state of our fishing sector.  If the sector was managed properly and we had structured onshore processing on a national basis, not just in places like Killybegs, we could provide incomes for people onshore, complementing the work done offshore.</p><p>  I cannot understand the situation.  Approximately 16% of the fishing grounds are off our coast, yet we are only entitled to 4% of the quota from those waters.  This does not make sense.  I wonder whether the political will ever existed to try to obtain fairness and equity in this regard.  I applaud the witnesses on trying to create equity within the system.  That is the way to go.  However, if the political will is not there to do it, we can have all the policies we want, but it will not happen.  I hope that those with power now will use that power for the common good.  However, in my lifetime the common good has never existed within the fishing sector.  The methodology around the fishing sector has created individualisation.  Policy has all been about trying to get something for oneself, not about what is best for communities and our people.  That is why 23 people own the mackerel quota of this country, a State asset.  That is not right.  Others could say more about this than I can.  However, it is not right that successive Governments stand over this situation.</p><p>  Mention was made of the principle of impact assessments.  I agree these are required, but what happens afterwards?  Is there flexibility to correct the inequalities and wrongs?  Are there teeth enough to drive this forward?  I do not see that happening currently.  Dr. Hynes spoke about marine tourism and said there was a huge opening for it.  I concur with that.  I have been in Clare where a group there is doing fantastic work.  It is one of the most professional operations in the country.  I visited the project during the year, but its name escapes me now.  There is huge potential nationally, but it needs to be marketed here and abroad.  If that happened, it would help coastal communities, providing them with spending power which would have a knock-on effect in other areas.</p><p>  Our coastal communities lack spending power currently and are hit by huge emigration.  There are areas in south Kerry and west Cork, which were traditionally strong GAA areas, but now due to emigration, they are amalgamating clubs to field teams.  A whole generation of people are leaving these communities, leaving them with an imbalance.  There is a disparity now in these communities between the number of males and females and a disparity in ages, with most people being either under 18  or older than 35.  The generation in between has left, bringing huge consequences in these areas in terms of social sustainability.</p><p>  I thank the witnesses for their enlightening presentations, which I hope everybody will take on board.  Perhaps if the proposals became part of policy and were driven politically as policy, we would be in a better place.</p></speech>

The work this committee is attempting to do is to try to see if it can formulate or propose a policy response that will protect rural coastal communities and communities dependent on inshore fishing or which have traditionally been dependent on inshore fishing for their livelihoods and help sustain those communities.  The socioeconomic aspect of the impact of the current situation on communities is very important.  We must look at how these traditional communities can be assisted and enabled to maintain their way of life and adapt to the changes being forced upon them.  We hope to have a report at the end of this process that will recommend a policy response.  We want to look at the existing CFP and see how it can be adapted to an Irish perspective to help sustain these  communities.</p><p>  Dr. Delaney identified five key critical issues in her presentation and my question centres on her work with Arranmore fishermen and her knowledge of the Donegal communities, but I accept there may be data gaps and that she may not have the full information required to make a proper adjudication.</p> <p>How would the deputation evaluate the coastal and island communities based on their knowledge to date of these five critical issues and the threats that exist for them?  How should the policy response be balanced between the potential for alternatives and the attempt to maintain the traditional economic activity of these communities?  How should we attempt to try to match that?</p><p> From a European perspective does the deputation believe the Common Fisheries Policy is an attempt to manage the sustainable exploitation of our fishing stock?  The reform is at the early stages.  Given the work of the deputation in evaluating the impact on coastal communities, how do they believe the Common Fisheries Policy stacks up?  Is it developed enough to take account of the impacts on small and coastal communities as well as the decisions that are being made at a wider European Level?</p><p> Representatives from Inland Fisheries Ireland were here some weeks ago.  During their presentation on salmon stock and the ban on drift-net salmon fishing they referred to the Atlantic intergovernmental body that considers salmon fishing and stocks and how it is now beginning to consider the social impacts of the decisions that are being made.  Does the deputation have any information on how developed this is or how it is moving along?  Is it something we should consider and examine in terms of the social impacts of the decisions that are being made?</p><p> My next question is for Dr. Hynes.  Dr. Delaney remarked that there is a lack of data to evaluate decisions.  The presentation strengthens that view in that reference was made to the difficulty in compiling data and gathering information.  I may not have looked into the position of coastal counties and economies in sufficient detail but the approach seems to be somewhat skewed by Dublin, Cork and major urban centres.  Is that having an impact?  Is this something that should be considered?  Should we examine rural communities more?  The coastal electoral divisions still take in parts of large urban centres and other economic activity might mask the impact or threats to rural, coastal communities.</p></speech>

The aim is to carry out a report and a study based on trying to build a model that allows consideration of smaller rural coastal communities as opposed to larger ports and fishing areas.  Deputy Pringle summarised it by proposing a policy that would allow for activities to take place to build resilient rural coastal and island communities.  That is what we are trying to achieve here notwithstanding the comments of Deputy Ferris about so much of the major fishing stocks being controlled by a small number of fishermen.  We are trying to do something beyond that and look at resilience and adaptability and, as Dr. Delaney noted, community support.  Much of what we are trying to do centres around those five key points.  We will go back to the deputation.  There are several questions for Dr. Delaney.</p></speech>

I will begin with the questions from Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill - I do not have Irish so I apologise for not pronouncing the names correctly.  His first question, which I managed to write down, was about the salmon ban and whether it could be lifted.  This ties in to what I stated at the end of my presentation.  There is the idea of collaborative research whereby we go in and do a pilot project to determine the position, as Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill suggested.  Through my work I have read and visited many places in the world.  In many areas there may be a protected species or area but in other places in the world there is not usually a complete ban or closure.  Often, there are graduated rules and rights of access for different individuals in different parts of the sector.  If we look around the world we see that there are many situations and sometimes there may be an arrangement that certain groups cannot come in but anglers and small-scale operators are allowed in.  We adapt it to the situation.  The most important thing in trying to evaluate the ban, and possibly lift it, is to get the data, which, as we have said, we do not have.  The key thing is to try to set up some type of collaborative research project.  Oftentimes when scientists have to make decisions they need a given time series and something to base them upon.</p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill asked whether there should be policy changes to support communities.  Was he referring to EU level?</p></speech>

We should think about why we are making policies and what the point is.  We hope that one main reason for making certain policies is to support our constituents and society.  I have worked with biological scientists in this area.  There is a derogation on a fishing ban in the Baltic Sea.  They said this would help the small-scale fishers, but what about the three trawlers?  Is it really fair and equitable to them?  This also touches on the issue of equity.  One needs to consider historical equity as well.  Some people might argue that one is emphasising one group over another and that might be the case but perhaps one could argue that a given group has been legislated against historically.  In some cases one might be trying to rectify a situation by brining everyone up to an equal level.  If I had to say "Yes" or "No", I would say "Yes".</p><p>  There was a question about the Common Fisheries Policy and the Common Agricultural Policy.  There are rather interesting and different rights issues between agriculture and the fisheries and the policies have developed differently because of that.  I am not best qualified to comment on the two but there is a reason they have gone differently.  Given the limited knowledge I have I believe it would be difficult to treat them in the same way but perhaps there are others with a more enlightened view or a better background.  There was another question about compensation for agriculture and whether there should be compensation for fisheries as well.  In many parts of the world they do compensate.  If it is a part of a broader policy, depending on what one is trying to do, then why not consider it?  It has been done.  What would compensation entail?  It may be a way to help people to innovate or to move into other areas.  Oftentimes there is an argument to the effect that in compensating a given group they will simply take it back and re-invest it.  For example, if the compensation is invested in technologies which are more selective then it is not necessarily a bad thing to re-invest.  We should consider what the goals are but compensation has been helpful in many arenas.</p><p>  Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill also asked about a centralised fund for upgrading small-scale fisheries.  I touched upon that in some ways.</p> <p>There are also many safety issues involved, especially with the older fleets.</p><p> Deputy Ferris is not here so I will reply to Deputy Pringle.  Dr. Hynes might have a better view of the island communities, although I focus more on the social aspect.  I have not done a formal study of this and I have not been back to the communities for a couple of years.  I could not give a formal scientific response to that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.686" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alyne Elizabeth Delaney" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013042500009#H00300"><p>I could give my opinion. The question was how I would evaluate how they are doing at the moment.  From my last visit, speaking with people and comparing the situation with other places I have lived and worked, it seems they are at a critical juncture.  Where I live in Denmark, the policy has been to close schools and centralise schools and government and I have seen the gutting of many of these small rural communities.  One of the main issues was the closure of schools.  For example, if one looks at the island communities with declining populations, the closure of schools is a key indicator.  Once a school is closed one can pretty much write off the community.  It might take a decade or two but, from a social science perspective, whether there is a school is a key indicator.  From what I have seen of the closure of businesses and the direction they are going, I would say they are at a critical point now.</p></speech>

Deputy Ferris also made a comment about non-Irish crew and said that it is perhaps because there is not a reasonable income.  From what I have seen in Scotland and other places, the main problem, apart from the difficult income, is the insecure future.  The crew would often have the goal of eventually getting their own boats and becoming independent operators.  One of the main issues is that they do not see a future because there is so much capital investment needed to become independent operators.  It is really a question of the insecure future.  If people feel more secure or if there are policies that would help them toward a more secure future then more local people will be willing to sign on as crew because they can see that they can perhaps also move forward.</p><p>  Deputy McNamara asked who should conduct social impact assessments.  It depends on what one is trying to study.  Social impact assessments first came about in the early 1970s with the National Environmental Policy Act in the United States.  Impact assessments were designed to take place ahead of policy changes.  Someone said it is too late afterwards.  The idea is to do it ahead of time to try to get an understanding of the impact.  Ideally, it would be conducted by a social scientist who has some training.  Who asks the scientist to conduct it depends on what the policy is.  If it is a policy through the Department responsible for fisheries then that Department should ask for it.  The European Commission has had impact assessments done on some of its policy changes but that is at a very high level.  At ground level, it should be whoever is instituting the policy change.  That is the ideal.  I have done some <i>ad hoc</i> contracts.  Ultimately, the people making the policy change should be the ones saying this needs to be done.  If it is a national policy it should be organised at national level.  Local people might say it is not being done and they want it done but then the question of funds arises.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.689" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Stephen Hynes" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AG32013042500009#H00600"><p>In response to Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill's question as to whether we have any idea of the value of lifting a salmon ban or of changes to the management regime of the inshore fleet, I do not have figures and cannot say what the impact would be.  One would expect a positive economic impact on the local community.  Some of my colleagues have studied the multiplier effect of that kind of activity.  Fishing or any marine-related activity tends on average to have a higher multiplier effect on economic activity than other sectors broken out by the CSO.  For every &euro;1 generated through fishing there is a knock-on effect of 57 cent, which is above average for a multiplier.  There is further work going on there.  There would be a positive impact but Inland Fisheries Ireland would argue for the value of salmon stock on the recreational side, which is a multiple of the value of commercial salmon fishing.  We do not know, if we were to lift the ban in certain island communities, whether it would have a major impact on stock going up the rivers.  I cannot answer that question.</p><p>  The Senator and others asked how we analyse the impact of policies.  It is a data issue.  Economists build models through looking at the data on individuals in whatever sector.  It is difficult to get information on inland fisheries or on small boats.  In a previous life I worked for Teagasc and we were able to do fantastic stuff on policy analysis, as it still does, using the national farm survey with individual-level data for the farmers.  The farm representative bodies are well able to use that type of analysis.  It would be of major benefit to the fishery representative bodies if we had that data and could use it for policy analysis.  That is a recommendation.  I have had constructive talks with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and BIM on that data but there seems to be a mismatch.  BIM is collecting data on the cost side of the fleet and the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority has the log book data on what is being landed and the sales note data but there is a mismatch between the inland fleets and the boats above 10 metres.  That data issue could be examined.</p><p>  Some of those points are relevant to Deputy Ferris's comments about equity and distribution.  He is right about some of the coastal economy statistics.</p> <p>According to the census results, the age dependency ratio is higher in coastal rural communities.</p><p> I agree with the Deputy on the importance of the marketing of potential marine-related tourism activities.  Yesterday, I attended a meeting of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA.  Some of the talks were interesting.  Many of the issues discussed had relevance for Ireland.  In rural tourism, for example, there is a tendency not to consider the marine.  Deputy Ferris referred to a lack of marketing.  In her work on rural tourism, Dr. Mary Cawley of NUI Galway states that initiatives must be relevant to an area's culture and geographical scale.  This is also true in terms of marine-related tourism activity.  There are a number of nice examples, including Col&aacute;iste UISCE in Belmullet, which incorporates marine activities with the Irish language.  It is a thriving business.  Geographically, it has a sheltered bay for windsurfing and dinghy sailing as well as a surf beach.</p><p> An audit of what we possess is necessary.  Given the geographical information system, GIS, data on landscape and marine features, there is a great deal of information on what areas are suitable for which activities.  We must also determine what consumers want in terms of product.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland is considering some of these issues, but much needs to be done.  If one gets off the boat on the Aran Islands, one can cycle about and look around.  I have not visited them in the past year, but there are no opportunities to get out onto the water.  People point to the weather, but modern wetsuits are good and there are activities such as paddle boarding and kayaking.  People do not need to have significant skills in these activities to be able to partake.  It is a way of generating extra economic activity in areas, yet it seems to be a blind spot.  These new types of activity do not require a considerable amount of investment.</p><p> Other areas possess marine tourism infrastructure.  For example, if simple slipways were added to existing quays in remote areas along the west coast, small quays that are not used for much anymore, providing that access to the water could add significant value.  We must know the product and conduct an audit of what is possible.</p><p> Deputy Pringle asked about a means of examining the impact of changes in the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP, on coastal communities.  This would be difficult.  We would need to get our hands on the data to run the models to which I referred.  I am involved in a project that is examining the reform of the CFP.  A colleague was with parts of the herring fleet in the Celtic Sea and asked about their preferences in terms of the CFP's objectives.  Their first priority was a strong, vibrant fishing community.  Catch levels, profitability and so on followed this.</p><p> The incorporation of socioeconomic considerations in fisheries management seems to be lacking regardless of the stock in question.  Under the move to the ecosystem approach, the impact on one species of fishing another species is examined.  This is great, but consideration of the impact on local communities does not seem to be built into management assessments.  Teagasc and the Marine Institute are key collaborators in much of our work.  Dr. &Aacute;ine Macken Walsh, a sociologist in Teagasc's Rural Economy Research Centre, RERC, examined rural development and barriers to change.  She found that fishing culture can be a barrier to rural development.  As Senator &Oacute; Domhnaill stated, generations of families are involved and it is almost seen as a failure if they move into a non-fishing sector.  How to get around this barrier is an important question.</p><p> Deputy Pringle was correct about the importance of distinguishing between urban and rural coastal communities.  We can do this based on population density.  It depends on one's definition of "rural".  We are working on this matter to update some of our statistics.</p><p> Deputy Ferris mentioned the significant decline in the populations of coastal communities.  From what we have seen of the census at electoral district, ED, level along the shoreline, the decline in rural coastal populations has been no more dramatic than the average nationally.  However, they have a higher rate of male unemployment than the national average or even urban coastal areas.  They also have a higher age dependency ratio.</p></speech>

They might be useful for the committee's work.  Dr. Hynes mentioned the difference between urban and rural EDs.  To aid the committee in its work, would it be possible for him to break the figures down further?  For example, neither Donegal nor Mayo have a major urban centre and have typical rural EDs that would show the impact of policies, the higher level of support that is necessary, etc.</p></speech>

Indeed, we are doing it.  We can generate data for counties and distinguish between rural and urban.  However, it becomes more difficult at lower levels.  We can look into profiling the data at the small area level in terms of employment, educational attainment and so on using the census, but it would be more difficult to determine the level of economic activity generated in EDs in County Mayo or County Donegal.  We could produce estimates, but they would be based on population densities as a percentage of the larger spatial scale for which we have statistics.  We could break the figures down further.</p></speech>

I know the answer to my next question, but I will ask it anyway.  It relates to assessing possible policy decisions.</p> <p>Will there be a recommendation to the effect that social impact assessments should be carried out in advance of future policy decisions?  Will Dr. Delaney comment on the balance between alternative and traditional methods, changes in communities, etc.?  In this regard, I refer to the need for traditional methods to continue to be used while alternatives are being developed.</p></speech>

When we consider traditional activities such as fishing, we discover that 200 years ago the equipment and methods used and the species caught were different.  People do not understand that what they consider to be traditional activities have changed, perhaps even in the past 50 years.  The key aspect is to retain a broader view and to try not to pigeonhole people into using one specific method or way.  It is more a case of people trying to secure access to resources and to live through that access.</p><p>  In the context of the Deputy's point regarding the transition from traditional to alternative methods, there are some opportunities in this regard through the new fisheries local access groups, FLAGs, of which there are six in Ireland.</p></speech>

That is one possibility.  If one is trying to help people through a transition, the key matters on which to focus are education and opportunities.  In the context of the marine tourism, one of the major aspects is not just the opportunities which exist but the fact that on many occasions tourists want to see traditional fishing vessels or what they view as being picturesque communities.  One must often have a high-level view of what is the goal and how to achieve it.  As already stated, education is often a factor as is the provision of some sort of funding to allow people to transition and build on the knowledge they already possess or to work with something that is related.  Some people think aquaculture is completely different from fishing.  I know fishermen who have become involved in aquaculture.  The key with the latter is to consider what is a suitable species and the nature of the local environment.  In the 1980s, aquaculture was called the blue revolution.  There have been some fantastic cases giving rise to major benefits.  However, there were also a number of some really horrible cases where the species chosen used up more protein than was produced.  Aquaculture could represent a good future but the key is to focus on which species to use and the nature of the local environment.</p></speech>

I thank Dr. Delaney and Dr. Hynes for coming before us and providing their perspective.  Dr. Delaney referred to tradition.  We have designated Gaeltacht areas and mn&aacute; t&iacute; and people can spend two to three weeks during the summer months in order to learn Irish.  That was not the case 50 years ago.  This is a small cottage industry which was created to replace subsistence farming.  Most of our coastal areas are designated as Natura 2000 sites of some description.  This gives rise to problems when people are trying to engage in offshore activities such as aquaculture, wind farming, etc.  There are areas, mainly in the west, which are supported by a semi-State body, &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which drew down funding for rural social and support schemes.  If we are going to continue to value rural communities, perhaps the committee should recommend considering a model similar to that which relates to &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltacht.  I refer to the creation of a mechanism to draw down supports from Europe.</p><p>  On policy, the discussion with which the meeting commenced in respect of drift net fishing provides a typical example.  We must consider how we might achieve the balance and it is all about balance.  Dr. Delaney's final comments on aquaculture brought the discussion full circle.  We must consider how we might achieve harmony between drift net fishermen and those involved in aquaculture.  The aim of the exercise is to ensure that rural, coastal and island communities will survive, that their schools can remain open and that such communities will thrive as a result.  That is what we are trying to do and we thought it would be easy.  I live on the east coast so I am probably the most objective member of the committee.  However, I am also probably the most uninformed.  The latter allows me to sit back, watch and listen.  I am fascinated by everything we have heard.</p><p>  I again thank our guests for travelling to be here.  Dr. Hynes did not have to travel quite as far as Dr. Delaney but we appreciate both of them making the effort to be here.  What they stated will inform what we want to see happen from the perspective of policy direction.  In addition to environmental impact assessments, the social impact and other considerations should also be drawn into the mix in advance rather than retrospectively.  I do not wish to presume anything but I am of the view that the committee's report will contain recommendations on real-time data, advanced studies and proofing.</p><p>  As we have no further business, I will bring the meeting to a close.  I remind members that we will meet again on Tuesday next, when we will have quite a sizeable agenda with which to deal.</p></speech>

Before we commence, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite the Minister to commence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.714" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="12:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013042500003#B00600"><p>Thank you, Chairman, for holding this meeting.  People were anxious that we meet last week, but it was not possible to do so.  One of my problems is that I do not have the power of bilocation.  This week I have been in Luxembourg, Brussels and Dublin, which has been difficult.  I, therefore, thank the committee for its patience.</p><p>  This is a serious issue, on which we need a significant response from lots of stakeholders and players to deal with a drastic shortage of available roughage fodder for animals.  We have a national herd of approximately 6.5 million animals.  We have just over 1.1 million dairy cows and 1 million suckler cows.  We also have other animals that need roughage.  It might be helpful for me to outline what we have been and are doing.  If members have questions, we will try to deal with them.</p><p>  There has not only been a response in recent weeks.  We knew from last summer - we really did not have one - that we would have a difficult winter period in feeding animals.  It was going to be expensive for farmers and there was a risk that there would be a fodder shortage.  Throughout the winter months we ensured Teagasc would be prioritising fodder, feed and nutrient management for livestock.  That was done in partnership with all of the farming organisations which have shown much leadership in this regard.  Many farmers were anticipating managing a limited fodder supply up until a couple of weeks ago when everybody had assumed we would have a normal spring.  If one looks at the statistics, for example, in the case of a big co-op such as Dairygold, at the start of last week 5% of its farmers had run out of stored fodder.  By the end of this week the figure will be 50%.  That is how dramatic the problem has become.  Everybody had timed his or her usage of stored fodder and its availability to end about one week ago.  There is now a significant shortage.</p><p>  We are trying to do a number of things.  First, we recognise that there is stress among the farming community, given the fear that farmers will not be able to feed their animals.  For many of them, it is a little like not being able to feed one&rsquo;s children.  The relationship between many farmers and the herds they manage is incredibly strong.  That is why when animals are screaming for feed and farmers cannot provide it, it is a particularly stressful time.  Farm organisations have been strong on the issue and we have instructed our inspectors to be much more sensitive in how they inspect farms and deal with farmers for the next two to three weeks.  We cannot simply stop inspections because we have an obligation to ensure monitoring takes place, but farmers will see a very different attitude in recognition of the prevailing stress levels.</p><p>  One of the things that always adds some positivity in agriculture and farming communities is if payments are made ahead of schedule.  At this time of year we would normally deal with 100 AEOS payments a week, but last week we dealt with 800.  More than &euro;500,000 was paid out last week and in the next ten days &euro;2.5 million will be paid out through the AEOS.  Ordinarily, these payments would be spread over the next month to six weeks, but we have people working around the clock to make the payments.  Even complex cases are being paid.  Unless there is a real reason to do so, there will not be a delay.  There is a helpline for the small number of farmers who have no feed and no money to buy it.</p> <p>I will discuss the availability of credit in a moment because there has been much discussion on this issue with banks, co-ops, grain merchants, feed merchants and so on.  There is a helpline in place and there is no reason for any animal in Ireland to be starving at present even though there is a shortage of feed.  A farmer who has no money to buy feed or who cannot access feed must contact the Department and we will pay to feed their animals.  Obviously, while this is a farmer support measure, it is primarily an animal welfare fund.  Members of the public who are concerned about the state of animals they have seen or heard also can ring the helpline and we will investigate it.  The number is 1850-211990 and there have been 117 calls to that helpline thus far this year, of which 48 have related to fodder and practically all of those calls have been within the past week.  The Department is dealing with this problem in a confidential way, farmer by farmer and case by case.  It is trying to ensure the welfare problem resulting from a fodder shortage is addressed and this probably means accessing feed from the co-operatives that are bringing it in and delivering it to those farmers who have a dramatic requirement for feed quickly.  A fund is in place that can be used for that purpose and I can add to it, as needed.  In my view, this is a demand-led fund as opposed to a fund about which I propose to give an actual figure.  Farmers who need help, if their animals are starving and they cannot get feed to them, should ask for help and my Department will give it to them.</p><p> The second point is that in the immediate term, what farmers need is not money but feed.  All the farming organisations will make that point and any farmer I have spoken to - I have spoken to many - will state that what they need at present is access to fodder and not a fund.  While everyone likes to have money to give out, in respect of the immediate crisis, what is needed is large volumes of roughage, namely, hay, haylage and silage for farmers or, in limited circumstances, straw as a temporary measure to get over a hump.  However, what really is needed is hay and haylage and in consequence, the agricultural infrastructure in Ireland, led by the co-operatives, are importing very large volumes of hay at present.  For example, Dairygold is bringing in truckloads of very large square bales at present.  Each truckload has 20 bales and to put that into perspective, each bale is equivalent to approximately 38 small bales.  Each such load will feed approximately 2,500 cattle for a day.  While I do not have to hand the exact figure, between 85 and 90 truckloads have come in thus far, which is sufficient feed for 234,000 animals for a day.  Another 150 truckloads are planned by Dairygold, which is bringing in between 25 and 40 truckloads every day, depending on the systems it has in operation.  It is dispensing these loads between its different co-ops around County Cork and parts of counties Limerick, Kerry and Clare.  Moreover, Dairygold is not alone in this regard.  For example, a smaller co-op, Drinagh Co-operative in west Cork, was the first to start importing hay.  Others also are doing it now, as Glanbia has really kicked into gear, as have Kerry, Lakelands, Connacht Gold and Wexford.  I met all the chief executive officers of the co-operatives yesterday and they all have agreed to increase dramatically the importation of large volumes of hay.  They will import it from the United Kingdom if they can get it there but if they are obliged to go further afield to other parts of Europe, they will do that too.</p><p> Consequently, farmers need to know there has been a significant response.  This has never happened before in living memory.  I can never remember this country being obliged to import large volumes of fodder from the United Kingdom.  While this is not a political statement about what is happening elsewhere, if one was watching the television station BBC Northern Ireland last night, one would have seen that a fodder crisis also is being spoken of there.  Moreover, people there were talking about following the example of the Republic in terms of how we are responding.  While we are doing a lot, we of course may need to do more, which is the reason I seek feedback from members.  However, this week I have recognised that to feed their animals, many farmers will be obliged to buy imported hay, which is expensive.  The Department has committed to covering the cost of transporting this hay to enable them to buy it at normal prices, if you like.  For example, Dairygold is bringing hay all the way from Kent, which is the other side of England.  It is an eight-hour trip to bring this hay to a port in United Kingdom to bring it across to Ireland.  Moreover, it is costing &euro;150 to bring into Ireland those big square bales.  They are being sourced for &euro;75 and it is costing &euro;75 to transport them here.  Consequently, for a farmer, it is costing &euro;150.  The Department is paying a large portion of the transport costs in order that farmers will be able to access those bales at approximately &euro;100 per bale.  The reason it is not the full &euro;75 is we must ensure the setting up of a system that encourages co-ops to drive the hardest bargain possible in respect of the cost of transport, for obvious reasons, as we do not want people to be profiting from this fodder crisis.  I have committed to spending &euro;1 million, essentially to ensure a reduction in the price of hay that is being imported for farmers of between one third and one half.  In many cases, the price will be reduced by one half.  As many people have questioned the reason only &euro;1 million has been committed, I note this will buy 1,000 truckloads of hay, which is enough to feed 2.6 million animals for a day.  These are the kinds of volumes under discussion.  If we get to a point at which more than 1,000 truckloads of hay come in from United Kingdom and we need to consider whether the scheme should be extended, then we will do so.  However, it is neither helpful nor necessary for me to start talking about more money.  The issue is not money; it is logistics.  It pertains to getting large volumes of fodder from the east coast of England to points all over Ireland and using the infrastructure we have in our co-ops, which covers every parish in the country, to get that fodder out of farmers and to manage this in a way that farmers are accessing it as they need it but are not over-accessing it, because other farmers will need it.</p><p> I reiterate, we had a really good meeting yesterday with the chief executives of all the co-ops and to give members an example of how seriously they are taking this issue, Stan McCarthy from the Kerry Group flew in from Chicago for the meeting.  Moreover, all the other key co-ops also were represented.  They have committed to ramp up significantly their efforts to bring large volumes of fodder and have agreed to an initiative on fertiliser because ultimately, this problem will be solved by growing grass and not by importing fodder indefinitely from the United Kingdom.  At present we have a big problem because many farmers out of necessity have put animals out on wetland they normally would be saving for the first cut of silage.  Cattle actually are trampling good grass into muddy ground, which has all sorts of negative consequences in terms of the availability of grass later on in the season and of silage for next winter.  Moreover, it is not overly-nutritious for the animals either because they are grazing too early before there is any real swarth there.  Therefore, both the Department and the co-ops are encouraging farmers to buy and to use fertiliser more extensively than they may normally do at this time of year, to try to get a real injection into the system to try to catch up, because the grazing season is approximately five weeks behind.  Co-ops will make available interest-free credit for farmers next month for fertiliser purchases.  They will extend credit facilities for farmers for fertiliser purchases, obviously within limits, to try to get an injection of grass growth into the system.  Thereafter, let us hope we will get the weather to actually deliver on that but we must always plan for the worst.  Were we to get another summer like last summer, we would have a continuing fodder crisis, even with some grass growth.  Consequently, the Department is planning for this to such an extent that it now is talking to co-ops about bringing in more hay than is required for the next two to three weeks, which is the crisis period.  The idea is farmers not only will buy enough roughage to feed their animals during this shortage but, even when grass is up and growing through the summer, enough will have been brought in to enable farmers to put some into storage as well as a security measure.</p> <p>The co-operatives agree on that and they are buying into it.</p><p> In relation to banks, I also met all of the key decision makers for all of the Irish banks that are lending to farmers - AIB, Bank of Ireland, Rabobank ACC and Ulster Bank.  They all were in yesterday and we had between an hour and two hours of a discussion.  If one looks at the statistics on banking and farming at present, what is happening is quite revealing.  For whatever reason - I have a fair idea what is the reason - farmers are not going to banks to deal with their credit problems.  There are serious credit issues for farmers.  There are very good prices, in terms of beef and milk.  These prices are getting stronger and there is no reason this year cannot be a reasonably good year for farming, despite the really bad start.  Banks want to lend money to farmers.  They are confident that they will be able to get their money back.  They want to make flexible credit facilities available to farmers.  They are talking to me about facilities, for example, of making short-term loans available to farmers and not asking for any repayment until harvest time or until the single farm payment comes in.  That is the kind of flexibility that they are happy to show to farmers.  I want to hear from farmers whether this is merely talk or whether it is happening.  For example, Ulster Bank has made &euro;25 million available for a weather-fodder fund - &euro;15 million of it in the autumn and another &euro;10 million this spring - and the bank is saying the farmers are not accessing it.  They want to make short-term loans available to farmers - an average of &euro;19,000 was the figure given.  They want farmers to come in and draw down that credit.  Likewise, Bank of Ireland, AIB and Rabobank all have specific teams in place that they want challenged by farmers.  If farmers are not getting the treatment they need, I need to hear about it and I will take an aggressive line for those farmers with the banks concerned given the kind of assurances that I have been given by senior staff in all of those banks.  In terms of credit, there is a banking system ready and waiting.  One cannot say the following about any other sector in the Irish economy, that banks want to lend to them.  They are publicly stating that they want to lend into agriculture and farming.</p><p> If one looks at the statistics on farming in Ireland, half of farmers in Ireland have no borrowings at all and the others have by and large viable businesses.  What we need to get over this particularly difficult period is access to credit at affordable rates with sensible repayment scheduling and from what I am being told, that is what banks want to provide.</p><p> There are other credit facilities available to farmers as well.  On the co-operatives, for example, the largest co-operative in Ireland, Glanbia, has made an extra &euro;15 million available to their customers this year.  Connacht Gold has done something similar.  It would not be quite as much because it would not have as much lending.  At Dairygold, it is somewhere between &euro;10 million and &euro;15 million.  The others are all the same.</p><p> Some of the co-operatives are giving interest-free credit because they want farmers feeding their animals and buying fertiliser to get grass growth because without the farmers doing so, they do not get the milk that they need.  This is a commercial decision as well as a compassionate one.  This is the big advantage of having a co-operative system in Ireland that can pull together in the interests of farmers, which is what is happening now.</p><p> There is significant credit available and there will be more in co-operatives, there is significant credit available that needs to be tested and drawn down within the banking system and there is credit available from feed merchants as well.  In some cases, there are examples of farmers being charged significant interest for credit and there is no reason that should happen given the offers that have been made from the banking system and the co-operatives.  I would encourage farmers to bear that in mind.</p><p> I do not want to pretend that, because of all that is being done, everything is okay here.  It is not.  Many farmers are extremely stressed and worried as to what the future holds for their animals.  There are farmers selling animals because they cannot feed them.  There has been a significant increase this year in the number of animals dying on farms.  On the figures as they compare to last year, by the end of March, the date for which I have data, last year 83,000 animals died on farms in the first quarter and this year the number is 106,000.  One needs to put that into context.  There are 130,000 farms in Ireland.  These are not figures on starvation.  These are calves that are dying at birth.  There is also a 3.5% increase in the number of calves in Ireland this year.  Of course, the figures also relate to animals dying because they are not getting the nutrients that they need and, therefore, they are picking up infections, diseases, etc.  There is an issue here.</p><p> There is a precedent.  After 2009, which was the previous really bad year for farming, there were similar figures for deaths on farms to what there are at present but if one looks at 2010, there was a dramatic improvement after that, and we can deliver that improvement as well this time.  The challenges are different from those of 2009, particularly from a fodder availability point of view, but if we can get over the next three weeks, this can be a year in which farmers can make their repayments and can make profits because prices are strong.</p><p> I am open to questions or suggestions.  Obviously, we will consider suggestions.  My focus, in terms of the money that we spend, is on getting fodder into farmyards to feed animals, not committing large amounts of money for a compensation fodder scheme or something like that.  I heard calls for a &euro;10 million fodder scheme.  If we were to introduce a &euro;10 million fodder scheme, we would have to do a number of things.  First, we would have to take it from farmers from somewhere else because there is no new funding.  Second, we would have to put a scheme in place for which we would have to get approval from the Department of Finance and the European Commission.  We also would have to put a system in place to allow farmers to apply for those funds and we would have to put the necessary checks in place to ensure that everybody who applies qualifies under a certain criteria, in other words, there would be no payments being made until July or August at the earliest when, hopefully, we will have left this fodder crisis behind us.  Instead of focusing on such a fodder scheme and all of the complexities and approvals around it, we have focused on turning around a targeted transport subsidy scheme - we turned that around in 48 hours in the Department - because that is what farmers, farming organisations and co-operatives were asking for.  It is about making feed available in a crisis as opposed to making some grand gesture in terms of committing large amounts of money, which, essentially, I would have to take from some other sector within agriculture to pay for.  We are dealing with the crisis at hand which is about getting feed from the United Kingdom into Ireland and making that available to farmers at an affordable price and in the quantities needed.  We want to go beyond the crisis need to provide extra fodder so that we can settle the nerves for the rest of the summer in terms of the fodder issues.  We are also focusing on ensuring that farmers can manage their finances and their credit through this awkward period where there has been an expensive winter which, hopefully, will be followed by quite a profitable summer and autumn because of the good prices to ensure that the credit and financial management around this year can work for as many farmers as possible.</p><p> Once again, if there are farmers who feel that all that is happening is just too much for them, then they need to call us and we will help them.  They should not let pride get in the way of that.  There is a lo-call number that I have given out on many occasions over the past couple of days, 1850 211 990, for them to do that.  </p><p> That is what we are doing.  If the members want us to do more or if they think we should be focusing differently, they should let us know and I will try to respond to that as realistically as I can.</p></speech>

I raised this issue in the D&aacute;il during Leaders&rsquo; Questions four weeks ago today.  While the response has been too slow and late, I welcome the action the Minister has taken.  The crisis is very significant.  I disagree with the Minister as there are two crises, the first of which is the physical shortage of fodder.  The Minister has spoken at length about that.  It puts many farmers who are already in financial difficulty in a position in which they will not have money.  Talking about giving more credit to people who do not have money does not solve the problem.  I have been saying from the beginning that there is a twin problem.</p><p>  I suggested some time ago that &euro;10 million be put aside.  Let me outline the normal practice in government.  In 2009, we put &euro;10 million aside for the flooding crisis that arose that autumn.  As it happened, we did not use all the money; it was put aside as a contingency.  A sum of &euro;10 million from &euro;1 billion is the equivalent of &euro;10 from &euro;1,000.  Therefore, I have no doubt that savings could be found within the Department in this regard.</p><p>  I accept in good faith the Minister's statement that he has put &euro;1 million upfront.  This is very good news.  For the first time, the Minister has given an unequivocal commitment on this matter.  The fund is for all those people who cannot afford to feed their cattle.  The fund is to be administered through the district veterinary offices.  I was seeking a similar scheme and suggested Teagasc but the Minister is to operate through the district veterinary officers.  He has said that whatever cash is needed will be made available to people through the offices to ensure they can feed their cattle or sheep.</p></speech>

If this had been said to me on 28 March, a lot of the grief and much of the pressure and hardship suffered since would not have been suffered.  However, is fearr go deireanach n&aacute; go br&aacute;ch.  I welcome the clear statement made by the Minister today.  I encourage people to ring the helpline, whose number is 1850 211990, because until now people did not know what they would get bearing in mind the money problem.</p><p>  I will not go into the anecdotal stories; we know they are true and that there are self-harm issues, etc., to be borne in mind.  I do not want to take up the time of the committee.  We all recognise that there is a very serious crisis.</p><p>  The Minister has answered a number of the questions I had anticipated asking.  He said the price to the farmer of a large bale of hay imported from Britain, with the transport subsidy removed, is approximately &euro;100.</p></speech>

There seems to be a dispute in this regard among farmers in Ireland who know a bit about the matter but I will leave that issue to them.</p><p>  There are many farmers who do not deal with dairy co-operatives.  They have no track record with them, nor do they have any credit facilities with them.  The dairy co-operative does not have a milk cheque to set against the price.  In some parts of the country, there are no dairy co-operatives.  What are the arrangements for the affected people?</p><p>  Will the banks continue to lend to those who have already exceeded borrowing limits, who are in trouble with the bank manager and who are in trouble their overdraft?  Have the banks given the Minister clear assurances in that regard?</p><p>  I accept the Minister's point that he will feed the animals directly.  I do not care how the animals get fed if they are fed.  The farmer will be happy to see the animals fed.  To whom must one apply?  What information is required by the officials when one seeks assistance?  How much assistance is available to farmers?  How does the system work?  Must the farmer in the circumstances I describe ring the helpline or go to the district veterinary office?  This needs to be absolutely clear and the message must be sent out to farmers.</p><p>  The Minister stated he will operate on an open-cheque basis.  I accept that as it is fair enough.  In the heel of the hunt, the funding I suggested a month ago will not be far off the funding that the Department will have to find.  So be it.</p><p>  The Minister said funding will be made available, if necessary.  The Minister quite rightly pointed out that commodity prices, including for milk and beef, are quite good at present.  Has any pressure been put on the factories and dairy processors to raise the prices of milk and meat so the producers will get a better income?  It is fine to keep lending money to people and taking it back from next year's cheque, but this means that the producer will have to pay this year's costs next year in addition to those of next year.  He will discover the solution was only temporary.</p><p>  The Minister gave details on payments.  With regard to agricultural scheme payments, what percentages are paid in respect of 2012?  I refer to the single payment scheme, the disadvantaged areas scheme, REPS 4 and AEOS 1 and 2.  With regard to the first two, I believe the percentage is fairly high.  With regard to the suckler cow scheme and all the other schemes pertaining to 2012, how far down the line are we in getting the cheques to farmers?  The Department could definitely send out cheques to people to whom they are due.</p><p>  Many have asked about prepayment under the disadvantaged areas and single payment schemes, for example.  I understand this cannot be done because of EU rules.  Will the Minister confirm whether there is any possibility that permission could be obtained, either under the national or EU-funded schemes, to make significantly earlier payments this year?   I do not mean a week earlier in the autumn.</p> <p> In the longer term, there will also be consequences for people who are destocking animals where they reduce the herd because they cannot feed them.  In addition, they anticipate that because of the late spring this year - and the issues the Minister highlighted, including fertiliser - they will not be able to feed the same number of stock next year either, so they will be destocking.  Has the Minister had discussions with the Minister for Finance on that matter because there are major tax implications for some farmers in destocking?  </p><p> I understand that many other people want to speak so I will finish there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.729" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1047" speakername="Martin Ferris" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013042500007#F00200"><p>I thank the Minister for attending the committee and for his presentation.  We are out of the blocks late, although that is not a personal criticism.  This matter was evident going back to late February when we had a continuous easterly wind for six or seven weeks.  In addition, the water table was excessively high as a consequence of a wet summer and wet winter.  Marginal land in the west and south west has been particularly badly hit as a result of the adverse weather conditions.  We will be so far behind when it comes to harvesting silage later this year that farmers will be a crop down at least.  This will continue on into next year and the difficulty will not go away in the short term, given the amount of cattle in the country.</p><p>  The banks want to lend but to whom will they lend?  Will they lend to people who have difficulties as it is, including small farmers?  The Minister said co-ops will give interest-free credit, which is welcome, and so they should because they are the main beneficiaries of the producers.  It is about time they put something back into it.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has got all these people together to alleviate the current situation.</p><p>  A sizeable number of small and weak farmers will have difficulty in approaching banks for money.  Such people may traditionally have had 15 or 20 sucklers, but they have been badly hit.  They now find they have spent whatever money they had to buy animal feed.  </p><p>  People in difficulties are being totally exploited by fellow farmers.  I know of cases where round bales of silage were sold for &euro;55 to &euro;60 per bale.  The same silage was worth approximately &euro;25 to &euro;30 per bale, so that is exploitation yet nothing has been done about it.  I do not know how they can live with their consciences having exploited their fellow small farmers who are so vulnerable at the moment.  </p><p>  The IFA and other farming groups are trying to make a connection with such farmers who may be too proud or shy to seek help.  They will slip between the cracks unless somebody makes that connection, but we need some form of structure to achieve that. </p><p>  While the &euro;1 million fund is welcome, I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that it may be totally inadequate.  It is a start, however.  I welcome the Minister's statement that more funding will be made available if necessary, which is encouraging.  </p><p>  The only way we will solve this is to work collectively with farming bodies and those with political responsibility to represent the communities we are speaking about.  It must be remembered that people are selling off cattle at the moment for prices that are collapsing.  A farmer with finished cattle is okay because factory prices are good, but those with yearlings or 18-month-old cattle must sell them for &euro;200 or &euro;300 less than this time last year.  The consequences of that will be felt as we move forward.</p><p>  In addition, we are going to lose the first crop of silage in marginal land.  If farmers have any drying they are putting cattle out on what would have been their silage.  I know people who have been spreading fertiliser for the last five weeks but it is a total waste because it is gone.  That means they need a second fertilisation of their land in order to get growth.  There was no growth there for seven weeks and it has only been there for the last couple of days when the wind went around to the south-west with a bit of rain.  Before that there was nothing.  I am driving around the country every week and can see fields that are burned because there is nothing there.  That needs to be taken into account, given what we have been through and the consequences that will arise later this year.</p></speech>

The allocation of funding is welcome as is the Minister's acknowledgement that it will have to be a rolling fund.  These emergency provisions will have to remain in place well into next year because this crisis will not ease over the next couple of weeks.  It will not be resolved quickly.</p><p>  We have all heard the banks saying they are willing to lend money, but in practice that has not happened.  The barriers that have put in place for people trying to access credit mean, in effect, that they cannot access it at all.  </p><p>  The Minister said the Department will not allow animals to go without feed and that he will arrange for them to be fed.  What is the process for farmers to access that feed?  Perhaps the Minister can outline the steps in that regard.  I imagine that if a farmer can access credit from a bank or co-op, the Department would not consider feeding those animals.  What will farmers be required to do to get that aid in cases where it will be very necessary?  </p><p>  The Minister said he has been planning for this since last autumn and was aware that the issue was coming up.  We have all heard stories about cattle starving to death in the fields, yet the response is only kicking in now.  How quickly will farmers get feed if they need to access it?  Will they be required to demonstrate that they cannot get it from their own resources before the Department steps in to provide it?</p></speech>

The main point he mentioned is true - this is not a financial issue, it is about the lack of fodder.  As others have already pointed out, it goes back to the bad weather last summer.  In the coming months, for the first time ever, there will be no surplus fodder left in the country.  In recent years, a certain number of farmers would always have silage, hay or straw left over, but for the first time ever that will not happen.  It will therefore have a knock-on effect for a number of years.  The newspapers usually carry notices of hay for sale but that will not happen any more.</p><p>  Teagasc will have to become involved in management and planning for the coming years to try to alleviate the problem.  It is a management issue from the farmers' point of view.  For example, if a farmer is normally used to feeding 100 cattle for the winter, yet only has feeding for 70, he will have to sell off cattle in advance.  There is no point in keeping 100 cattle if there is no feed for them, because somebody else may be able to feed them.  That situation will have to be managed in a proper and efficient way in the coming period to alleviate the problem. </p><p>  Deputy Ferris mentioned farmer exploitation and there are no better people to exploit one another than farmers.  We all know that.  One can see farmers around the country paying &euro;300 an acre for conacre grass, which is madness.  This has been going on for years but it has not changed and will not change.  It is not a new phenomenon and we all know that.</p><p>  Fertiliser is a big issue.  As was mentioned earlier, fertiliser is normally spread at the end of January or in early February in the eastern part of the country in particular.  However, it was done this year but with absolutely no effect.</p> <p>It is going to have a knock-on effect, notwithstanding the fact that milk prices are reasonably strong at the moment.  Our yields are down significantly due to the lack of grass, which means that while one is getting a better price, one does not have the same volume of production.  That will also have a knock-on effect.  There will be extra costs involved.</p><p> I welcome the fact that co-operatives are providing interest-free credit for fertilizer.  Glanbia is providing interest-free credit between May and July.  This will all depend on the weather.  We need a good spell of decent, mild weather in the coming period.  Unfortunately, the weekend is forecast to be bad, which will not help.  If we do not get good weather and the opportunity to grow grass, we will be in serious trouble.  Teagasc must play a significant role in planning for next winter and advise farmers about how to manage the feed stocks they may or may not have for next and the following year.</p></speech>

I welcome the move to keep pressure on banks.  It is very important that banks lend money to help those people who have difficulties.  The moves by co-operatives to bring in fodder are also very welcome.  Connacht Gold has compounded a cheap ration, which I referred to the other day and which will cost approximately &euro;240 to &euro;250 per tonne.  It will be a major help along with roughage, which is also very important.  For people who have a bit of roughage land for cattle also, the compound ration will help to alleviate the problem.</p><p>  I compliment my colleagues in the IFA, some of whom are in attendance, for their work over the last number of days.  We all worked like that in difficult years previously.  The more fodder, hay and people who work together, the better it will be.  There is a serious problem with fertilizer.  I have some at home in a shed which I could not spread due to the risk of rain.  If one spread it, it might have been washed away and in any event it would have been lost as there was no growth there.  We hope that there will be some mild weather.</p><p>  I welcome the move to fast-track AEOS payments due to farmers.  I received calls this morning on the way to the committee and am aware that there is a small number of farmers who had a problem with their disadvantaged-area application and single-farm payment last year.  They have been penalised or their payments held up.  It is their own fault as farmers sometimes throw a letter on the dresser and do not respond to it.  They are now under pressure and wonder if matters can be sorted out.  I will be in touch with the Minister's office to sort out a few problems that are there.  We must all work together and hope the weather improves to provide a bit of growth.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.735" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2013042500008#G00300"><p>I thank members for being constructive, which is helpful.  It has been suggested that there are two problems, namely, fodder and money.  I accept that money is a problem for some farmers, but the main priority for farmers across the country is to feed their animals.  That must be the focus of the funds we have available to us to spend.  The emergency welfare fund is about feeding animals that will otherwise not be fed, for whatever reason.  We are less interested in the reason and more interested in ensuring the animals are fed.  We will then work with owners to establish why it was necessary.  Obviously, we want to get large volumes of fodder into the State by getting a real drive going through co-operatives, which is what we are doing.</p><p>  On the money issue, I have got a very strong sense from co-operatives, banks and, to a certain extent, feed merchants that they will make extra credit available even to people who have reached credit ceilings to get them over this particular crisis.  They are not going to let animals starve due to a lack of credit.  If I thought access to credit was a major problem, we would look at addressing it.  All of the indications I have received from banks and co-operatives are that credit is available even for people in difficult financial situations to buy feed to get farmers and their herds over a difficult period and into a normal growing season.  I am not talking about remortgaging houses or rescheduling machinery loans.  If credit is not available and people cannot feed their animals, they should contact us and we will feed them.</p><p>  A number of people have asked how the system works.  We have deliberately left the system as it is to allow our DVOs to use their common sense.  We set up an animal welfare hotline some 18 months ago as part of the Department's animal welfare initiative and in the context of the legislation the Houses of the Oireachtas spent many hours debating.  It allows members of the public to pick up the phone and express to departmental officials concerns about welfare situations in urban and rural areas, including where farm animals cannot be fed.  If farmers themselves have concerns about the welfare of their own animals where they cannot afford to keep them, they can also use the hotline.  We will respond.  The line is open until midnight every night.  If no one answers, we will revert to a person who leaves a message within half an hour.  The line is being monitored all the time.  I have had some of my staff test it to ensure that it is working and we have assigned extra staff due to the significant increase of activity on the line.  Where a person expresses concern, we contact a local DVO and a vet will go to talk to the person concerned.</p><p>  This is not an attempt to catch people out or attribute blame, it is a welfare response.  The last paragraph of the note which has recently been circulated to DVOs may give members an idea of the kinds of actions we are taking.  It sets out that this is a short-term measure.  It recommends that arrangements for delivery of <i>circa</i> ten bales of silage or ten bales of hay - though this could vary depending on the herd size - or equivalent feed value concentrate be made immediately for farmers in need.  It suggests that a limit of &euro;500 to &euro;1,000 can be authorised by the local veterinary officer and an invoice sent to the Department.  This is about the immediate injection of feed into a farm that needs it to ensure animals do not starve.  We are working with all sorts of people to ensure that we can access the necessary feed.  If someone contacts his or her local IFA representative or other farm organisation, those bodies can approach us and we will follow the matter up.  If people contact their Teagasc advisors or local DVOs, the mechanism can also be triggered.  We are here to help people who are in extreme situations.</p><p>  I will not allow any animal to starve if the Department is given notice and can intervene.  It is what we are trying to do in the Department.  Whatever it costs, it costs.  I will have to find the money in our budget and if we have to take the money from other schemes, we will.  It will not cost that much as our programme is targeted on individual cases.  Whatever money is needed will be made available.  The system is deliberately a flexible one to ensure that veterinarians and authorised officers are not prevented from responding due to a technical qualification criterion.  We want the scheme to be flexible to ensure that we can respond to urgent situations.  That is necessary in many cases.  We know the farming community very well in the committee and that many farmers wait until the last minute to call for help.  We must, therefore, intervene quickly to ensure we put the necessary assistance in place.</p><p>  The question of non-dairy co-operative customers is an important one.</p> <p>Many have asked me if Dairygold or Glanbia would help a non-dairy co-operative customer.  We have received a clear commitment from the chief executives of the co-ops that everyone in their catchment areas will be helped as some dry stock farms are faced with difficult circumstances too.  Many dry stock farmers will have accounts with co-op agri-stores and will be able to pick up what they need from them.  In Dairygold&rsquo;s case, it had been limiting its stocks to one bale per farmer which would have fed about 130 cattle for a day.  It had to ration stocks to ensure there would be enough supplies for everyone.  I hope that will change in the coming days.  In the note I received an hour ago all of the co-ops are ramping up the volumes of fodder they are bringing in.</p><p> There was a request of an advance payment of &euro;1,000 to every farmer in the disadvantaged area scheme, DAS, and the single farm payment scheme.  It is important to be realistic about this.  My Department is not a bank.  The total for such advance payments would come to &euro;100 million, a cost we cannot carry.  I do not have it and would have to ask the Department of Finance to give it to me five months before it should paid.  My Department would then have to carry the bridging cost.  We do not have the facility to do this.  However, if I could do it, I would.</p><p> I met the European agriculture Commissioner before a Council meeting this week.  I informed him about our fodder crisis and made it clear Ireland would be applying for early payment of the single farm payment.  I hope half of the payment will be made six weeks earlier to improve farmers&rsquo; cash flow in the autumn.  Everyone knows, however, that DAS payments are made in September every year around the same time as the National Ploughing Championships.  If I could, I would bring forward the payments.  However, I cannot raise expectations on something I cannot deliver.  We will pay out early on those schemes on which we can such as the AEOS, the agri-environment options scheme.  In the next ten days to two weeks we anticipate paying out &euro;2 million in AEOS 2 payments.  We paid out &euro;500,000 last week to 800 farmers in AEOS 1 final payments.  All of these were problem cases which required clarification.</p><p> Deputy Ferris commented on farmers exploiting each other.  It is important to balance that comment by saying there are many farmers who are giving their neighbours fodder free of charge.  Much of this is being facilitated by farm organisations.  I can name many farmers in my area who have been feeding their neighbours&rsquo; animals for three weeks already and have not charged them for it.  I accept there is some exploitation, with people looking to profit from other people&rsquo;s misery.  That should not be happening, but that is what happens when one has a market in which there is massive demand and little or no supply.</p><p> The waste of fertiliser is an issue.  Farmers have had to pay a fortune to feed animals they would normally be feeding with silage.  The cost of grazing animals at this time of year should be about 50 cent a day per animal as opposed to &euro;4 per animal per feed ration.  That is a big difference and it is costing the sector a fortune every day.  Even with all of this, the banks still want to lend money into the system, as they think this can be a profitable year for farmers who will be able to pay off their debts.  The banks are also stating that if a farmer cannot pay off this year, they are willing to put repayment schedules in place in the next 18 months to two years.  Ulster Bank&rsquo;s proposal in its weather fund has a standard 18 month repayment period rather than six to seven months.  I encourage farmers to test the banking system.  If what the banks are telling me is not happening, I need to know about it and I will publicly highlight it, if it is the case.  I can understand the scepticism around banks, but that is the case across so many other sectors too.  It is one of the reasons farmers are not engaging with their banks on this issue.</p><p> I agree with Deputy Deering that milk volumes are down.  It is in everyone&rsquo;s interests to get grass growing.  That is why we need to make fertiliser affordable and available through credit.  Everyone recognises that solving this problem is like solving Ireland&rsquo;s wider economic problem and doing so will help grow the economy.  This is about moving away from emergency measures of having to import from the United Kingdom and growing our own grass.  We grow grass better than anyone else in the world.  Teagasc has informed me today that it is switching its advice focus not only on fodder management but also on financial management in getting over this credit problem for farming.  I encourage farmers to speak to their Teagasc advisers, as well as private agricultural advisers.</p><p> I know Connacht Gold has made a product available which is cheaper than ration would normally be.  That is a useful and good response to what is happening.  However, animals need roughage too.  One cannot feed animals on pure meal alone.  That is why many farmers are mixing meal with straw.  It is a stopgap measure but not the solution we need.  We need grass, hay and haylage.</p></speech>

There is another problem which has not been spoken about at the committee - the psychological pressure farmers are under.  One action the Minister can take today is to instruct that all farm and forestry inspections temporarily cease until such time as the crisis is over.  I am not suggesting farmers would do anything wrong.  Like a hole in the head, what a farmer needs least is a farm inspection.  If the Minister was to state today that, to assist farmers with the psychological trauma they are going through, he was instructing his officials the length and breadth of the country to temporarily stop farm inspections until the crisis was over, it would be a positive measure.</p> <p>I would be very grateful if he could respond.</p></speech>

He asked us for genuine suggestions in respect of it and I will put four very brief ones to him.  Will he look at leasing a ship, bringing it to Kent, which is well serviced by ports, and shipping fodder from Kent to here?  This would significantly reduce the price of fodder.  Will he access the EU solidarity fund?  Funding has been used in the past specifically through Teagasc where the Minister dealt with farmers on an case-by-case basis.  It was very successful in the past.  He could access the EU solidarity fund to deal with issues in particular areas, for example, in Clonown in my constituency where they have now lost four consecutive years of meadow because of flooding of the callows.  There is a significant problem with feed and fertiliser merchants who cannot access credit.  They cannot pass it on to farmers because they are already overextended and something needs to be done in respect of that.  I commend the Minister on looking at the advance buying of fodder because these weather conditions could continue for a number of weeks or months.  I suggest that the Department should actively engage with NAMA to access some of the NAMA warehousing to centrally store some of this forage in advance of when it is needed.  While it may be shipped in by Dairygold at the moment, in six weeks time, the crisis could be in the west or north east of Ireland.  Fodder could be accessed at a number of storage facilities held by NAMA around the country and shipped to wherever it is required in a couple of weeks' time.</p></speech>

There is one thing I need to get clarification on.  When he says he is committed to covering the cost of importing the hay, which is &euro;50 out of transport costs of &euro;75 in the case of the big bales, how will that happen?  He has explained about credit and getting meal.  A man contacted me yesterday.  Prior to hearing that his costs might be covered for transport, he and a neighbouring farmer spent &euro;1,200 on importing hay.  This person is wondering how he will be able to avail of this subsidy.</p><p>  Deputy Naughten raised the crisis they have every year on the Shannon callows.  At what stage will the Government put the NPWS back in its fundamentalist environmentalist box and tell it that sometimes there are bigger priorities than snails, flies and butterflies?  There are people who are at the end of their tether not during this crisis but in the last year and years before that who seem to come last below all species that live in the area.</p><p>  My final point concerns the feeding of horses, donkeys and ponies.  Where I come from, I received a call four or five weeks ago from concerned people about the fact that a horse was found dead in a field with an emaciated horse beside it and another horse was thrown in the woods about 300 m away.  A significant number of people contacted me about it because it was the side of the main Dublin road.  I do not keep horses and do not know enough about it but the consistent message given to me was that there needs to be some sort of systematic cull or some system put in place whereby many of these animals can be put out of their misery.  I know it is not ideal but I do not think it fair that they are hanging around in an emaciated state in fields because people who bought them with their best interests at heart do not have the money to take care of them.  What can be done in this area because it is a massive problem?</p></speech>

I assure the Minister that he will never have to check on his official or those like him because they are always working hard.  I certainly welcome the &euro;1 million fund.  It is a start but it is only a drop in the ocean.  I thank the IFA and other organisations, such as Coolmore Stud in my own county which did not export fodder but recently sent it to Clare and the west.  We should have seen this problem coming.  Coming on the back of a long wet summer, cattle are in for nearly 12 months and we do not have a great deal before that either.  I do not agree with my colleague beside me that the Government acted in time.  It was way too late.  Deputies &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Healy-Rae and I, along with others, have been raising this issue for five or six weeks.  Any of us who knows anything about farming knew there was no growth given the temperatures.  Indeed the temperatures are still forecast to be very low for the next number of weeks.</p><p>  I am alarmed.  I heard the Minister, for whom I have always had great respect, say on Saturday morning that the banks were ready, willing and able.  That could not be further from the truth.  I would go along with Deputy Healy-Rae's argument that farm inspections should be stopped.  I would then ask farm inspectors to attend at the banks with farmers because there are forms to be filled, the managers with which they deal are gone and all relations between most businesspeople and banks have broken down.  We know that.  As was said by Deputy Naughten, the merchants are totally overextended with regard to credit so there is a significant problem there.  The Minister must bring the Department of Finance into it.  He said he had to go to the Department of Finance.  The Department of Finance should be in this because this is a national issue and because farming is the area that brought us out of previous recessions.  This is demoralising and depressing for farmers and their stress levels are huge.  I ask the Minister to send inspectors to chaperone farmers at the bank and see how far they get.  Most of them will not get past the counter because the banks do not want to know.  They are already removing their overdrafts.  That is my experience and I am in business as well.  </p></speech>

It is having a huge knock-on effect.  It is 25 April.  The Minister knows that in his county, silage has not been cut.  It will not be cut for at least another three weeks and will have a significant effect.  This is not going to go away but will continue into next winter and be very serious.  The disadvantaged area payments have to be released and the Department of Finance must become involved because this is a major crisis and bigger than we think.  We must get the Department of Finance and the Taoiseach to understand how serious it is and deal with it because the rest of the economy is depending on farming.</p></speech>

Everybody, including farm organisations and co-operatives, was managing this through a difficult winter but everybody was anticipating that we would have some kind of normal spring beginning about a fortnight ago.  When that did not happen, we had to kick into a new response because all of a sudden, there was a fodder access issue - we had literally run out.  We are now responding to that in as comprehensive a way as we can.  The point I am making is that the level of the commitment by Government should not be measured in terms of whether there is a &euro;1 million fund available.  What we are doing is targeting money where it is needed, which is to support the importation of large volumes of fodder, to make that available to farmers at affordable prices and to ensure they can get the credit to buy it if they need it.  If we need to go further, we need to go further.  That is why I have said in terms of the welfare fund that if animals are starving in parts of Ireland, I want to hear about it and we will intervene.  We will make that work regardless of the cost consequences.</p> <p>With the exception of the transport subsidy, two or three weeks ago we were trying to increase the pace at which we were making payments because I knew farmers were stressed.  Approximately ten days ago we instructed inspectors to be more careful in how they approached and treated farmers.  We have a legal obligation to ensure the rules are kept.  That is linked with single farm payments, disadvantaged areas payments and all of the other payments provided through the European Union.  We have to inspect farms, but we are doing what we can to avoid putting pressure on farmers in the inspection process.  If I simply cancelled inspections for the next couple of weeks, I would be audited by the Commission and the committee would then be asking me about disallowances, or fines, because the Commission had refused to pay money linked with schemes in respect of which we had not properly implemented the rules.  I have to implement the rules, but I have made it clear to inspectors that they are to treat farmers with respect, which they should always do, and sensitivity, given the stress they are under.  Sometimes when a crisis emerges on a farm, inspections can help because if inspectors are doing their job properly, they can bring back information that will allow us to respond.</p><p> We have had a discussion on shipping fodder.  Instead of importing individual lorryloads of hay, I am anxious to transport a couple of shiploads into Cork, Galway, Waterford and, perhaps, Killybegs or on the east coast.  I have asked the CEOs of the co-ops to consider this option and we had a conversation on the issue yesterday.  It is a more complex logistical exercise because it requires the co-ops to act collectively rather than use their own transport systems.  They will revert to me within the next couple of days with a response on increasing significantly the volume of hay being imported.  That matter is under consideration as part of the mix.  My Department does not have the logistical capability to do this, but a big company such as Glanbia or Dairygold does.  The business of such companies includes management of their transportation systems to collect large volumes of milk on a daily basis and deliver feed.  That is why we are working through the co-ops.</p><p> If it is possible to access funds from the EU solidarity fund, we will try to do so.  It would be dangerous for me to raise expectations in that regard, however, because I have been through many debates in which people have sought money under that fund.  Normally it is sought in response to massive forest fires, widespread flooding and other extreme weather events and natural disasters.  Many countries in Europe are dealing with fodder shortages.  This is not the only country to have a delayed spring.  I do not know whether we can successfully argue a case for accessing the solidarity fund on grounds of a fodder management system that is out of sync with the weather.  We will investigate our options and if it is possible to draw down funds, of course, we will not leave anything behind.  However, I would be slow to raise expectations around the fund because I know it is difficult to access.</p><p> We have had a conversation with the banks about merchants receiving credit.  I understand the issue is not significant.  If members have experience of cases that show otherwise, I have a direct contact in all of the main banks and will pursue the issue.  There is a genuine understanding a credit issue has emerged in Ireland and money has been made available to address it.  The banks have assigned teams of people to meet farmers and fill in forms with them rather than throwing them a form of ten or 12 pages.  That is what I have been told and I want to test the commitment I received yesterday.  It is easy to beat up the banks for obvious reasons, but in this instance I have received strong commitments on providing the financial assistance and credit the farming community needs.  I can only take such commitments at face value and encourage farming organisations to test them.  </p><p> As regards having a centre for storing fodder, we have thought about this option, but I want the co-ops to manage storage.  If they have fodder that is additional to demand, I want them to store it.  Most of them have indicated that there is no issue in this regard because they have extensive storage facilities located close to farming communities.  I suspect there will be demand for everything we bring in, even if we dramatically ramp up imports because farmers will want to store extra hay as an insurance measure, particularly if they can access feed at affordable prices.</p><p> In regard to the operation of the transport subsidy, farmers will fill in their forms in the co-ops.  I witnessed one such transaction in Dairygold last weekend.  The co-op will bring in a load of hay and farmers will arrive with their tractors or jeeps to get the bale.  Who gets what will be clearly calculated.  We have to give the subsidy to the farmer because there will be issues with European competition law if we give it to the co-op.  The farmer will receive credit or a cheque to the value of the transport subsidy.  In other words, the price will be reduced.  Most farmers have accounts with co-ops and their accounts will simply be credited if they fill in the forms.  That is why we are using the co-ops.  I have advised farmers who club together to import large volumes of hay from the United Kingdom that we cannot give them direct subsidies because we would lose control and management of the situation.</p></speech>

My officials spoke to the CEO of Connacht Gold today.  If farmers or buyers groups can source fodder from the United Kingdom, they should do so through their co-op.  I understand the co-ops will try to facilitate them in drawing down the subsidy.</p><p>  A two-pronged issue arises in respect of horses.  First, horses are left to forage for themselves in fields lacking grass and, second, blatant cruelty is evident in some cases.  We are trying to act on this issue.  My Department has never been as busy in this area, not only because people are reporting more but also because we are taking a more proactive and aggressive approach.  We work with local authorities and culling is happening in some cases where animals are in such an emaciated state that the humane thing to do is to put them out of their misery.  However, a property rights issue arises because these animals are owned by somebody.  The State cannot simply confiscate them and put them down before going through a process.  In some cases animals are claimed by their owners after we pick them up only to be picked up again a couple of weeks later.  This is a difficult issue to address.  We have new legislation with the Animal Health and Welfare Bill 2012 which will be enacted presently.</p> <p>By the start of next month we will also have our new, centralised database for horses in place.  That will not be the perfect system but is the first step towards a much better system whereby the agencies that can grant passports will all contribute to a central database.  We will have that central database and will then move onto the next step to continue to improve that system.  That will help us to know who owns the animals and where they are.  We have learned many lessons during the horsemeat scandal and we have done much thinking about how we can improve the area of horse identification and passports, although that was not directly linked to the horsemeat scandal but was a policy byproduct of it.  Members will see much change there in the coming weeks.</p><p> I do not want to comment on NPWS because we are dealing with the fodder issue today.  If Deputy Mattie McGrath knows of farmers who are going into banks and are not getting a service or the support they need, I need to hear about it and we will follow up on it.  As I said before, I take seriously and at face value the commitments I have received from banks.  I appreciate that commitment because it is significant and I encourage farmers to test that.  If it is not happening as it should, I need to hear about it and we will take a very public and critical line on banks if they do not follow through on the promises they have made to me.</p></speech>

I do appreciate it.</p><p>  I am the director of the national kidney and pancreas transplant programme.  This programme is also responsible for organ procurement which is the main topic of discussion today.  I have been committed to this programme for 30 years, having personally performed over 1,500 kidney and pancreas transplants and 300 organ procurements.  I feel I am in a position to comment at least on my own area which is organ procurement, kidney and pancreas transplant.</p><p>  The programme started in Jervis Street in 1964 and this year we will complete our 4,000th transplant.  This puts the national kidney transplant programme in the top 20 in the world in terms of numbers done.  We started only six years after the first successful transplant was done in Boston.  We have been at this a long time and I have seen many things happen.  Every initiative and advance in this area has been made through the hard work of a few committed individuals.  There has never been a national approach to the concept and problems associated with organ donation and kidney transplantation.  For example, when we moved to Beaumont in 1987 they forgot that there was a transplant programme moving from Jervis Street and we had to re-jig the urology ward.  Essentially that <i>ad hoc</i> concept is how transplantation has been dealt with since.</p><p>  The main subject of the discussion today is organ procurement.  While we need more organ donors I want to emphasise the impact of that on a service that is already stretched beyond its limits in which we are already failing our patients.  The numbers waiting are increasing but the numbers being transplanted are not.  I will talk about the lack of organ donors, the poor infrastructure in which transplant patients are housed, the shortage of transplant surgeons which is reaching crisis and what I think the ideal for the country should be.</p><p>  The more donors we have the more organs are available for our patients with end organ failure - liver, kidney, pancreas, heart and lung.  There is a global shortage of organs for transplantation, particularly kidneys.  It is generally accepted around the world, particularly the western world where this is taken very seriously, that renal failure management is going to bankrupt health services in the next 20 years.  I do not know the figures here but in the United States already something like 15% of the health care budget goes on less than 1% of the renal failure patients.  With diabetes and end-stage renal failure increasing this will get worse.  We need to address this because if we do not we will be talking about rationing dialysis in the not too distant future.  That means that there will be no dialysis for people like me or anyone over 60.  If one is under a certain age there will be no dialysis.  If perhaps one is mentally retarded, or if one is not a valuable member of society, there will be no dialysis and so on.  This is a slippery slope and it happens in countries that cannot sustain themselves with transplantation, such as India, Pakistan and Israel, where people go abroad and buy kidneys because there is no alternative apart from dying.  While one can have ethical concerns about that, if one has to choose between dying and buying a kidney most people eventually will buy the kidney.  That is a slippery slope that is at the end of failure to address this problem while we can still do something.</p><p>  We have reached a plateau in transplantation in Ireland.  We have approximately 18-20 donors per 1 million of the population which up to ten years ago was one of the best rates in Europe.  Seeing the coming storm, most European countries have adopted a process of investing in organ donation.  It has been done under the concept of presumed consent, the soft opt-out.</p> <p>The legislation had certain achievements, including bringing transplantation into mainstream discussion at government level in these countries.  Most people involved in transplantation travel and know the real advantage is the huge investment in infrastructure at local donating hospital level.</p><p> I am sure everyone here knows that presumed consent does not mean a thing.  Nobody anywhere in the world takes organs from a child or a person's loved one without seeking the permission of the family.  This just does not happen.  One can call it what one likes.  The presumed consent concept should mean it is presumed anyone looking after a patient who has died offers the family the opportunity to donate.  This is an immense consolation to the family.  It is a service to a family who has lost a loved one and is not just an organ procurement agency looking to do more business.  It offers immense consolation down the line that a young person's family knows that at least, out of a hopeless situation, five people had their lives saved and significantly improved.  The other side of the coin is that occasionally we receive letters from families who were not offered this consolation and not asked about organ donation.  It is usually out of a perceived kindness as medical personnel wonder how can they possibly bring up this topic at such a time.  It is a very delicate area which needs to be examined. The kernel of the problem is that people do not ask because they feel, and justifiably so, that as they have been looking after someone for a while they cannot possibly turn around and ask.  I support the concept of soft opt-out presumed consent, but only if it brings organ donation into the main arena and introduces a presumption that everyone wants to do it, and the infrastructure must go in at ground level, which has been the message throughout Europe.</p><p> We must address the issue of infrastructure.  Hospitals are generally accepted as the location of some of the saddest and happiest moments of our lives.  Internationally it is recognised that when it comes to architecture, hospitals should be among the most inspiring public buildings.  Every one of us has horror stories and happy stories from hospitals and can empathise with this.  The situation in most hospitals is unacceptable for 2013 living.  We should examine having something similar to the situation in Norway, a country of 4.6 million people.  It has one transplant centre which does six times as many lungs and twice as many kidneys as we do.  We must look at this.</p><p> The next problem in transplantation is transplant surgeons.  No transplant surgeons means no transplant.  This is a bigger crisis than the lack of donors for the continuation of transplantation in Ireland.  Transplantation surgery cannot recruit young people into training.  Anyone we do train goes to the United States the minute he or she can tie a knot because of the opportunities there.  It involves night work and weekend work and is not what we call a lifestyle-friendly medical career, which is what many graduates seek nowadays.  I will give an example of the impact.  Transplant surgeons have the second highest divorce rate among surgeons in the world.  Neurosurgeons have a higher rate, mainly because they are neurosurgeons.  With transplant surgeons it is because of the lifestyle - they are never there.</p></speech>

Triplicating services is not a great idea.  Consider the expertise that liver can bring to kidney and heart and lung can bring to pancreas.  I do not have any idea where such a centre should be, but the issue should be addressed.  It is a very cost-effective way of treating people and we should consider it seriously.</p><p>  We should examine the model in Norway.  We should develop a national centre for organ transplantation, and perhaps bone marrow could be included in that, because the personnel involved have a great deal of expertise in infections and immunosuppression.  The new national centre should be located in a university hospital, independent of that hospital's board and CEO and answering only to the national organ donation and transplant office of the HSE and the Department of Health.  This is essential if we are to stem the tide which is beginning to overflow us.  To give an example of how serious the situation is, we have 65 patients who have been fully worked up with their donors for living donor transplantation.  These are people who have taken time off work and gone to significant expense to donate a kidney to a loved one.  However, we cannot give these people dates for their transplants.  At the rate we are transplanting, they will have to wait two and a half to three years to get their living donor transplant.  This means that in two years they will have to be re-evaluated and some of the organs concerned will have deteriorated and will no longer be transplantable.  A person may have had a blood transfusion and become immunologically incompatible.  We risk losing them.  The other problem is that these patients are also on the deceased donor list.  People who already have a living donor allocated end up getting a deceased donor and taking a kidney off someone else.</p><p>  I thank the committee for the opportunity to bring our problems to the fore.  I have no doubt that in two years' time we will be cutting the ribbon on a brand-new national organ transplant centre which will be a world leader in its field.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.776" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Peter Conlon" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013042500004#D00500"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to speak about organ transplantation in Ireland.  I am the clinical director of one of the largest kidney transplant centres in the British Isles and have more than 20 years of experience in kidney transplantation.  The views I express are shared by the vast majority of my colleagues in the care of dialysis and transplant patients in Ireland.</p><p>  Patients with kidney failure have a number of therapeutic options.  It is true to say that most patients in the world with kidney failure die without any significant treatment, as the treatment, although effective, is extremely expensive and requires a very sophisticated medical system to deliver it.  Patients with kidney failure who have the good fortune to live in Ireland have access to a number of treatment options including peritoneal dialysis, home haemodialysis, in-centre haemodialysis, deceased donor kidney transplantation or live donor transplantation.</p><p>  Kidney transplantation is without question the best treatment for almost all patients with kidney failure.  It provides the best quality of life for patients with kidney failure, more than doubles their life expectancy compared to remaining on dialysis and, in the process, saves the State more than &euro;750,000 over the lifetime of the recipient for each kidney transplant performed.  Many patients receiving a live donor kidney transplant can reasonably expect their transplanted organs to function for more than 40 years, which mostly means for the rest of their lives.  There are many impediments to delivering more kidney transplants, but the major impediment at present is the availability of suitable donors and the infrastructure to deliver these transplants.</p><p>  As Professor Hickey described, Ireland has had a successful kidney transplant programme for almost 50 years, but it is nothing like as successful as it could or should be.  Ireland should be aspiring to achieve kidney transplantation success similar to that of Norway.  Professor Hickey has already described some of the Norwegian experiences.  I will compare the two countries in terms of their approach to kidney transplantation.  Ireland has a population of 4.6 million, and Norway has a similar population of 4.8 million.  Ireland has performed an average of 150 kidney transplants per year over the past ten years, while Norway has performed between 270 and 300 transplants annually.  As a result of this difference in kidney transplant activity, Norway has a stable population of 370 patients on maintenance dialysis while Ireland has more than 1,800 patients on dialysis.  Ireland could, with appropriate investment, within a few years achieve transplantation results similar to Norway, with enormous benefits to patients with kidney failure in Ireland, and in the process save the State more than &euro;300 million.</p><p>  The scarcest resource in transplantation is organ donors.  Kidney transplantation is almost unique among organ transplantation in that living donors are a major source of organs for successful transplantation.  I will first discuss deceased kidney donation.</p> <p>Organ procurement in Ireland, which is essential for all the disciplines of transplantation - including heart, lung and liver - is run on a shoestring.  All organ procurement is run out of an office in Beaumont Hospital staffed by five very committed and professional transplant co-ordinators.  These individuals also have many other duties besides organ procurement.  There is practically no infrastructure for organ procurement outside Beaumont Hospital in the regional hospitals.  The transplant co-ordinators at Beaumont Hospital have developed a network of link nurses in each intensive care unit, ICU, who - in their spare time - assist in educating their colleagues on organ procurement.  This is no way to run a transplantation service.</p><p> These issues have become all the more urgent in view of the fact that the recently implemented EU directive on organ donation mandates the separation of organ procurement and transplantation and also insists on much more rigorous traceability and organ quality  criteria.  There is an urgent requirement to establish a formal national organ procurement agency, which would provide a national resource to every ICU and emergency room in the country, namely, expertise in organ procurement.  As already stated, Ireland has five transplant co-ordinators.  Northern Ireland, with a population less than half the size of the Republic's, has 27 and in the UK there are more than 200.  When the UK recently implemented an investment in organ procurement, there was a 50% increase in organ donations.  Implementing resources to properly manage organ donation is far more important than implementing a presumed consent law and is likely to result in a far more dramatic increase in organ donation.</p><p> Living donor kidney transplantation is also an important process in treating kidney failure and delivers far better long-term results than deceased kidney transplantation.  I am pleased to inform members that the Department of Health and the HSE have recently committed funding to deliver the first phase of a very significant expansion in live kidney donation and have agreed, in principle, to fund a plan which, it is hoped, will deliver during the next three years 100 living kidney donation operations annually.  This plan has been stymied at every turn and has not yet been implemented.  I am unsure when it will be implemented, despite the urgent need that exists.  There are currently almost 100 kidney donor-recipient pairs awaiting living kidney donation in Ireland.</p><p> There are, however, a number of very important other issues that need to be urgently addressed if Ireland is to realise the full potential of living kidney donation.  In this regard, the implementation of the human tissue Bill will be necessary to deliver on the relevant targets.  The first of the issues to which I refer relates to coverage of the out-of-pocket expenses of living kidney donors.  Each living kidney donor saves the State more than &euro;750,000 euros in health care costs.  Currently, however, a living donor pays all expenses relating to travel to and from the hospital, extra child care costs, etc.  Typically, a living donor will require several weeks off work following such major surgery and thus will not be available for work.  It typically costs each living kidney donor between &euro;5,000 and &euro;7,000 in lost income and out-of-pocket expenses.  It is common practice in most developed countries for health authorities to cover out-of-pocket expenses for living kidney donors.  In the UK, the state covers up to &pound;5,000 in such expenses.  The EU directive requires the Minister for Health to implement such a system.  I urge him to implement it without further delay.   It is unfair that not only does a living kidney donor gives up one of his kidneys but that it also costs him so much money in lost income.</p><p> I am aware of at least two Irish individuals who wanted to become altruistic kidney donors.  Such donors are people who recognise that there is a major need in respect of those with kidney failure and offer to donate one of their own kidneys to individuals they do not know.  As a result of the lack of legislation permitting such donation in this country, it is not yet possible.  The two altruistic donors to whom I refer donated their kidneys to people in the UK because it was not possible to donate in Ireland.  This means that two kidneys were lost to Irish patients forever.  Human tissue legislation would be necessary in order to legalise altruistic kidney donations here.</p><p> Patients with a donor who is incompatible due to a blood group or tissue type mismatch can now frequently find a compatible donor by way of a paired kidney exchange programme.  We have recently developed a relationship with NHS Blood and Transplant in the UK for the sharing of living human kidneys as part of the implementation of a paired kidney exchange system. This will allow large numbers of Irish and UK patients to receive live donor transplants that would not otherwise be possible.  In order to implement the paired kidney exchange scheme with the UK, the Government or one of its agencies will be required to enter into a service level agreement with the UK transplant authority.</p><p> A significant number of patients living in Ireland and receiving kidney treatment here have relatives abroad who would like to come to Ireland and donate a kidney to their loved ones.  There is currently no clear-cut mechanism or policy from the Department of Health to allow these donors to come to Ireland and receive care in Irish hospital and health care institutions in order to facilitate organ donation here.</p><p> The Road Safety Authority, by way of its hard-hitting public awareness campaigns, has transformed people's view of road safety.  I am of the view that a level of resources similar to that employed in respect of road safety campaigns should be invested in promoting organ donation awareness among the general public.</p><p> Transplant surgery commonly occurs in the early hours of the morning and is consequently arduous.  If a transplant programme is to be successful, the system needs to ensure there is an ongoing supply of these highly skilled professionals.  I refer, in particular, to transplant surgeons, whose training typically takes 15 years to complete.  Failure to implement the working time directive and bans on recruitment have put this essential resource in peril.</p><p> As somebody who each day witnesses the fantastic life-saving and life-changing benefits that organ transplantation brings to the Irish population, I would support any proposal that would ethically allow for the expansion of this technology in this country.  I am of the opinion that introducing a presumed consent law would have very little impact in expanding organ transplantation and should not be at the top of our priority list.  Rather, we must focus on the reorganisation of organ procurement services to ensure that every potential organ donor, whether living or deceased, is identified and facilitated in order that successful transplantations can take place.  There is also an urgent need to implement the planned expansion of transplantation infrastructure at Beaumont Hospital to ensure that all live and deceased kidney transplants can be performed to a high standard and without delay.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.779" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ruair&iacute; Dwyer" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013042500005#E00300"><p>I am Ruair&iacute; Dwyer and I am a consultant in the ICU in Beaumont Hospital.  I have been involved with identifying and obtaining consent for transplantation there.  In that context, I work in close collaboration with the organ procurement service run by Ms Phyllis Cunningham, who came before the committee last week.  I am chairman of the committee on organ donation of the Intensive Care Society of Ireland, ICSI.  The ICSI represents doctors who work in intensive care medicine.  Our committee and organisation include representatives of nurses who work in ICUs and organ donor co-ordinators.  We emphasise the importance of links with ICU nursing in respect of this issue.  As intensive care consultants, we are the clinicians who are directly responsible for the care of all patients with serious brain injuries and the diagnosis of death in those patients who unfortunately progress to brain death.  We are involved in explaining organ donation and in requesting permission from families for such donations.  We are also involved in the care of organ donors in order to optimise the number of organs suitable for transplantation.</p><p>  Promotion of organ donation is seen as being an integral part of our job if our efforts to preserve life have failed.  There is strong enthusiasm in ICUs on the part of both medical and nursing staff.  Education in organ donation issues is an integral part of the training relating to our specialty.  This education remains ongoing throughout our careers.  The ICSI held a day-long conference devoted to organ donation in 2012.  This attracted a large attendance of both medical and nursing staff who work in intensive care.  The ICSI has published guidelines on the diagnosis of brain death and on organ donor management in order to help increase the number of organs available for transplantation.  With support from the HSE, intensive care clinicians are establishing an audit programme which will encompass a comprehensive audit of organ donation within ICU and which will identify any potential for improvements in this area.</p> <p>We believe that our specialty has made a significant contribution to the relatively high rate of organ donation in Ireland.  However, we see major challenges in increasing the rates of organ donation and even in maintaining current rates of organ donation.  I work in the neurosurgical centre in Beaumont Hospital.  When I started 20 years ago we had a brain death diagnosed probably once a week but now we have such a diagnosis once or twice a month.  That is the pool we are recruiting from for organ donors.</p><p> We strongly support the proposals from Professor Egan, which have been mentioned by the two previous speakers, for promoting public awareness, for increased numbers of organ donor co-ordinators and for the appointment of staff in each hospital network with responsibility for promoting organ donation.  There are differing opinions within our specialty on presumed consent.  Many are concerned that presumed consent could lead to a decrease in organ donation if the concept of organ donation as a voluntary gift is replaced by a perception of compulsion.  Others, however, feel that presumed consent would have a positive effect on organ donation numbers.  On balance, that is my position.  I will return to that at the end of the statement.</p><p> Our society was unanimous that whatever legislation is introduced, the practical details of its implementation will be vital in ensuring that current levels of consent to organ donation are maintained.  We are the group who will be asked to implement any new legislation and we hope it will be drafted to ensure there are no accidental obstacles to organ donation in it.  Issues of concern to us include how the issue of consent to organ donation will be addressed in practical terms.  We must examine what will happen if no relatives are available to provide consent and whether presumed consent would apply to donors after cardiac death, which are a different group to donors after brain death.  There is need to have a secure register for those who wish to opt out of organ donation before death, if presumed consent was introduced.  We suggest it would be vital to have close collaboration with the clinicians on the ground who work in ICU in drafting any legislation or regulations for its implementation.</p><p> We are delighted with the amount of attention being given to organ donation and with the level of commitment of this committee in addressing the issue.  Organ transplantation transforms the lives of patients and it will be a very positive achievement for society as a whole if we can maximise the number of patients who benefit from it.</p><p> To return to the issue of presumed consent, we canvassed opinion within intensive care medicine.  A fairly significant majority was opposed on the basis that it could have the opposite effect to what is intended.  That is something on which my colleagues will elaborate.  On balance, I feel it would have a positive effect in terms of changing the terms on which we approach patients for organ donation, in making organ donation the norm rather than the opt-in position.  Most importantly, when one looks at the evidence that is available from countries that have introduced presumed consent, it seems to be associated with a small but significant increase in organ donation, provided it is linked with improvements in resources, in particular improvements in staff who are aligned with organ donor co-ordination services.</p></speech>

What I want to do is drill down a little into what Dr. Dwyer has mentioned.  I also represent the Intensive Care Society of Ireland, which in turn represents the consultants working in intensive care medicine throughout the country.  The committee has a copy of our position statement on presumed consent addressed to the Minister.  Our position is that we favour staying as we are with an opt-in situation.  That was not a unanimous position.  It was a majority decision.  Dr. Dwyer explained that many people had different views.</p></speech>

The majority of organs donated in this country are donated from brain-dead donors.  The care of those patients occurs in intensive care units.  Brain death occurs in intensive care after a significant brain injury where a person is on a life-support machine.  The staff involved include the intensive care specialist, the nursing team and our trainees.  It is our job to care for those patients.  Our primary duty of care is to the patients and, by extension, to their families.  Sometimes a brain injury progresses onto brain death.  That is a clinical diagnosis that we must make at the bedside.  We do two sets of brain stem tests.  They are identical tests done by two separate groups of people separated by a brief period of time.  Our job is to do the tests, the first, to determine brain death, and the second to confirm that at a later stage.</p><p>  It is between the two sets of brain stem tests that we approach the family of the patient and bring up the issue of organ donation.  How we do that is very important.  It will be obvious to everyone that this is a period of extreme trauma for the family.  There will be overwhelming grief, a lot of confusion, anger and a huge amount of tension among family members because these types of events happen, by and large, to young people and they happen very suddenly.  One has to imagine what it is like to deal with these scenarios, the patients and their families.  When we engage with them on the issue of organ donation it is very important that we do it delicately with a lot of compassion and empathy.  How we say it and how we bring it up is extremely important.  We are advocates for the patients and, thereby, their families.  We do not have any say in who is on a waiting list for organ transplantation.  We have no idea of what is happening on that end.  We are on one end only.  In these circumstances, we do not ask them to be organ donors or we do not ask them not to be organ donors, we give them the opportunity to consider organ donation.  We do not necessarily ask for an answer straight away.</p><p>  What we normally do is go back and do the second set of brain stem tests to confirm brain death.  Time of death will be at the conclusion of the second set of brain stem tests.  At this stage we will go back to the family and re-engage with them and ask for their opinion on the topic of organ donation.  We will have families come back to us and say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;, that for many years they have talked about it and it is something that they as a family and their deceased relative really supported for many years, and that they would like to consent to the process of organ donation.  To that family I say, &ldquo;Thank you for considering this.  You have done the right thing for you, your family and your deceased relative.&rdquo;  Alternatively, the family might come and say they are not sure, that they have talked about it and they have never been easy with the concept, that they are not comfortable with it and not really keen to consent to organ donation.  To that family I say, &ldquo;Thank you for considering it.  You have done the right thing for you, your family, and the deceased relative.&rdquo;</p><p>  What I am trying to say is that there is no right answer, there is no wrong answer.  There is only the answer that is given to me by the family.  I have to accept it.  I have to remain and continue to remain neutral in the process.  My duty of care is to the patient in the bed and his or her family and to no one else.  I have to be really neutral.  One might ask why I do not lobby for transplantation.  I do not for the same reason that I cannot lobby against it.  I have to be neutral.  I can raise the question.  Dr. Hickey explained the matter eloquently.  My job is to ensure that in every single incident that brain death occurs in this country, the question is asked to the family to give them the option.  Not to give the option is a dereliction of care from a societal point of view.  I cannot sway their opinion either way but I have to give people the option.  The role of the Intensive Care Society of Ireland in that is to make sure that this happens; to educate our colleagues and to provide resources and training for them so that they are aware of how brain death occurs, that they test for it properly and that they are given the proper skills to deal with the families, help them to come to terms with what is happening and to phrase the issue of organ donation in a neutral, empathic manner.</p><p>  That is really what I want to say and I want to set the scene as to why and how this happens every single day, separate from the transplantation issue.  I have reservations about presumed consent, largely because, as echoed by our transplant colleagues, I do not think it will make a huge difference.  I go back to what I said about how we interact with a family and where I could bring presumed consent into the conversation.  I am not going to change my style of conversation with the family, regardless of what comes out of this process because that is what is practised throughout the world and that is the recognised way of trying to deal with this delicate scenario with traumatised families.</p> <p>Consequently, I do not see it as a huge issue but as being way down the list.  </p><p> I will not go through all of the resource allocations required as that issue has been eloquently discussed this morning.  However, from the perspective of consent, it is not the big issue.  It is not the big ticket and I do not think changing this will make any difference.  What really will make a difference is increasing resources and infrastructure.</p></speech>

I thank the joint committee for its invitation to speak today.  </p><p>  Mr. Hickey has devoted his whole life to transplantation and if anyone deserves to be a professor, it is him for sure and I mean that sincerely.  He has alluded to the entire spectrum of organ donation, from the time an organ comes from the donor patient to when it is transplanted into the recipient patient, where it goes and the circumstances involved, as well as the resources and funding available at each stage.  My colleague, Dr. Dwyer, and I work together in the intensive care unit of Beaumont Hospital.  Both of us care for patients with neurocritical injuries - traumatic brain injuries or intracranial haemorrhages.  In his presentation Dr. Dwyer alludes to the fact that when we started 20 years ago, we used to carry out brainstem tests perhaps once a week.  Certainly, the demographic of patients we see is testimony to the success of the Road Safety Authority.  As members are aware, in 1998 approximately 400 people were killed on the roads, whereas in 2012, approximately 160 people died.  Organ donation rates mirror exactly road fatality rates.  Clearly, the number of people killed will also reflect the number who experience catastrophic injuries, which is testimony to the success of the Road Safety Authority and its laudable work in recent years.</p><p>  Essentially, the pool of potential organ donors has decreased.  As to what should be done about this, my colleagues have suggested and I strongly concur that we must never miss an opportunity where there is the potential for organ donation.  However, we lack infrastructure that could facilitate this process.  I will speak a little about that issue.  The other aspect is that we must look a little more widely in the field.  My own area of specialist interest is donation after determination of death by cardiovascular criteria, also known as donation after cardiac death, DCD, or non-heart beating donation.  This is an area in which I am very interested and which in a way mirrors donation after brainstem death, DBD.  They are similar in a way, in pertaining to deceased donation.</p><p>  I will read briefly from my statement.  On the proposed changes to the current opt-in system of legislation, I support fully the position taken by the Intensive Care Society of Ireland in stating the majority of its members oppose changes to current legislation.  This opinion has not changed since the previous submission made in 2009.  Members will be aware that in that public consultation document the opinion of 23 of 30 learned organisations canvassed on the topic was against a presumed consent model.  This is my personal opinion and we are all on the same page, in that no one will argue that to receive an organ transplant is a life-saving procedure.  For my part, as an intensive care clinician, I am very committed and believe it to be the gift of life.  However, nothing can ever be presumed in a gift and nothing should be taken for granted.  We rely on public trust and confidence in the medical profession and it would only require a single case to go wrong or blown up in the newspapers for such trust to be damaged.  Were the public to be led to believe doctors are now entitled to take organs, unless they have signed up to an opt-out register of some kind, this could be counter-productive overall.  In my submission I state further that in 2010 Ireland ranked ninth out of 27 countries in our rates of organ donations, at 17 per million of population.  That is not bad if one thinks that among the European Union of 27 member states Ireland ranks ninth.  While that is okay, we run a long way behind Spain where there is a rate of 30 organ donors per million of population.</p><p>  The rest of my submission relates to the subject about which Mr. Hickey and Professor Conlon have spoken, with a little bit drawn from my own area of intensive care, essentially on resourcing the donor transplant co-ordinators and providing more level 3 clinical intensive care beds.  I am very proud to work in Beaumont Hospital which is a great institution.  When I qualified there in 1995, we had 20 intensive care beds, whereas today we have 17.  The population has not become smaller and one must now be pretty sick to get into the intensive care unit in Beaumont Hospital.  As a result, while we would like to give everyone the opportunity and facilitate organ donation, where possible, one's bed is not cold in Beaumont Hospital before someone else is in it.  That is a fact.  The resourcing of intensive care beds is an important component of organ donation.  Families should be given the opportunity, where possible, to enable their loved ones to become organ donors.  However, as often happens in the triage of patients, in a case in which one patient has been critically injured and will not survive and someone else is arriving in casualty who is gasping for breath, one will always take the patient gasping for breath because he or she has a chance of living.  However, resourcing intensive care units and providing high level intensive care beds should be a key priority.  Beyond this, from my perspective, I can only echo what Mr. Hickey and Professor Conlon said.</p><p>  While I accept that the medical literature shows a positive slant where presumed consent has been introduced, this is somewhat clouded by turning the camera on organ donation for a short period of time and increasing public awareness.  The increased organ donor numbers seen where presumed consent was introduced may be a reflection of this, that is, a reflection of increased infrastructural investment in the area.  </p><p>  The new driving licences are great, as they are little cards that allow for a code 15 regarding organ donation to be included.  Personally, it should be more like the American model and more explicit.  It should be a mandated request on documentation for passports or driving licences.  I am also in favour of requiring a request in order that each patient or each family can be given the opportunity to donate organs, if there is potential for organ donation.</p></speech>

I work as a consultant renal physician at Cork University Hospital.  Between 2003 and 2009, I acted as chair of the national strategic review of renal services.</p> <p>Since March 2009, I have been the national clinical director of the HSE national renal office.  The national renal office is responsible for planning, co-ordinating and managing the strategic framework of renal services across the country.  Prior to 2001, I worked as a consultant renal physician at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and was involved in the organisation, co-ordination and delivery of renal and transplant services in that country.</p><p> As has already been said, in common with all countries, the number of our fellow citizens affected by permanent kidney failure, a term which, as the committee will have heard, is technically described, perhaps rather unpleasantly, as end-stage kidney diseases, ESKD - it merely means that one's kidneys are permanently failed and one either needs dialysis or a transplant - continues to grow.  The national renal office conducts an annual census of this on 31 December each year.  On 31 December 2012 - this is in part answer to a question the Chairman posed to the Minister on 5 March last - just under 4,000 of our fellow citizens had end-stage kidney disease, 81 being children under the age of 18.  Of the 3,876 adults with end-stage kidney disease, 1,560 or 40% of the total received treatment by haemodialysis at a number or haemodialysis units dispersed around the country.  Some 237 or 6% of the total were treated by one of the forms of home haemodialysis or home dialysis - there are different forms - in their own homes.  Thankfully, and I would echo what has been stated already that this is a testament to the existing success of the renal transplant programme in Ireland, 2,079 or 54% of the total already have a functioning kidney transplant, and 62% of children with end-stage kidney disease currently have a kidney transplant.</p><p> It is important to stress that whereas all types of renal replacement therapy are successful treatments for end-stage kidney disease, prolonging survival, improving functional status and allowing patients to carry on with their lives, there is no doubt that kidney transplantation is the best of these options.  I will not reiterate what has been said on this already.  It is the policy of the national renal office that strategic planning should seek to maximise the number of patients who can avail of this and whereas not all patients may be suitable as recipients of a kidney transplant, many more than have currently received one are so and this is reflected in the waiting list for transplantation.</p><p> As well as being a considerable physical, social and psychological burden on patients with end-stage kidney disease treated by any of the forms of dialysis therapy, the costs to the State of providing these therapies are very substantial.  In 2011, the ESRI noted - the reference is given as "Activity in Acute Public Hospitals, Annual Report 2010" - that the single highest-ranked procedure for day patient attendances at acute public hospitals was haemodialysis and that accounted for one fifth of all day-case attendances.  In 2012, we delivered just under 250,000 haemodialysis procedures in Ireland.  Another metric which many may find compelling is that last year, with a careful mapping exercise, we identified that Irish patients who travel to and from dialysis - one must remember they go 156 times a year - travelled 13.5 million km in 2012, and the State provides a degree of subsidy to this.</p><p> Despite reductions in the unit costs of these treatments over the past few years, they continue to generate very substantial revenue charges.  Professor Hickey referred to those numbers.  The best estimate that our office could make on the cost of this would be as follows.  We believe that the attributable costs for dialysis, excluding support for transplant and certain drugs, comes to approximately &euro;91 million for haemodialysis and approximately &euro;7 million for home therapies.  If a patient is transplanted, he or she will also be on transplant drugs which would cost roughly the same as the other drugs they are on.  Effectively, just under &euro;100 million is the cost of the dialysis therapies for 1,800 of our fellow citizens.</p><p> In the five years since 2007, the number of adults with ESKD has increased by 24%.  That is an absolute increase of 743 patients.  Of this increase, 63% has been accounted for by an increase in the number of those with a functioning transplant - that number being 466 - with the remaining increase due to an increase in those treated by dialysis - 277.</p><p> The second point of information is that we are very comfortable in modelling the likely future growth in end-stage kidney disease.  Based upon what has happened previously and what we would anticipate in the future - one must remember that the growth in the number of persons at the end of every year with end-stage kidney disease is the sum of new patients who start for the first time minus those patients who, regrettably, pass away and how they are distributed depends upon dialysis - we would project that every year we will have between 114 and 178 additional end-stage kidney disease patients in the Republic of Ireland.  If I take the mid-point of that which is 150, and if there is no additional transplantation, that means that every year we will have to open a new haemodialysis unit the size of Cork University Hospital dialysis unit, which is the second largest in the State.  If transplantation rates go up, that proportion that will go up will obviously diminish.</p><p> There is, therefore, echoing what others stated, little doubt but that an increase in access to organs suitable for transplantation would improve the survival, rehabilitation and quality of life of many more patients with ESKD than at present.  Furthermore, the potential future costs of dialysis therapies that would be forgone - these would not be savings we would now make but future costs we would avoid - would benefit the renal programme, the health services as a whole and the Irish taxpayer.</p><p> The principal question that needs to be addressed and is being addressed by this committee is "how is this best achieved?".  A variety of potential solutions have been advanced by a variety of individuals, organisations and healthcare systems.  I am happy to offer my own observations on those elements that I think are likely to increase transplantation while at the same time, as has been mentioned, preserving the confidence of the wider citizenry in the organisation of this activity.</p><p> Undoubtedly, increasing the resources available to support living-donor transplantation is a key element, but what of deceased-donor transplantation?  As has been highlighted in a 2009 United Kingdom health technology assessment, a number of elements contribute to the variation rates of organ donation between countries.  These include: the national wealth and investment made in health care services; the legislative framework that underpins donation, particularly as this applies to questions of presumed or informed consent; the availability of potential donors - comment has been made about variations, thankfully, in road traffic deaths and other issues; public attitudes to, knowledge of and education about organ donation and transplantation; and, critically, the organisation and infrastructure provided to deliver organ donation and transplantation.  Much of the commentary has focused on legislative framework which is of extreme importance.  However, I would strongly associate myself with the views expressed by others that in the absence of a robust organisation and infrastructure to support this endeavour, any legislative framework is unlikely to achieve its maximum potential in increasing donation.  Similarly, robust engagement with the public to minimise anxiety, misunderstanding and fear regarding any potential legislative change must also be of the highest importance.</p></speech>

McDowell" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013042500008#H00500"><p>I apologise for not circulating them in advance.</p><p>  I listened carefully to the medical practitioners who have given evidence to the committee and I am grateful for the opportunity to address the committee.  Listening to the evidence that has been given, it seems that the concern and focus of the medical community at the very least is possibly not around the issue of opt-in or opt-out and presumed consent, but more around the issue of what legislation can bring in terms of infrastructure and resources.</p><p>  When preparing for this, I was struck by what the CEO of the Spanish transplant authority stated recently about the early years of opt-in in Spain.  He made the point that in the first ten years of the presumed consent or opt-out structure in Spain during the period leading up to 1979, the opt-out structure introduced by legislation there did not increase rates of donation significantly.</p> <p>He was making the point that increased rates of donation represented the introduction of expert liaison personnel or transplant coordinators throughout the intensive care units around the hospital network, and that the opt-out or presumed consent system, in itself, was not necessarily contributing to increased rates of donation.  That possibly touches on some of the issues highlighted by the medical practitioners who have already given evidence.  Regulation 22, within the recent statutory instrument, is the current legal background.  That follows the directive.  The directive itself does not compel member states to introduce one system or another but it compels them to address the issue of consent.  That is exactly what this member state has done.  It has issued a statutory instrument in which the issue of consent has been addressed.  Consent is required from the next of kin of the deceased at present.</p><p> As I understand it, there is a framework to be introduced by the HSE.  We are awaiting its publication.  This committee is now interested in considering whether presumed consent is ethically and legally robust and whether it is potentially challengeable.  Throughout the 30 years in which presumed consent has been introduced in various member states, there has been no challenge to it or an opt-out system.  I refer to a challenge on the basis of the convention.  The committee may be aware that the European convention provides for a number of rights that might provide the basis of a challenge to a presumed consent system.  One is Article 8, which establishes the right to a private and family life, and another is Article 9, which pertains to the freedom of conscience and religion.  We also have constitutional rights, which would have to be observed in any legislative structure.  We have Article 40.3.1&deg;, the right to bodily integrity, Article 44, the right to freedom of conscience and religion, and Article 41, which recognises the family as a fundamental unit.  These rights are all relevant in this territory.</p><p> I am not quite certain from a legal perspective whether there is a significant difference between an opt-in system and an opt-out system in terms of whether the underpinning legislation is legally fragile or robust.  The key would seem to be the extent to which the consent of the family members of the deceased is being sought.  The further one drifts away from that principle, be it through an opt-out or opt-in arrangement, the more fragile the structure becomes, not only for reasons associated with the convention or the Constitution but also for reasons that underpin medical practice.  The whole concept of medical practice is based on one of the central tenets of informed consent.  Thus, if one moves to an opt-in or opt-out system that takes the rights, needs and decisions of the family away and establishes a right to veto its decisions or views, for example, it begins to sit uncomfortably with the tenet of consent that underpins medical practice.</p><p> At its centre, this debate is about consent.  I am not quite sure whether presumed consent is necessarily going to increase the figures on donation.  Some of the evidence would suggest that it may do so marginally but perhaps it will not do so at all.  One of the key concerns must be about the issue of medical practitioners and protecting them.  A key aspect of any legislation introduced should be to set out the consent process clearly.  In the United Kingdom, for example, the Human Tissue Act goes through a system of defining qualifying relationships in terms of next of kin and it stipulates people who must be consulted.  Underneath that, it introduces codes of practice that provide another layer of detail on what is required.  That would probably be envisaged in the legislation that may be introduced.</p><p> In one sense, the issue of presumed consent may well provide a positive context or starting point for a conversation between a medical practitioner and the deceased's relatives in an intensive care unit.  That may well be positive.  However, from a legal perspective, I am not certain whether it is important that there be an opt-in or opt-out arrangement, but the key is to note that the further one drifts away from the issue of consent from relatives, the more potentially challengeable or fragile any legislative structure becomes.</p><p> That is a summary of my views on some of the legal implications flowing from an opt-in or opt-out system.  There is further detail in the document that has been circulated.  I will be happy to answer questions.</p></speech>

We had the same discussion last week.  While there may be varying views on how we approach this issue, it is important that organ donation be encouraged and facilitated, where possible.  Many steps need to be taken.</p><p>  Dr. Plant implied that we can profile the challenges that will be faced in the years ahead in the context of kidney failure and other conditions requiring transplantation.  It is quite obvious that there will be difficulties associated with transplant surgeons.  Perhaps talking about organ donation in isolation without promoting infrastructure and its development would mean the committee would be failing in its responsibility.  Clearly, it is not just a case of organ donation; it is also a question of infrastructure and having personnel trained to approach families.</p><p>  Does the doctor who was treating the patient who suffered from brain or cardiac death approach the family?  Is that normally the case or is there a specialist nurse or staff member who has experience and training in approaching families with regard to organ donation?  Does it happen on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis or are there structures and protocols in place?  Does it depend on the consultant, surgeon or doctor?</p><p>  I once encountered a family which lost a loved one and which was too traumatised in its grief to think of organ donation.  The family has regretted it since.  There are organs available every week that could be used but which are not used.  We do not know why.  We do not know whether there are cultural issues at play or whether we just do not profile, highlight and encourage organ donation enough.   We do not know whether there is sufficient infrastructure in place.  Much discussion needs to be held, not only on the legislative side.  We must really promote the concept at Government level and throughout broader society.</p><p>  When one sees the progress made in regard to the national paediatric centre, I have great confidence that action on the national transplant centre, on which I welcome the views, will happen very quickly.</p> <p> As regards all-island based transplantation and harvesting, and on an east-west basis, is there a greater capacity for us?  We are a small nation with limited resources so can we pool them on an all-island basis, in a structured way, including between Britain and Ireland?  Surely there must be greater scope and potential to pool our resources in that area.  In the coming years with the difficulties in which the State finds itself, I do not believe that the longer-term planning needed in the context of training transplant surgeons and other investments in infrastructure will happen as quickly as we would like.  Therefore, there is the potential for co-operation in that area.</p><p> We are witnessing an international trade in organs, which is both illegal and unethical.  It is disturbing and emanates from Latin America, Asia and parts of Africa.  Clearly, the West is encouraging organ donation in whatever guise, be it soft consent, informed consent or opt-out.  By encouraging people to donate organs it will surely assist in reducing the illegal trade.  One would hope that is the case, although it may not be.  As parliamentarians, we can do many things nationally and internationally in the European context. </p><p> I am intrigued how the system works at the coalface.  For instance, in a hopeless case when all chances of survival are gone, who approaches the next of kin or is it done on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.800" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013042500010#K00200"><p>I joint with the Chairman and other colleagues in welcoming each of the contributors.  Like so much in life and death, this is not a straightforward issue by any measure.  Dr. O'Rourke talked about the one-page system.  It must be acknowledged that, irrespective of the different views on presumption or signing up, everybody is sincerely working towards the objective of improved donor availability and the consequent access for those in need.  It is a matter of trying to find the appropriate response.</p><p>  I would like to ask a few additional questions.  Both Dr. Hickey and Professor Conlon referred to the Norwegian model.  As regards the number of transplant surgeons, I note that in the third page of his presentation, Dr. Hickey spoke of a current situation involving four whole-time equivalents.  Is that the actual number currently <i>in situ</i> for the kidney service, or is it the picture across the board?  He indicated that if we were to exercise the European Working-Time Directive we would need 20 transplant surgeons to run our current service.  Will he clarify if that is particular to the kidney transplant area or does it cover all transplant issues that arise? </p><p>  I am taken with Dr. Hickey's argument for a single centre of excellence and expertise that would cover all the various areas of need.  I note that we currently have a triplication of such facilities in Ireland, which obviously does not allow for that professional engagement on a continuous basis and all the other advantages that would occur.</p><p>  I thank the witnesses for what they have said.  At the end of the day, even if the presumed approach were to be legislated for, could the current capacity cope even if there was a significant increase?  Clearly, that remains a matter for debate among Dr. Hickey and his colleagues.  From what I can ascertain from what he and others have said, they simply could not cope with a significant increase in availability.  </p><p>  Professor Conlon referred to establishing a national organ procurement agency.  I know that there are representatives of the procurement end of this who have made important and useful contributions.  I cannot fail to note that we have only five transplant co-ordinators here - a fact which, compared to the figures in Northern Ireland and Britain, jumps off the page at me.</p><p>  Professor Conlon indicated that the proper management of organ donation would have a greater impact and a more dramatic increase in organ availability than even the presumed idea that is coming into play.  I understand the concerns outlined by Dr. Dwyer and his colleagues that presumed consent could lead to a decrease in organ donation.  I am not so sure that would be the case, however.  It would be alarming if it were.  In that respect, it would offer a break in the current enthusiasm for the presumed approach which was well described here last week by a range of people, including living donors and recipients who gave powerful testimony.  One young woman, just five weeks after a kidney donation, looked in better health than any of us gathered here today.  It was wonderful.</p><p>  Dr. O'Loughlin referred to a number of measures that should be taken to have a more certain outcome than the presumed approach.  Is Dr. Hickey's view on a single centre of excellence shared across the board?  The Intensive Care Society of Ireland's correspondence to the Minister speaks of particular measures but I presume they are only in the context of the current trilocation of activity.</p><p>  Dr. Plant strongly emphasised that the organisation and infrastructure provided to deliver organ donation and transplant services is a more certain requirement now and with more definite positive outcomes.  </p><p>  I thank each of the witnesses for their respective contributions.  The well-intentioned, non-professional case that is being presented by people like Mr. Brolly and others who have taken up this issue, is gaining significant momentum.  It will have the support of influential organisations and other interests in the coming week.  I am aware that this matter will be addressed further then.  The contributions we have heard are timely and welcome.  I thank the witnesses for them.  When the Chair allows it, perhaps they can respond to the questions I have posed.</p></speech>

Their illustrative, illuminating, educational, informative and humane presentations have gone to the heart of some of the most difficult interactions that doctors have with patients and their families.  It is not all that long ago that I used to find myself occasionally having this conversation with relatives.  It is one of the most difficult areas.</p><p>  I would like to pay particular tribute to Professor Hickey who has been an extraordinarily wonderful role model for young Irish doctors in terms of his devotion to this cause over the years and for keeping it on the agenda where it should be. </p> <p> The problems of transplantation are contributed to partly by the organ crisis.  I am delighted that so many of our colleagues have correctly and forthrightly pointed out that one of the major problems is also resourcing.  There is no doubt that this is a microcosm of the health service in general and its problems.  Unfortunately, we have a system which is under-resourced, grotesquely understaffed and mismanaged by people who should not be managing it.  The people who should be managing the service are being relegated to the status of clinical technicians by a group of people who should not be making the relevant decisions.  The system is not underfunded, but it is severely malfunded and requires reform.  Professor Hickey's apocalyptic scenario involving the rationing of dialysis should not be dismissed as a Cormac McCarthy-like future fiction.  The inexplicably widely-loved NHS in the United Kingdom was doing this until comparatively recently.  Certainly, in my professional memory, middle-aged patients were systematically denied dialysis in certain regions as it was felt the system could not support them.</p><p> I am 100% in favour of Professor Hickey's suggestion that we should have a solitary national transplant centre.  While much of my criticism is aimed at bureaucracy, there is a certain amount to be laid at the door of doctors and medical-school politics.  Norway has a slightly larger population than Ireland and has four medical schools.  There is only one medical school in Oslo, while Dublin, with a smaller population, has six medical schools.  We have one medical school per 750,000 inhabitants, whereas the European average is one per 1.5 million.  The average in the United States of America is one school per 1.2 million people.  One cannot have rational structures when one disperses one's resources across an irrational number of centres, which are kept alive for the benefit of powerful medical-political and academic forces with a vested interest in maintaining them.  It is an issue we must discuss, albeit in another forum.</p><p> Professor Hickey, Dr. Conlon and Dr. Plant are perhaps best placed to assist me on the following.  As a general rule of thumb, the number of specialists <i>per capita</i>in Ireland is approximately 80% of the number in the UK, while the UK has approximately one third of the number which is the norm in continental Europe.  In turn, the number in continental Europe is substantially lower than in North America.  Do the three witnesses know roughly what our figures are and how we compare?  I suspect that by European standards we are grotesquely under-provided not only with transplant surgeons but with nephrologists, if only somewhat under-provided by UK standards.  Is that a fair characterisation?</p></speech>

I have learned a great deal from them.  Has there been any discussion of providing one transplant unit for the country among the medical profession, the HSE and the Department of Health?  The need for a long-term plan has been highlighted.  I have a serious problem with the way the HSE is dealing with the general doctor issue at the moment.  We seem to be going from year to year rather than planning for the long term.  I wonder if those involved in this area have worked to set out a ten-year plan with clear targets and if that includes the creation of a single unit.  We are dealing in many areas nationally with reconfiguration of the service.  Has the creation of a single transplant unit been part of the discussion process on such reconfiguration?</p><p>  If the problem of organ donors and the availability of space to carry out the work were resolved in the morning, what would the system's maximum transplant capacity be?  Professor Hickey said we should aim to carry out 300 transplants per annum.  If we resolved all the other issues, how long would it take to reach that target and how many additional consultants and beds would be required?  What is the maximum number of transplants that could be carried out with the current capacity in the system if we had all the necessary organ donors and theatre and bed space?  It is important to identify at this stage where we are at and what we can deal with.</p></speech>

It was lovely last week to hear emotional stories from live donors and to see recipients and how they benefited.</p><p>  I read some of the opening statements last night and was struck by how little I knew.  I did not know that Ireland did not have a specific transplant centre and a faced a serious lack of transplant surgeons into the future.  I learned that the programme is run from an office in Beaumont Hospital and has only five co-ordinators, who have other duties to attend to.  I had thought we were much further along than that.  We seem to be very behind the times.  I was also struck by the huge size of the investment required in the system even if we had the donors.  I was also struck that a living donor had to pay for his or her own expenses, which are of the order of &euro;5,000 to &euro;7,000.  While that is a small amount of money given the return, many people will find they cannot afford those sums.  We must be living in the Dark Ages to expect people to do that.  I was further struck by the fact that we do not have legislation to cover the scenario in which a person wants to donate an organ and the donor must therefore travel abroad in order to donate.</p><p>  Most of the questions I wished to raise have been dealt with by other speakers.  I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  They were a real eye-opener and very informative.  I agree 100% that we must apply resources to making people more aware of the organ donor programme and to encouraging donations.  As I said, I am a member of the health committee and the presentations have been a significant eye-opener.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, there is not.  I do not know what the last Administration was doing here, but they had a lot of money which was not invested in the right places.  I am interested in the points raised about Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom and their investment in organ procurement.  What do they actually do?</p><p>  I address the next point to Dr. Colman O'Loughlin.  I have sat in a room in which someone has asked my family the question to which he just referred.  It is a very tough question.  One's initial reaction is "No - not in a million years."  When one gets a second opinion after a day or two, one lives in hope and considers that if there is anything that can be done for other people, it is the right thing to do.  When we were asked the question, the issue was dealt with in the most compassionate way possible.  As a member of a family which was involved in an organ donation decision 20 years ago, I believe that a little piece of our family member is still out there in some community or family where someone is living a full life.  Someone used the phrase "a lifeline of hope".  It is important that when people face that terrible time in their lives they have as much information as possible.  It must be told to them with the greatest compassion and understanding that they are being asked to allow someone who has been in their life to pass on while someone else is given a new lease of life.</p> <p>As much information as possible must be given compassionately to such families, and it must be explained to them that someone dear in their life could give someone else a new lease of life.</p><p> I found the briefing material interesting to read.  At a meeting yesterday with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, she informed us that we need &euro;1.5 billion every month to keep the State afloat and pay people&rsquo;s wages.  It is a sad reflection on all of us that when we had plenty, more was not done in helping agencies such as this.  Coming from a donor family, we certainly appreciated the way we were dealt with and it helped heal some of the sadness involved.  It gave us a different appreciation of the dilemma of making life-changing decisions when it comes to organ donation.</p></speech>

No amount of money will make any difference to our organ donation system until we have the correct procedures and structures in place.  I was in the Seanad when Senator Feargal Quinn introduced his presumed consent legislation, which was hotly debated.  When one reads the headline, it might make sense.  However, when one delves down into the matter, it is clear it does not work unless there are systems behind it and co-ordinators who would meet the families in question to ask them to consider donation.  A process is needed, but we do not have one in place.</p><p>  In the public consultation process on the matter in 2009, 23 out of 30 organisations involved stated that presumed consent is not the way to go.  I believe we are now going to have another public consultation.  There is nothing like having another report on what we already have been told.  Having a report and pretending there is action does not deal with the problem.</p><p>  In 2012, the EU directive on organ transplantation was implemented in Ireland.  Many of the delegation were in Dublin Castle when we had what I can only describe as a box-ticking exercise.  It involved officials from the HSE discussing a directive, a draft of which was not available to anybody in advance of the meeting, which meant we were all talking in generalities.  After having made my contribution at this meeting, I found it amazing that the directive was not put before the D&aacute;il, the Seanad or the health committee but was signed in on the last possible day, 28 August 2012, by the Minister.  That was a failure of process.  It was a significant opportunity missed.</p><p>  Our first organ transplantation legislation in the State was itself a failure of process.  Here we are now talking about presumed consent, which would not make a blind bit of difference if we brought the legislation in tomorrow morning because there would be nothing underneath it to support it.  There would be no system to ensure people could talk to families about organ donation.  We could have a required request system, which would be more effective.  Again, however, unless one has the structures in place, it cannot work.  It is a failure of our process that our first organ transplantation legislation in the State was introduced last year but no legislator had any input into it and the concerns of the delegation were not taken on board.</p></speech>

People may think this is a recipe for contention between medical staff and families involved, when it is not.</p></speech>

I can provide him with the exact staffing level for nephrologists, which will likely reflect on the other specialties in question.  The mean number of consultant whole-time equivalents per million of the population in the United Kingdom is 7.4.  In the Republic of Ireland, it is 4.6.  There is also a regional disparity, with about 6.3 per million in the HSE Dublin north east region but 5 in the HSE south region, 3.8 in the HSE west region and 3.6 in the HSE Dublin mid-Leinster region.  The second metric, which is similar, is the mean number of consultant whole-time equivalents available per 100 end-stage kidney disease patients.  In the UK it is 1.1, while in the Republic of Ireland it is 0.6.  Again, there is regional variation.  These data are accessible on our website at <i>hse.ie/nro</i>.</p><p>  I profoundly agree with Deputy Catherine Byrne on the fact that there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  However, we have revenue locked within the programme for treatment of end-stage kidney disease.  There is &euro;100 million for costs attributable to dialysis.  If a proportion of those patients received a transplant, that revenue would no longer be required.  With respect to Senator Crown, I do not believe we will have a situation in which we will not dialyse people.  I cannot envisage that happening.  However, if we do not increase access to transplantation, the numbers on dialysis will continue to increase.</p><p>  We have reduced costs dramatically in the past three years, but no matter how cheap one makes it, a patient has to have this treatment 156 times a year.  Senator Crown used the word &#8220;malfunded&#8221;.  The taxpayer, through the HSE, is funding end-stage kidney disease treatment.  It is a question of which way we want to do this.  Unusually for a health care issue, in this case the treatment that is the highest quality and has the best outcome is the cheapest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.810" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Ruair&iacute; Dwyer" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013042500012#M00500"><p>We hear anecdotes about families requesting that an organ donation not be made.  We see that as a major failure on our part and it is something we go to great lengths to avoid.  If it is any comfort, it seems to happen rarely.  There was a formal audit of potential donors in 2008 which found that less than 5% of families asked that organs not be donated.  Part of our routine with all patients is to ensure the family has been offered the opportunity to allow for organ donation.  We are well aware of the long-term benefits to the patient who receives the organ donation.  The organ donor co-ordinators support the whole process.  Our job in intensive care is primarily looking after the living.  We also see organ donation as an integral part of our job, but with the EU directive there is an incredible amount of paperwork in place or coming down the line in this area.  If this can be dealt with by the co-ordinator rather than being added to our workload, it will facilitate the process of organ donation considerably.</p> <p> It is perhaps not the business of this committee but the issue of the single transplant centre has been raised by a number of members.  I may have a different perspective compared to others.  There are synergies in having a transplantation centre as part of a general hospital that would be lost in having a single transplant centre.  At a time when we are trying to merge obstetric hospitals with general hospitals, there might be negative effects in terms of access to specialists in many areas.  In the case of kidney transplantations in Beaumont Hospital, there is access to endocrinologists and a large general intensive care unit that would not be available in a single centre.  </p><p> I will pass on some of the other questions which will be answered by my colleagues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.812" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colman O'Loughlin" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013042500013#N00200"><p>I would like to address the question raised by Deputy Billy Kelleher about whether it is the treating doctor who raises the issue of organ donation with the family.  It is the treating intensivist who does it.  By necessity and largely because the process begins when a patient is admitted to an intensive care unit with a brain injury which progresses to brain death, we recognise this process quickly and in all of our interactions with our very sick patients - the sickest patients are in intensive care units - we focus on the family dynamics because they are extraordinarily overwhelming and very difficult for us, as well as for the families involved.  From the outset, we pay particular attention to developing a bond with the families.  We must explain the concept of brain death.  As many learned individuals still struggle with the concept, trying to explain it to a family coming in cold is difficult.  Their relative is warm and has a pulse, the screen monitor looks normal and yet he or she is dead.  One then throws organ donation on top of this.  We develop a bond and try to build trust, which is extraordinarily important and can make a significant difference.  The corollary - lack of trust - can blow everything out of the water.  We must, therefore, be very careful in that regard.  It is necessary that the person involved with the patient is present when one brings up the issue of organ donation.</p><p>  Should we have support?  Yes, we should, but we do not have it.  We have an organ procurement office in Beaumont Hospital run by a fantastic group of people who are also transplant co-ordinators.  Having a procurement person who is also a transplant co-ordinator and on both sides of the fence would be horrendous in any other civilised country.  That cannot continue and must stop.  We must have a dedicated organ procurement office staffed separately from transplant co-ordinators.  They are different jobs and should be staffed differently.   Should they be in a position to come to the hospital when we have a potential organ donor?  Yes, they should.  I did most of my speciality training in Melbourne where there was a fantastic organisation called Life Gift Victoria which was run by the government rather than medics.  It had people on call to arrive at a hospital within whatever timeframe was possible when they heard about a potential organ donor.  They were present when one approached the families and would have received specialist training.  I have received as much training as I can have in this area.  I have 30 other patients in my intensive care unit at the same time, but these are the people who are dedicated to this cause and have fantastic skills.  Therefore, we should have them.</p><p>  To respond to some of Deputy Catherine Byrne's comments, this is a very difficult time.  We are very encouraged when a family comes forward to us with its support for the organ donation process.  We must bear in mind, however, that it is within the right of the family not to go down that route.  We must be very careful not to guide it one way or another.  We can bring up the issue.  That is the best we can do with trust.  I am very glad the Deputy had a positive experience with the medical specialists with whom she dealt.  We focus on that relationship with the family, which is incredibly important.  I do not have strong feelings on this issue because the family has the ultimate say as to whether to opt in or out.  As Professor Hickey said, we would never overrule its decision.  Generating trust with the family and developing that bond is very important for us.  </p><p>  Any external influence such as the presumption of consent or the idea that altruism is being removed from the process is potentially dangerous.  I do not have any figures for the committee, as the research is very weak.  Mr. Joe Brolly, whom we all should congratulate for raising the topic, continually describes the euphoria he felt in gifting his kidney.  That is important - he gifted it and felt euphoric.  There is a small chance that the concept of the presumption of consent might take away slightly from this; therefore, it is very difficult to bring that argument into the process.</p></speech>

I am strongly committed to organ donation and believe families get much solace in the long term.  Deputy Catherine Byrne described her experience.  I had one experience a number of years ago of a small child who died and there was almost a case of medical misadventure.  I remember sitting with the parents in the room and not bringing up the issue of organ donation.  In retrospect, I would do so today.  I would not miss that opportunity again.  There are very few opportunities where the potential for organ donation is missed because the issue is not raised by me and my colleagues in the intensive care unit.</p><p>  Going back to the resource implications, most organ donation result from the intensive care unit.  There are patients who never reach the intensive care unit owing to resource restrictions who could become organ donors but are not given that opportunity owing to limitations in the number of intensive care beds.  I do not have anything more to offer.</p></speech>

As each kidney donor will save about &euro;700,000, one could consider a kidney donor to be a pot of gold.  When one multiplies this figure, the economics of transplantation are enormous.  I said up to &euro;300 million could be saved over ten years by treating kidney failure predominantly by way of transplantation rather than by dialysis.</p><p>  Senator Colm Burke spoke about whether we could cope with the level of transplantation.  As we said, we cannot.  We have 100 pairs of donors and recipients waiting to donate a kidney to each other.  Therefore, it will take us three years to do it.  With this in mind, we have put together a business plan to very rapidly try to expand capacity.</p></speech>

We have approval to appoint 30 staff.  The consultant appointments committee is delaying the process.  We have worked hard in recent years, but it will require the implementation of this plan and reaching the next second and third stages to have any hope of coping with the numbers of patients mentioned.</p></speech>

Everything has been more or less covered.  All of the questions have been adequately covered.  </p><p>  I was very interested to hear about Deputy Catherine Byrne's personal experience.  I think she would agree that if she had not been offered the opportunity, it would have been a source of sadness for her family.  It is a service to the donating community.</p><p>  The single unit will be located on a university hospital campus such as the one in Oslo in order that we would have our great anaesthetic colleagues beside us all the way.  In respect of cost, it is a question of what is the priority.  There is a hospital just down the road from here called the Mater hospital, with a plaque on it dated 1846, when construction of the hospital began.  That was in the middle of the Famine and there was a set of priorities.  It is still a leading hospital.  </p><p>  Professor Conlon has said it is cost-effective to do it, but how a society looks after this group of people who suffer a slow death over a period of years makes a statement about it.  Money should be made available for this centre.  It should be an attractive career for people who will want to spend their lives in it.  The way to do this is to have a single centre that will be state-of-the-art and in which where there will be no triplication of services and in which all units will be brought together to develop a centre that will be worthy of this country and the community we serve.</p> <p> To reply to Senator John Crown's question, we are being distracted from looking after people by meetings with ambivalent paraprofessionals in the hospital setting.  This centre needs to be governed, managed and funded by an organisation such as the national organ donor and transplantation office and answerable to this committee, the Government and, ultimately, the people.  The patient has been pushed down the priority list in health care.  It is all about budgets, targets and business speak.  We need to get back to doing what we would want to be done to us if we were sick.</p></speech>

However, it is important to acknowledge that dialysis can be provided for those who cannot have a kidney transplant, whereas our fellow citizens who have cystic fibrosis or are dealing with heart or liver failure are in more difficult circumstances.  The absence of a transplant does not mean they will cost the State X euro in replacement therapy; it means a loss to their families or communities.  We have not focused on this issue sufficiently.  We should not forget the people in question.  The Republic of Ireland has the highest frequency of cystic fibrosis in the world.  This is another group of people who present a particular charge to the success of this project.</p></speech>

I acknowledge that the Mater hospital was built during the Famine of the 1840s and that we should have a statement of intent, but the greater good can suffer, even in the context of the national children's hospital.  I am not denying all of the good that has been done, but we should consider the bigger picture.</p></speech>

On my question about the current complement of those practising, Professor Hickey has indicated that it is in the order of 20 whole-time equivalents.  What is the current complement across the board of kidney and all other relevant specialties and what figure does he believe it should be?</p><p>  On the concpet of presumed consent, all of the views expressed indicate an acceptance that the next of kin or family should retain the right to give final approval.  I presume the delegates would agree, but it is not something that we should be afraid to address.  Donor card holders are making a very clear statement, but is it also the case that next of kin and family have the right to intervene and say "No"?  An issue arises both in terms of the current situation and what might apply in terms of presumed consent, but it is very strong in the case of donor card holders.  It is a matter that should be addressed because if it was my wish as a donor card holder, I would be strongly of the view that my family has no right to object.</p></speech>

It is in the books, but it never happens that a family is sidestepped in this situation.  If one person in the family is uncomfortable, the story is over because we do not want to cause more trouble and strife.  The donor card is a useful vehicle for those who are looking after someone who has just died to bring up the topic.  If the family is not interested in engaging, that is the end of it.  While one could argue legally in favour of going down that road, people who have struggled to save somebody for three or four days understand the situation very well.  The donor card is useful and the concept of presumed consent may offer a similar vehicle in making organ donation the norm rather than the exception.  In a not insignificant number of intensive care unit cases, the topic is raised by the family.  That is great for everyone who is looking after the patient because it is not necessary to initiate the request.</p><p>  In terms of numbers, we have four full-time equivalents.  All of our transplant surgeons also perform significant urology procedures.  Some perform more significant procedures than others, but they have a second job, which is often very busy.  These four full-time equivalents are involved in transplants and organ procurements, as well as looking after the national children's transplant unit, which used to be in Beaumont hospital but has been moved to Temple Street Hospital.  Two of us are double jobbing in that regard.  As Dr. Plant noted, we have half of the necessary numbers when compared with the United Kingdom and these are not blue ribbon numbers.  We are way behind what we need.  If a transplant surgeon is confined to working 48 hours per week and he or she happens to be on duty over a weekend in which a couple of donors become available, that is the week gone.  Twenty might be an exaggeration, but it would not be a great exaggeration.</p></speech>

I asked my colleagues why we were not participating with others in other parts of these islands.  If one is operating in a wider geographic catchment, typically there is movement of donor organs within an area.  This means the time between organ removal and placement becomes extended in what is called a longer cold aschemia time.  The cold aschemia time in the Republic of Ireland is considerably shorter than it is in the United Kingdom.  There is an inexorable logic, whereby four or five areas joined together, with a common rule of sharing, will produce an imbalance of trade after a period of time because smaller areas will disproportionately provide more organs for larger areas.  The other issue is the nature of the background donor population.  Our ethnic background and age structure are different from those in the United Kingdom.  Kidney donors on this island tend to be younger, the cold aschemia time tends to be shorter and such an imbalance of trade is relatively minor.  When I first returned here, I was strongly of the view that we should share, but my experience and observations over time have led me to believe we are just about big enough.</p></speech>

We had a sharing arrangement with the United Kingdom between 1989 and 2001.  Everything Dr. Plant described came to fruition.  There was a negative balance of trade every year and, because of transportation, even for the best matched imported kidneys, we had no knowledge about who had removed them, how they had been managed in ICU or the quality of the ICU concerned.</p> <p>We had no control over that.  The best-matched imported kidneys did worse than the worst-matched local kidneys and we pulled out of that arrangement.  Generally speaking, again, with 60 million<i></i>in the UK, the smaller centres do not get the rewards.  They become demoralised, their efforts deteriorate and organ procurement declines as a result.  That has been the situation in the US where big centres have cannibalised small centres, and everybody is a loser when that happens.  We must maintain our own integrity here.  There are situations where a bigger pool like the UK is important, such as the paired organ exchange which Professor Conlon is running.  We are involved with the North for pancreas transplantation.  There are 27 co-ordinators there.  Maybe they could spare some for us.  Involvement with the North may be a possibility.  Professor Conlon would know better than I do.  I do not know.  In terms of the deceased donation rates here, we should look after our own people first and export what we cannot use.</p></speech>

The law, as introduced by the BSI last year, provides that the family's consent is legally required.  So even when one has a kidney donor card that suggests that one is happy for one's kidneys to be used in the event of one's death, the law states that the consent of the family is required.</p></speech>

It would never be the case that we would do it anyway.  The donor card has always been a guide, an important guide.  Most families would be aware that the person carried an organ donor card, and by and large they would be supportive if they were aware.  There are occasions when the patient has had a donor card and the family has not agreed and we go with the family on every single occasion.  It has never happened in Europe but there was a case in Singapore where there was a physical fight in the intensive care unit on this issue and I do not want to get into that in any shape or form in my practice, but it can happen.</p></speech>

That is why many of my colleagues are concerned about this.  Brazil introduced presumed consent some 15 years ago and it was followed by a decrease in donations, so they reversed it.  The experience in Europe has been different.  Where European countries have introduced presumed consent, associated with a strong campaign to gain social support for this, there seems to have been an associated increase in donations.  There is data from two centres in Belgium where one centre adopted presumed consent and the other did not.  There was a major difference in organ donation rates over the following couple of years in the presumed consent centre.</p></speech>

The results in Ireland are better than in the UK and much better than in the US.  So smaller, in terms of not sharing kidneys over long distances, is often better than sending kidneys that are 24 hours on ice and have travelled half way up and down the country.</p></speech>

I remind members, witnesses and guests in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones for the duration of the meeting.  This is the third and final hearing on organ donations in Ireland.  We will examine the policy perspective with officials from the Department of Health, the HSE and the Irish Medicines Board, IMB.  I welcome Ms Mary Jackson, Professor Jim Egan, Dr. Siobh&aacute;n O'Sullivan and Dr. Patrick Costello.</p><p>    Before I commence I remind witnesses about the rules on privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I offer apologies on behalf of Deputies Kelleher, O'Caol&aacute;in and Mitchell O'Connor and Senator Colm Burke who have to attend other meetings.  Sometimes on the graveyard shift in committees, members have other commitments they cannot get out of.  Nevertheless, I thank the officials for attending.  This is an important issue and I call on Ms Mary Jackson to make the opening remarks.  </p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues who are also involved in shaping organ donation and transplantation policy.  Dr. Siobh&aacute;n O'Sullivan is chief bioethics officer to the Department of Health and she is also a member of the Council of Europe committee on bioethics and of the HSE's national consent advisory group.  Dr. Patrick Costello is blood, tissues and organs manager for the IMB, which is the competent authority authorising organ donation and transplantation under Ireland's EU regulations.</p><p>  A priority for our health system is to ensure that every link in the donation and transplantation chain is safe.  EU Directive 2010/53/EC, which was transposed into Irish law by SI No. 325 of 27 August 2012 has set criteria for quality and safety and enshrined them in law.  The IMB is working with Professor Egan in the HSE's national organ donation and transplantation office to ensure organ procurement and the activities in Ireland's three transplantation centres at Beaumont Hospital, the Mater Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital meet these criteria.</p><p>  In addition to mandatory standards for quality and safety, the EU has set out a ten-point action plan on organ donation and transplantation, which aims to strengthen co-operation between member states to increase organ availability and enhance the efficiency and accessibility of transplantation systems, while, at the same time, improving quality and safety.  The actions, to be implemented by member states are to promote the role of transplant donor co-ordinators in every hospital where there is potential for organ donation; promote quality improvement programmes in every hospital where there is a potential for organ donation; exchange best practice on living donation programmes among member states: improve the knowledge and communication skills of health professionals and patient support groups on organ transplantation; facilitate the identification of organ donors across Europe and cross-border donation in Europe; enhance the organisational models of organ donation and transplantation in member states; promote EU wide agreements on aspects of transplantation medicine; facilitate the interchange of organs between national authorities; evaluate post-transplantation results; and promote a common accreditation system for organ donation, procurement and transplantation programmes.  Ireland is prioritising areas for attention from this list, which will positively impact on organ donor rates.</p><p>  Another major initiative is the programme for Government commitment to legislate to change to an opt-out system for organ donation about which we have heard a great deal during these hearings.  This commitment will require legislation and has divided members of the clinical community and the voluntary sector.  However, as we have seen in other jurisdictions, it is not the legislative base, but the infrastructure and donation and transplantation systems in place, and how potential donors and their families are encouraged to donate, that make the difference in increasing the number of donations.  Ireland is among a minority of EU member states, including the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany that do not operate an opt-out system.</p><p>  We must change the cultural attitude towards organ donation and make organ donation the norm in Ireland.  The present system of consent will change to one of "presumed" or "deemed" consent, which means that the consent of an individual to organ donation is deemed or presumed to have been given unless they objected during their lifetime.  If a person does not wish to become an organ donor after death, they will need to register an objection during their lifetime - a process known as opting out.  The deceased's family or next of kin will still have an important role to play in the process of organ donation, as we heard strongly from the presentations earlier.  While the next of kin will not be required to give their consent to the donation itself, they will be asked to provide as much information as possible on the person's medical and social history.  The Minister has stressed that there would be no instance whereby organ donation would proceed against the wishes of the deceased's family.  The system to be introduced is, therefore, a "soft opt-out" system.</p><p>  The Department is drafting the heads of a human tissue Bill, which will legislate for the giving of consent for the removal, retention, storage, use and disposal of organs and tissues from deceased persons in the context of post mortems, transplantation, research or anatomical examination.  The Bill will also legislate for consent for the use of organs and tissues removed from a living person for transplantation and research.  The logistics of establishing a system of presumed consent are complex.  Many factors, other than the introduction of a system of presumed consent, affect organ donation rates.  The availability of donors, transplantation infrastructure, public attitude, and investment in health care all play a role.  The Department, in conjunction with the HSE's national organ donation and transplantation office, is considering what practices and organisational changes, along with a change to the consent system, will further improve donation rates in this country.  A secure information technology system must be established and maintained.  The Welsh Government, which is planning to introduce an opt-out system, envisaged that this would cost more than &euro;5 million for ten years for a population that is two thirds that of the Ireland.</p><p>  In the absence of a personal unique health identifier, the identification of individuals and the maintenance of a national registry of potential donors is problematic.  An opt-out system would require an extensive and well resourced communications strategy.  Measures would have to be put in place and sustained to protect the rights of vulnerable groups and the marginalised members of our society.  For example, how would a homeless person, or a person who lacks capacity register his or her wish to opt out?  The Department will commence a consultation process on presumed consent in the next few weeks and will invite interested parties to submit their views on the practical aspects of introducing this system.  We will pose a range of questions, allow approximately six weeks for consultation, distil the information received and then have a focused workshop on the findings of this consultation.</p> <p>The workshop will involve clinicians, the HSE, Irish Donor Network representatives and other relevant parties to give direction to the next steps, the shape of the legislation and what is needed in the health system to implement a soft opt-out system.  We would also be pleased to have representatives of this committee in attendance on the day. </p><p> The health system must put people and patients at the centre of everything we do.  The Irish Donor Network gave an important input to discussions on the detail of the implementation of Irish regulations on quality and safety in donation and transplantation.  Its member organisations - the Alpha One Foundation, Cystic Fibrosis Ireland, the Irish Kidney Association, the Irish Heart and Lung Transplant Association and the Irish Lung Fibrosis Association - will continue to be partners in the development of policy and actions.  Indeed, representatives of the network met the Minister in February to provide its members&rsquo; views to him, especially on the issue of consent to transplantation.  The network also pointed to service areas where improvements could be made to enhance donation and transplantation potential.</p><p> I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to present the Department&rsquo;s position today.  Two clear messages came from the presentations given by the representatives of organisations and individuals who appeared before the committee.  First, like other countries throughout Europe, Ireland has waiting lists for transplantation.  Second, legislation alone will not solve the problem, but we must work together to increase Irish organ donation and transplantation rates.</p><p> A framework to ensure quality and safety is being developed and enhanced.  In parallel with this, we must make organ donation the default position for most people and maximise the number of organs available for transplantation.  We must ensure that our hospital system is resourced to provide as many people as possible with the gift of life through organ transplantation.</p></speech>

As chief bioethics officer in the Department of Health, my role is to support the Department in achieving its mandate and strategic objectives through the provision of bioethical analysis and advice.</p><p>  The success of any organ procurement system is contingent upon its capacity to fulfil three interconnected objectives: good outcomes in terms of quantity and quality of organs; the maintenance of public trust in the transplantation system; and respect for ethical principles.  As the need for organs increases worldwide as well as here in Ireland, transplantation systems have explored a number of innovative strategies to increase donation rates, many of which have proved ethically challenging.  Strategies include expanding the criteria for declaring death, living donation, donation after circulatory death, anonymous donation, directed donation, opt-out policies and even the introduction of economic incentives for donors.  These strategies are not necessarily unacceptable, but they are morally debatable.  While the ultimate goal is to save lives and improve the quality of life for transplant recipients, this goal needs to be achieved through means that do not violate socially accepted ethical norms.</p><p>  Gift giving or voluntary donation to benefit another person as an expression of altruism and social solidarity has been the ethical cornerstone of organ procurement and transplantation in this country.  Traditionally, the practice has been institutionalised as an opt-in system, which depends on having the express or explicit consent of the person or obtaining the consent of the person&rsquo;s family after death.  The presumed consent model has been adopted by a number of countries in Europe and globally in an effort to boost donor numbers.  Ethicists have pointed out that the term "presumed consent" is something of a misnomer, as consent is an active rather than a passive process, and thus we prefer the term "opt-out", which we believe is a more appropriate use of terminology to describe the model. </p><p>  The principal ethical objection to the opt-out model is the loss of autonomy and the right to self-determination of potential donors.  Opponents also argue that the fact that someone did not register an objection to donation does not necessarily mean that he or she agreed to be a donor.  It may simply mean that he or she had not read the necessary materials, did not know the relevant facts, or was otherwise unable to participate in the debate over organ donation.  This could lead to the removal of organs from those who did not wish to donate - so-called false positives, if one likes.  Commentators have argued that this situation is morally unacceptable because it violates the principle of respect for autonomy that underlies our concept of informed consent.  Fears have also been expressed that an opt-out system could undermine solidarity and altruism as important motives for organ donation.  It has been argued that the State, acting through health professionals and the transplantation system, would be intervening to take organs rather than facilitating their donation.  There is at least a risk that some degree of trust in the system could be lost, potentially decreasing the availability of organs for transplant.</p><p>  Proponents of the opt-out model counter that if a change of policy from opt-in to opt-out were to be broadcast widely, there would be no diminution of the exercise of self-determination and therefore personal autonomy would not be affected.  Furthermore, it has been argued that an opt-out system enhances autonomy, as public surveys have shown a high willingness on the part of the public to donate their organs; thus, by failing to remove people&rsquo;s organs, one is acting contrary to their wishes, even if they may be unexpressed wishes.</p><p>  Supporters of an opt-out model also employ what we in ethics would call a utilitarian argument.  This basically means that one provides the greatest good for the greatest number of people by harming no one and benefiting many.  This particular thesis hinges on the fact that the dead or least their surviving interest cannot be harmed and that any curtailment of individual freedom is legitimate in the interest of the common good - that is, the survival of other citizens.</p><p>  Another argument proffered in support of a policy change to an opt-out system is that it would facilitate a change in attitude - members heard that earlier this morning - so that donation would be increasingly seen as natural or normal, hence increasing the likelihood that families would conclude that donation was in line with their deceased relative's wishes.</p><p>  I respectfully suggest that there are a number of ethically relevant considerations in introducing an opt-out system in Ireland.  I am sure some of these will be considered as part of the pubic consultation process.  In advance of any change in the system, the population should be informed of and receive relevant information on changes to the current arrangements concerning organ removal.  This is to allow them to exercise their right to self-determination and opt out of the system if they so wish.  There should be a simple and convenient procedure for anyone to opt out and it should be possible for individuals to revise their wishes at any time.  We are all aware that our values can change over a lifetime depending on our personal experiences, and therefore that kind of facility is essential.  It must be ensured that poor language or reading skills, a low level of educational attainment or poor socioeconomic or health status do not result in anyone&rsquo;s understanding being limited to such an extent that his or her silence could be construed as consent to organ donation.  The issue of how we might deal with vulnerable groups requires special attention. </p><p>  Under a presumed-consent system, hospitals would need to have reliable and continuous access to the latest recorded wishes of potential organ donors.  It would require a definition of who is responsible for the documentation, who is allowed to enter records, who has access to the information recorded and when.  Some countries - for example, Sweden - do not allow access to the register until brain death has been diagnosed.  This is to ensure the population does not get the idea that the system is effectively keeping an eye out for potential donors.  Other countries actually allow checking of the register before the second set of brain-death testing takes place.  These are all important things to take into consideration.  We need to have regard to who would have access to the information and how that information is managed.  There are also the more mundane, but nevertheless important, issues of data protection and data security that need to be taken into account.  We would need to ensure that records are valid and correctly assigned, because it is important to be able to correctly identify the individual and his or her wishes.</p> <p>Not least, the State has a responsibility to prevent the social stigmatisation of individuals who might opt out for their own reasons and who may not wish to be part of the process and thus may be regarded by the rest of society as lacking in solidarity.  We must do some work in this regard.  It is important to emphasise that deceased donation is a complex area, affected not only by law, administration and infrastructure but also by ideology and values.  That is why I am especially grateful to have had this opportunity to address the committee on issues which are slightly off-kilter but centrally important.</p></speech>

I was appointed as the HSE's director of the national organ donation and transplantation office via the Royal College of Surgeons and Royal College of Physicians in April 2011.  I am a fellow of the joint faculty of intensive care medicine.  I am the Irish representative on the Council of Europe committee on organ transplantation.  I am a former chairman of the European Respiratory Society transplantation group, and am the co-chair of the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation committee for the management of chronic rejection.</p><p>  I am privileged to be involved in the care of patients and families who are awaiting organ transplantation.  I have had the benefit and fortune to work with wonderful surgeons such as David Hickey, Oscar Traynor at St. Vincent's University Hospital and Jim McCarthy at the Mater hospital.  These are highly skilled individuals who execute this form of treatment.  I am continually humbled by the generosity of Irish society and the Irish families who donate in the most difficult of circumstances - truly Olympian events which affect other people's lives - and save lives on a regular basis.</p><p>  The three distinct transplant programmes in this country are unique in that, although located in university teaching hospitals in Dublin, they must provide a service for the entire nation while competing for resources with other regional and acute local services in those hospitals.  At present, 685 patients and their families are awaiting transplantation in Ireland.  Organ donation in Ireland is based on an opt-in system, and thankfully it is rare for somebody to die in circumstances which allow organ donation.  Of 3,000 deaths in intensive care units per annum, approximately 80 to 100 cases are patients in these circumstances.  In 2010 only 58 donations were made.  The procurement and co-ordination of organ donation is provided by the renal transplant service because of the absence of standard formal structures.  This gap has been filled very successfully in a voluntary capacity based on historical needs over many years.</p><p>  Internationally, many stakeholders emphasise the benefits of organ transplantation.  The European Commission Action Plan on Organ Donation and Transplantation (2009-2015) emphasizes the substantial health care benefits of organ transplantation and states that all European states need to identify potential organ donors and support their conversion to actual organ donors.  The goal of soft opt-out is to allow organ donation to be the society norm.  It does not devalue organ donation as an extraordinary gift from one family to another.  However, soft opt-out legislation alone does not enhance organ donation.  It is part of a package that includes donation infrastructure.  Donation infrastructure protects the interests of families and donors, ensuring a compassionate and professional approach at the time of donation.</p><p>  Earlier, we heard subjective views on specific data, but there is specific data which supports presumed consent.  A review of presumed consent published in <i>BMJ</i>, formerly known as the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, indicates that it is associated with a 25% increase in organ donation rates, or an additional two to six donors per million of population.  This is further emphasised in the UK health technology assessment report mentioned by Dr. Plant earlier today.  European league tables of organ donation rates are consistently dominated by those countries which have presumed consent in partnership with formal organ donation infrastructures, including Spain, Portugal and Croatia.  Generally speaking, we quote the Spanish model as the international standard for organ donation and transplantation, but Norway is also an excellent role model.</p><p>  To comply with society's expectations and national and international needs, three structures must be deployed in the Irish health service, and we are actively working on these.  Intensive care key donation personnel would be assigned throughout the health service in line with international practice and the European Commission action plan.  These medical and nursing personnel will underpin the organ donation process by protecting the interests and welfare of those families who choose to donate organs in the most difficult of circumstances.  The second element of infrastructure development is the national organ procurement office, which would be developed to be independent of recipient co-ordination to comply with the standards required by the EU tissue directive and the EU organ directive.  It would also be in keeping with the 2011 HSE-commissioned independent international review of transplant services we completed and the recommendations of the Irish Medicines Board, which regulates this area.  The third element is the recently established HSE national organ donation and transplantation office, which would be positioned to establish a financial and governance framework to protect the interests of donors and recipients in the current challenging fiscal environment.</p><p>  Deploying these three structures would will bring Ireland in line with international practice norms, mitigate the risks of a fall in organ donation rates in a changing society - a very significant risk based on the experience in 2010 - potentially remove up to 530 patients from dialysis over the next ten years, and save up to 750 additional lives of patients with advanced liver, lung and heart disease over the next ten years.  These structures would also provide a platform for co-operation with services in Northern Ireland.  In a very measured fashion, deploying these structures would save up to &euro;60 million over the next ten years.</p><p>  It is our goal to have one of the very best organ donation and transplantation systems in Europe and we are deeply committed to this.  I thank committee members for their attention and I am happy to take any questions in due course.</p></speech>

This was transposed through SI 325/2012.  The other competent authority is the HSE, which established the national organ donation and transplantation office as its representative and as a competent authority for implementing the legislation.</p> <p>The legislation is relatively limited and divides the two organisations' roles.  The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, is responsible for the inspection and authorisation of procurement organisations and transplantation centres.  It is also responsible for reviewing adverse events or reactions that are attributable to the quality and safety of a transplanted organ.  The HSE has a wider role in implementing the legislation.  It must develop the framework for the quality and safety of organs.  This includes issuing guidance to health care establishments and professionals on best practice in transplantation.  It has a role in the establishment of a donor and recipient registry and in the control of organ exchanges between Ireland and other member states.  It also plays a critical role in respect of reviewing and learning from adverse events and reactions.</p><p> The IMB has been appointed to its role because we have a history of regulating health care facilities, in that we were responsible for implementing the blood and tissue legislation.  There is an overlap between tissues and organs.  In theory, multi-organ donors could become multi-tissue donors as well.  Two of our organ centres are also tissue establishments.  We are committed to working with the HSE, the Department of Health and our clinical colleagues, from whom the committee has heard, in the implementation of this legislation.</p></speech>

It is important that donor card holders discuss their intentions with family members so that there is a lesser onus on those members to make a decision.  Resources need to be invested in organ donation awareness campaigns, as we must promote donor awareness and encourage people to donate.  We should roll out campaigns in schools.  The younger that people become interested, the more it becomes a part of normal life.</p><p>  Organ donation is one issue, but capacity, resources and infrastructure comprise another.  A major investment is required to move us into line with best international practice.  When reading the statements, I was struck by the fact that Ireland did not have a specific transplant centre or enough transplant surgeons.  This important area is being run out of an office by five co-ordinators in Beaumont Hospital in Dublin who have other duties.</p><p>  The Deputy First Minister, Mr. Martin McGuinness, MLA, recently indicated that he would introduce legislation through the Northern Ireland Executive to provide for presumed consent.</p></speech>

With any medical matter, public trust is a priority.  Our first action when we go to hospital for any procedure, large or small, is to sign a consent form.  We trust that the medical professionals caring for us will make the right decisions.  I was struck by the query about what happens to homeless people and who acts as their voice.  Will the delegates elaborate more broadly?  We should not remove people's ability to make decisions on what happens to their bodies after they have been incapacitated.  Their families should have a role in providing consent when the time comes for their relatives to pass.</p><p>  All of the presentations at our recent meetings have been interesting.  Some of the delegates may have been sitting in the Gallery when I referred to my personal experience of a family member who was an organ donor.  It gives the gift of life to others.  If those of us who must make this difficult decision keep in mind the fact that someone else is living because our loved ones have passed on, it gives some comfort.  The person we lost is forever young in our minds, having only passed away at 20 years of age.</p></speech>

I welcome and am delighted to see the team in attendance.  When I introduced my Bill in 2009, few voices questioned the safety of or belief in presumed consent.  There were many additions to the effect that, as Professor Egan explained well, presumed consent would only work if the infrastructure was in place.  We also took on board a great deal of information about Spain.</p><p>  We have heard little opposition to presumed consent, although there has been a question regarding finance.  Savings of &euro;60 million over a ten-year period were mentioned.  Perhaps someone might touch on this matter.  Such savings would address people's doubts in this regard.</p><p>  I am frustrated by the length of time needed to get anything done in either House.  We adjourned our debate and the then Minister for Health and Children, Ms Mary Harney, stated that she wished to take public opinion, but nothing has happened since.  There are few voices against presumed consent, but such a system must be tied in with other factors.  The only voice that was loudly not in favour of presumed consent was the Irish Kidney Association.  What are its concerns?</p></speech>

I apologise for being unable to attend.  I do not understand its concerns or why it does not approve of presumed consent.  It seems that everyone else is in favour.  I urge that we reintroduce my legislation or a Government Bill.  With the committee, I visited the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, from whom there was no strong opposition.  He seemed to be in favour of presumed consent as well, assuming precautions were taken.  We can push on that open door.  I hope that we do.</p></speech>

The thrust in legislating for the opt-out or soft opt-out system is not meant to undermine trust or change our wonderful system, given the doctors' descriptions of what happens.  Patients and their families must be put at the centre of everything.  We want to consult on how best to implement a soft opt-out system so that we can get it right and take everyone's concerns into consideration.</p><p>  Members of the Irish Kidney Association are present in the Gallery.  I took Mr. Murphy's main point to be that we should not concentrate on the cold words of legislation alone, but on the practical elements, for example, proper infrastructure and people who can do the job of getting consent and maximising organ donation well.</p><p>  Given the cost of implementation, Ireland faces a particular problem in setting up a register of donors, be it a register of opt-ins or opt-outs.  Experience in the UK shows a low number of registrations, approximately 28%.  Nor do we have a unique health identifier, which is another problem for legislation.  If there are five Mary Jacksons living in my locality, how do I know who is who on the register?  The practical, logistical and cost implications cannot be overlooked when putting a system in place.</p></speech>

The key terminology is "soft".  This is a soft opt-out proposal which means the wishes of the family will remain to the front and at the centre of the whole process.</p><p>  On Senator Feargal Quinn's comments, it is accepted internationally that there are substantial financial benefits to be accrued from transplantation.  We have seen business cases proposed in the United Kingdom which underpin its substantial investment of almost &pound;60 million in organ donation and transplantation.  The United Kingdom sees this as a cost effective and cost neutral process.  This is about preventing people from spending time on dialysis and saving money through the use of appropriate measures.   </p><p>  On Deputy Sandra McLellan's point on Northern Ireland, given that the population of the Republic of Ireland is 4.5 million and that the population of Northern Ireland is 1.8 million, it is eminently sensible that there be synergy from the point of view of the cost effectiveness of our working with our colleagues in Northern Ireland.  We need to be on a sensible platform in that regard.  As we have heard, they are way ahead from an infrastructural perspective.  We need to get to a comparable position.  We could then seek to work closely with them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-04-25a.853" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Siobh&aacute;n O'Sullivan" time="12:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2013042500020#U00400"><p>Deputy Catherine Byrne raised the issue of vulnerable categories.  I, too, have concerns about what is proposed in the case of homeless persons and incapacitated adults.  For example, some countries operating opt-out systems allow for children, whereas here parents act as advocates for children.  We need to look carefully at this issue.  The difficulty is that while in a soft opt-out, there may be a family that can act as an advocate for the deceased, there will always be marginalised groups in society which will not have that support.  This needs to be recognised.  There is a need for the inclusion of safeguards in relation to advocates acting on behalf of such persons.  It is an issue that requires serious consideration and I thank the Deputy for rasing it.</p><p>  On the question of autonomy, it has often be said the soft opt-out system allows greater autonomy because the person's wish - once a person has not objected, it is taken that he or she is happy to be a donor - cannot be overridden by the family and is, therefore, a much better system.  However, any opt-out system operating in Europe involves the family.  This is for practical reasons as much as anything else because one needs to ask the family practical questions about lifestyle and so on.  Most countries operate soft opt-out systems, with Austria being the only country that operates a system in which the family is not involved.  There are a huge number of variances in the systems operating across Europe in terms of family involvement.  In Norway the family is very important and central to the process, with communication being the key.  This is largely because Norway does not operate an opt-out register.  As such, talking to the family is one of the only ways to establish whether the deceased person wanted to donate.  In Belgium the family must be involved, but nobody is clear on what "involved" means.  In other countries authorisation from the family is required.  There are a large number of opt-out models which state how a family must be involved.  This comes back to my final point, namely, that we must be aware of the ethical norms operating and values.  In Ireland  the family generally is involved.  We need to be aware of how that is going to work and take this into account in our deliberations on how this might translate into legislation.</p></speech>

I am not sure if it was said in the course of the discussion thus far, but an example of the commitment of the system to working to improve the position is the &euro;3.5 million allocated to the living kidney donor programme in the HSE's service plan for 2013.  At a time of very constrained resources, this is an important commitment.  We know that transplantation is better for a patient and adds value to the system.</p></speech>

This is the third of our series of meetings on the issue of organ donation.  It is important that we continue to advocate and promulgate organ donation.  The joint committee will meet in private session next week to consider how to progress and assist in the formulation of policy as outlined in the programme for Government.  The briefings received today and in our previous two meetings will form a major part of our analysis, on which we will report back to the Department and the Minister.</p></speech>
