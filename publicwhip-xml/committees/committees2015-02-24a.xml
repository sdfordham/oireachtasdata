    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1103" speakername="Andrew Doyle" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2015022400002#C00300"><p>I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney and his officials.  I thank the officials for the briefing material.  I advise members, the Minister and officials that they must turn off their mobile telephones.</p> <p>  As members will have seen, the Revised Estimate for 2015 was presented to the D&aacute;il in the new programme-based format.  This means that the Revised Estimate as presented contains the following information for each programme: how the money allocated to that programme is proposed to be spent and the previous year's outturn in each case; the numbers of staff assigned to work connected with the programme and how this compares to the previous year; and performance related information, including departmental outputs, again with corresponding information for the previous year and what are termed performance and impact indictors with previous year's information.</p> <p>  The administrative expenditure for the Vote as a whole is summarised in more detail than previously.  The Revised Estimate gives the select committee an opportunity to review whether targets set and the distribution of moneys across the Vote for 2015 are appropriate in all the circumstances and demonstrate the best use of the resource.  It also gives us an opportunity to explore issues facing the Minister in terms of the 2015 allocation for his Department.</p> <p>  I propose that following the Minister's opening statement, we will consider the Revised Estimate subhead by subhead and take questions from members.</p><p>The agri-food sector is playing a considerable role in our economic recovery.  The sector remains Ireland&rsquo;s largest indigenous industry and accounts for almost one in nine jobs, mainly in rural and coastal areas where few other employment opportunities exist.</p><p> Bord Bia recently confirmed a fifth consecutive year of growth in agri-food exports.  The value of Ireland&rsquo;s food and drink exports grew by some 4% during 2014 and reached almost &euro;10.5 billion, which is another all-time high.  This is some &euro;3.2 billion higher than in 2009, an increase of over 45%.  In this context I was pleased to secure an increase of almost &euro;42 million in Exchequer funding compared to 2014 to invest in the agri-food sector.  The Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department will amount to &euro;1,260 million in 2015.  This figure is made up of &euro;1,044 million in current expenditure and &euro;216 million in capital spending.  This is the first in a series of six budgets where the Exchequer contribution to the Agriculture Vote will be increased in order to facilitate the implementation of both the rural development programme, RDP, and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF.</p><p> The second element to the financing of the sector for this year and the coming years concerns taxation.  Following on from the publication of the agri-taxation review, the Minister for Finance announced, in his 2015 Budget Statement, a suite of taxation measures which are intended to assist in the modernisation of farming, provide for increased land mobility, assist succession and broaden the period over which income averaging relief may be claimed.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->These measures are timely and will support the continued development of the sector and our aims under Food Harvest 2020.</p><p> In addition to allocated Exchequer funding, Ireland will also receive &euro;1.215 billion in direct funding from the EU for the basic payment scheme, or &euro;7.2 billion over the lifetime of the CAP agreement 2014 to 2019.  Furthermore, the rural development programme will deliver an additional &euro;4 billion of EU and national funding in the period up to 2020.  My overarching priority for 2015 is to deliver the first part of the Government's commitments to the farming and fishing sectors in the commencement of actions under the new rural development and seafood development programmes.  These supports will support the incomes of family farms and prioritise vulnerable sectors, particularly those areas of natural constraints to which I have allocated &euro;195 million in 2015; that is formerly DAS.  The rural development programme, or RDP, will be a key support in enhancing the competitiveness of the agrifood sector, achieving more sustainable management of natural resources and ensuring a more balanced development of rural areas.  We are awaiting formal approval of the programme from the Commission.  In the meantime, I have secured Exchequer funding of &euro;439 million for capital and current expenditure on RDP schemes.</p><p> One of the most significant elements of the rural development programme is the continued commitment to agri-environment schemes.  In 2015, approximately &euro;120 million is being provided, &euro;52 million of which is effectively to close out REPS, while &euro;70 million will be paid out under AEOS.  Almost 17,000 and 15,000 farmers respectively will receive payments under these schemes.  I was pleased to launch last week the new green low carbon agri-environment scheme, or GLAS as people now know it.  GLAS is intended to build on the success of the earlier programmes and encourage farmers to farm in an environmentally sustainable manner.  GLAS will be a five year scheme with a maximum payment of &euro;5,000 per annum, with the potential to qualify for a top-up payment of up to &euro;2,000 per annum.  Funding in 2015 provides for the opening of the scheme to some 30,000 entrants and for part-year payments to be made.  When fully open, the scheme will support up to 50,000 farmers and require funding of &euro;250 million per year.</p><p> A strong and focused on-farm investment scheme remains a priority and in 2015 this will be delivered through TAMS 2, which is the second generation targeted agricultural modernisation scheme.  For 2015, I am allocating some &euro;34 million to TAMS, which represents a 100% increase on last year's budget.  This will provide for final payments on TAMS 1 as well as a new farm safety scheme for which I am providing once-off funding of &euro;12 million.  Tragedy struck too many Irish farm families in 2014.  Conscious of the loss of life and injuries sustained on farms in recent years, particularly during 2014, I opened the farm safety scheme in October of last year.  The grant rate is 40% up to a maximum eligible investment ceiling of &euro;20,000; i.e. the maximum grant is &euro;8,000.  Almost 6,300 grant applications have been received in my Department.  Over 4,000 of these are already processed and approvals are being issued on a continual basis.</p><p> This year is set to be an extraordinary one for the dairy sector.  The ending of the milk quota regime next month will free Irish farmers from the shackles of quota.  With opportunity, however, comes a requirement for investment.  My Department will be inviting applications to avail of grant funding for capital investments in 2015, including a new dairy equipment scheme to support the sector in its expansion plans.  As with the beef sector, I am proposing the establishment of discussion groups for the dairy sector in 2015 as part of the rural development programme.  Payments under the programme will not be made until 2016, however.  The plan is for 5,000 entrants to dairy discussion groups next year.  This will serve as an essential learning experience in the post quota environment.</p><p> Ireland is the largest net exporter of beef in the northern hemisphere and this is testament to the efforts of all stakeholders in this vital sector.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Ireland is the largest net exporter of beef in the northern hemisphere and this is testament to the efforts of all stakeholders in this vital sector.  As a consequence of the importance my Department places on the beef industry, coupled with an acknowledgement of the difficult year experienced in 2014, I have again given particular priority to providing the kind of support that can contribute to restoring confidence to this sector.  I am pleased that we were in a position to fund support measures worth in excess of &euro;73 million in 2015.  The cornerstone of this support package is a significant increase in the funding allocated to the new beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, from &euro;23 million to &euro;52 million.  This 126% increase will place Ireland to the international forefront of genetic improvements in beef and will make an important contribution to improving the carbon efficiency of Irish production.  As I announced on budget day, my intention is to have a two-tier payment under the BDGP, that is, &euro;100 for the first ten animals on the farm and &euro;80 thereafter.  Obviously these payments are subject to the agreement of the European Commission in the context of the overall scheme and discussions on these issues are ongoing.  The payment levels are also of course subject to the overall budget limit of the scheme.  </p><p> A sum of &euro;9 million will also be paid to approximately 36,000 farmers under the beef data programme, BDP.  This programme assists farmers in improving the genetic quality of their livestock while maintaining a flow of crucial data to the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation that will generate further advances in cattle breeding at national level.  The estimate also includes provision of &euro;1.6 million for the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation to support continued breed improvement in the beef and dairy sectors and &euro;0.5 million is being provided to compensate for the removal of persistently infected calves under the BVD compensation scheme.  I have also allocated an additional &euro;1 million to Bord Bia for the marketing of beef given the challenges that we had last year.  The ongoing development of the knowledge base in the sector will continue to be supported.  The beef technology adoption programme, BTAP, has been an outstanding success and a further &euro;1 million is provided for such payments in 2015.  The new knowledge transfer measure for the beef sector, provided in the RDP, will also open to farmers next year and I expect payments to be made under that programme in 2016. </p><p> The sheep sector continues to experience challenges.  Consequently, I am providing funding for a continuation of the sheep technology adoption programme, STAP, into a third year.  This programme provides for the establishment of discussion groups among sheep farmers, similar to the model used for other groups.  Funding of &euro;4 million is provided for the programme in 2015.  The number of producers participating and the positive feedback from participants attests to the success of the programme to date.  I have also announced, as part of the RDP, that the STAP structure will become a knowledge transfer group for sheep from 2016 onwards with an expected 4,000 participants starting that year.  I am also maintaining the provision of some &euro;540,000 for the improvement of breeding in the sheep sector through Sheep Ireland. </p><p> TAMS II funding will also be made available for the pig and poultry sectors reflecting the need for investment in these sectors.  I am also prioritising innovation as part of the smart agenda through a substantial fund for research, development and training amounting to &euro;28 million under the FIRM, Stimulus and Forestry Funds and Teagasc training courses.  I will also be maintaining our focus on food safety and animal health and welfare with a provision of some &euro;82 million overall.  Our justifiable reputation for food safety and quality standards has led to the opening of both the American and the Chinese markets to Irish beef in recent months, which is a really good practical example of why high food safety standards are so important.  In addition to the specific allocations already mentioned, I have provided &euro;144 million to fund Teagasc and Bord Bia in 2015.  These agencies have central roles to play in improving the profitability of the beef sector across the range of their activities. </p><p> Taking account of the fact that the Irish bloodstock industry is of enormous economic benefit to this country, I have increased State support to the horse and greyhound industry by &euro;14 million to &euro;68 million.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It has been estimated that the industry provides in excess of 14,000 jobs, approximately &euro;1.1 billion in economic output and is responsible for exports worth in excess of &euro;200 million.  That represents money that is pretty well spent.  </p><p> The greyhound industry employs more than 10,000 people.  Since 2002, in excess of more than 10 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings.  The industry contributes some &euro;500 million in economic output to local economies around the tracks which have a wide geographical spread.  The increase in State support to both industries is in recognition of the significant shortfall in funding going into the horse and greyhound sectors in recent years as a result of the downturn in the economy.  With the introduction of the online betting tax, the Government will provide an additional &euro;6 million a year to the horse and greyhound fund. </p><p> I am anxious to unlock the significant potential of the marine sector for export growth and employment.  I will shortly be launching Ireland&rsquo;s new seafood development programme for the period up to 2020.  Following months of intense lobbying and negotiation, I secured a contribution of &euro;148 million to Ireland&rsquo;s programme from the new European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, for the period 2014 to 2020.  It is worth noting that in the previous seven years the figure was &euro;70 million.  Therefore, the contribution secured represents more than a doubling of that fund.  Together with matching Exchequer funding, this will enable me to launch a &euro;241 million EMFF programme in 2015.  </p><p> The majority of funding under the new seafood development programme will be focused on the further sustainable development and growth of our seafood industry.  Some &euro;142 million of the total fund will be available for this sectoral development, which is more than twice the &euro;66 million available under the previous programme for that same purpose.  </p><p> The new EMFF programme will also directly fund &euro;46 million in new investments to support our capacity to enforce the Common Fisheries Policy and ensure a level playing field for all fishermen.  In addition, &euro;41 million will be provided to improve the science that supports our fisheries management, together with &euro;11 million for implementation of the new EU Integrated Maritime Policy and &euro;1.3 million for storage aid supports.</p><p> I am making available &euro;15 million in 2015 to commence investment measures under the new seafood development programme and this will rise significantly in following years as the programme is rolled out.  Separately, I am also making available approximately &euro;9 million in 2015 to complete the final year of the current seafood development programme.  I have also allocated some &euro;11.5 million of capital expenditure to be invested in fishery harbour works.</p><p> Having experienced the positive outcome of the agri-taxation review, my colleague the Minister for Finance and I proposed a similar exercise for the marine sector.  Under the Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth strategy, the Government has set a target of doubling the value of Ireland&rsquo;s blue economy by 2030 and I am keen to ensure there is a supportive financial environment underpinning this target.  A working group, led by the Department of Finance and consisting of my Department, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will oversee the review and I will liaise with other Government Departments and agencies, including with the Marine Co-ordination Group. </p><p> The forestry sector receives the largest share of the public capital programme expenditure of my Department and I have provided some &euro;110 million for this purpose in 2015.  The Government recently approved a new forestry programme up to 2020, the objective of which is to support the planting of over 43,000 hectares of new forests.  The measures to which I have referred today demonstrate the Government's commitment to the agriculture, marine and forestry sectors.  We are now in a position to implement actions under the new rural development and seafood development programmes, which, I hope, will leave a lasting legacy in these sectors, and make a significant contribution to the further development of these important pillars of Irish society and, in particular, to the rural and regional economies.</p><p> I will happily answer any question members may have.  I apologise for the length of the presentation but there is a good deal happening.</p><p>It covered all the areas.  I understand the Minister has to conclude here in an hour.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Chairman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2170"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Andrew Doyle"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Andrew Doyle"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have four programmes plus the administrative programme so if we want to go through subheads we can do so but we will only have approximately 15 minutes per subhead.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2015022400002#G00200"><p>I only have a few comments.  I am going through the subheads and I do not think the Minister will be changing his budget now as it is too late.  Accordingly, it is as well to focus on a number of specific issues today.  I always feel these meetings would be a lot more useful before the Estimates are finalised, and now we have the Revised Estimates.</p> <p>  On the first page mention is made of taxation.  This is not strictly the Minister's function but he brought up the subject.  Can he get us figures from his colleague, the Minister for Finance, or from the Revenue Commissioners, as to what farmer-specific schemes actually exist?  How many farmers avail of the schemes each year?  It is important to get a fix on this issue.  We always talk about taxation but I would like to know how many of these measures affect how many people.   I suspect a lot of other people would like to know that too.</p> <p>  On page 2, in respect of a financial issue, it states, "We will deliver an additional &euro;4 billion of EU and national funding in the period up to 2020".  We discussed this before but the Minister might clarify the matter again for me.  Does the year mean 2020 or 2023 in terms of the actual payout?  Is it n, n + 2 or n + 3?  It makes a difference if it is spread over the period from now to 2020 or from now to 2023, particularly as we are in 2015.  It then states, "&euro;52 million will be paid out to REPS farmers this year and &euro;70 million to AEOS farmers, of which there are almost 17,000 and 15,000 respectively".  On the figure of 15,000, the Minister, in a reply to a parliamentary question I raised on 12 February 2015, stated that there were 19,272 farmers between AEOS 1, 2 and 3.  He might account for the 4,272 farmers missing there.</p> <p>   I understand the Minister opened GLAS at the weekend.</p></speech>

I just wanted to correct the record on that point.</p><p>Even if there is double that number it means there are 50 plans per planner, on average, and they have to get area aid and everything else done in the meantime, as well as deal with AEOS and REPS and so on.  If the Minister looks at what planners get paid he will be able to figure out how many days it takes them to do a plan and he will find out that there is not enough time to do 30,000 or 40,000 plans.  Is the Minister confident there is enough capacity to get them all done by the middle of May?<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=852"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=852&amp;amp;pid=EamonOCuiv&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Is it the Minister's intention to have a later closing date for those with commonages in view of the huge difficulties and delays that will be involved in, first, getting planners who are willing to do commonages and, second, getting agreement on the commonages between the farmers as to which of the planners would be used to draw up the plan for the commonage?  There is a strong view that the commonage plans will be unattractive.  Farmers are wondering whether the Minister is willing to have a later closing date for commonage farmers and if he will reserve a certain number of places for them because they believe they are not in a position to compete timewise with those on low land who are in a much more attractive position.</p><p> Another question that arises relates to GLAS.  If a farmer participates in GLAS this year and has two years left in AEOS, my understanding is that he will be paid only for three years in GLAS.  Will the Minister confirm if that is provided for in the regulations or if it is a rule made by him?  As the Minister is aware, there are huge concerns regarding penalties for farmers, which have a big effect on all of the accounts he has given, in respect of land eligibility issues and what appears to be a determined effort by the Department to dramatically reduce eligible land in semi-natural areas.  Perhaps he can tell the committee what financial effect that is likely to have on the Estimates if what has happened in south Galway is continued throughout the country.  Will he confirm that it is intended to have 300 inspections on farms with commonages?  Will he also confirm the situation in areas where farmers have been precluded from grazing in the winter following which the inspectors say there is no farm activity on the land?</p></speech>

What is it for and what is it intended to support?  Will capital funding be provided in terms of a rural innovation and development fund?</p> <p>  In his introduction the Minister mentioned the Seafood development programme.  Will there be a focus on job creation because the experience of many people in Donegal, particularly in respect of the Seafood development  fund, is that there have been job losses as processors have automated and reduced the actual number of people working.  One of the bones of contention is that funding is always announced as supporting so many jobs but then jobs are lost because of the development rather than being created.  Will there be a change in focus in that area?</p> <p>  With regard to subhead C7.6 - environmental compliance in the fisheries sector -  I note a shift in emphasis from capital to administration with a significant increase in current expenditure.  What is the reason for that and what does the change involve?</p></speech>

The first is on the Beef Data and Genomics Programme.  Coming from the midlands, the Minister should not be surprised that I ask about it.  When is it likely that the first tranche of payments will be made under that scheme?  I understand it is &euro;100 for the first ten animals on the farm and &euro;80 thereafter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.33" nospeaker="true" time="14:00:00" ><p>The Chairman and the committee have paid much attention recently to the farm safety programme.  Up to &euro;12.2 million has been allocated to it with 6,300 farmers applying for it.  All remedial safety works must be completed by 31 August 2015, six months from now.  The Department is processing applications with 4,000 already complete.  The problem is the difference between processing an application and issuing the approval, a problem for which the blame lies with the Department.  The Minister can do a public relations blitz, claiming he has 90% of the applications processed.  However, getting the approval out to individual farmers to enable them to set in train their farm safety works, such as roofing or fencing off silage pits, is a different matter.  How quickly can the Department get the approvals out?</p><p>I congratulate the Minister on his achievements in securing access for Irish beef exports back into the American and Chinese markets.  What level of exports does the Minister anticipate achieving for the Chinese market?  I know the Chinese authorities will send an inspection team for its final approval.  How soon will the market be open for Irish exports?  I know a grey market existed in this area for a few years.  How much will this new development make it a more profitable market?</p><p>Potentially, 50,000 farmers will apply for GLAS, the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme.  I was a farm planner myself back in the 1980s.  I know if one gets bogged down in the bureaucracy that is often attached to some of these schemes, no matter how good a planner one is, one will be held up for weeks.  Will the Minister streamline the bureaucracy?</p><p>A recent report stated the average payment in GLAS could be as low as &euro;3,000, while the Minister was hoping the minimum payment would be &euro;5,000.  The 15 May deadline is pretty tight.  It will have to be subject to some degree of elasticity.  Is it true farmers will not be able to split a parcel of land to carry out different measures on separate field areas?  Will they lose out as a result of this rule?  These are the technical conditions which can see an applicant going down to &euro;2,500 in a payment.  I want to see people getting the maximum payment of &euro;5,000 without the bureaucracy scribbling away trying to reduce it by 40% to 50%.</p></speech>

An allocation of &euro;28 million has been made for research and training.  This is an important area.  Does the Minister regard the allocation as sufficient?  An allocation of &euro;800,000 has been given for biofuel initiatives. What are these?  Can we move on from the miscanthus disaster in the past?  While we have heard much talk about prices in the dairy industry, the Minister must remember tillage is also undergoing problems with prices.  Teagasc funding has increased from &euro;1.08 million to &euro;1.13 million.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Tom Barry:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2317"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Tom Barry"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=2317&amp;amp;pid=TomBarry&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Tom Barry"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It states here that this has to do with the increased cost of retirements.  It seems terrible to be increasing the Vote yet getting no extra feet on the ground.  I know it is a legacy issue, but when is the Minister considering net hiring of people into Teagasc?</p><p> The funding for the World Food Programme is kept the same at &euro;9,960,000.  Would it be possible for any of the milk or milk products that went over quota to go into that?  I am just curious.</p><p> General legal expenses went from &euro;2.5 million to &euro;3.3 million.  Can we have an outline of what these were?  It is quite a significant increase, of around &euro;800,000.  Is there any breakdown of what these expenses are or are they kept private?  I think that is on page 26.  </p><p> Could the Minister give us guidelines on what sort of projects would be considered for the CEDRA fund, which is &euro;1 million?  There will be farmers and people who would like to diversify and would like to know these.  Maybe they are already available but I am not aware of them.</p></speech>

I welcome the opening of GLAS ahead of time, as expected.  I can see the challenges associated with that timeline, but great effort is being made to open it as soon as possible.</p> <p>  From the point of view of the beef sector, that is great news about China.  I congratulate the Minister and his officials on that and thank them for the significant work that went on behind the scenes.  Given the 126% increase in money for beef through the data and genomics scheme, it might be an opportune time for the Minister to give us his view on the current position of the beef sector.  This is a major shot in the arm for it, but in light of the increase to this scheme and the difficult year the industry had last year, it would be interesting to hear his view on that.  Knowledge transfer is also referenced in the Minister's address.  I hope the maximum amount of that money goes to the primary producer and the farmer and that we keep the costs of facilitation to a minimum, particularly in light of the increase that is coming to Teagasc.  </p> <p>  An increase of &euro;14 million for the bloodstock industry is welcomed.  It is necessary on the basis of some of the cuts made five or six years ago.  A huge effort has been made to protect our industry and as soon as money is available it will be very much welcomed for that industry, which employs 14,000 people but has the potential to employ over 20,000, as it did in the past.  I know it is intended for HRI, but the Minister might outline how he envisages that extra money being spent.  Does he see capital projects as part of that expenditure?  The increase in money allocated to horse welfare is also to be welcomed, but the Minister might also outline how he sees that extra money being spent.</p><p>I welcome the number of schemes introduced this year.  GLAS, in particular, was announced last week.  The challenge in respect of GLAS will be to get as many farmers as possible into the scheme and ensuring they get as much as possible out of it as fast as possible.  Is there a plan in place to do that?</p><p> The next issue is farm safety.  There is major concern about that.  Is the Minister planning to introduce a special part of the knowledge transfer scheme where farm safety may be involved in this scheme, whether compulsory or otherwise?  We discussed this at a previous meeting and it was referred to earlier.  It might be the way to go.  Has the Minister considered any options in that regard?</p><p> The targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, will be announced in a month or six weeks.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Pat Deering:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2290"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Pat Deering"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=2290&amp;amp;pid=PatrickDeering&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Pat Deering"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The criteria for TAMS was previously was very rigid.  The Minister's statement mentioned the opportunities for the dairy sector involved in TAMS.  Will it be specific diary equipment for example, or is there a list of issues that could come under that area?  For example, if a farmer wanted to improve his roadway structure, would that qualify under TAMS?  </p><p> There is a proposed increase in spending on the control of horses in the coming year.  Is this money that is specifically allocated to local authorities for horses that may be running wild in the urban areas?  It is a huge problem in urban areas whereby horses are left go wild and it then falls back on somebody to tidy it up.  The somebody is the local authority and there is a cost involved in that.  In my own town of Carlow, it is an ongoing issue whereby so-called stray horses are left to be looked after.  It is a huge cost.  The horses cause untold damage and hassle everywhere.  One would have to wonder if the people who may own these horses can be made directly responsible in some way.  </p><p> I would like to pick up on the points my colleagues have made on the Commission on the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, report and the &euro;1 million allocation.  Is that allocation for the implementation of the report?  There are 37 different recommendations in it - have they been prioritised or is an implementation committee in place?  The Minister of State is directly responsible for this.  There is a lot of good information in the report that could be very helpful for rural Ireland.</p><p> As Deputy Penrose mentioned previously, we have always talked about bureaucracy.  When all the schemes start off, we talk about what would make them more consumer friendly and farmer friendly, yet the process seems to be getting more and more bureaucratic.  Is it possible to make it more friendly? </p></speech>

There is no provision this year for the locally-led environment schemes.  Will they even be opened for application?  Regarding knowledge transfer and the beef technology adoption programme, BTAP, I have been told by people who are being notified for the 2015 BTAP discussion groups that they are going to have to pay, even though the provision per participant to TEAGASC is, I understand, &euro;350.  Each individual participant is going to have a lesser amount net at the end of the year.  Going back to what Deputy Deering has said, as much as possible of that money should go to the primary producer, to the participants.  Otherwise it is not going to be attractive.  The principle of knowledge transfer and discussion groups should be encouraged rather than discouraged.</p> <p>  The Minister has a range of questions and comments to deal with.  I thank the members as we covered the ground in 22 minutes.  </p><p>I have not given the responses yet, which might take a while.  I will try and give as much detail as I can.</p><p> On Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's question about taxation, we are not trying to give everybody a tax break, we are trying to use taxation to do strategic things, like move land out of conacre into long-term leasing, which is working very well.

As the Deputy is aware, there is a flexibility to go beyond 2020 to N+2 or N+3 if we must, just as with the last RDP when this and the previous Governments had to reduce spending.  I hope that we will be able to spend the full amount of money under the new RDP before 2020, but it will be for future governments to decide.  The intention is to increase expenditure each year for the next six years.  We have increased expenditure by &euro;42 million since last year.  That is the start of the new development programme.  We will increase expenditure again next year because we must reach an average spend in the next six years that goes far beyond what we are spending currently.  This is a good news story for farmers.  We will see increasing expenditure each year until 2020 and, potentially, beyond.</p><p> The question that everyone is asking is whether we will be able to get the job done on the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, in the time available.  For all area-based payment schemes, we must have a deadline of the middle of May under the regulations.  This is why we have been so intent on getting GLAS open as soon as we can.  As some people who have been following this matter will know, we are opening GLAS on the basis of what is effectively a verbal agreement with the Commission.  We are not even getting our letter of comfort from the Commission until the middle of next month.  As we must get the application process up and running, we have opened GLAS on the basis of an understanding with the Commission.  We are confident that there will be no changes and that the Commission will be satisfied.  We will open some of the other schemes, those that are not area based, on the back of the letter of comfort.  They can have closing dates beyond 15 May.</p><p> There is pressure, but everyone in this room has put me under pressure to get payments out in 2015 for GLAS.  We have &euro;20 million in a budget that I want to get out to farmers under GLAS.  I want them to be involved for the last three months of the year.  If we are to do that, we must get applications in by the middle of May so that we can assess them over the summer and make decisions as soon as we can afterwards.</p><p> There are approximately 400 planners outside of Teagasc.  Teagasc is working with the farm relief service to take on extra help to get plans in place.  The website has been open since yesterday for people to start uploading plans and maps.  My official can interrupt me if I am getting anything wrong, but that is my understanding.  Planners should not wait for time to pass.  The Deputy is right, in that we need a turnover in terms of getting plans prepared and ready for formal submission on the system.  We need that process to be up and running this week.  That is why we have opened it.  Farmers should be talking with their planners today about agreeing a timeframe for putting their plans in place.  Many plans will be straightforward.  They are not complex.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The commonage plans will also be straightforward but if issues arise with its implementation we are not going to disqualify anybody simply because it is not in place in time.  As long as farmers apply and commit to acting in a way that is consistent with the commonage GLAS plan, they will be able to submit their applications earlier and the plan will confirmed subsequently.  If they are struggling to find or agree on a planner for their commonage, the Department will appoint a planner.  That is one of the roles we can play on a helpful basis.</p><p> The numbers I provided earlier on REPS and AEOS were approximations prepared for me by the Department.  The correct figure for AEOS is 19,275.  AEOS 1 is 7,500, whereas AEOS 2 and 3 are just under 6,000 each.</p><p> We are looking to accommodate later closing dates for commonages, which I recognise is a genuine concern, but I hope they will not be necessary.  In regard to land eligibility, I received an open letter on this issue.  There is no agenda in my Department to force down the eligible land on commonage areas.  We are required to carry out a certain number of inspections all over the country over commonage land and non-commonage land.  It is up to farmers to decide how much land they include on their single farm payment application under Pillar 1.  It is not up to us to tell them.  We can indicate a guideline figure on what we think is eligible but the farmers ultimately have to exercise their judgment on what they consider to be farmable land.  We want to help farmers get land that is not currently being farmed back into production.  This is why GLAS is such a progressive scheme.  It aims to increase stocking rates in most cases because there has been under grazing on certain commonage areas.  There has also been over grazing, however, and we need to manage that.  I hope GLAS will be able to get land into a better condition in many cases.  The only way commonage land can be managed is by grazing it.</p></speech>

The Minister made the key point that the GLAS plan identifies what can be achieved.  I am concerned that if a farmer submits an application on 15 May which contains the achievable figure instead of the current figure, he or she will be liable for penalties.  If the farmer signs up to a GLAS plan for the land, will he or she be allowed to include the figure he or she thinks will be achievable on this basic payment?  That could have a significant impact on the farmer.</p><p>It does not have a significant impact on the single farm payment for this year because farmers will receive the same decoupled payment.  The single farm payment will be the same but it will be applied for based on a lesser hectarage.  It may have an impact on redistribution or disadvantaged area scheme payments but the amount of the single farm payment will be the same.  Farmers need to sit down with their planners to make an accurate assessment of their land in terms of what is farmable and what is not.  That is how the Commission will audit the scheme.  We are not trying to catch people out.  There are not 300 inspections of commonage land.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->All sorts of rumours that are not based in reality are circulating.  There were some inspections and some farmers were written to on the back of inspections.  The results of the inspections were expressed to the farmers and shareholders concerned.  That is all that has happened.  There is no agenda, apart from trying to help farmers get as much of their land back into as "farmable" a condition as possible so as to maximise the area for which we can justifiably apply for single farm payments.  This is my Department's only agenda, apart from looking after commonage areas in a way that protects biodiversity, wildlife and the other sustainability issues we need to look after.</p><p> Deputy Pringle asked about CEDRA, as did a number of members.  As people might remember, the Minister of State, Deputy Ann Phelan, was attached to my Department, and she has specific responsibility for CEDRA.  We felt it was important that she have some budget to work with in terms of the responsibilities that are linked to my Department.  She is also very much linked to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  CEDRA spans a number of Departments and was specifically not about agriculture but about rural economies outside the farm gate.  That was the whole point of it.</p><p> A decision was made in early 2015 that funding should be provided for the social farming across borders project, subhead A13, CEDRA rural innovation and development fund, and approximately &euro;40,000 went into it.  I suspect we may spend more money on social farming projects, which is progressive thinking whereby one would use the infrastructure of a farm and a farm family to support in work people who may have other challenges that would make it very difficult for them get into the workforce otherwise.  There are some very successful social farming initiatives involving, for example, people who have challenges regarding their mental health, confidence and disabilities.  I am very supportive of this and hope we will be able to put more money and resources into it.</p><p> Further proposals are being developed to achieve maximum benefit from the fund, including proposals on activating female rural farm entrepreneurship and improving agritourism options.  These options are being discussed between the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and are intended to complement the work already being done under the Action Plan for Jobs 2015 on entrepreneurship and tourism.  Although it is a relatively small amount of money in the bigger scheme, we will see rural projects that can help get people back to work.  Another initiative I support is the concept of village markets by which we would encourage villages, towns and communities to create opportunities for buying and selling products.  Such markets are also important social outlets in many small rural communities and the idea is working well.  The initiatives we will be funding will be positive, and after the programme has been rolled out, the committee members will be able to judge it.</p><p> While the seafood development programme will focus on jobs, the idea that we would not upgrade and modernise our food processing facilities because we want an increased workforce would be flawed thinking.  Our seafood industry competes with many other countries and we need modern processing facilities.  This involves mechanisation and modern equipment from a food safety and standards point of view, in terms of the quality of fish and so on.  We have invested a lot of money in upgrading and expanding fish processing facilities, particularly in Donegal, and it has increased the workforce in many factories.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I reiterate to Deputy Pringle that this has happened.  Most of it is about adding value to product.  The Deputy is talking about factories that would have had a lot of people effectively gutting fish, much of which has been mechanised since then.  That is not where most of the money has gone in recent years.  Most of the money the Government has spent on the seafood processing sector has been about adding value to product, whether that is packaging, smoking or whatever.  The Government deliberately has had a higher grant aid provision linked to higher value-added processing.  If he wishes, I can send through the detail to Deputy Pringle as to where the Department has spent money.</p><p> The Department will continue to try to ensure that Ireland has a seafood industry that is competitive and modern, which employs as many people as possible and which gets as much fish as possible through those systems, be they from Irish trawlers or from foreign trawlers.  The alternative is we simply will see more and more fish getting pumped into containers and taken to other parts of Europe for processing because we are not efficient here.  The Deputy knows the fishing industry well enough to know this happens in huge volumes.  The Department wishes to have more processing take place here, as well as to have more added value and jobs here, just like it has done in the agrifood sector.  We do not want Ireland simply to be exporting commodities of whole fish.</p><p> In respect of subhead C7.6, on environmental compliance, my understanding is it actually pertains to research.  In 2014, the subheads were used for the first time to fund preparatory work for the phased implementation of the ban on discarding fish, which formed part of the Common Fisheries Policy reform package agreed in 2013.  The first part of this ban commenced on 1 January 2015 with the second and more complex phase due on 1 January 2016.  The projected expenditure was based on estimates of projected data collection, research, workshops, gear trials and a range of projects to inform the development of specific proposals for actions at national, regional and EU level.  In other words, this has gone from being capital expenditure to current expenditure in preparation for what will be a major challenge for the industry, for the Department and for the agencies that are working with the seafood industry to introduce a discards ban on mixed fisheries, which will be phased in over the coming years.</p><p> Ultimately, this will be a good thing for the fishing industry because it will stop the dumping of approximately 40% of the fish that are caught, but it will involve a transition and the Department must make sure that the fishermen can manage the transition properly from a financial and a management perspective.  It would be great to have a detailed discussion on that challenge on another occasion because I would be very interested to get feedback from people like Deputies Pringle, Ferris and others who are interested in the seafood sector.  This is something that must be done and either we find a way to do it or the Commission will enforce a way of doing it.  I know which of those two options I desire.</p><p> Deputy Penrose asked about the beef genomics programme.  At present, the plan is that the Department estimates it will be paying out on approximately 650,000 animals.  Mr. Fintan O&rsquo;Brien will correct me if I am wrong but I think that is the approximate figure.  The Department wants the first ten animals in a herd to get &euro;100 - I am referring to a calved cow in this regard - and essentially, this means approximately 290,000 of the aforementioned 650,000 animals will receive &euro;100 per head.  That is approximately half the national herd, if one likes.  As the average herd size for a suckler herd is 17 animals, most farmers will have more than half of their herd getting &euro;100 per animal.  However, as the Deputy is aware, there are some major operators in the midlands who have many more animals in their herds than the national average.  While they know they will get &euro;100 for the first ten animals, they have 80 or 120 animals and they will want to know what is the story with the rest of them.</p></speech>

I suspect one of the first things we would do is to start with the guys with more than 60 animals.  They would receive &euro;80 per animal for as many as we could pay them.  That is not unreasonable.  We will prioritise the small farmer, as we do in the case of the &euro;10 payment.</p></speech>

We want to make sure we keep the people concerned in business.  The big operators will receive a big dividend, but if we must cut our cloth to measure, they will be making a contribution.  I have not made a definitive decision, but I am providing the committee with my thinking on the matter.  There were over 6,000 applicants and we will have them approved as soon as possible.  As we only closed for the receipt of applications in mid-January, we are moving quickly.  I can provide the Deputy with the exact figures.  The closing date was 9 January, by which time 6,299 applications had been received, of which over 4,000 have been processed and 1,000 are being discussed with the farmers concerned.  Some 1,900 have been referred to local offices for approval; 10% will be subject to a prepayment inspection, while 315 of the 1,900 have been approved.  We are rolling out the scheme as fast as we can, but we must go through a process.  We cannot spend European money without ensuring the correct percentage of pre-inspections.  The money must, however, be spent this year.  It is money under the last rural development programme that we must spend.  That is why the scheme is being brought forward at this pace.</p><p> On the question of whether we should include a safety module, there is a compulsory health and safety module in some of the knowledge transfer programmes covering the beef, dairy, equine, sheep, poultry and tillage aspects.  There will be a compulsory health and safety module as part of the discussion groups.  Whether it is taken to the next stage where we say people must conduct a farm safety audit before they can qualify is something about which we must talk.  If the committee can make some recommendations on farm safety, I will listen very closely.  No one has all of the answers and it is something the committee could do, given its level of experience.  I have spoken to FBD, Teagasc and the Health and Safety Authority.  We have also spoken to other insurance companies and other stakeholders, as well as farming organisations about what we could do, within reason, to encourage a change in attitudes to safety.  We are doing this in the fishing industry and as a result, the past few years have not been as tragic.  Last year was horrific in terms of the number of farm accidents, in which 30 people lost their lives, the highest number since records began.  As we have already a tragedy this year, committee members will find me proactive on the issue of farm safety and willing to spend a lot of money and make direct policy changes, if we think this will work.  I would like to receive some feedback from the committee.  It would be a good use of its time to hold hearings because there are many good people involved in trying to find a way forward on the issue of farm safety.</p><p> On the Chinese market, the same publication which suggested the average GLAS payment might be &euro;3,000 was also stating we would sell &euro;75 million worth of beef to China.  I am not sure if either figure is accurate, but &euro;75 million might be an accurate estimate.  I am not sure about the figure of &euro;3,000 because the majority of farmers participating in GLAS will comfortably receive more than that amount.  They will have plenty of options to do so, but it is up to farmers to decide how they put their plans together.  We are exporting more than &euro;40 million worth of cattle skins to China.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The industry is very excited about the potential of that market.  Last year China imported 240,000 tonnes of beef; by 2018, we are estimating conservatively that it will be importing 1.75 million tonnes.  That is the pace of growth we are seeing in terms of the demand for non-Chinese beef.  The consumption patterns of the Chinese population also give grounds for optimism.  While consumption <i>per capita</i>was one third of a kilogram in the 1980s, it is now more than 5 kg and continuing to increase.  It is an enormous market that is only going to get larger and larger.  Ireland is the only European country that can access the market.  For anybody who has been to China - I have participated in a couple of trade missions - it is clear that the people associate the European Union with quality.  They want German cars, French clothes and Italian shoes.  My objective is to ensure they will want Irish meat.  Many Chinese consumers have significant disposable incomes and will pay more for high quality products.  In the infant formula market, for example, people are willing to pay $66 per tin for a product made in west Limerick, even though a locally produced tin further down the shelf is selling for $10.  There is a very exciting opportunity for Irish beef producers in the Chinese market and we are determined to pursue it.  We will be taking a trade mission there in the second half of the year to ensure we do everything we can politically to open doors for the beef industry.  The same applies to exports to the United States which is also a very exciting market, about which members have heard me speak on previous occasions.<br/><br/>Deputy Tom Barry asked about Leader funding.  While that funding is drawn down by agreement under the rural development plan in my Department, the detail thereof is really the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government which is hoping to start the process of setting up new Leader and local action groups in the coming weeks.  The process is under way and I expect Leader funding to be available in the second half of the year.  I cannot be sure of this, but that is my expectation.<br/><br/>Some &euro;28 million is being allocated for research and training.  One of our priorities throughout the lean period was to ensure funding for research and development would not be cut dramatically because it would have had a very detrimental impact in the medium term.  Now that resources are increasing and we are spending more year on year, many of the research programmes we supported will be coming to maturity and we will get the benefit of them in the food sector broadly, from forestry to food nutrition to dairy product processing.  In fact, we are already seeing some of the benefits at the Moorepark research centre and elsewhere.<br/><br/>As part of the National Research Prioritisation Exercise, as part of which almost &euro;500 million is being provided for research, at least five of the 14 priority areas will be in the agrifood and marine sectors.  That is a total change from where we were a few years ago, when the marine and agriculture sectors did not even get a look in.</p></speech>

The National Research Prioritisation Exercise, NRPE, was published in 2012 and recommended that the majority of the approximately &euro;500 million annual public spend on scientific research should be targeted at 14 priority investment areas, at least five of which are relevant to the agrifood and marine sectors.  This reflects the priority the Government is giving to these sectors.</p><p> Nobody needs to tell me about tillage prices.  We have had two very good harvests in terms of quality, moisture and yield, but the prices have been lousy.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is the reality and the reason is that we have had very good harvests all over the world and there is a lot of grain available.</p><p> That is also the reason for the over-supply in recent months in the international dairy markets.  We have had cheap grain for two years in a row and most of the world's milk is produced on the back of grain.  That led to an increase in dairy production which drove down dairy prices.  We are starting to come out the other side of that because there is drought happening now in certain parts of the world.  That means that we will not have the kind of price collapse in the dairy market that some were predicting - or at least we think not; we cannot be sure.  We are trying to do things for the tillage sector, particularly under TAMS.  I spoke to the committee before about trying to encourage more arable farmers to use organic fertilisers.  Building storage facilities on tillage farms is somewhat counter-intuitive for farmers who do not have any livestock but it gives them the option of being able to buy slurry when the price is right.  They can use it when they need to in a much more targeted way if they have storage capacity.  </p><p> On the issue of Teagasc staff, we have actually increased the numbers.  We have increased the amount of teaching staff Teagasc is allowed to employ because the agricultural colleges are all full.  I was in Mountbellew Agricultural College last week, which has 340 students enrolled at the moment and is by far the most it has ever had.  It was set up in 1904 and is the oldest agricultural college in the country.  That situation is reflected across the other colleges too.  It is not too long ago that people were talking about closing down Mountbellew and other colleges like Gurteen but I am glad to say that those colleges are thriving now.  </p><p> The Department has sanctioned over 50 mission-critical appointments in Teagasc since 2009.

To be clear, some people seem to think that I if I did not spend that money thus, I would be able to spend the &euro;10 million on farmers but that is not the case.  This is part of the Government's contribution towards development aid.  If we did not spend that &euro;10 million, then the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would have to spend &euro;10 million more and we would spend &euro;10 million less.  It is in a separate category in terms of our budget so it is not a question of me taking money from farmers, from agriculture or from fishermen and giving it to the WFP.  We have a very close connection with the WFP because of our understanding of food development issues.  That is why my Department has traditionally spent money in this way.  </p><p>Regarding Deputy Heydon's comments on the beef industry, clearly we will have a better year this year than we had last year in the sector.  A lot of people have said that the only reason the beef price is up is that the kill is down but that is not true.  We have been killing over 30,000 animals for the last number of weeks.  If anything, the kill so far this year is slightly up on last year.  That said, the anticipated number of slaughtered animals this year will be 110,000 to 120,000 less than last year.  That is the indication that we have at present, in terms of calves coming through and so forth.</p><p> The combination of killing fewer animals, opening new markets and less availability of beef generally across the EU should mean that we should have strong pricing through this year, but one never knows with beef.  Things can change quite quickly.  I would be hopeful that we will have a very strong year this year.  Certainly farmers are anticipating that we will have a very strong year.  They are spending a lot of money on store animals at the moment.  A lot of farmers have said to me that they simply cannot get animals in marts at the moment in terms of the prices being commanded.  That worries me a little because it means that if the price weakens then people who have bought animals for a lot of money are exposed.  That said, farmers need to make their own business decisions.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> From my perspective, we will continue to work within the beef forum and with farming organisations and the industry to maintain as healthy a beef market as we can.  The big thing we will do between now and the summer is to produce a recommended structure for beef producer organisations which will be able legally to negotiate price with factories under the new Common Agricultural Policy.  That will change fundamentally the relationship between farmers and factories for the better.  One will have farmer-owned producer organisations who might be negotiating with factories on behalf of 1,000 beef farmers.  They will have real volume to negotiate with around price, spec and market conditions.  It will be a two-way communications as they will also be able to communicate with their farmers in terms of what kind of animal and what spec, age and weight will get them the maximum price.  Likewise, they will be able to negotiate aggressively with factories in a way that moves us away from farmers being simply price takers.  This will allow farmers to negotiate collectively on a legal basis.  That is not the case at the moment for farming organisations.  It will make a difference.</p><p> We will be supporting live exports also.  Deputy Michael McNamara has been very vocal on this issue.  Live exports were up approximately 18% last year across the range from breeding heifers, to calves, weanlings and finished animals.  We will continue to facilitate live exports to ensure that the prices being paid in Ireland are competitive and provide farmers with decent value in terms of the margin that is there.</p><p> On the horse and greyhound fund, the equine industry is unusual in Ireland.  It is an international industry.  If we allow funding to fall below a certain level for a sustained period of time, Ireland will lose its place as one of the foremost horse racing countries in the world.  That is from a breeding point of view as well as from an events and racing point of view.  If we do not have prize money that attracts the top horses to race here, we will find ourselves in the second tier of countries in racing and that would be a disaster on a series of fronts, including employment, income, exports of thoroughbreds and so on.  I am glad therefore that on the back of getting an extra &euro;25 million into the Exchequer from taxing online bets, we are going to allocate &euro;16 million to the horse and greyhound fund.  That will bring the industry very close to where it was in the so-called boom times when there was a very strong fund.  It is a very positive development.  We are also introducing new horse racing legislation to ensure the money is spent in a way that is transparent, effective and appropriate.</p><p> Regarding horse welfare, an extra &euro;1 million in capital investment is being made.  We have increased funding for the control of horses from &euro;1.6 million to &euro;2.6 million but the extra &euro;1 million is for a specific purpose.  I have written to local authorities to ask them to make proposals for capital investment projects to address welfare for urban horse populations.  That means managed stables, grazing facilities and yards to enable us to run education programmes for young people who are very attached to horses in a managed and controlled environment.  We cannot continue to accept horses in back gardens, public areas, NAMA-owned land or parks in city centres.  From a welfare point of view, it is totally unacceptable.   It is also totally unacceptable from a legal point of view as people must have registered premises now for equines and animals must be microchipped and have passports.</p><p> We need to know and understand where our horses are and who owns them.  Currently, there are too many horses outside the system and we will change that.  There will be a stick and there will be carrot.  The carrot is that we will pay for projects in different parts of the country.  We are hoping to facilitate four this year, which will probably be attached to four cities.  The best proposals will get the money.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Hopefully, we will facilitate another four next year.  For example, if Traveller families have horses that are not in an equine registered premises there may be an option for us to work with local authorities to ensure that their horses are kept in a more controlled environment where we can put supports and education programmes in place and so on.  This will involve not only Traveller families but others who have horses in an urban environment.  I believe that will be a good initiative and I am anxious to progress it.</p><p> I believe I have answered most of Deputy Deering's questions which covered the green, low-carbon, agri-environmental scheme, GLAS, farm safety, targeted, agricultural modernisaiton schemes, TAMS, the control of horses and the Commission on Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, report.  We are trying to reduce the level of bureaucracy.  For example, one can only apply for GLAS online and one has to do so by going through a planner.  That has made a significant difference in terms of reducing the bureaucracy for farmers.  The people who do the form filling and the loading up of maps are the planners and one pays the planner to do that.</p><p> In terms of hen harrier designated lands, I have put considerable thought into this issue to try to be helpful for those affected by it.  Up until now fewer than 400 farmers affected by hen harrier land designations have got any form of payment or compensation.  Those farmers and landowners would have got a payment of somewhere between &euro;5,000 to &euro;12,000 and in the very high cases, they might have got up to &euro;14,000 but that would involve a very small number.  We anticipate that all 4,000 farmers who have been affected by hen harrier land designations will be able to come into GLAS and they will qualify for GLAS plus.  Therefore many of them will get a payment of &euro;7,000 per hectare.  Instead of spending a relatively small amount of money on a relatively small number of people, we could be spending somewhere &euro;25 million and &euro;28 million on the consequences of hen harrier designation in terms of a payment that recognises the restrictions on farmers and therefore the reduced capacity for income from their farmland.  </p><p> I cannot do everything to provide for those affected by hen harrier designations.  Another Department designated those lands and put the scheme in place on the back of those designations.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine has more money than the National Parks and Wildlife Service and, effectively, we are creating a separate category in GLAS for special areas of conservation and designated areas and giving a recognition payment for the limited activity that can happen on much of that designated land.  That means that 3,500 or more farmers whose lands have been designated, for which they did not receive any payment previously, will now be able to get up to &euro;7,000 without having to do anything apart from putting in place a basic GLAS plan which recognises the restriction applying to their land on the back of the designation  It is a big step forward.  If there are other things that can or should be done, they would need to be examined, but in the context of GLAS, that is as far as we could go.  We could not get agreement on a higher payment than &euro;7,000.  We are doing what we can to recognise the hen harrier designation issue, which is significantly more than was done in the past, and this will represent a significant chunk of the overall GLAS provision.  If we were to do any more, other farmers who want to access GLAS would have a big difficulty with it.</p><p> On the Chairman's questions regarding the locally-led environmental schemes, I hope we will be able to get that competitive process up and running this year.  I know there is a significant interest in that in Wicklow.  There is also a significant interest in it in other areas.  A number of island communities have also expressed an interest in it.  That will involve a competitive process and the best submissions will get the money.  This is like the Burren scheme, with which Deputy McNamara will be familiar.  </p><p> The Chairman also asked about the discussion groups and how much farmers will be asked to pay.  The important aspect of the discussion groups must be the quality of the learning in them as opposed to just paying somebody to turn up.  If we are to get good people in to give farmers the information they need to farm better and more profitably and sustainably, that costs money and that is the basis for the payment.  We will try to keep that cost as low we can and I will talk to Teagasc about it.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2170"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Andrew Doyle"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=2170&amp;amp;pid=AndrewDoyle&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Andrew Doyle"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There have been all kinds of figures thrown out, some are not accurate and some are reasonably accurate.

Otherwise I will have to reduce the amount of money that goes to farmers and give it to Teagasc to fund the schemes.  One cannot count the same money twice. </p></speech>

Could he clarify from whom, or from which institution?</p> <p> I congratulate the Minister on his recent successes and all the work he and his Department are doing to open up further markets to Irish beef.  It was unfortunate that in the week the Chinese market was announced, farmers were receiving lowered quotes from beef factories.  I would not be entirely optimistic, but I hope the Minister is right when he says it will be a better year.  I also welcome the extra &euro;1 million the Minister has put into beef marketing and the &euro;144 million funding for Teagasc and Bord Bia.  </p> <p> The quality assurance scheme is a central plank in our beef marketing. This excellent initiative is funded largely at a cost to the Exchequer.  Farmers make sacrifices to meet the criteria required, and it is good that they do so, but beef processors can sell their product into external markets more easily because of this.  In return for that, the beef processors offer farmers &euro;4 a head for cattle out of spec.  Cattle in spec have their own bonus scheme because it suits those farmers involved to flush out cattle at times of the year they otherwise might not come out.  The sum of &euro;4 a head for quality assured cattle is almost an insult by the beef sector standards.  What does the Minister intend to do about this?</p></speech>

It is the figure we had agreed on, up to &euro;7000.  We had to negotiate all these payments and these ceilings with the Commission in order to get agreement from it as to how the scheme would operate.  The Commission is the body mentioned when talking about agreement and acceptance on these matters, because ultimately it is paying 54% of the cost.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Simon Coveney:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=250"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=AGS&amp;amp;memberid=250&amp;amp;pid=SimonCoveney&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Simon Coveney"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> Beef prices are currently 15% higher than they were last September.  We cannot expect beef prices to increase every week, they will go up and down slightly but as long as the graph is moving upwards then we are in quite good shape.  What farmers are paying for store cattle at the moment would suggest that they are encouraged by the pricing trends we have seen.  We will have to see if prices increase or stay the same, but there are only so many things I can do as Minister.  I cannot instruct factories to pay more.  There is a quality assurance bonus of 12 cent per kg and there is an out-of-spec bonus, negotiated and agreed in principle between farming organisations and factories in the Beef Forum last November.  Farming organisations are not happy with the money offered but the agreement also said it would operate on a cost neutral manner.  This has not happened as there has been an extra cost to it.  I cannot get into the space of negotiating price.  Anytime I do mention price I seem to get a letter from the Competition Authority.  The whole reason for needing beef producer organisations is to have bodies to negotiate price on a weekly basis.  That will be a very good development.</p><p> Quality assurance makes sense for farmers also.  If factories sell meat for a higher price, because it is associated with safety and quality, then farmers get paid more.</p></speech>

We are now the only European country that can sell to the United States and to China.  We may also be the only European country that can sell to Japan.  As a Government we are doing everything we can to create the conditions for buoyant beef prices but I cannot micro-manage pricing at factory level.

I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Chairman:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2339"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Marcella Corcoran Kennedy"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2339&amp;amp;pid=MarcellaCorcoranKennedy&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Marcella Corcoran Kennedy"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I remind our guests that their presentations should be no more than five minutes duration.  As a number of delegates are presenting today, all of their presentations and submissions have been circulated to members in order that they might have an opportunity to read and digest their contents.  I call on Mr. Mark Fielding to make his presentation on low pay and a living wage.</p><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to address the joint committee.  As they are aware, I represent small and medium-sized businesses in Ireland and I am the CEO of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME.</p><p> I wish to touch on a number of issues that are of vital importance to small and medium employers and also to those affected by poverty.  Depending on to whom one listened in the period 1999 to 2000, the national minimum wage was supposed to address poverty by either reducing or eliminating the problem.  However, the survey of income and living conditions produced by the CSO in 2012 showed that the level of consistent poverty had increased since 2004 and that deprivation rates were steadily increasing.  It is clear, therefore, that the introduction of the national minimum wage, in order to get rid of poverty, has not actually worked.  I am sure Fr. Peter McVerry would agree with me in that regard.  The number of people who are homeless stands at its highest point ever in the history of the State.  People are not living in poverty because the minimum wage or their hourly rates of pay are too low.  There are, for example, individuals who earn above the minimum wage and are living in poverty.  People are living in poverty because they are either not working or not working enough.  They need jobs, not an increase in the minimum wage.</p><p> As members will be aware, 360,000 citizens are unemployed.  There are also 86,000 involved in activation schemes which, for want of a better expression, means that they are also unemployed.  This means that, in total, almost 450,000 citizens are out of work.  Of these, 96,000 have been unemployed for three years.  That is where the problem lies; it is not down to the position on the minimum wage.  Net income inequality in Ireland is close to the EU 28 average.  The Irish wealth distribution rate also roughly reflects the average which obtains in other developed countries.  The only explanation for the uneven spread in income inequality - in the context of earned income - relates to the fact that a huge number of people live in households in which nobody works.  In 2013 almost one in four of those aged under 60 years was living in a household in which no one was in employment.  That is double the EU average.  It is, in fact, the highest proportion in Europe without exception and significantly higher than in even Greece or Spain.  When an unusually large proportion of the population are not earning an income, it is not surprising that there is an uneven distribution of earned income.</p><p> As far as ISME is concerned, the concept of a national minimum wage was wrong from the very outset because it confused the roles of the Government and employers and placed the onus on the latter to pay a wage that sometimes was not economic.  Businesses can only afford to pay the value of the labour they purchase.  It is uneconomic for them to do otherwise.  During the period in which the national minimum wage has been in place, it has actually been increased by 55%.  However, we still have not eliminated poverty.  As stated, the level of poverty is increasing.  In the context of who is paying the national minimum wage, the National Competitiveness Council defines competitiveness as all those factors affecting the ability of Irish businesses to sell goods and services in international markets.  The council believes competitiveness is not an end in itself but a means of achieving sustainable improvements in living standards and quality of life.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Mark Fielding:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If that is the case we know that between 2000 and 2008 we have had a huge loss of competitiveness in the region of 39% to 40%.  It has come back slightly between 2008 and 2012 but we are again in the process of losing some competitiveness and in the background there is another call for an increase in the minimum wage.  The knock-on effect of the minimum wage will have an effect on wage values across the economy.</p><p> Taking into account the inflation figures of the past 12 years the ratio of national minimum wage to price levels at today's value would be about &euro;7.40 rather than &euro;8.65.  The solution we propose, rather than have a national minimum wage which puts the social responsibility on an employer, is that the Government would introduce an incomes policy which would include an earned income tax credit.  The amount of that credit could be a function of how much one earns and one's family size.  That process could remove all tax and other deductions on income that equates to about two thirds of the average industrial wage, ensuring that individuals can earn up to &euro;20,000 per annum before being taxed.  That could be targeted so that money goes to actual workers living in poverty.  It has the advantage of removing low paid employees from the tax net.  It enhances the progressive structure of tax policy.  It is making gainful employment more rewarding than the live register.  It fulfils the Government's obligation to redistribute income through the tax system, which is not an employer's function.  It takes the onus and cost of income distribution away from employers.  When low-wage workers are supported through tax cuts and rebates, then, being more equitable, all taxpayers share the financial burden.  We recommend that the Low Pay Commission investigate and cost this proposal as part of its work in the coming months.</p></speech>

I am aware that he previously provided assistance to the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  In my comments I wish to use the data available to economists to address the question, "Is Ireland a low pay economy?"  I can tackle the question from two approaches - the microeconomic approach, looking at it from the level of the individual, and the macroeconomic approach, looking at it from the level of the overall economy or an overall industry.  The microeconomic approach, the key data measure, is the incidence of low pay which is generally taken to be the proportion of employees earning less than two thirds of the median wage.  For Ireland the figure is very high.  Looking at the European Union 15, Ireland has the third highest incidence of low pay at just over 20% when account is taken of hourly pay.  The data are collected by the Central Statistics Office.  The advantage of using EUROSTAT data is that it aggregates it across and member states can make comparisons.  The OECD also provide aggregates but not the same level of detail that EUROSTAT offers.  The EUROSTAT is somewhat better.</p><p> In terms of full-time employees and part-time employees, Ireland remains towards the bottom of the league table.  In fact, for full-time, Ireland is at the bottom with the highest level incidence of low pay at 17%.  For all EU states, low pay is higher among part-time staff.  Given that they are being compared to a national benchmark, it is standard that part-time workers would generally be on lower hourly wages than full-time workers.  The incidence of low pay for part-time workers in Ireland is close to 40%, the third highest in the EU.</p><p> The headline figures would suggest that Ireland is a low pay economy.  However, we must look at that in more detail.  Three issues are key when addressing whether Ireland is a low pay economy from the micro perspective.  The first is the thresholds used, against what are we judging low pay.   The second is the tax rate on low pay.  Low pay is judged versus gross pay but the worker feels net pay.  The final issue, as alluded to by Mr. Mark Fielding from ISME, is the at risk of poverty rate for those in employment.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">  Mr. Seamus Coffey: :</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a broader measure as it takes into consideration pay, tax and transfers.  Ireland had the second highest threshold for low pay in the European Union.  According to the data, the median wage in Ireland is approximately &euro;19 and the low pay threshold is set at two thirds of this, at &euro;12.03, the second highest threshold used.  In Germany, the Netherlands and Finland the thresholds are all 20% lower.  We are judging our low pay threshold on much higher thresholds than other countries.  Anyone earning below &euro;12 an hour in Ireland is classed as being low paid, whereas in Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden, it is approximately &euro;10 or even &euro;9 in some cases.</p><p> EUROSTAT also produces figures based on purchasing power parity to account for differences in prices and even on that basis the low pay threshold in Ireland is the second highest, the highest being in Denmark whre an important consideration is the tax applied to the low paid.  Ireland, across the different types of household, has the lowest tax rates for those on low pay and EUROSTAT also looks at that factor.  It looks at tax rates on an annual basis, for those earning 67% of the average wage, as well as those on 100% of the average.  It looks at low earnings, at single income couples and low earning dual income couples.  In all household structures Ireland has one of the lowest net tax rates on gross pay, our gross pay threshold for those on low pay is higher and the amount of tax we impose is much lower.  </p><p> Net pay in Ireland is likely to be higher than in most other countries.  Denmark has the highest threshold, at over &euro;15, but on a single person without children on the average wage it will impose a tax rate of 38%.  In Ireland the equivalent tax rate would be approximately 21% or 22%.  While there is a gap in gross pay, in terms of net pay, the gap has been eliminated.  The gap between Ireland and Denmark is smallest in the case of a single person.  I am not cherry-picking these figures because on even lower wages the gap is much larger.  Tax is important because, while pay rates appear to be lower in Ireland, what the employee gets to take home may be higher because Ireland has an unusual tax system by international standards, in which we tax those on low pay very little and get to average levels when we get to those on higher incomes.</p><p> The final element of the microeconomic process that is useful is to combine pay, tax and transfers.  Looking at gross pay, less tax deducted, and transfers such as child benefit, for people who are at risk of poverty, namely, those below 60% of median disposable income, the rate for employees at risk of poverty in Ireland is one of the lowest in the European Union.  Some 3% of employees in Ireland live in households that are at risk of poverty.  The only country with a lower rate is Finland, at 2%; across the European Union the rates are higher in 13 of the EU15.  Therefore, while Ireland has one of the highest incidences of low pay, if one takes into account the higher rate, our lower tax rates and transfers we offer, the rate for employees at risk of poverty is one of the lowest in the European Union.</p><p> On the macroeconomic side of the national accounts, an important statistic is the wage or labour share, which represents the proportion of income going towards the compensation of employees.  It measures how much employees get of the value created in companies, how much goes to the Government in the form of product taxes and how much goes to companies in the form of profits, although the measure of profits is relatively broad.  In the matter of wage share, Ireland is right at the bottom of the table.  In the EU15 it is second from bottom, with only Greece having a lower wage share, at approximately 40%.  The profit share, the amount going to the gross operating surplus in Ireland, is the highest.</p></speech>

If he wishes to add further to his comments, he may, of course, do so in the course of the discussion with members.  I call on Senator David Cullinane to begin the questions as rapporteur in the compilation of the report.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Coffey and Mr. Fielding and thank them for their contributions.  We are looking to produce a document on low pay, decent work and a living wage.  The starting point for all of us would be a fair economy offering decent pay and decent work.  We also want to have a sustainable economy.  I argue that a more sustainable economy is one which offers decent work and decent pay.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A total of 20% of the workforce is on low pay, which means 400,000 workers experience poverty and deprivation while 11.7% of the workforce is at risk of poverty and 8.7% is in consistent poverty.  The ILCU tracker survey highlighted that almost 200,000 workers, or 11% of working adults, have no disposable income left at the end of the month with 480,000, or 27%, having less than &euro;50 left and another 730,000, or 41%, having less than &euro;100 left.  That means low pay, income equality and economic inequality are big problems across the economy.  How can they be addressed?  It is clear if one looks at the facts that the current model is not working.  We need a new model, which is about social solidarity and about everybody, including employers, having a responsibility.  I am taken aback by Mr. Fielding's contribution in which he seems to suggest that employers do not have a social responsibility and he referred to confusing the State's role in terms of social responsibility and an employer's role.</p><p> He said the minimum wage has not eradicated poverty.  Nobody would have argued that the minimum wage alone would eradicate poverty but what was missing from his contribution is the fact that the minimum wage has not increased since 2007.  The cost of living has increased with rents increasing to pre-crash levels but the minimum wage has not increased.  If it does not keep pace with inflation, it will not eradicate poverty.</p><p> The underlying problem is access to public services.  Child care, housing and health care are issues that hold people back in terms of in work poverty and so on.  Does Mr. Fielding believe that employers have a social responsibility?  Will he comment on the fact that Ireland has the third lowest taxation take in Europe and the lowest employer's PRSI take in Europe?   We are not taking in enough taxes to pay for public services.  If Mr. Fielding is putting it back on the State to take responsibility for and deal with poverty, deprivation and low pay and the problems low paid workers face, where will the money come from?  If we accept, given the facts, that the current model does not work, where will the revenue come from?  I did not hear an argument from him to increase taxation or employer's PRSI.  However, he argued against increasing the minimum wage.  He has not proposed an instrument to deal with these issues.  I am interested in what he and Mr. Connolly propose in this regard.</p><p> While Mr. Connolly's contribution was good and detailed, what practical measures need to be taken to deal with low pay and in work poverty?  Does he agree that housing, child care and health care are three critical areas requiring investment, which is necessary to lift people out of poverty?  What is his view on a living wage and the minimum wage?  What is view on the role of both business and the State in dealing with these issues?</p></speech>

If I pay what is the economic rate of pay to that person, taking that home, then that is what I am obliged to do.  There is confusion about redistributing wealth.  It is the Government's job to redistribute wealth; it is not my job.  It is not my job to pay above what I can afford to pay.  If I do then I will go out of business.  I have to compete in the open market so one cannot ask me to pay above the economic rate.</p> <p>  The consistent poverty rate is highest among the unemployed at 19.2% and is lowest for those at work at 1.9% which is a tenfold difference.  The whole thing is to get people back working; not charge more for the people who are lucky enough to be in work.  </p></speech>

One thing I would be wary of when looking at the people in work who are at risk of poverty is that more than half of them are self-employed.  The at risk of poverty rate for employees is relatively low and Ireland is second lowest in the EU.  Ireland has a high rate of almost 20% for those at risk of poverty among the self-employed which is where a lot of the low earnings exist.  The hourly pay rates are a bit incidental to the self-employed because they must earn money through their own productivity and through finding customers.  Low pay in the self-employed sector is probably far higher and is an issue that equally needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  In regard to where can Ireland get the money to pay for services that we wish to provide, we have one of the lower Government revenue rates in the EU.  There are two key differences between Ireland and the rest of the EU.  First, as I have already mentioned, is Ireland's relatively low rate of income tax on low to middle incomes.  Most EU countries would have a substantially higher rate.  Second, Ireland is right at the bottom in terms of employers' social insurance.  Most countries would use such insurance to have a far more extensive state run pension system than we have in Ireland.  One could consider the low rate as a form of deferred pay where people's employers pay into the system of social security.  Ireland is unusual due to having a flat rate social welfare pension system.  One needs a flat rate for the base but most countries would augment that funding with pay-related pensions.  I believe we can collect substantially more money from this sector and there is scope to raise social insurance contributions.  What most countries use social insurance for is to improve pension provision.  As we know, pension provision in Ireland is relatively low.  Our basic pension is &euro;230 a week.  For many people, if they are dependent on that sum, it can mean a substantial drop in income if they have not put aside money for a private pension.  This matter is something that can be addressed.</p> <p>  Let me turn to services such as housing, child care and health care.  Housing generates a lot of attention at the moment but many of the issues tend to arise at the margin.  I refer to the homeless and people who suffer rent increases.  By and large, housing and the standard of housing in Ireland would be some of the highest in the EU but clearly we have issues.</p> <p>  In regard to health care, an important aspect we can focus on is what is meant by "universal".  In Ireland, universal tends to mean free but most countries do not take the same approach.  They take universal to mean treating everybody the same.  Over the past number of weeks comparisons have been made between Ireland and France.  The French health care system has considerable merit but everybody pays for everything in that country.  The French system is massively subsidised but everyone makes a financial contribution.  Its subsidies come from a very progressive tax system which we have but we do not have universality in terms of treatment. </p> <p>  The key issue here is the minimum wage, social welfare and how to help people.  We should seek to help people.  One issue is to focus on what the Government can do and to reform our social welfare system.  We have a social welfare system that is very comprehensive but could be better.  We break up people into too many categories such as unemployment, disability, illness, lone parents and carers.  A more comprehensive system where everybody is treated the same would be far better.  If we are going to set a basic minimum benchmark for what we want people to have in this society then we should ensure we give it to everybody.</p></speech>

Does Senator Cullinane wish to ask a supplementary question?</p><p>Yes.  I thank Mr. Coffey for his comments.  I wish to return to the point made by Mr. Fielding about the responsibility of employers.  People want employers to pay decent wages.  We have, for example, some very large retail chains in this State that have been very profitable but do not pay their workers proper entitlements.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Dunnes Stores is one example where Mandate has embarked on a campaign on behalf of those workers on very low contract hours and low pay.  Mr. Fielding has, unfortunately, not dealt with the fact that 20% of the workforce are on low pay, which is the responsibility of the employers.  He has not dealt either with the fact that the minimum wage has not increased since 2007, yet the cost of living has gone up.  Employers have a responsibility to pay decent wages, especially when companies are profitable.  I would like Mr. Fielding to deal with that issue.  I have an interesting figure for him, too: the adjusted wage share of GDP in Ireland declined from 53.9% in 1996 to 50.2% in 2013.  Workers have seen an overall drop in their wages in terms of the adjusted wage share of GDP.  Employers do have a responsibility.</p><p> As an employer organisation, if ISME wants to put some of the responsibility for the redistribution of wealth back onto the State, it cannot have its cake and eat it, but it must be able to state from where that money will come.  It seems that Mr. Fielding is against wage and taxation increases, whether employer's PRSI, or tax on corporations or companies.  From where will the money come to redistribute wealth to deal with the issue of inequality, to which he refers but which he says the State must resolve?  He has to have some answers to these questions and accept that there are many employers who could pay better wages but who do not.  They are profitable companies and the State and decent employers subsidise them through welfare transfers.  It is bizarre for any employer organisation to stand over this.  I would be interested in Mr. Fielding&rsquo;s responses to these questions.</p></speech>

In my presentation I said taking the ratio of the national minimum wage to price levels, the actual minimum wage rate would be &euro;7.42, not its current rate of &euro;8.65.</p> <p>  In answer to the question of from where we would get the money, every person coming off the dole results in a saving of &euro;20,000 and will be producing tax revenue, employer&rsquo;s PRSI and their own universal social charge, USC etc.  The Senator can see the figuresd.  We cannot keep on saying the employer has to take on the responsibility.  I am stuck on that point and that is the way it is.  It is not our job to take on the responsibility of the State to redistribute wealth.  That is not what we are there for; we are there to employ people, make money in order that we can employ more people and offer a decent living to everybody and watch our competitiveness in order that when we and sell our goods on the open market, we can actually compete. </p></speech>

I invite Mr. Coffey to comment.</p><p>I thank the Senator for bringing up the issue of the wage share.  There is no doubt that in Ireland the wage share is very low.  If we consider the value added created by companies in the business economy - taking away the financial sector in which there are problems and the sectors dominated by the public sector - health, education and defence - across the European Union the wage share is 60%.  In other words, 60% of the value of companies created across the European Union goes to workers.  In Ireland the rate is 42%.  Therefore, the wage share is very low.</p><p> In the case of Ireland, there are unusual features such as from where does the value come.  We have two economies.  Ireland is the only economy in the European Union in which foreign-owned companies create more value than domestically-owned companies.  The value added by the foreign-owned sector is larger than that added by the domestic sector.  Ireland is unique in that regard.  In the foreign-owned sector the wage share is 26%.  That is unusual; it is not seen anywhere else in the world.  Part of the reason is the type of sector in which these companies are involved, for example, pharmaceuticals, in which high value is added.  I imagine some of it is down to taxation, the location of profits and operating in a low tax environment.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Seamus Coffey:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The sector that creates the most value added is very low at 26%.  If one looks at Irish-owned companies, the wage share is 65%.  For domestically-owned companies, Ireland's wage share is above the EU average, which is 63%.  At an aggregate level, the wage in Ireland appears low but one should split it into the foreign-owned sector where the wage share is much lower.  The foreign-owned sector, paradoxically, is the high paying sector where more people have higher paying work.  If one takes the domestically-owned sector, the wage here is 65%, which is not the highest by any means but it is close to the EU average.  Looking at the labour share, or the wage share, we have the complication of Ireland having two separate economies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.127" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2015022400002#N00200"><p>Will Mr. Fielding talk us through how his proposals in regard to the earned income tax credit would work?  He did not have it costed and is leaving that to the Low Pay Commission to do, but does he have any idea of a costing?  A small business would not make a proposal without costing it.  Are there any companies in which it works?</p> <p>  Mr. Fielding said the price of many items and essential expenditure - he cited car insurance, education and health insurance - have increased sharply in recent years.  He then referred to the input costs for industry in terms of diesel costs, electricity costs, etc., but they are also income costs for households for whom fuel costs and electricity costs are particularly high.  Is that not an argument for an increase in the minimum wage, because the input costs for employees have increased as well?</p> <p>  Mr. Coffey did the usual academic thing and gave us all the answers but did not give us a solution.  The presentation was excellent but will he come off the fence and say whether we need an increase in our national minimum wage?  We have had all this employment creation recently but pay levels seem to be staying flat.  Mr. Coffey spoke about wage share but when we look at the CSO figures on pay, they do not correlate with the employment creation.  Are all these new jobs being created at low wages?</p> <p>  Mr. Coffey said that we were slightly above the EU average for wholesale and retail, above the EU 15 average for accommodation and food service activities and at the EU average for the administration and support service activities.  They are the areas in which the minimum wage tends to be paid most.  Does that suggest that the figures back up Mr. Fielding's argument?  It probably goes back to my first question on Mr. Coffey's own opinion as an economist.</p> <p>  In regard to employers' PRSI, do not forget that employers' PRSI has been doubled.  The cost of employers' PRSI was doubled in 2013 and I have no doubt that had an impact on many job creation plans, in particular in those sectors to which Mr. Coffey referred.</p><p>In regard to those sectors in which the wage share is close to the EU average, I would note that they are aggregates.  One would have to look in a bit more detail at the numbers to see how it is actually distributed.  I highlighted those because I think they are the sectors with which low pay would tend to be traditionally associated.</p><p> In regard to a broader solution, the solution is to get the social welfare and the work systems more integrated.  Currently, they are disparate and one works in isolation from the other.  If one is working, one is dealing with the tax system and if one is not working, one is dealing, by and large, with the social welfare system.  They should be more integrated.  If we have benefits, they should be universal.  We should treat everybody in the same way.  That might require higher rates of tax but it would not necessarily mean people will be worse off.  If there is a basic minimum standard set out and it is paid to me, then I should be taxed more.  I should not be better off.  However, that would mean that nobody would ever be worse off by working.  One should  never lose anything by contributing to society.  A system where one has generous social welfare is laudable, and that is what we should have, but it should not be designed in such a way that people lose it when they start to contribute to society. </p><p> I would encourage more universality in transfers.  We could increase child benefit and maybe introduce something similar for adults.  One would not have people fighting for their own corner and all these separate groups looking for what they want.  If we have a social democracy and treat everybody in the same way, as happens in many countries, one would not get those divisions.  </p><p> I would not view the minimum wage as the key issue about how one lifts people out of poverty.  Work matters but the State should take a much stronger approach than it takes currently and offer more on the basis of social welfare.  People say our social welfare budget is high but relative to the EU, it is not.  Other countries spend far more in terms of cash transfers.  They collect it through higher tax and higher social insurance and I believe we can achieve something like that.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Seamus Coffey:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have a divided society, a very progressive tax system and a very divided social welfare system in which one group is contributing and another is benefiting.  If we were all in this together, the system would work much better.</p></speech>

It has the capacity to do so.  I do not have figures for the Deputy.  Rather than beginning with the minimum wage and examining how we will increase it, something that has been put into the public domain, if it is to be empirically based, there may not be an increase in the minimum wage.  We could see it coming down to the level of &euro;7.42 per hour, which would equate with the consumer price index figure.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on his point that people are personally being hit with costs similar to those with which businesses are being hit.  In a small business the labour content comes in at about 48% of added value, while in a large business it comes in at about 8%.  There is a sixfold difference between the two.  When there is a rise in the minium wage, it hits small businesses six times harder than it does a large business.  Most large businesses do not talk about the minimum wage because they operate at a level where they pay way above it.  I am not going to argue the toss with the Deputy over an increase in the minimum wage, rather I am saying we should not have a minimum wage, rather we should have a minimum income policy.  As I have said and will continue to say, it is the Government's job to redistribute wealth, not mine</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.131" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1023" speakername="John Lyons" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2015022400002#O00300"><p>Both delegates but Mr. Fielding, in particular, might respond to the following comment.  The Low Pay Commission in the United Kingdom has for the 15th year recommended an increase in the minimum wage.  The other day it recommended a 20 pence increase, which the Confederation of British Industry, CBI, a body somewhat equivalent to the one represented here, broadly welcomed.  I recognise that the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, is not the same type of body, but it is a similar one and I am curious to know why a body in the United Kingdom that represents something similar would broadly welcome a recommended increase in the minimum wage, while Mr. Fielding, from what I believe I heard him say here, does not agree with the minimum wage and believes it should be up to the State to redistribute wealth.</p> <p>  I recognise that not all businesses are thriving and that many people that ISME represents are finding it difficult to make ends meet.  I do not believe any of us is talking about a business that cannot afford to pay anything more than what it is paying, but let us be realistic.  There are businesses that fall into the category represented by ISME, as well as businesses in the category that employs more than 250 employees that are reaping in profits.  I believe in the basic concept that if a business is profitable and workers help to make it profitable, there is nothing wrong with ensuring some of them share in that by receiving a dividend, perhaps in the form a better wage.  I am not talking about people on the median wage of &euro;19 per hour; I am only interested in this context in those who are on a wage of &euro;8.65 per hour.  It is my genuine belief that if the State did not have a minimum threshold, in many cases some workers in some of these categories would be paid less.  The State gets involved in redistributing wealth.  We co-share in the contribution to salaries.  Approximately &euro;300 million per year is paid to people who work full time through family income supplement.  On top of this, we recognise that some employers would like to take on additional staff but are not at the stage where they could fully pay to recruit an additional person.  That is the reason we have introduced initiatives such as the JobsPlus scheme.  Therefore, I do not believe it is only the State that is responsible for redistributing wealth.  Wealth is created in other sectors.  If a company in the category ISME represents is profitable, what is wrong with it paying its employees a little more?</p><p>I agree with the Deputy when a company can afford to pay.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Mark Fielding:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I never said that they should not.  I am talking about the minimum wage here and about the redistribution of wealth.  </p><p> If a company is in profit then of course it should pay and of course there should be wage increases.  There is nobody here saying anything to the contrary.  The Deputy asked, in the context of a British representative body welcoming a 20 pence increase in the minimum wage in the UK, why we disagree with an increase.  Since the year 2000 IBEC has sold us down the Suwannee in the context of the minimum wage and wage increases.  We did not agree to what was happening at the time but we were not then part of social partnership, we were excluded.  That is one of the reasons we lost our competitiveness - by about 40% - over those years.  Big business did not give a monkey's about what small businesses were doing.  It is the prerogative of large business organisations to agree with something but the SME sector is struggling to get back on our feet after seven hard years.  We have so many businesses that are struggling.  I agree with the Deputy's point that once businesses are profitable, they should pay employees appropriately.  We all know that is wise.  We are still in business because we look after our staff when we can make the money to do so.  I am not saying that we will hoard all of the gains, of course not.</p><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as ucht an cur i l&aacute;thair suimi&uacute;il.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-mhaith ar fad.  Everybody agrees that we have a problem with low wages in this State but how we actually resolve the problem is the issue.  We know that there is also a problem with underemployment.  We have one of the highest proportions of low-paid employees in the EU and OECD countries.  Has any research been conducted on the level of unemployment created by increases in the minimum wage?  In other words, in other jurisdictions, what is the typical correlation between a 50 cent increase in the minimum wage and unemployment levels?  My understanding is that while the minimum wage is important, there are many other tools that the Government can use to alleviate poverty.  Furthermore, while the minimum wage is important to an employer, in real terms and in the long run, it does not affect the level of employment or unemployment very much.  As a committee, we like to operate on the basis of evidence.  What evidence is available on those specific questions?</p><p> My understanding is that Ireland's income gradient is quite steep in comparison with other countries, where it is more level.  Would that be an accurate interpretation?   I take the point made earlier that to introduce GDP figures into anything in this country skews everything because there is such a large foreign element to the economy.  It seems to me that both witnesses are making the argument that the State should be involved in welfare transfers but to my mind, however, the State is subsidising people on low incomes, as well as employers, with such payments.  If the State took the &euro;300 million to which Deputy Lyons referred out of the equation, many of the people who work for very small businesses would simply not be able to work for them anymore and if employers wanted to employ them they would have to pay more them higher wages to make their efforts worthwhile.  </p><p> Reference was made to Denmark taking a bigger chunk of tax from people on low incomes.  Does that include taxes like USC, water charges, property tax and all of the other taxes that are charged in Ireland, many of which are not income dependent?   We are very conscious that most self-employed people - especially the newly-self-employed - are living hand-to-mouth and that from month to month they are not sure if they can pay themselves an income.  However, I am also conscious that some of the unemployment figures are skewed in terms of who is deemed to be self-employed.  A person could be deemed to be self-employed who only works for one hour per week in a self-employed capacity.  Would Mr. Coffey have any issues with regard to the precise nature of the self-employed figures?<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2304"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2304&amp;amp;pid=PeadarToibin&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On ensuring businesses remain competitive, is it not necessary for society to focus on all of the other cost bases affecting them, rather than wages?  Wages should be the last place one looks at to guarantee cost competitiveness.  For example, physical infrastructure represents a big cost, as do upward-only rents, utility bills, insurance bills and legal bills.  All of these costs within the grasp of the State which, if tackled, would improve the cost competitiveness of business.  Rather than seek to target those on low pay, we should look at all of these other places first.</p></speech>

While there is an overall rate of 20% of PRSI, if one looks at the detail, we do not have 20% of people in a worse position than in other countries.  </p> <p>  In reply to Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's question on the minimum wage and employment, I say, "What a question for an introductory course in economics?"  It is a question addressed to all first year students and seems to have a standard answer in theory which is that while a minimum wage harms some people, that is, those who cannot find employment, it benefits those in employment whose pay it brings up.  One has winners and losers.  While that is the theory, we have no evidence that suggests one answer over the other is right.  Various studies show a very large employment effect of a minimum wage that will reduce the numbers, while others show very little employment effect.  If one looks at the evidence, it goes both ways.  One issue is how to obtain the data to check.  Studies have been conducted in various counties and the USA that border different states where minimum wage rates are higher and some find a substantial employment effect, in particular in low-pay sectors, including service sectors, food and retail.  However, other studies including different variables do not find any employment effect.  I cannot give a definitive answer as it depends on which study one wishes to choose.  One will hear people say there is a very strong employment effect, but I could equally find a study that indicates there is none.  It is very difficult to say what impact an increase in the minimum wage would have on employment.  In theory, economics suggests it has an effect, but we do not know in practice.</p> <p>  When it comes to the self-employed and the part-time employed, an important indicator the CSO collects is the number of people who are workng part-time and underemployed - those who are essentially forced into part-time work and would wish to work more.  Up to 2012, that figure had increased and was increasing substantially as people were on reduced hours and days.  Thankfully, we have seen that rate fall for the last two years since the start of 2012.  The number is down by approximately 35,000.  Whereas at the start of 2012, 195,000 people counted themselves as working part-time and underemployed, the figure is now down to approximately 160,000.  While it is moving in the right direction, we still have 160,000 people who would like to take on more work.</p> <p>  On the income gradient in Ireland, the distribution of income is unusual in comparison to that in other countries.  Our disposable income is in line with that in other countries, but our earned income is not.  If one takes the overall economy across everybody, Ireland has the most unequal distribution of earned income, but that is driven by the fact that we have so many who are earning nothing and not in the workforce.  Equally, even within the workforce, if one takes workers only, the distribution of income in Ireland is unusually high.  EUROSTAT has figures comparing the bottom decile with the top decile.  In Ireland the median gap is approximately four, whereas the standard across the European Union is approximately three.  If one takes a figure of &euro;20,000 at the bottom, one is looking at a figure of &euro;80,000 at the top.  In other countries, the gap is not as wide.  Our tax system may have a role to play in that regard.  While they have lower incomes in Ireland, we tax less at the bottom and the gap in net terms is reduced.  That is what the system does.  There is no doubt, however, that the income gradient for earned income in Ireland is unusual.</p> <p>  In relation to the subsidy, one could argue that the figure of &euro;300 million is a subsidy to employers.  However, one could also argue that we have a &euro;4 billion subsidy to deal with unemployment.  I have no problem with the Government spending money.  If people do not have the ability to earn or are not earning, it should provide it.  The issue in Ireland is that there are so many schemes to get money to households that it becomes overly complex and people view the money as going to different areas.  A broader, more universal approach would clean up many of the problems we have.</p><p>Deputy Peader T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said that if the Government pulled back and did not pay what might be called subsidies to employers, employers would have to pay more.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Mark Fielding:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not a game that once the subsidies are taken away the employers would pay more.  If the employers cannot pay more they go out of business, as we have seen in the past number of years.</p><p> In response to the question on the minimum wage rising and the unemployment level going up or down, it is all about perception.  Deputy Calleary mentioned the increase in PRSI last year from 4.25% to 8.5%.  That put a stop to new employment.  The word on the street is that the minimum wage could increase by a euro, and that is putting a stop to people taking on staff.  It is about the perception.  As Mr. Coffey states, one can prove different things from the different statistics.  At present, employers are worried and are saying that they do not know if they will take on an additional two or three people.  The members of ISME are not talking about taking on hundreds but twos and threes in small shops and factories around the country.  People are saying they will hold off to see what will happen.  That is the present difficulty.</p></speech>

There is a two-tier economy, comprising of small and medium businesses on the one hand and capital intensive industries on the other hand.  The young people working in Google, Facebook and Paypal are doing very well.  The capital intensive industries do not create employment.  Their <i>modus operandi </i>is to be as capital intensive as possible.  The multinational companies pay the highest wages and this puts pressure on small and medium Irish companies.  I do not have a problem with the minimum wage but with the knock-on effect an increase in the minimum wage will have on others, who will feel that if a new person is getting this much money they should get more, and more in the following years.  People seem to be oblivious to the tension this creates among employees.  I fully agree with the concept of the minimum wage in spirit but in many cases the reality is that it impedes companies taking on staff.  One has to face up to that Senator Cullinane.</p></speech>

There is a perception that people in business are making a fortune, they are making money by doing something irregular, or breaking the law.  There needs to be an honest debate on business.</p><p> There are 250,000 people who are unemployed, with 1,600 emigrating every week.  What is important is how we deal with that issue and how we get people back into employment.  As I have said on numerous occasions, a job gives people much more than money, it gives them a place to go every day, where they will mix and socialise.  It transforms their lives.  Nearly half of the 250,000 people who are unemployed have been unemployed in the long term.  That is a terrifying situation.  It is a bigger issue than how it is being addressed, where there is perception that those who have been unemployed in the longer term are playing the system.

What is the case beyond Europe?  I note in the United States of America, 15 states have brought in a living wage.  Does a perspective from the US throw any light on how we go about this issue?  Can we learn from other countries and other economies outside of Europe?</p></speech>

It is established what is a living wage which is then put into legislation.  It has a slightly different standing to a minimum wage.  There is no legislative authority for companies to pay it.  Although many companies sign up voluntarily, I would imagine most of them are where the pay rates already exceed the living wage.  In the state of Washington, particularly in the city of Seattle, we will get an experiment as to whether the living wage actually becomes the statutory minimum.  It will set up a small area within the state where it will require all companies to pay.  Again, this will give us the data to see if it does have an employment effect.  However, as it has only happened in the past eight months, it will take some time to feed through to see the impact.</p> <p>  In the US, the living wage has much traction but does not quite have the traction to become the minimum wage.  It has become a voluntary code up to which employers can sign.  One issue with the living wage is that individual circumstances differ.  Comparing a living wage for a student who just wants ten to 15 hours of part-time work to someone trying to run a household is not entirely appropriate.</p> <p>  We use the EU as a benchmark because our economies are similar.  There are not substantial differences in our tax and transfer systems.  Over the next 12 to 18 months, we will see the living wage still have an impact.  I do not believe the voluntary code will have much of an impact but if we follow what is happening in Seattle we may learn something.</p><p>It has been a pleasure to listen to the delegations.  I have travelled around the country a lot over the past couple of years, visiting shops and other small traders.  I have mainly met members of ISME, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association.  They are in a very competitive market.  Of the shops that I visited, several have gone out of business.  Other shops are concerned whether they will stay alive while others have succeeded very well.  In general terms, those who succeeded very well are not now paying the minimum wage.  They did start by taking somebody on the minimum wage.  However, if they were going to hold onto that successful employee, they had to pay them more, otherwise they would lose them to somebody else.  This belief in a competitive market is successful.  It works very well and means people are automatically lifted up if their business succeeds.  If the business does not succeed, they go out of business.</p><p> Many people cannot figure out how Members in Leinster House can say we should do this when they have never created a job or never actually borrowed money to start a business.  They get frustrated and feel we should be discussing upward-only rent clauses, for example.  We need to help businesses, survive, thrive and succeed.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator Feargal Quinn"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator Feargal Quinn"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This would help to ensure that those who are brave enough to borrow the money to start a business and employ somebody, even at a low rate, will know they will have to pay staff more if they are to keep them.

Those who decide to set up their own businesses are the real risk-takers in society.  We do not have a safety net for them, which makes it difficult.  We must look at an overall package.  As Mr. Fielding has said clearly, it is not just about wages.  The well-being and happiness of a society is also about the number of people working.</p> <p>  In the UK there is a tiered minimum wage system.  Currently the rate in the UK is &pound;6.50 and it drops down based on one's age.  What would be the view of the witnesses on introducing that system here?  It is appropriate across the UK, in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</p></speech>

It is clear that the incidence of low pay is much higher for younger people and it declines as people get older.  The rates in Ireland are relatively high across the age profile, but they do decline.  For those under 30, the incidence of low pay is around 40%, yet it is down to 20% for those between 30 and 39.  Perhaps those are relatively high rates, but it does decline.</p> <p>  I would not quite say that we do not have a safety net for the self-employed.  They are not entitled to unemployment benefit, but one cannot get insurance against a risk one can trigger oneself, so we are not particularly unusual in that regard.  There is a certain safety net in that everybody is entitled to unemployment assistance.  It is means-tested, so that if somebody has the means, they will not get the money, but the safety net is there.  The issue is that if there is a basic benchmark for everybody, we can reduce some of these anomalies.</p> <p>  The issue of low pay in the self-employed sector deserves more scrutiny.  The focus here is on pay for employees but there are significant difficulties in the self-employed sector, whether it is, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n referred to, people classifying themselves as self-employed despite not working very much at all, or the difference in the tax treatment of employees and the self-employed, in that an employee gets the employee tax credit, but there is no self-employed tax credit.  The reason for that might be high-earning self-employed people, who can use expenses to reduce their overall tax liability.  A self-employed person earning very little has no tax liability to offset against.  This is something worth considering at the bottom of the pay distribution for the self-employed.  The broad point I am making is that we should have a more universal safety net, rather than one that targets individual groups.</p><p>Senator Quinn is correct.  One pays the minimum wage when starting out.  One sees how employees are getting on and then if one wants to retain staff, the minimum wage is just a starting point.  I also agree that we should be looking at other costs, rather than just wages.  It is a definite issue.  Of course upward-only rent reviews come to mind.  To be fair to small and medium business owners, when things got rough in other countries, when businesses were pulling back on costs, staff were let go first.  In Ireland, we held on to our staff.  We reduced their hours but we held on to our staff and we did not reduce their rates.  Now we are running into difficulty because as we come out of the recession, we still have the rate of pay set in 2006-07 as we bring people back into the workplace full-time, working 37.5 or 40 hours a week.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Mark Fielding:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not all doom and gloom in terms of bad employers and so on.  </p><p> On the tiered minimum wage system, we already have a system where, when younger people come into the workplace, they are paid a percentage.</p></speech>

I welcome Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins of the Nevin Economic Research Institute, Mr. Fergal O'Brien, head of policy and chief economist with IBEC, and Ms Maeve McElwee, head of IR/HR with IBEC.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>i</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I am an economist and the senior research officer at the Nevin Economic Research Institute.  I am also a member of the Living Wage Technical Group, formed last year to establish a robust, transparent and sustainable methodology for calculating a living wage for the Republic of Ireland &ndash; a point I will return to later.</p><p> I also welcome the attention the committee is giving to the topic of low pay and the living wage.  In the context of its examination and our discussion this afternoon, I think the following pieces of data are informative.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In 2012, EUROSTAT published its analysis of the 2010 EU-wide labour force survey.  It classified 20.7% of workers, or one in five, in Ireland as low paid, meaning that they earned below a low pay threshold of &euro;12.20 per hour, a figure equivalent to two thirds of national median hourly earnings.  EUROSTAT also found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that low pay was more common among women, those with low education levels and workers on fixed duration contracts.<br/><br/>The latest CSO poverty figures for 2013, which were published in January of this year, indicate that, of all those in poverty, 11.7% are working.  They are in the group known as the working poor, representing approximately 85,000 workers.  The latest quarterly national household survey data show that there are almost 125,000 workers underemployed, that is, working part time but not for as many hours as they would wish.  This phenomenon is bound to have a negative impact on their incomes.<br/><br/>The distribution of direct income in Ireland, namely, earnings from all sources, is heavily skewed.  The latest data, which is also for 2013 and published by the CSO in January of this year, show that the pre-distribution of income is such that the top two deciles - the top two 10% groups - receive more than 50% of all direct income and the top three deciles receive more than 67%.  The top 20% receive 25 times the share of the bottom 20%.  The scale of this inequality continues to place large pressures on the redistributive system, particularly the social welfare system, to even out the income distribution.  It does this well, but at an ever increasing cost to the State.  The latest Department of Social Protection annual report shows that, in 2013, the number of working families in receipt of family income supplement, FIS, increased by almost 30% to 42,000 low-income families, supporting more than 90,000 children.<br/><br/>In the context of figures such as these for Ireland and other countries, attention has turned in recent years to the adequacy of earnings, in particular the adequacy of low pay rates.  The attention given to this issue underscores a growing appreciation for society to consider low wage rates, not just in the context of competitiveness and competition, but also in the context of income adequacy and living standards.  In effect, it reflects a belief that, across societies, individuals working full time should be able to earn enough income to enjoy a decent standard of living.<br/><br/>The living wage technical group was set up a year ago with an objective of establishing a transparent, robust and sustainable way of determining a living wage.  The group's members included the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, Social Justice Ireland, TASC, Unite the Union and SIPTU.  Over a period of four to five months, the group met and developed a methodology, based on the available data for Ireland and the precedents and lessons in the international research literature, and published it alongside a 2014 value for a living wage last July.  The documents are available on the living wage website, <i>www.livingwage.ie</i>.  I have appended a document to my presentation that provides more details.<br/><br/>The living wage figure established for 2014 was &euro;11.45 per hour.  This figure is the average gross salary that will enable full-time employed adults, without dependants, across Ireland to afford a socially acceptable standard of living.  That standard of living covers spending across 17 categories of expenditure and up to 2,000 goods and services and takes into account the structure of the taxation and social protection systems.  The calculations, which draw on the minimum essential standards of living analysis of the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, were completed for the country as a whole, with expenditure figures calculated for Dublin, other cities, towns with populations of more than 5,000 people and the rest of Ireland, including small towns and rural Ireland.  The results from this analysis were brought together to establish the national figure.  The group plans to update the living wage figure on an annual basis, with the next update to be during this summer.<br/><br/>In a research paper published at NERI last year, I detailed some of the impacts and challenges that the establishment and introduction of a living wage would have.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The committee may be interested in examining that paper because it provides a lot of detail.</p><p> The impact on the individuals and employees in terms of income gains and consequent improvements in living standards for them and their families should not be underestimated.  For example, a &euro;1 per hour increase in the pay of a full-time low waged worker is equivalent to a gross income gain of &euro;2,033 per year, which is a multiple of any possible budgetary change to social protection or taxation levels.  While there are also impacts on employers, whose wage bills will increase, the research literature shows the impacts have limited consequence in sectors such as finance, banking and construction where there few earners below the living wage threshold and thus any increase in costs is small.  In sectors with a greater proportion of low paid employees, such as retail, food production, bars and restaurants, the wage bill impact is likely to be more pronounced and it would be sensible to phase in any move to a living wage in these sectors.  The research literature also indicates impacts for employers in terms of cost savings and gains from increases in staff retention, reduced absenteeism and improvements in productivity and efficiency.  While these may not fully offset the increased wage costs in the high labour sectors, the literature indicates that they would make a significant contribution towards reducing these costs.  There are also impacts on the State, which gains through increased taxation, particularly indirect taxation, reductions in social protection expenditure and increases in both employers' and employees' social insurance contributions.</p><p> The implementation of a living wage is likely to be a gradual and voluntary process.  In sectors such as finance, where only small numbers of employees are below the threshold, achieving increases should be possible and the international research shows little or no impact on companies.  There is no reason why, for example, the IFSC could not become a living wage zone.  There are greater challenges in labour intensive low-pay sectors, such as retail and accommodation, and a phased approach to achieving a living wage is more feasible for these sectors.  Similarly, local authorities, like in other countries, should take a leadership role and ensure their employees and contracted workers are all paid at least the living wage.  The experience elsewhere shows that the idea of a living wage evolves from being considered impossible to being viewed as of benefit to society, although that transition and its acceptance by employers, workers and society in general can take time.</p><p>I am grateful for the invitation to address the committee on the issue of low pay and the concept of the living wage.  I will outline IBEC's position on the national minimum wage in the first instance and will then ask my colleague, Mr. Fergal O'Brien, to address the economic background to these matters.  The important element of the issue of the national minimum wage is that it needs to reflect the economic circumstances that obtain at any time.  IBEC supports the principle of a national minimum wage but believes it is vital that the wage be appropriate, competitive and affordable, taking into account at all times the cost of living in the economy.  An inappropriately large national minimum wage or any excessive increases to it can potentially damage employment growth prospects, business investment and, ultimately for many small firms, ongoing viability.</p><p> The data on the national minimum wage are incomplete but CSO statistics suggest that the number of those currently engaged in the national minium wage is not significantly different from the pre-crisis level.  The estimated figure for 2007 was 4.9%, compared to the current estimate of 4.7%.  This suggests we are not seeing a significant change in the demographic profile of people employed on the minimum wage.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Ms Maeve McElwee:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Low Pay Commission's review of the national minimum wage must be evidence based.  It should take into account a number of factors including labour market conditions, international comparisons and competitiveness, sectoral and regional affordability and cost of living trends.</p><p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  I will elaborate on the economic criteria that should be considered when making a decision on future changes to the national minimum wage.  The first criteria is labour market conditions.  While the labour market is in a much better place than during the depths of the crisis, and nearly 100,000 jobs have returned to the Irish economy over the past two years, we still have a very long way to go.  While the unemployment rate might dip below 9% this year and we are making good progress, many low-skilled and young jobseekers are still having difficulty returning to the workplace.  They are the jobseekers who would be most affected by any inappropriate change to the national minimum wage.  Labour market conditions are still very fragile and this must be factored into any decision.<br/><br/>Ireland has a high minimum wage by international standards and compared with the countries with which we compete, despite the fact that we have not had an increase during the crisis years.  Our statutory minimum wage is the 5th highest in the EU, and 4th highest when Luxembourg is excluded.  The UK comparison is crucially important.  When the economic crisis hit us, food processing, tourism and manufacturing was very heavily impacted by competition from the UK and Ireland's lack of competitiveness <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the UK.  At today's exchange rate, the UK minimum wage rate is probably a little higher than ours, whereas at last year's exchange rates, Ireland's minimum wage was 10% higher.  While the Low Pay Commission has acknowledged the importance of exchange rates, it is very important that whatever decision we make about the national minimum wage leaves room for inevitable future exchange rate volatility and that we do not leave ourselves exposed on the competitiveness front, particularly from the UK, by failing to leave room for these inevitable exchange rate fluctuations.<br/><br/>Even when we use cost of living benchmarks such as purchasing power parity, PPP, our minimum wage is still high, the 6th highest in the EU.  Another important benchmark is to examine it against median earnings in the economy.  By this measure, our minimum wage is almost half the median wage, while in the US it is approximately one third.  We have a relatively high minimum wage.<br/><br/>It is important that sectoral and regional affordability are taken into account in any decision.  In terms of regional issues, it will have to be a one-size-fits-all rate and cannot be benchmarked against the cost of living in Dublin.  Previously, our members in the regions, particularly those with weaker economic performance such as the north west, have definitely suffered the most from a business perspective as a result of the increase in the minimum wage.  A competitive cost base is very different in Dublin from the regions.  A useful indicator is the minimum wage as a percentage of median earnings in the regions.  While our data is incomplete, the evidence we have examined suggests that while the national average is below 50% in the north west, the minimum wage is as high as 60% of median earnings.  A minimum wage increase will hurt business and employment in Donegal much more than in Dublin, and this must be taken into account.<br/><br/>Just three sectors of the economy - hospitality, retail and wholesale and other services - account for more than half of all minimum wage workers.  We must be realistic about the fact that while the economy is recovering the level of output and turnover in many businesses is well below the crisis peak.  In retail for example, turnover is still 15% below the pre-crisis peak.  Many businesses in the sector are still impacted by legacy costs, and, for many of them, labour is still a legacy cost because the majority of businesses did not cut pay rates during the recession.<br/><br/>The final criterion I would like to comment on is cost of living.  It is appropriate that the minimum wage be increased in line with cost of living so its real value is maintained over time.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Fergal O'Brien:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In Ireland we have done this very effectively since the introduction of the minimum wage.  The minimum wage buys one 20% more than it did when it was introduced in 2000.  I believe much of the reason there is concern about low pay and a strong debate on a living wage - a disconnected topic that is somewhat relevant to this discussion - is that in other countries the statutory minimum wage has not kept pace with the cost of living.  In the United Kingdom, for example, its real value is less than this benchmark, while in the United States, it is considerably less, at approximately 30% lower.  In the United States the minimum wage now buys one 30% less of a shopping basket than it did in 2000.  This is crucially important as in Ireland it buys one 20% more and the fundamentals are very different.  When one considers the rate of inflation across the economy, business is not able to pass on higher prices.  If there is an increase in wage costs, the vast majority of businesses will not be able to recover it in the form of higher prices.  There is no inflation in the economy and our cost of living is still below where it was in 2008.  As the price of some items has risen, the price of many others has fallen and the overall shopping basket cost is below where it was in 2008.  There is no cost of living justification for wage increases across the economy or, specifically, a minimum wage increase.</p><p>I thank Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins, Mr. Fergal O'Brien and Ms Maeve McElwee for their presentations which will be helpful in drafting the document that will consider low pay, in-work poverty and a living wage.  There is a mountain of data showing there is a problem with low pay and deprivation and poverty among people who are working; not people who are unemployed.  Dr. Collins provided the joint committee with some of the figures, as did Mr. Seamus Coffey earlier.  I note that 20% of the workforce are on low pay and that 400,000 suffer from poverty and deprivation.  Moreover, 11.7% of people who are working are in poverty, while 8.7% of those who are working are in consistent poverty.  These obviously are real figures; there are people behind them and they are of real concern to members as, I hope, everyone present wishes to see a fair and decent economy with decent wages and so on.  That should be one's starting point.  I argue that the current model is not working because we have such high levels of in-work poverty and low pay.  Therefore, one must investigate what the problems are, acknowledge that there are problems and then consider what the solutions are.  Dr. Collins has made reasonable, realistic and deliverable proposals on a living wage.  The joint committee must consider them and I agree with Dr. Collins's analysis that a living wage is not something that will happen overnight.  It will be gradual and happen over time.</p><p> As for the contributions made by Mr. O'Brien and Ms McElwee, can they back up some of their assertions with data?  The IBEC briefing notes state the living wage "comes with a fiscal cost as it will hurt employment".  On what data, research and evidence is this assertion based?  The joint committee has also heard from the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, that an increase in the minimum wage or an increase in wages would hurt our competitiveness.  However, countries such as Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium and Austria have much higher personal taxes, higher corporate taxes, higher wages, higher employers' PRSI and better labour protections.  They all have much better workers' rights and much better wage levels and are much more competitive.  This came from the global competitiveness report, a survey of business, which showed that if one builded a model and a more sustainable economy on decent work, decent pay and decent workers' rights, it would be more sustainable for everybody.  </p><p> The delegateses from IBEC made an interesting point which was also made by Dr. Collins and with which I agree, namely, that wage levels and increases are one way to lift people out of poverty.  Obviously, the concept of a living wage is aimed at doing some of this, but I refer to Government policy on public services.  The delegates quite rightly mentioned housing supply and child care costs as two critical issues, to which I would add health care.  From where would the increased revenue come to pay for the investment in these services?  While I am open to correction, I do not believe IBEC is calling for increased taxes across the economy.  From where will the increased revenue come to pay for these services?  If one does not argue for wage increases, especially for those who need them and if one states more money will be necessary to solve the housing supply problem and resolve child care issues, one must then ask from where will the money come.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> We say more money is necessary to pay for the housing problem, for housing supply and child care.  We must argue about where the money will come from.  Does Mr. O'Brien have a position on rent controls, which is one proposition put forward?  I am interested to hear the IBEC position on this.  What data will IBEC use to back up the assertion that it would be bad for the economy?  I argue that more competitive countries and those with more sustainable economies pay better wages, have better working conditions and have higher taxes on corporations and wealth.</p><p>On the overall measurement of competitiveness of the economy and how Ireland compares with other high income and high cost economies, when doing international comparisons it is crucial to compare Ireland to countries we are competing with on a day-to-day basis.  Our most significant competitor for a range of business activity is the UK.  We must be pragmatic when we look at comparisons, whether with respect to inward investment, small businesses trying to sell into the UK market as the first port of call for exports, or imports coming into the country, the majority of which will be coming from the UK.  Prior to the crisis, the cost of doing business in Ireland got out of kilter, particularly with the UK and a number of other countries.  We need to keep the UK strongly in focus in terms of competitiveness arguments.  Comparing ourselves to Nordic countries, which have completely different social models, is not a relevant comparison in terms of its impact on business.</p><p> The impact of competitiveness on jobs was somewhat lost in the run-up to the crisis years because so much happened at one time.  We had banking and construction crises, an exchange range crisis that added to the competitiveness crisis and, in the run-up to 2007, we were adding jobs in construction but losing jobs in manufacturing.  One of the reasons we lost all of the manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2007 was because our cost base was out of line against the UK.  We cannot forget that.</p><p> In terms of the comments we have not made, when the crisis hit and the decision was made to reduce the minimum wage in 2008, IBEC did not support the reduction.  We felt the minimum wage was an important component of the cost of doing business and competitiveness but we did not support its reduction.  We need a competitive minimum wage.</p><p> In terms of the concept of a living wage, public expenditure, housing and education in particular, from the business perspective we want to see high-quality jobs in the economy.  We want to see more ambitious investment in education and skills development to help people to upskill and gain higher quality employment after entering the workforce.  The argument about the living wage is that it is crucial business is not asked to compensate for the high costs emerging in our economy, including housing, rent and health care.  That will lead to a spiral of loss of competitiveness and jobs and it will damage economic recovery.</p><p> It is the Government's responsibility to make sure it has the proper policy to deliver affordable housing and the supply of housing the economy needs.  In terms of how that will be funded, the Senator is correct that we do not favour higher tax rates but we do favour more tax revenue.  We can have more tax revenue by supporting activity through a competitive cost base but not by having higher tax rates.  This is one of the things we saw in the 1990s and early 2000s.  We like to put a lot of it down to a property bubble but there was a solid economy that grew strongly on the back of competitive tax rates.  We can do so again in terms of growing a revenue base without higher tax rates.  Crucially, the Government must lead policy in terms of investment in housing.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Fergal O'Brien:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The private sector will support it and there are lots of options for it to support investment in housing.  There is a lot of money available in the markets.  Workers are looking for jobs and those with money are looking for investment vehicles, but Government policy must lead, as we cannot expect business to bear the cost of policy failures in the housing sector that will cost further jobs in the economy.</p></speech>

There is an issue surrounding the sustainability of the State&rsquo;s involvement in dealing with the scale of income inequality or low wages.  We can see this in the significant growth in family income supplement over time.  There is a great deal of merit in having family income supplement as a transitory payment for workers who need assistance, but as it moves to becoming a permanent feature of the labour market, it is a concern.  The numbers have been going up over time.</p> <p>  The overall effort the social protection system is making is very significant.  There were several reports last week of Ireland being at European levels of income fairness or inequality.  This is principally delivered by the State in redistributing.  There is, however, a great fear that it will be difficult for it to sustain this task in the future.  That brings us back to the fact that while we need a good social protection system and good public services, we need a more adequate base of direct income and earnings.</p> <p>  There is merit in joining the dots between the provision of public services and pay requirements.  If there is poor provision for public services, more people will have to spend money and, therefore, have to earn more.  Figures for items such as the living wage would be higher.  The living wage figure I mentioned could fall if there were better public services because people would not need as much money to maintain a particular standard of living.</p> <p>  When the living wage technical group was working through the data last year, as well as reporting a living wage figure, we stated we would show a family living cost because individuals and couples with children faced such significantly higher costs.  There were dramatic costs, fundamentally linked with differences in child care costs and the different costs incurred by children.  Child care costs were significant.  We felt it was completely unfair to ask employers to carry the cost because of the fact that there were deficiencies in the public sector and public service provision.  We should, therefore, be thinking about these, too.</p><p>Dr. Collins&rsquo;s points about the sustainability of the State subsidising low pay and about in work poverty came up in our last discussion.  I would also like to hear Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s and Ms McElwee&rsquo;s opinions on this matter.  Most employers attempt to pay decent wages, but there are some big multiples in the retail sector which do not.  They are profitable companies that do not pay decent wages.  The State, through family income supplement and other measures, is subsidising these companies, which hurts everybody.  What is IBEC&rsquo;s position on that issue?</p><p> We need to increase tax revenue because we have the third lowest tax take in Europe.  As long as that is the case, there will be underlying inequality in society because we do not have the revenue to invest in the public services we need.  How do we raise that tax revenue?  We have to be specific in how we do it.  We cannot just say it will come from economic growth.  This is a global issue which came up for the first time at Davos at the World Economic Forum which discussed the growing gap between restrained wages and the income of the majority, on the one hand, and the massively expanding wealth at the top, on the other.  It is a big global problem.  What proposals would the delegates put forward to deal with these inequalities?<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->How do we get to the root of the problems affecting many workers?

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.168" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal O'Brien" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2015022400002#BB00200"><p>On the tax issue, what we are about in the economy is broadening the tax base.  It makes economic sense to do this and that we are shifting our reliance away from work because the taxes on work in the economy are very high, in particular the taxes on highly skilled work.  We hear this all of the time from employers when they look at the cost of a highly skilled job in Ireland versus that in other jurisdictions.  We have a high marginal tax rate and a high effective tax rate for highly skilled employees, which is a big challenge.  In growing the economy, we need to broaden the tax base and get more people back to work.  That would give us the tax revenue we need for improved public services.  </p> <p>  On the inequality issue, Dr. Collins has said Ireland has a redistributive tax and social welfare system.  We actually have the single most redistributive tax and social welfare system in the world, bar none.  We raise a lot of tax revenue which we redistribute in terms of a strong social protection system.  We do this more effectively than any other country.</p> <p>  When one looks at pre-tax and pre-social welfare levels, the question is why we have this inequality which is an outlier at a pre-tax and a pre-social welfare level.  The single main reason we can see is that there are so many homes in which no one is working.  That is the real issue in terms of inequality in society.  We have the highest rate in Europe for jobless households and had the second highest rate before the crisis hit, even when there was a full employment rate.  We have not really grasped that policy challenge.</p> <p>  Investment in education, skills and appropriate reform of the tax and social welfare system which would help to get people back into work is the priority because the number of homes in which no one is working is the real cause of inequality in society.</p> <p>  Ms McElwee will respond to the question on pay.</p><p>On the concept of the living wage and how it would be applied in areas in which we typically look at the issue of low pay, there are many definitions.  It is not a new concept, but it is very much a current topic for discussion.  Internationally, there has been no ability to define exactly what a living wage should be.  Looking at the work to which Dr. Collins referred, the technical group is still looking at 28 versions of a living wage, depending on the construct of the family and the location in which somebody is living.</p><p> There is the idea that the living wage could fall once it had been implemented, but that is not really a practical assessment because, in reality, no employer would be in a position to reduce a wage once the concept had been implemented.  The idea of the living wage does not address the reality in the labour market.  The family wage which has been constructed on there being mostly a sole male breadwinner does not recognise the position of women in the labour market and the flexibilities required by different cohorts in the labour market, nor does it deal adequately with dependants within the family.  When we look at how we would implement something along the lines of the living wage and making it reasonable and decent, it is entirely impractical for employers to be able to manage this.  They pay wages which are competitive and sustainable for their businesses.  As we have seen, over the course of 2014 and into this year, more employers are predicting pay increases where they are affordable.  This leads to greater productivity and competitiveness because employers and employees together drive competitiveness to achieve these wage increases.  When we look at some of the sectors that are typically seen to be low pay, we look at the retail sector and talk about some big retailers which do not pay well and do not pay decent wages.  However, if one looks at the data, most of the big retailers do not have anybody working at the national minimum wage rate.  </p><p> When we talk about those on low pay having difficulties in achieving greater pay rate, we are back to the areas about which Mr. O'Brien spoke.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Ms Maeve McElwee:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are looking at Donegal in terms of small employers challenged with work crossing the Border, for example, retailers and hoteliers who constantly have a price pressure between where they are operating in a very small environment and the competitive rate they face just across the Border.  </p><p> The issue of introducing a living wage is a voluntary concept.  It still has its own problems and would bring into play its own workplace relations issues, but it does not resolve the issue of low pay because, in effect, employers who can afford to pay it will do so without it necessarily needing to be guided one way or the other.  Those who cannot afford to do so will still have to fall back to what is a commercially sustainable rate of pay for the business they are in.</p></speech>

It is clear that what we are collecting currently is not sustainable, and we are still borrowing.  As growth  continues there will be some recovery in that.  We can expect that but if we look at the projections the Government has set out in its budgetary documents some months ago into the years to come, they are questionable in terms of the costs the economy is likely to face and the feasibility of what are declining overall levels of taxation revenues proportional to national income.  That does not make sense regardless of the way one looks at it.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien mentioned that we have the most redistributive tax and social welfare systems in the world.  I am not sure if we do.  I suspect we are very close to it if we do not, but the reason for that is because the starting position is so bad.  It is because we have such an inequity in terms of starting distributions of earnings and because the State has to step in through the tax system and, most principally, through a social protection system to even it out.  That is why I said earlier that the State does a very good job at doing that, but we forget the fact that it is the starting position that is so problematic.  One of the solutions to adequate levels of income, therefore, is that we end up looking at adequate levels of pay to be the base for that.</p> <p>  I will make some brief points on the living wage, picking up on some of the other comments.  I wish to clarify that it is one figure that is being set out, not 20 or anything like that, and it is for the country as a whole.  There is a very clear technical document laying out the calculation of it for the Republic of Ireland.  It does work in other countries.  It is fairly well established in London, for example, and outside London in the United Kingdom, as there are successful living wage schemes in other parts of the world, including in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and so on.  Employers make that work, and they make a link to the fact that this is about saying that if an individual is working full-time, they should be earning sufficient to be able to afford a decent standard of living.  That is what the living wage is intended to do.  That is not to say it is the answer to all our problems or that all our problems will disappear, but the significant contribution it makes is that it provides an annually updated benchmark, which will tell us the level of income employees need to be earning for them to be able to afford a decent standard of living.  When they are below that, they are clearly cutting back and when they are above that, they have some discretion in terms of their spending.</p><p>I thank the two presenters.  I will make two points.  First, I am slightly concerned that Dr. Collins's method of calculating a living wage seems to exclude the role of the State in terms of either taxation or transfer in that it appears to place it all on the shoulders of the employer.  In the context of what  Mr. Seamus Coffey had to say to us before the representatives came in - I do not know if they were here for it - the EUROSTAT figures show that the wage share in Ireland is only slightly below the EU average for the wholesale and retail trades, for accommodation and food service activities and for administrative support service activities, which are areas, I assume, in which one would be assisted by a living wage, so we are not necessarily way off the EU average in terms of it.</p><p> Second, Dr. Collins also raised the idea that local authorities should pay the living wage as a type of experiment, but that gets paid for by the same people he wants to pay for the minimum wage, namely, ratepayers, who are already getting nothing for paying their rates.  That will increase their cost base.</p><p> There seems to be an inherent contradiction in Mr. Fergal O'Brien's presentation.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Dara Calleary:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2201"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Dara Calleary"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2201&amp;amp;pid=DaraCalleary&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Dara Calleary"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->According to a press statement on the IBEC website, the majority of companies intend to introduce pay increases in 2015.  It also refers to a spectacular economic recovery in 2014 and indicates that 49% of companies awarded pay increases to staff in 2014, with this figure set to increase to 51% this year.  Mr. Mark Fielding of ISME disputed these figures.  How many workers in IBEC member companies are on the minimum wage?</p><p> Given that the figures presented by Mr. Seamus Coffey show that the wage share is lowest in industries that are dominated by foreign owned companies, in particular US multinational firms, in other words, IBEC members, is it not slightly contradictory, if not hypocritical, for IBEC to oppose an increase in the minimum wage when its own members are awarding pay increases to those on substantially higher incomes and are doing so from a lower base?  </p><p> A single person on the minimum wage with no children or debt receives &euro;16,960 per annum.  IBEC speaks regularly about input costs in the economy, for example, energy and waste costs, being poor.  The same applies to individuals.  While purchasing power here is in line with the European average or perhaps a little higher according to EUROSTAT, one is left with very little from &euro;16,960 when one subtracts from it rent, travel and food costs.  Given that IBEC members paid staff on higher incomes an increase in the past couple of years, is it not wrong that the organisation advocates that those on the lowest incomes who serve its members on higher incomes should not receive any increase in pay?</p><p> Mr. Fielding made the colourful remark that IBEC had sold out small business by supporting the minimum wage.  I ask the IBEC representatives to respond to his comment. </p></speech>

As such, I am unable to answer the Deputy's question.</p> <p>  IBEC has a significant number of very small companies among its members.  In terms of the survey we circulated of increases in pay, the majority of employers who responded indicated that they intended to increase pay.  This covers all sectors of IBEC's membership.  However, when one breaks down these figures, one finds that more than half of companies with fewer than 50 employees have indicated that they are not in a position to increase pay this year.  There is, therefore, significant diversity in the ability of companies to pay.  This diversity is based on sectoral and regional factors.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked why IBEC had rejected calls for an increase in the national minimum wage.  The reason is that we do not believe there is any cost of living requirement for an increase in the national minimum wage by IBEC members in particular sectors.  I refer specifically to the retail, hospitality and low cost manufacturing sectors which need to manage competitiveness to keep in line with their competitors in the United Kingdom.  We are still in a very early phase of recovery and many of these sectors are not recovering at the same rate as some of the larger companies where pay increases are being awarded.  We must bear this in mind and allow these sectors to build a sustainable recovery.  We also want to encourage smaller businesses, irrespective of whether they are members of IBEC, to increase employment, for which they require stability and need to be able to pay a competitive rate of pay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.175" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal O'Brien" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2015022400002#DD00300"><p>There is no contradiction in IBEC's view.  The way the labour market is working is that those employers who can afford to give pay increases are doing so, which is great for the workers in question and the domestic economy.  As Ms McElwee stated, many small businesses across IBEC's membership cannot afford to award pay increases at this point as to do so would threaten their viability and jobs, either in terms of the number of people employed or the hours employees work.  There is, therefore, no contradiction in our position, which is a reflection of developments in the labour market.</p> <p>  IBEC members employ approximately 1.1 million people across all sectors of the economy.  We are very happy to reflect as best we can all of the issues and business needs of our members and believe we do this quite well.  It is great that businesses doing well in export markets and the technology sectors are awarding pay increases.  However, for those businesses where labour accounts for more than 50% of the cost base and which are operating in sectors in which turnover is still 15% or more below the pre-crisis turnover figure, wage increases would not be the appropriate course of action.  They would cost jobs and prevent more people from returning to work, which must be the priority in addressing the inequality challenge.  Again, I see no contradiction in IBEC's position on this matter.  It is a reflection of the reality in the labour market and its economic fundamentals.</p><p>On the point raised by Deputy Calleary, while the living wage takes account of the taxation system, it does not take account of the transfer system because, ideally, one should not need transfers if one were earning sufficient income for a living wage.  The living wage is structured on the basis of an estimate for a single individual.  Transfers for families occur through child benefit and so forth.</p><p> The reason I referred to local authorities introducing the living wage is that this is the route by which its introduction has tended to take place elsewhere in the world.  Elected representatives have decided that employees of local authorities should be paid a living wage and the living wage is introduced in that way.  There is merit in that approach and a number of local authorities in Ireland have been examining the issue.</p><p> A living wage has also been introduced in other countries by large businesses, which tend to be the types of companies that embrace the living wage.  Large finance businesses and some of the universities and accounting firms have introduced it.  For the most part, such firms have few employees on very low wages and these tend to be cleaning and catering staff and so forth.  These employees are then paid a living wage.  Some of the leading supporters of the introduction of a living wage, for example, in the United Kingdom, are big businesses which like to be seen to be paying their employees properly.  It often comes as a surprise to them that they were not paying their employees properly and the result is a willingness on their part to embrace living wages.  </p><p> I propose to address the logic of an increase in the minimum wage, an issue on which I disagree somewhat with Mr. O'Brien and Ms McElwee.  To take first the change in consumer prices since the previous increase in the minimum wage in July 2007, prices had increased by 2.3% between July 2007 and the end of last year.  There is, therefore, an issue related to the value of the purchasing power of those earning the minimum wage, which has declined over time.  Throughout this period, there were significant variations in prices, with periods of deflation and inflation.  To some degree, we are in another period of deflation.  Nonetheless, there are issues around the decline over time in the purchasing power of those on the minimum wage.  </p><p> I agree with Deputy Calleary that there appears to be some logic in the argument that, in a period in which wage increases are broadly beginning to appear in the economy, as shown by data from the Central Statistics Office and reports from IBEC for two years in a row indicating that its members are awarding wage increases, it would seem to be almost a bit mad that the wages of those at the very bottom who need an increase most are not increasing.  The idea that there would be no increases for this group but increases for those further up the ladder does not make sense.  There is merit in ensuring further divides do not emerge.  This returns us to the logic of increasing the minimum wage.  </p><p> One of the great problems with the structure of the minimum wage in Ireland is that we tend to revisit the level at which it is set only occasionally.  In other words, we only consider increasing it every couple of years.  Asking employers to pay, for instance, one increase of 60 cent rather than four increases of 15 cent spread over four years is a much more difficult request to implement.  The decision of the Government to establish a low pay commission to examine the minimum wage on an annual basis is very welcome.  We should consider making smaller changes in the minimum wage over time to maintain its adequacy for low income workers than to revisit the issue occasionally, as has been the case until now.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That would make a lot more sense than the occasional visiting we've been doing up to now and I think will give us better outcomes.</p></speech>

Could Dr. Collins confirm another figure that is quite remarkable, that the top 20% of workers receive 25 times the share of the bottom 20%?</p> <p>   The issue being discussed here is low pay; sometimes when the issue is discussed with IBEC or ISME attention gets slightly diverted to those outside of employment.  The challenge we have here is that there is such a problem with low pay in Ireland.  I believe it is the objective and the responsibility of the Government to ensure that a person working full-time can cover their full expenses in life.  There is a difficulty if a wage fails to do that.  I find that often in these discussions it is argued that low wages are good for competition but high wages are also good for competition and that logic affects the distribution of income.  The fact of the matter is the competitiveness of the State is founded on all of its income and all of its pay; a flatter income gradient would be more beneficial for the competitiveness of the State because people who earn &euro;100,000 are also competing with people who earn &euro;100,000 in Britain.  </p> <p>   Sinn F&eacute;in has been involved in bringing about a living wage in Belfast City Council.  This cost Belfast City Council &pound;21 per staff member per year and was accomplished with no increase in the rates paid by businesses, so it can be done if an organisation is determined to do it.  </p> <p>   Mr. O'Brien suggested increasing the tax base while reducing the tax rates.  That does work at certain points of the economic cycle; my worry is that it has proven to have the opposite effect at other points of the economic cycle.  When there is contraction in the economic cycle, as there will be, we find that it has a procyclical influence on the process and sometimes has the effect of making the bottom end of the cycle more difficult for the economy.</p> <p>   We discussed FIS earlier, which to a certain extent is a subsidy; the State, in effect, is paying a subsidy to employers to pay workers.  If that subsidy did not exist these individuals would not take the job because the job would not be worthwhile.  Some of the people who are in receipt of FIS work for companies that are very profitable and do not need FIS.  If IBEC believes in market forces, does it believe that certain businesses should have subsidies paid to them in this way?  For example, I am aware that IBEC does not support large subsidies to farmers in a similar fashion year on year.  If some companies do not need subsidies and others would not survive in the real market should the state be repeatedly paying them a subsidy?  </p> <p>   It has been asserted that we are in direct competition with people in Britain as opposed to those in the Nordic countries.  I do not fully agree with this; I believe we are probably in competition with all of those economies.  It is those models which are most competitive that we should be aiming to converge upon.  The difference between the minimum wages in Ireland and Britain has been mentioned but how does the purchasing power in Ireland compare to that in Britain?  How can purchasing power be increased without increasing the minimum wage?  One suggestion was to reduce the costs of public services; are there any other ways that could be done?</p></speech>

In our conversation, inequality in society and the statistics we use to measure it are mainly looked at in terms of household income data, including social welfare.  I would go back to some of the comments made earlier about the source of inequality.  I believe it is due to having such a high rate of jobless households and that this is the single source of inequality in society.  The issue is not just the social welfare system, but more about how we can help people in these households find jobs.  These are people whose parents may never have had a job.  This is one of the biggest challenges we face and is crucial to the debate on inequality.</p> <p>  In terms of tax, my point is that there tends to be significant revisionism in terms of the economic history of the 1990s and 2000s and of the cuts in taxes making the system unsustainable.  The problem was we had a very narrow tax base.  Our argument would be that we should broaden that tax base.  We must learn from that crisis.  When the economy collapsed, there was nothing coming into the public coffers.  This was because we had an excessive reliance on income tax and transaction related property taxes.  Broadening that tax base to services and property makes sense and will protect us in future downturns.  We argue that having competitive income tax rates, in what is now becoming an increasingly mobile, global labour market, is how we will maximise tax revenue from the perspective of income.</p> <p>  A narrative has developed that the State is subsidising employers to keep people in work.  That view is unhelpful to this discussion and we disagree with it.  Many of these jobs would not exist if they were a higher cost.  The employer may be paying 70% or 80%, but the State would be paying 100% of that cost if it was not competitive to keep that job in this economy.  If wage costs are significantly higher, we will lose many of these jobs.  We hope we will move to higher quality jobs over time.  For that reason we will invest in skills and education to try to create an environment where more people have higher quality and higher paid jobs in the economy.  However, many of the higher cost jobs we have here will move out of this country.  We have seen this in the past.  Before the economic crisis ever hit us, hundreds of thousands of jobs moved out of this economy because of wage cost competitiveness.</p><p>I shall start by confirming the figures for the Deputy.  The figures are from the most recent CSO survey on income and living conditions, the most detailed survey and data we have on income in the country.  It gives us the picture of where we are before taxes and social welfare occur.  It is the case that the top 20% receive 25 times the share of those at the bottom.  One of the other numbers was that the top 30% of all earners get 67% of all the income.  This is the starting point of the State steps to redistribute.  If we have such high inequity to start with, it is a big job to redistribute income and even out the situation.  This brings us back to issues around how to begin to address in some way the issue of more adequate earnings and incomes.  This is the reason we have an effective tax and social welfare system.  We must have that.  Otherwise we would have even more unequal income distribution, which would be even more problematic.</p><p> We must remember competitiveness is not just about wages.  Wages are important, but there are issues in regard to public services, infrastructure and the education system.  Competitiveness touches on all of these also.  In terms of low paid workers and the general groups the committee is looking at, we must remember it is not all about pay and that there are issues around precariousness of employment or precarious work practices and uncertainty for employees, who do not know from one week to another what their work hours or income will be.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Putting people and families in a position such as that is not sustainable in terms of ensuring adequate and decent standards of living for society.  </p><p> I agree with Mr. O'Brien that a jobless household is the real issue.  There is no doubt about that.  Given the scale of the economic crash we have had, we have many of these households.  The great concern is that if we have significant numbers of lower skilled people unemployed, the potential jobs awaiting them are not a great improvement from their current position.  We want to get these people back to work, but we want to get them back into decent jobs and work.  We must think about this agenda.</p><p> On the broadening of the tax base, we have still got quite a bit of work to do.  We have made significant progress over time, but broadening it further would probably include issues such as increasing employees' and employers' PRSI, which are quite low.  Neither of these two groups are paying sufficient currently to support the social insurance system we have in place or the social insurance fund, which continues to require subvention from the Exchequer.  Given the structure of the economy and the population and given the likely costs that face us in the years to come, this brings us back to thinking realistically about how we will pay for these.</p><p> I and some of my colleagues at the Nevin Economic Research Institute have been pointing towards the fact that we must stop dealing with the day-to-day crises we have been dealing with, in positive and negative times, for approximately three decades and begin to embrace seriously where we are going as a society.  We must think about that.  This will require us to think about structural reform and about preparing for the long-term challenges.  It is unrealistic to look at the tax take we collect currently and the likelihood of what is ahead for society without realising that we must either make significant public spending cuts in the years to come or collect more tax.  We have not had that debate, but it would be useful to have it.</p></speech>

Therefore, if we reduced the minimum wage by half, we would have a higher demand for labour.  However, if a person is working full time and cannot afford to pay his rent and feed his children, the State must fill that gap.  In other words, we need to find a morally responsible wage level that means the State does not need to keep filling the pot for people who need support to look after their families and their rent.  This wage needs to be found and employers need to pay that rate.  This makes the argument that there is a necessity for an increase in the minimum wage in order to achieve that.</p><p>One of the disadvantages of being last to contribute is that most of the questions have been asked.  I agree with Mr. O'Brien that one of the main issues in regard to household income is jobless households, but I must also state the obvious, namely, that earning &euro;8.65 an hour is a significant contributor to income inequality.  It also affects a person's opportunity to not just survive but be part of society.  With all due respects to Ms McElwee, it is no consolation that approximately the same percentage of the population is on &euro;8.65 an hour as before 2007.</p><p> The minimum wage of &euro;8.65 an hour is not an acceptable wage for anybody.  I recognise we look at the world from a different viewpoint and I respect that Mr. O'Brien and Ms McElwee are here as IBEC representatives.  I speak from a different side.  For example, we know the VAT reduction for the hospitality sector cost the taxpayer a significant amount.  We will hear from unions that come before us at a later date that no negotiations were held on issues such as the nature of work rather than pay alone so as to ensure better quality conditions for these people.  We know that some people in the hospitality sector have refused to engage in registered employment agreements, REAs, or joint labour committees, JLCs, which might ensure a better quality of life.</p><p> As was said earlier, the issue is not just about wages, but about everything else also.  I am disappointed with IBEC's response on this and almost feel there is a conspiracy in this regard.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Lyons:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2307"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy John Lyons"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2307&amp;amp;pid=JohnLyonsLab&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy John Lyons"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Deputy Calleary had asked if there are any figures on how many IBEC members have employees who are paid &euro;8.65 per hour.  I assume that there are some people who do.  It is great to hear people talking about wage increases.  Surveys have shown that more people are expecting wage increases and that employers are going to do this.  We know that is happening.  They are the types of employers who have a good social responsibility attached to the way that they treat their workers.  </p><p>  The current estimate of people employed on the minimum wage is 4.7%.  I respect that there are employers who cannot pay because of the circumstances they find their business in right now but to call a spade a spade, there are businesses who employ people and who would employ them at less than what they pay them now if they could.  It is not acceptable to sugar coat the situation and say that does not exist.  That is what the issue is about here today.  I am not concerned with people on middle or higher incomes getting more this year.  I recognise that Government policy on this is required, and that is being looked at.  One of those significant pieces in the jigsaw is income rates.  It is not acceptable for anybody to earn &euro;330 a week; it cannot buy anything.  Even if it does provide 20% more purchasing power now than it did seven years ago or pre-crash, that is still very little.  </p><p>  I will finish on this point.  Nobody here earns close to the minimum wage.  There has been very little discussion about the real life implications of what it really means for these people.  I respect employers and acknowledge that they have a massive social responsibility but we cannot escape from the fact that if the minimum wage was reduced by &euro;2 tomorrow there will be some employers who are represented by IBEC and others who would decrease the wages they pay immediately.  Those people are the reason we are here today and why the introduction of some sort of regulation is necessary, to protect people who are in such vulnerable situations.  </p><p>  I will leave it at that.  I do not expect comments back because most of the questions have been asked and answered.  I want to make that point.  The real conversation here today is about the people who earn &euro;8.65 per hour.  We do fund work; we fund work for wealthy companies that are well able to pay and give people full-time, 40-hour contracts per week but choose to give them less than that for the benefit of the company rather than the worker.  Nobody here can produce documents to show that but we all know that exists.  It would be a shame to have this conversation without reference to the reality that people are living and who we hear from on a day-to-day basis.  </p></speech>

Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked a question about the purchasing power in Ireland versus that in the UK.  The latest numbers that IBEC has looked at show that in Ireland it is about 10% higher.  The other thing that it is important to recognise is that Ireland does a very good job of keeping minimum wage earners out of the tax net; their effective tax rate is about 3%.  In most other countries tax on minimum wage is quite high; in the UK it is about double.  That is an important part of the conversation.</p> <p>   The reduced rate of VAT and the impact it has had on the economy is relevant to much of this discussion and the conversation we had on tax rates and revenue.  The Deputy made the point that the VAT reduction would cost the taxpayer.  I would argue that the VAT reduction has actually yielded revenue for the taxpayer because it put more people back to work.  It showed the cost-sensitive nature of many of the sectors in which it would have impacted and ultimately it was an economic gain for the country.  It actually benefitted the taxpayer.  It took people off social welfare, put them back into work, ensured that employers were paying more employer PRSI and that there was more spending power in the economy.  That is what appropriate tax rates can do in terms of supporting economic growth and activity but it also demonstrates the cost-sensitive nature of some of the sectors being discussed.  If they have lower costs there will be more activity; if they have higher costs there will be less activity and unfortunately less employment.  I think the VAT reduction proves much of that.</p><p>Very quickly to respond to Deputy Lyons's comments.  I just wanted to link it to the living wage benchmark.  One of the reasons it was developed was to provide a figure that shows how much employees need to earn to be able to cover all of their costs and to have a decent standard of living.  When they earn below that figure they are making cutbacks and so on.  I think that figure is very useful in terms of pointing towards the sustainability or challenges that employees face.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That figure is very useful in pointing towards sustainability or the challenges employees face when they are on below the living wage, struggling and having to make cuts.  That is one of the main purposes of establishing the figure.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to put them on silent mode.  They need to be turned off because they could cause problems with the broadcasting equipment.<br/><br/>As people will know, the committee is carrying out a series of meetings in regard to what would happen to Ireland in the event of a British exit from the European Union.  Prime Minister Cameron said that if elected in May, he will hold a referendum in the UK in 2017 or earlier.  We are interested in finding out exactly what that might mean for Ireland.  It is important to state that the committee took the decision to examine this issue at this time in view of the potential impact it might have not just on Ireland but on Irish citizens in the UK.  We are having a series of meetings to discuss the impact and are talking to a range of academics, politicians and the like.<br/><br/>Today's discussion will focus on the economic interdependence of Ireland and the European Union.  The UK is Ireland's most important economic partner with just over one third of Irish imports coming from, and one sixth of Irish exports going to, the UK market.  We are delighted to be joined by Mr. Joe Durkin who is from the school of economics at UCD and who is very welcome. <br/><br/>Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with today's proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>I remind members that after Mr. Durkan's presentation, we have a number of items of private business to discuss and that the discussion today is not about whether the UK should have a referendum but about the implications of an exit on Ireland.  I invite Mr. Durkan to speak.</p><p>I will talk a bit about the background to the UK leaving.  I will then say what I think the likelihood is for the UK and for its relations with the European Union.  I will also say something about the likely performance of the UK economy being out of the EU and what that means for us because it is really through trade that we will face an impact.  The focus is on the UK.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe Durkan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The basis for the UK leaving, as presented, is almost entirely political and driven by the political needs of the present government and how it perceives Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party, and the growth of the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP.  That lies behind it and in order to justify it many arguments have been used, most of which do not stand up.  There is a claim that the UK is not integrated within the EU economy and in particular the financial services sector, the services sector, has not been integrated.  The data does not support that.  The growth in the UK trade with Europe has been very rapid, much more so than in previous periods.  Work that has been done in the United Kingdom that has tried to separate out the Single Market effect and the growth effect suggests that the UK&rsquo;s penetration of Europe has increased, as has the penetration of other EU countries into the UK. </p><p> In respect of the services sector it is probably true that it has not integrated as well but that is true of all countries, not just financial services but accountancy, legal and all the rest of those services have not developed to the extent that one might have expected under the Single Market programme.  It may be that it takes a bit longer than people had expected.  That is important.  There is also a problem with red tape and the claim that the UK economy is held back by red tape but exactly the same red tape applies to every other country and not all countries are held back.  Some work has been done to try to quantify the effect of red tape and suggest that the UK has less regulation than most other EU countries, particularly in the labour market, with the exception I think of Holland, which is the most liberal.  The degree of regulation in the United Kingdom is no different from that in the United States. </p><p> There is also a question that the UK contribution is excessive in spite of the rebate but in fact its net contribution amounts to 0.5% of UK GDP so this is not the huge burden that it makes out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.196" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2015022400002#C00200"><p>What is that in absolute numbers?</p><p>I can send it to the Chairman.  It is not huge.</p><p> The other argument is that immigration has given rise to a huge flow of people into the United Kingdom, which has damaged the economy and resulted in pressure on the health and social services.  That claim is also in dispute because most of the immigrants from the new accession states have contributed to output and output has been higher as a consequence.  The number of welfare immigrants is very small.  It is not in reality a big issue.  The political process is different.  It will make a lot of comment about these things even though they do not stand up. </p><p> If the UK does leave it is not just a question of leaving, it will want access to those markets.  It cannot just leave and say that is the end.  It will want to have a relationship with the EU.  We have examples of only a few countries, Norway and Switzerland being the prime ones, that are outside the EU but have agreements with it.  In effect both of these countries must meet EU rules if trade is to take place.  The UK will find itself in exactly the same position.  It will not be allowed to trade advantageously because it has managed to get rid of rules.  Leaving will not confer a competitive advantage in the short term.</p><p> In terms of the financial services sector, the City of London will find it is just as influenced by the rules that will be developed within the EU with the one proviso, that it will have no input into those rules.  If it leaves and new rules for the financial sector are determined the UK will be obliged to abide by those but will find that it has no say in their operation.  At the moment it does have a say.  This is very important and not clearly understood in Britain.  I think people there believe they can leave and behave as they want but that is not the case.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe Durkan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> It is true that the UK contribution will go down.  Interestingly enough, both Norway and Switzerland are obliged to make a contribution towards the economic development of the new accession states that need funds.  The United Kingdom will almost certainly be required to do so.  In the case of Switzerland, it amounts to about 55% of the contribution it would make if it was a member of the European Union.  That is kind of interesting and suggests that Britain's going will not save that much money in terms of payments.  </p><p> There is also the question of CAP which I might say a bit more about later.  Britain must think about the reduction of CAP payments because the burden of adjustment will fall on the British Government.  Therefore, it would save money directly but indirectly it would have to support agriculture unless it decides to do something else.</p><p> It is almost certain there would be less immigration.  I have read some material which suggests that Britain does leave there will have to be a repatriation of people.  That seems highly unlikely because I think the people who are in Britain will remain.  </p><p> The third issue I want to talk about is how the UK economy will perform.  If the referendum is held in 2017 then we are faced with two years of uncertainty about the outcome and uncertainty is detrimental to investment.  The last referendum held in Britain led to a reduction in investment and a capital flight because of the fear that Britain would not be a member of the European Union.</p><p> There is no doubt that the UK economy's performance would deteriorate in the short to medium term.  That is almost inevitable because of the uncertainty.  Britain would also have to negotiate a trade deal with the European Union which may not be favourable.  It will also find, when world trade is being discussed, that it will be by the European Union, the US, China, India and Japan.  The UK will be peripheral to that discussion because it is so small relative to everybody else and Britain will find itself excluded from negotiations.  I also suspect that the city of London will lose its relative position.  It is not in the eurozone at the moment.  Due to the UK not being in the eurozone it is peripheral and it will become more peripheral if it is out, I believe.    The UK economy is likely to suffer a lower growth path in the long run.</p><p> The idea that it can abolish red tape is fanciful.  A lot of the red tape, while it might be burdensome for companies, is necessary and would be introduced anyway and it is not just imposed by Europe.</p><p> What are the implications for Ireland?  The UK economy is very important for Ireland and one cannot just get that by looking at trade.  One third of food exports from Ireland go to the United Kingdom which, to my mind, is the key to it all.  A lot of the rest of the exports would be chemicals and pharmaceuticals which are produced by  multinational companies and they will go anyway.  The food sector could be affected.</p><p> Why is the UK so important?  We have two episodes that show us how important the UK is to us and one was the mid-1980s.  We began to recover from the recession in the mid-1980s due to the growth in the UK economy following the loss and boom.  I wrote a paper on this issue a long time ago which showed that the timing of our growth in exports was directly related to the growth of the UK economy and led our recovery.  It took a good few years before it was evident that a recovery was in place.  In the same way, the slow recovery that we are experiencing now began last year and is related to the growth in the UK and US economies.  They are the two factors that have driven our recovery, as well as some domestic foreign direct investment.  For us, the performance of the UK economy is critical.  If the UK weakens then it will lead to a weakening of the growth of this economy and I do not see how such an outcome could be avoided.</p><p> For us, the important things will be trade, foreign direct investment and tourism.  In terms of trade, the effect will be weaker.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe Durkan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is no likelihood that FDI that goes to the UK will come to Ireland.  Most of the companies go to the UK because the market is big but they also see access to Europe as important.  Car manufacturers such as Toyota, Nissan and Honda are located there.  If they lost that big market and European springboard, this investment would cease and there would be capital flight.  The companies will not necessarily come here.  I could not imagine companies such as these coming here because our market is small and, therefore, I do not see us gaining much from that.</p><p> With regard to tourism, it is inevitable that a weaker UK economy will lead to weaker tourism.  We experienced this during the current recession.</p><p> Agriculture matters very much to us but it is not clear what would happen in the UK.  It would lose the transfers under the CAP and the UK Government would have to make a decision on whether it would support agriculture.  The amounts are huge.  I saw data that suggest that over the next five years, almost Stg&pound;20 billion will go into agriculture through the CAP.  That money would not be available and, therefore, the UK Government would have to make a decision on supporting agriculture.  The worst scenario from our point of view would be if the government resorted to the same policies it had prior to entry into the EU when the UK had a deficiency payment system under which lower prices were guaranteed to farmers but incomes were maintained through additional payments.  The effect of that was to reduce the price of meat and dairy products, in particular.  Some members may recall that prior to joining the EU, Ireland subsidised the export of butter to the UK because of that deficiency payment system.  We would not want to go back to that but that is a big risk for us, as we would find it hard to sell in the UK.</p><p> The milk quota system was a big barrier to the growth of the agriculture industry.  It conferred income gains to people in the short run but it meant that output was constrained for the past 35 years.  That constraint on milk output meant that the agriculture industry found it hard to develop.  With the lifting of the quota, output will increase by between 40% and 50%.  The producers and processors have geared up for that but our main market is still the UK and we could easily find that market distorted, which is a major risk.</p><p> The risks are high if the UK leaves.  There could also be issues with the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  The policy would cease because from the Uk's point of view, it would re-establish control over its fisheries.</p></speech>

I commend the Chairman on holding these hearings in advance of any possibility of Britain leaving the EU.  It is better to be there before the horse bolts.  There is no great economic benefit for Britain in leaving the EU.  It is doing well and it would not be wise to leave.  The general consensus is that no political party in Ireland would even contemplate leaving the EU if Britain left because there would be no benefit whatsoever.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator Terry Leyden"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator Terry Leyden"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The announcement of the referendum, which is premature with the election in May and when people do not know who will be in power, has undermined the economy before people know who will be in government.  It may be a combination of the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party but the Scottish nationalists do not want to leave.  The Labour Party might be convinced that it is now politically advantageous to hold a referendum.</p><p> Yesterday, 850 jobs were announced by Apple for Athenry.  It is coming to Ireland because we are guaranteed to stay in the European Union and the company can supply the European Union from a location in Ireland.  It is a massive investment and a great endorsement of the country but it did not go to England.  We are giving mobile companies stability and we are the only English speaking country in the region.  There is a massive implication for Britain and all we can do is put across our point of view, which we are doing in a balanced and reasonable manner.

He is one of a number of contributors to the debate and the problem is that it is like playing devil's advocate.  We are considering the ifs and buts that permeate the debate.  The committee started by trying to speculate about the effects on Ireland if Britain pulled out but we have not yet come to terms with the Tories and their suggestion that they will have a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; referendum if they get an overall majority in the next election.  The first hurdle must be overcome, which is whether the Tories get an overall majority.  Most speakers have outlined the lunacy of the current thinking of the Tories and the negative effect of a pull-out, although it is not like unplugging from a socket, for Britain and Ireland.<br/><br/>We have a divided nation, with Six Counties still occupied by the British establishment.  We have the Border and we are in Europe and in the euro, while Britain is in the sterling zone.  The ramifications for Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Border are tremendously complicated.<br/><br/>With UKIP basically a racist and anti-immigration force at play in Britain, the hysteria was illustrated by the media presenting themselves at airports to see the immigrants who were going to rob the welfare system dry in England.  The media discovered only one man was coming in but he had a job.  Romanians and Bulgarians did not flood in and most people agree the benefit to any nation of inward immigration is because of the motivation of immigrants, who want to work and are productive in the workforce.<br/><br/>What will happen in Northern Ireland politics?  First of all, there is a substantial Unionist representation that takes its seats.  It would be interesting to hear the analysis of how the brothers in the Unionist fraternity would relate to the Conservative Party in Great Britain.  The irony of it is the position of Scotland and, by implication, Wales.  Is there an argument that UKIP, if successful, would eventually end up wrecking the United Kingdom?  Sinn F&eacute;in, being eurosceptic, will not take part in the debate in Westminster.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eric Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=142"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Eric Byrne"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=142&amp;amp;pid=EricJByrne&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Eric Byrne"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->How will the political dice in this regard roll <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales?<br/><br/>Some people seek an out in the context of Norway and Switzerland.

As everyone is aware, Switzerland shares borders with France, Italy and Germany and I understand that the result of the referendum to which I refer cannot be implemented because it is not possible to create quotas in respect of European workers entering and leaving particular jurisdictions.<br/><br/>Is it fair to state that we should anticipate that negotiations on the part of Westminster in respect of unravelling whatever treaties the British feel need to be unravelled will probably last two years?  As is the case with Greece, does our guest believe that Britain would find itself very short of friends if it were to leave the current community of 28 member states?  Are there any implications for England in the context of the TTIP negotiations?</p></speech>

A number of questions arose at our previous meetings which I will now put to our guest.  We can tell what would likely be the impact on Britain and Ireland if the former were to exit the EU.  To what extent has the impact on the Union itself of a possible exit been examined?  If Britain leaves, then the Union will be smaller.  In addition, if this course of action were followed, it would be the first occasion on which a member state would leave the Union since its inception as the European Coal and Steel Community.  In a sense, it would also be the first reversal of the European project.</p> <p>  What has motivated the British establishment to contemplate taking this route?  As Deputy Eric Byrne indicated, if the Tories win the forthcoming general election, it is their intention to hold a referendum on this matter.   One is conditional on the other, of course, and an exit might never happen.  In such circumstances, one must query the wisdom of putting forward the proposal relating to a possible exit in the first instance.  What are the issues which motivate members of the British public?  Is it a case of their having an us-and-them view of Europe?  Has Britain ever taken ownership of the European project?  Has it resiled from that project and, if so, to what extent?  How much impact has this had on the entire European integration project?</p> <p>  Mr. Joe Durkan referred to Norway and Switzerland.  The latter is situated in the middle of the European Union and is, therefore, in a very advantageous position geographically.  While not so centrally positioned, Norway has the compensation of its natural resources.  The case of Britain is somewhat different, particularly in the context of its relationship with the island - namely, this one - located off its western shores.  There are some pundits in this country who have suggested that Ireland should also consider leaving the EU.  Such a course of action would be disastrous.  It would give rise to a double whammy by causing major damage to the EU and - by virtue of their isolation from the Continent - the economies of both Ireland and the UK.</p> <p>  Mr. Joe Durkan referred to the City of London and how remarkably and effectively it is integrating with the European area in general.  There would be a serious effect on the level of trade between the City of London and other global financial services centres if the UK were to leave the EU.  The knock-on effect of this would be felt in the UK's economy.  There are suggestions to the effect that if the City of London is doing well in terms of trade, then the remainder of the British economy follows suit.  In the event of Britain removing itself from the EU arena, what will happen to the trade carried out in the City of London?</p></speech>

The United Kingdom is apparently embarking on a process whose conclusion is uncertain, but this exercise is helpful in assisting the committee to a greater understanding of the issues.  Together with the other briefings we have been given, Mr. Durkan's contribution is invaluable.</p> <p>  The first question I intended to ask has already been answered and I have only one other question for the witness.  Mr. Durkan referred to the risks of an EU exit being quite high for the United Kingdom economy in the short to medium term.  I am not an economist and must defer to his vast experience and expertise in these matters.  Will he elaborate on how, in the normal run of things and given the bigger picture, the UK economy would suffer?  I will refrain from asking about the impact on the Irish economy, because we will just have to wait and see how the dice falls in that respect.</p></speech>

My question follows on from that of Deputy Keating.  I take a completely different view from the latter, namely, that the purpose of our having these types of discussions is to consider how we might place ourselves in a state of readiness in the event that the UK does decide to exit the European Union.  Mr. Durkan has set out very clearly the implications of such an outcome and I accept his analysis.  The questions that follow for us relate to the type of contingency planning we should be doing, what types of precautionary measures we should be taking and whether we should include certain measures in our budgetary process that would leave us in a state of readiness in the eventuality of a UK exit.</p></speech>

In his view, can Ireland or any other EU member state exert an influence on the UK's decision?  Going back as far as 1975, despite all media and most parties supporting British membership, the referendum on whether the UK should remain part of the then EEC was only carried by a 2:1 majority.  In 1993, John Major's Government almost fell on the issue of the Maastricht treaty.  Current polls show that the majority of people in Britain want out of the EU for various reasons.</p> <p>  An interesting development in the debate in recent months has been the references to Norway, Sweden and Switzerland - countries which are outside or on the periphery of the EU and have managed to achieve greater growth than any of the best performing countries of the EU or its economy overall.  All three of these countries have direct trade with Europe and their economies are performing exceptionally well.  Will Mr. Durkan comment on that?</p> <p>  It is important to note that it is not just the Conservative Party driving this issue.  Some members of the British Labour Party are very wishy-washy about the EU and cannot give a guarantee on how they will vote.</p></speech>

That is the official policy.  Of course, every party includes members who are sceptical.</p><p>From speaking to people in the British Labour Party, my impression is that there will be a referendum no matter who is in government after the election.  I would go so far as to say there will undoubtedly be a referendum.  Although the majority wanting to leave the EU has reduced and now stands at some 53%, 82% of British people want a referendum on the question.  None of the parties will be able to ignore that.</p><p> IBEC has argued that in the event of a UK exit from the EU, a margin of businesses in Ireland could cede to a more attractive credits-based tax regime in Britain, as set out under Conservative Party proposals.  That party seems determined on having a referendum and on a UK exit.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Halligan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2315"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy John Halligan"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy John Halligan"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is already beginning to offer tax incentives to businesses to establish operations in Britain.

I base my view on the results of opinion polls, what is stated in the UK press and the actions of those in the Conservative Party and some in the British Labour Party who seem to be hell-bent on having a referendum held and who will probably support an exit from the European Union.</p></speech>

The United Kingdom has a long history of immigration.  Obviously, many Irish people have gone there to live and work.  Has it tended to differentiate between immigration from the countries of the British Commonwealth and that from other European Union member states?  Have studies been carried out of the economics of migration?  In that context, I recall a recent newspaper headline which read, "Is there no one left in Britain who can make a sandwich?"  We all know the point that was being made about the skills, etc., people possess.  Have studies such as those to which I refer been carried out?</p> <p>  Agriculture is extremely important to Ireland, particularly in the context of direct transfers.  In view of the fact that the United Kingdom is a net contributor to the European Union, what impact would a possible exit have on the direct supports we receive?  There are many small holdings in Scotland and Wales and, as a result, both are much more dependent on direct transfers.  What impact would a possible exit have on those involved in farming in these countries, particularly in terms of their ability to remain in operation?</p> <p>  In the context of business - be it small, city-based or whatever else - everyone wants to reduce the amount of red tape which must be dealt with.  Are there specific policies which companies, both large and small, might identify and state that if they were removed, operating would be easier?  Everyone is opposed to red tape, but I am just wondering if there is differentiation in this regard?</p><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tUasal Joe Durkan.  Different people have come before the committee to discuss this matter and there is agreement that a possible UK exit from the European Union could have a huge impact on Ireland.  As Deputy Bernard J. Durkan inquired, should we be focusing on the possible impact on the European Union in general and the United Kingdom?  We are motivated in terms of the impact it would have on Ireland.  A person who previously appeared before the committee suggested the IFSC was very much viewed as a satellite of the City of London and noted the potential impact an exit could have on Ireland in this context.  Does Mr. Durkan share the concerns expressed by the individual to whom I refer?</p><p> If Britain were to decide to leave, how long would it take to negotiate new trade agreements?  Deputy Timmy Dooley indicated that Ireland needed to put in place contingency plans.  Does Mr. Durkan have suggestions to make in this regard?  The strategy the Tories appear to be pursuing seems to be based on the premise that by announcing an intention to hold a referendum on a possible exit, they will strengthen Britain's hand in negotiations with the European Union.  Does Mr. Durkan share my view in this regard?</p><p> Under the Tories, Britain is seen as one of the most pro-TTIP countries in the European Union.  However, the British Labour Party has indicated that it has major difficulties with the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism.  Some countries in Europe, including France and Germany, have also outlined their concerns about this mechanism.  If Britain does pull out of the European Union, will it have an impact on investment?<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1774"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=1774&amp;amp;pid=SeanCroweSF&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Another speaker suggested that if Britain was to move under a Tory leadership, certainly it would be much more comfortable moving towards the US in terms of trade.</p></speech>

I wish to ask a question that has not yet been asked, namely, in relation to the financial transaction tax, the Robin Hood tax, the total tax.  Mr. Durkan mentioned in his evidence that he expects the City of London to get more peripheral if the UK pulls out of the European Union.  One of the reasons Ireland was not one of the original 12 or so countries that signed up for the intergovernmental agreement to establish the financial transaction tax in some European countries, was we thought that would drive people from our financial services centre across to the UK.  If the UK withdraws from the European Union does Mr. Durkan expect Ireland to have to sign up for the financial transaction tax?  Would that then become a done deal?  Everyone who wished to contribute has had an opportunity to do so.  Deputy Dooley sends his apologies.  He has another meeting but will read the answer to his question in the transcript.</p><p>Senator Terry Leyden asked about Ireland leaving the European Union.  I thought about it very peripherally and I did not think there was the remotest possibility that we would leave because the balance of advantage for us has to be to stay within the European Union.<br/><br/>Deputy Eric Byrne's questions were mostly political.  I am not heavy into politics but try to think of the economics of things.  When one looks at the UK one has to ask what is driving it.  It seems to me that the referendum is being driven by a small group of people, the Eurosceptics within the Tory Party and the fear of UKIP.  The trouble is that the more these people make noise, the more Mr. Cameron and so on responds to it an attempt to show that he is not being caught offside.  He may be painting himself into a corner - that is what I suspect.  I cannot see, given what everybody believes about the disadvantages to Britain, that it would do something that is not in its interests.  I just do not believe that but the UK could be driven to it if the vote turns out to be the way it is.  I would expect the members of the committee to know more about this than me because they are in the political process and I am not.  I try to avoid it if I can.  <br/><br/>In terms of the negotiations, Article 50 of the treaty allows for people to exit so the procedure is laid down.  I think it would take a long time, it may be two years before it could get out and then it could spend another two years negotiating a trade agreement.  Trade agreements take much longer than one would think.  Switzerland still has not completed its part of EFTA but is not part of the European Economic Area so it still has not got a formal agreement on all the trade that is needed.  I am not really into the politics. <br/><br/>There was a very interesting article in last week's edition of <i>The Economist</i>which talked about the fragmentation of the political system in Britain.  Instead of  being just two parties there is now an awful lot more in it.  One cannot ignore Scotland any more and one cannot ignore Northern Ireland.  I am not sure about how Wales fits in but it has to take account of that.  It will be the United Kingdom leaving the European Union - it is not one bit of it that will leave, the whole lot will leave.  Scotland will not have the option of not leaving, nor will Northern Ireland.  The whole of the United Kingdom will leave.<br/><br/>Deputy Durkan asked me about the really important question, namely, the impact on the European Union.  The European Union will have an interest in concluding a trade deal with Britain.  It is in its interests.  It does not want Britain to be outside.  Britain is still a big market and it sells a lot.  It will want to do a trade deal.  It will not want to be too advantageous for Britain.  Obviously it cannot let Britain decide it will get rid of a whole rake of regulations.  It will still have to conform to the regulations in place.  That is inevitable.  It will not be able to get rid of the red tape.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe Durkan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> As for the European project, Britain never bought into it and I am not sure we did either.  Members should bear in mind that this grew out of the Second World War.  I taught a course on European integration to my students and spent three or four lectures talking about what happened after the war because that is the motivation for the European project.  People might forget it because it is 70 years ago but it is still there.  Many people in Germany remember what it was like just after the war.  There was an extraordinary level of displacement as people were forced to leave parts of what is now Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.  The devastation wrought by that and by similar events throughout Europe is something they do not forget.  We did not experience it so we may not have bought into it.  We bought into it because it looked like it involved money or employment but the originators of the project probably had a different perception of what they were trying to achieve from the one we have.</p><p> I was asked about the performance of the UK economy.  There is no doubt that in the run-up to the referendum investment in the UK will be weaker.  It is inevitable and the consequence of that will be a reduced medium-term performance and a weaker supply side of that economy.</p></speech>

This is not just speculation as it happened in the 1970s at the time of the last referendum.  Investment did actually fall and that inevitably reduces a country's long-run potential growth.  There will be uncertainty if the UK does leave as to what the terms of any trade agreements will be.  Everyone will call for them to remain more or less as they are because otherwise it is very disruptive.  If UK income falls it will impact on Europe because it means Europe will sell less.  It is important we do not see weakness in an economy as an advantage because it really is a disadvantage.  The richer countries become the better it is for everybody because they are then more likely to be able to trade successfully.</p></speech>

Foreign firms in the United Kingdom, of which there are many, may think twice about expanding their activity there and may consider locating elsewhere.  The question was on how they performed and my answer is "very poorly".  It is not just a question of investment.  Having failed to get the investment, their capital stock does not increase as it should so their long-run performance will be lower.</p></speech>

Members of the committee are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> I remind our guests that their presentations should be no more than five minutes duration.  As a number of delegates are presenting today, all of their presentations and submissions have been circulated to members in order that they might have an opportunity to read and digest their contents.  I call on Mr. Mark Fielding to make his presentation on low pay and a living wage.</p><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to address the joint committee.  As they are aware, I represent small and medium-sized businesses in Ireland and I am the CEO of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME.</p><p> I wish to touch on a number of issues that are of vital importance to small and medium employers and also to those affected by poverty.  Depending on to whom one listened in the period 1999 to 2000, the national minimum wage was supposed to address poverty by either reducing or eliminating the problem.  However, the survey of income and living conditions produced by the CSO in 2012 showed that the level of consistent poverty had increased since 2004 and that deprivation rates were steadily increasing.  It is clear, therefore, that the introduction of the national minimum wage, in order to get rid of poverty, has not actually worked.  I am sure Fr. Peter McVerry would agree with me in that regard.  The number of people who are homeless stands at its highest point ever in the history of the State.  People are not living in poverty because the minimum wage or their hourly rates of pay are too low.  There are, for example, individuals who earn above the minimum wage and are living in poverty.  People are living in poverty because they are either not working or not working enough.  They need jobs, not an increase in the minimum wage.</p><p> As members will be aware, 360,000 citizens are unemployed.  There are also 86,000 involved in activation schemes which, for want of a better expression, means that they are also unemployed.  This means that, in total, almost 450,000 citizens are out of work.  Of these, 96,000 have been unemployed for three years.  That is where the problem lies; it is not down to the position on the minimum wage.  Net income inequality in Ireland is close to the EU 28 average.  The Irish wealth distribution rate also roughly reflects the average which obtains in other developed countries.  The only explanation for the uneven spread in income inequality - in the context of earned income - relates to the fact that a huge number of people live in households in which nobody works.  In 2013 almost one in four of those aged under 60 years was living in a household in which no one was in employment.  That is double the EU average.  It is, in fact, the highest proportion in Europe without exception and significantly higher than in even Greece or Spain.  When an unusually large proportion of the population are not earning an income, it is not surprising that there is an uneven distribution of earned income.</p><p> As far as ISME is concerned, the concept of a national minimum wage was wrong from the very outset because it confused the roles of the Government and employers and placed the onus on the latter to pay a wage that sometimes was not economic.  Businesses can only afford to pay the value of the labour they purchase.  It is uneconomic for them to do otherwise.  During the period in which the national minimum wage has been in place, it has actually been increased by 55%.  However, we still have not eliminated poverty.  As stated, the level of poverty is increasing.  In the context of who is paying the national minimum wage, the National Competitiveness Council defines competitiveness as all those factors affecting the ability of Irish businesses to sell goods and services in international markets.  The council believes competitiveness is not an end in itself but a means of achieving sustainable improvements in living standards and quality of life.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Mark Fielding:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->If that is the case we know that between 2000 and 2008 we have had a huge loss of competitiveness in the region of 39% to 40%.  It has come back slightly between 2008 and 2012 but we are again in the process of losing some competitiveness and in the background there is another call for an increase in the minimum wage.  The knock-on effect of the minimum wage will have an effect on wage values across the economy.</p><p> Taking into account the inflation figures of the past 12 years the ratio of national minimum wage to price levels at today's value would be about &euro;7.40 rather than &euro;8.65.  The solution we propose, rather than have a national minimum wage which puts the social responsibility on an employer, is that the Government would introduce an incomes policy which would include an earned income tax credit.  The amount of that credit could be a function of how much one earns and one's family size.  That process could remove all tax and other deductions on income that equates to about two thirds of the average industrial wage, ensuring that individuals can earn up to &euro;20,000 per annum before being taxed.  That could be targeted so that money goes to actual workers living in poverty.  It has the advantage of removing low paid employees from the tax net.  It enhances the progressive structure of tax policy.  It is making gainful employment more rewarding than the live register.  It fulfils the Government's obligation to redistribute income through the tax system, which is not an employer's function.  It takes the onus and cost of income distribution away from employers.  When low-wage workers are supported through tax cuts and rebates, then, being more equitable, all taxpayers share the financial burden.  We recommend that the Low Pay Commission investigate and cost this proposal as part of its work in the coming months.</p></speech>

I am aware that he previously provided assistance to the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  In my comments I wish to use the data available to economists to address the question, "Is Ireland a low pay economy?"  I can tackle the question from two approaches - the microeconomic approach, looking at it from the level of the individual, and the macroeconomic approach, looking at it from the level of the overall economy or an overall industry.  The microeconomic approach, the key data measure, is the incidence of low pay which is generally taken to be the proportion of employees earning less than two thirds of the median wage.  For Ireland the figure is very high.  Looking at the European Union 15, Ireland has the third highest incidence of low pay at just over 20% when account is taken of hourly pay.  The data are collected by the Central Statistics Office.  The advantage of using EUROSTAT data is that it aggregates it across and member states can make comparisons.  The OECD also provide aggregates but not the same level of detail that EUROSTAT offers.  The EUROSTAT is somewhat better.</p><p> In terms of full-time employees and part-time employees, Ireland remains towards the bottom of the league table.  In fact, for full-time, Ireland is at the bottom with the highest level incidence of low pay at 17%.  For all EU states, low pay is higher among part-time staff.  Given that they are being compared to a national benchmark, it is standard that part-time workers would generally be on lower hourly wages than full-time workers.  The incidence of low pay for part-time workers in Ireland is close to 40%, the third highest in the EU.</p><p> The headline figures would suggest that Ireland is a low pay economy.  However, we must look at that in more detail.  Three issues are key when addressing whether Ireland is a low pay economy from the micro perspective.  The first is the thresholds used, against what are we judging low pay.   The second is the tax rate on low pay.  Low pay is judged versus gross pay but the worker feels net pay.  The final issue, as alluded to by Mr. Mark Fielding from ISME, is the at risk of poverty rate for those in employment.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">  Mr. Seamus Coffey: :</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That is a broader measure as it takes into consideration pay, tax and transfers.  Ireland had the second highest threshold for low pay in the European Union.  According to the data, the median wage in Ireland is approximately &euro;19 and the low pay threshold is set at two thirds of this, at &euro;12.03, the second highest threshold used.  In Germany, the Netherlands and Finland the thresholds are all 20% lower.  We are judging our low pay threshold on much higher thresholds than other countries.  Anyone earning below &euro;12 an hour in Ireland is classed as being low paid, whereas in Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden, it is approximately &euro;10 or even &euro;9 in some cases.</p><p> EUROSTAT also produces figures based on purchasing power parity to account for differences in prices and even on that basis the low pay threshold in Ireland is the second highest, the highest being in Denmark whre an important consideration is the tax applied to the low paid.  Ireland, across the different types of household, has the lowest tax rates for those on low pay and EUROSTAT also looks at that factor.  It looks at tax rates on an annual basis, for those earning 67% of the average wage, as well as those on 100% of the average.  It looks at low earnings, at single income couples and low earning dual income couples.  In all household structures Ireland has one of the lowest net tax rates on gross pay, our gross pay threshold for those on low pay is higher and the amount of tax we impose is much lower.  </p><p> Net pay in Ireland is likely to be higher than in most other countries.  Denmark has the highest threshold, at over &euro;15, but on a single person without children on the average wage it will impose a tax rate of 38%.  In Ireland the equivalent tax rate would be approximately 21% or 22%.  While there is a gap in gross pay, in terms of net pay, the gap has been eliminated.  The gap between Ireland and Denmark is smallest in the case of a single person.  I am not cherry-picking these figures because on even lower wages the gap is much larger.  Tax is important because, while pay rates appear to be lower in Ireland, what the employee gets to take home may be higher because Ireland has an unusual tax system by international standards, in which we tax those on low pay very little and get to average levels when we get to those on higher incomes.</p><p> The final element of the microeconomic process that is useful is to combine pay, tax and transfers.  Looking at gross pay, less tax deducted, and transfers such as child benefit, for people who are at risk of poverty, namely, those below 60% of median disposable income, the rate for employees at risk of poverty in Ireland is one of the lowest in the European Union.  Some 3% of employees in Ireland live in households that are at risk of poverty.  The only country with a lower rate is Finland, at 2%; across the European Union the rates are higher in 13 of the EU15.  Therefore, while Ireland has one of the highest incidences of low pay, if one takes into account the higher rate, our lower tax rates and transfers we offer, the rate for employees at risk of poverty is one of the lowest in the European Union.</p><p> On the macroeconomic side of the national accounts, an important statistic is the wage or labour share, which represents the proportion of income going towards the compensation of employees.  It measures how much employees get of the value created in companies, how much goes to the Government in the form of product taxes and how much goes to companies in the form of profits, although the measure of profits is relatively broad.  In the matter of wage share, Ireland is right at the bottom of the table.  In the EU15 it is second from bottom, with only Greece having a lower wage share, at approximately 40%.  The profit share, the amount going to the gross operating surplus in Ireland, is the highest.</p></speech>

I call on Senator David Cullinane to begin the questions as rapporteur in the compilation of the report.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Coffey and Mr. Fielding and thank them for their contributions.  We are looking to produce a document on low pay, decent work and a living wage.  The starting point for all of us would be a fair economy offering decent pay and decent work.  We also want to have a sustainable economy.  I argue that a more sustainable economy is one which offers decent work and decent pay.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->A total of 20% of the workforce is on low pay, which means 400,000 workers experience poverty and deprivation while 11.7% of the workforce is at risk of poverty and 8.7% is in consistent poverty.  The ILCU tracker survey highlighted that almost 200,000 workers, or 11% of working adults, have no disposable income left at the end of the month with 480,000, or 27%, having less than &euro;50 left and another 730,000, or 41%, having less than &euro;100 left.  That means low pay, income equality and economic inequality are big problems across the economy.  How can they be addressed?  It is clear if one looks at the facts that the current model is not working.  We need a new model, which is about social solidarity and about everybody, including employers, having a responsibility.  I am taken aback by Mr. Fielding's contribution in which he seems to suggest that employers do not have a social responsibility and he referred to confusing the State's role in terms of social responsibility and an employer's role.</p><p> He said the minimum wage has not eradicated poverty.  Nobody would have argued that the minimum wage alone would eradicate poverty but what was missing from his contribution is the fact that the minimum wage has not increased since 2007.  The cost of living has increased with rents increasing to pre-crash levels but the minimum wage has not increased.  If it does not keep pace with inflation, it will not eradicate poverty.</p><p> The underlying problem is access to public services.  Child care, housing and health care are issues that hold people back in terms of in work poverty and so on.  Does Mr. Fielding believe that employers have a social responsibility?  Will he comment on the fact that Ireland has the third lowest taxation take in Europe and the lowest employer's PRSI take in Europe?   We are not taking in enough taxes to pay for public services.  If Mr. Fielding is putting it back on the State to take responsibility for and deal with poverty, deprivation and low pay and the problems low paid workers face, where will the money come from?  If we accept, given the facts, that the current model does not work, where will the revenue come from?  I did not hear an argument from him to increase taxation or employer's PRSI.  However, he argued against increasing the minimum wage.  He has not proposed an instrument to deal with these issues.  I am interested in what he and Mr. Connolly propose in this regard.</p><p> While Mr. Connolly's contribution was good and detailed, what practical measures need to be taken to deal with low pay and in work poverty?  Does he agree that housing, child care and health care are three critical areas requiring investment, which is necessary to lift people out of poverty?  What is his view on a living wage and the minimum wage?  What is view on the role of both business and the State in dealing with these issues?</p></speech>

If I pay what is the economic rate of pay to that person, taking that home, then that is what I am obliged to do.  There is confusion about redistributing wealth.  It is the Government's job to redistribute wealth; it is not my job.  It is not my job to pay above what I can afford to pay.  If I do then I will go out of business.  I have to compete in the open market so one cannot ask me to pay above the economic rate.</p> <p>  The consistent poverty rate is highest among the unemployed at 19.2% and is lowest for those at work at 1.9% which is a tenfold difference.  The whole thing is to get people back working; not charge more for the people who are lucky enough to be in work.  </p></speech>

One thing I would be wary of when looking at the people in work who are at risk of poverty is that more than half of them are self-employed.  The at risk of poverty rate for employees is relatively low and Ireland is second lowest in the EU.  Ireland has a high rate of almost 20% for those at risk of poverty among the self-employed which is where a lot of the low earnings exist.  The hourly pay rates are a bit incidental to the self-employed because they must earn money through their own productivity and through finding customers.  Low pay in the self-employed sector is probably far higher and is an issue that equally needs to be addressed.</p> <p>  In regard to where can Ireland get the money to pay for services that we wish to provide, we have one of the lower Government revenue rates in the EU.  There are two key differences between Ireland and the rest of the EU.  First, as I have already mentioned, is Ireland's relatively low rate of income tax on low to middle incomes.  Most EU countries would have a substantially higher rate.  Second, Ireland is right at the bottom in terms of employers' social insurance.  Most countries would use such insurance to have a far more extensive state run pension system than we have in Ireland.  One could consider the low rate as a form of deferred pay where people's employers pay into the system of social security.  Ireland is unusual due to having a flat rate social welfare pension system.  One needs a flat rate for the base but most countries would augment that funding with pay-related pensions.  I believe we can collect substantially more money from this sector and there is scope to raise social insurance contributions.  What most countries use social insurance for is to improve pension provision.  As we know, pension provision in Ireland is relatively low.  Our basic pension is &euro;230 a week.  For many people, if they are dependent on that sum, it can mean a substantial drop in income if they have not put aside money for a private pension.  This matter is something that can be addressed.</p> <p>  Let me turn to services such as housing, child care and health care.  Housing generates a lot of attention at the moment but many of the issues tend to arise at the margin.  I refer to the homeless and people who suffer rent increases.  By and large, housing and the standard of housing in Ireland would be some of the highest in the EU but clearly we have issues.</p> <p>  In regard to health care, an important aspect we can focus on is what is meant by "universal".  In Ireland, universal tends to mean free but most countries do not take the same approach.  They take universal to mean treating everybody the same.  Over the past number of weeks comparisons have been made between Ireland and France.  The French health care system has considerable merit but everybody pays for everything in that country.  The French system is massively subsidised but everyone makes a financial contribution.  Its subsidies come from a very progressive tax system which we have but we do not have universality in terms of treatment. </p> <p>  The key issue here is the minimum wage, social welfare and how to help people.  We should seek to help people.  One issue is to focus on what the Government can do and to reform our social welfare system.  We have a social welfare system that is very comprehensive but could be better.  We break up people into too many categories such as unemployment, disability, illness, lone parents and carers.  A more comprehensive system where everybody is treated the same would be far better.  If we are going to set a basic minimum benchmark for what we want people to have in this society then we should ensure we give it to everybody.</p></speech>

Does Senator Cullinane wish to ask a supplementary question?</p><p>Yes.  I thank Mr. Coffey for his comments.  I wish to return to the point made by Mr. Fielding about the responsibility of employers.  People want employers to pay decent wages.  We have, for example, some very large retail chains in this State that have been very profitable but do not pay their workers proper entitlements.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Dunnes Stores is one example where Mandate has embarked on a campaign on behalf of those workers on very low contract hours and low pay.  Mr. Fielding has, unfortunately, not dealt with the fact that 20% of the workforce are on low pay, which is the responsibility of the employers.  He has not dealt either with the fact that the minimum wage has not increased since 2007, yet the cost of living has gone up.  Employers have a responsibility to pay decent wages, especially when companies are profitable.  I would like Mr. Fielding to deal with that issue.  I have an interesting figure for him, too: the adjusted wage share of GDP in Ireland declined from 53.9% in 1996 to 50.2% in 2013.  Workers have seen an overall drop in their wages in terms of the adjusted wage share of GDP.  Employers do have a responsibility.</p><p> As an employer organisation, if ISME wants to put some of the responsibility for the redistribution of wealth back onto the State, it cannot have its cake and eat it, but it must be able to state from where that money will come.  It seems that Mr. Fielding is against wage and taxation increases, whether employer's PRSI, or tax on corporations or companies.  From where will the money come to redistribute wealth to deal with the issue of inequality, to which he refers but which he says the State must resolve?  He has to have some answers to these questions and accept that there are many employers who could pay better wages but who do not.  They are profitable companies and the State and decent employers subsidise them through welfare transfers.  It is bizarre for any employer organisation to stand over this.  I would be interested in Mr. Fielding&rsquo;s responses to these questions.</p></speech>

I represent small and medium businesses which are trying to get out of the recession they have been in for the past seven years and which to a man and woman are paying rates of pay they can afford.  In my presentation I said taking the ratio of the national minimum wage to price levels, the actual minimum wage rate would be &euro;7.42, not its current rate of &euro;8.65.</p> <p>  In answer to the question of from where we would get the money, every person coming off the dole results in a saving of &euro;20,000 and will be producing tax revenue, employer&rsquo;s PRSI and their own universal social charge, USC etc.  The Senator can see the figuresd.  We cannot keep on saying the employer has to take on the responsibility.  I am stuck on that point and that is the way it is.  It is not our job to take on the responsibility of the State to redistribute wealth.  That is not what we are there for; we are there to employ people, make money in order that we can employ more people and offer a decent living to everybody and watch our competitiveness in order that when we and sell our goods on the open market, we can actually compete. </p></speech>

I invite Mr. Coffey to comment.</p><p>I thank the Senator for bringing up the issue of the wage share.  There is no doubt that in Ireland the wage share is very low.  If we consider the value added created by companies in the business economy - taking away the financial sector in which there are problems and the sectors dominated by the public sector - health, education and defence - across the European Union the wage share is 60%.  In other words, 60% of the value of companies created across the European Union goes to workers.  In Ireland the rate is 42%.  Therefore, the wage share is very low.</p><p> In the case of Ireland, there are unusual features such as from where does the value come.  We have two economies.  Ireland is the only economy in the European Union in which foreign-owned companies create more value than domestically-owned companies.  The value added by the foreign-owned sector is larger than that added by the domestic sector.  Ireland is unique in that regard.  In the foreign-owned sector the wage share is 26%.  That is unusual; it is not seen anywhere else in the world.  Part of the reason is the type of sector in which these companies are involved, for example, pharmaceuticals, in which high value is added.  I imagine some of it is down to taxation, the location of profits and operating in a low tax environment.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Seamus Coffey:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The sector that creates the most value added is very low at 26%.  If one looks at Irish-owned companies, the wage share is 65%.  For domestically-owned companies, Ireland's wage share is above the EU average, which is 63%.  At an aggregate level, the wage in Ireland appears low but one should split it into the foreign-owned sector where the wage share is much lower.  The foreign-owned sector, paradoxically, is the high paying sector where more people have higher paying work.  If one takes the domestically-owned sector, the wage here is 65%, which is not the highest by any means but it is close to the EU average.  Looking at the labour share, or the wage share, we have the complication of Ireland having two separate economies.</p></speech>

He did not have it costed and is leaving that to the Low Pay Commission to do, but does he have any idea of a costing?  A small business would not make a proposal without costing it.  Are there any companies in which it works?</p> <p>  Mr. Fielding said the price of many items and essential expenditure - he cited car insurance, education and health insurance - have increased sharply in recent years.  He then referred to the input costs for industry in terms of diesel costs, electricity costs, etc., but they are also income costs for households for whom fuel costs and electricity costs are particularly high.  Is that not an argument for an increase in the minimum wage, because the input costs for employees have increased as well?</p> <p>  Mr. Coffey did the usual academic thing and gave us all the answers but did not give us a solution.  The presentation was excellent but will he come off the fence and say whether we need an increase in our national minimum wage?  We have had all this employment creation recently but pay levels seem to be staying flat.  Mr. Coffey spoke about wage share but when we look at the CSO figures on pay, they do not correlate with the employment creation.  Are all these new jobs being created at low wages?</p> <p>  Mr. Coffey said that we were slightly above the EU average for wholesale and retail, above the EU 15 average for accommodation and food service activities and at the EU average for the administration and support service activities.  They are the areas in which the minimum wage tends to be paid most.  Does that suggest that the figures back up Mr. Fielding's argument?  It probably goes back to my first question on Mr. Coffey's own opinion as an economist.</p> <p>  In regard to employers' PRSI, do not forget that employers' PRSI has been doubled.  The cost of employers' PRSI was doubled in 2013 and I have no doubt that had an impact on many job creation plans, in particular in those sectors to which Mr. Coffey referred.</p><p>In regard to those sectors in which the wage share is close to the EU average, I would note that they are aggregates.  One would have to look in a bit more detail at the numbers to see how it is actually distributed.  I highlighted those because I think they are the sectors with which low pay would tend to be traditionally associated.</p><p> In regard to a broader solution, the solution is to get the social welfare and the work systems more integrated.  Currently, they are disparate and one works in isolation from the other.  If one is working, one is dealing with the tax system and if one is not working, one is dealing, by and large, with the social welfare system.  They should be more integrated.  If we have benefits, they should be universal.  We should treat everybody in the same way.  That might require higher rates of tax but it would not necessarily mean people will be worse off.  If there is a basic minimum standard set out and it is paid to me, then I should be taxed more.  I should not be better off.  However, that would mean that nobody would ever be worse off by working.  One should  never lose anything by contributing to society.  A system where one has generous social welfare is laudable, and that is what we should have, but it should not be designed in such a way that people lose it when they start to contribute to society. </p><p> I would encourage more universality in transfers.  We could increase child benefit and maybe introduce something similar for adults.  One would not have people fighting for their own corner and all these separate groups looking for what they want.  If we have a social democracy and treat everybody in the same way, as happens in many countries, one would not get those divisions.  </p><p> I would not view the minimum wage as the key issue about how one lifts people out of poverty.  Work matters but the State should take a much stronger approach than it takes currently and offer more on the basis of social welfare.  People say our social welfare budget is high but relative to the EU, it is not.  Other countries spend far more in terms of cash transfers.  They collect it through higher tax and higher social insurance and I believe we can achieve something like that.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Seamus Coffey:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We have a divided society, a very progressive tax system and a very divided social welfare system in which one group is contributing and another is benefiting.  If we were all in this together, the system would work much better.</p></speech>

It has the capacity to do so.  I do not have figures for the Deputy.  Rather than beginning with the minimum wage and examining how we will increase it, something that has been put into the public domain, if it is to be empirically based, there may not be an increase in the minimum wage.  We could see it coming down to the level of &euro;7.42 per hour, which would equate with the consumer price index figure.</p> <p>  I agree with the Deputy on his point that people are personally being hit with costs similar to those with which businesses are being hit.  In a small business the labour content comes in at about 48% of added value, while in a large business it comes in at about 8%.  There is a sixfold difference between the two.  When there is a rise in the minium wage, it hits small businesses six times harder than it does a large business.  Most large businesses do not talk about the minimum wage because they operate at a level where they pay way above it.  I am not going to argue the toss with the Deputy over an increase in the minimum wage, rather I am saying we should not have a minimum wage, rather we should have a minimum income policy.  As I have said and will continue to say, it is the Government's job to redistribute wealth, not mine</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.278" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1023" speakername="John Lyons" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015022400002#O00300"><p>Both delegates but Mr. Fielding, in particular, might respond to the following comment.  The Low Pay Commission in the United Kingdom has for the 15th year recommended an increase in the minimum wage.  The other day it recommended a 20 pence increase, which the Confederation of British Industry, CBI, a body somewhat equivalent to the one represented here, broadly welcomed.  I recognise that the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, is not the same type of body, but it is a similar one and I am curious to know why a body in the United Kingdom that represents something similar would broadly welcome a recommended increase in the minimum wage, while Mr. Fielding, from what I believe I heard him say here, does not agree with the minimum wage and believes it should be up to the State to redistribute wealth.</p> <p>  I recognise that not all businesses are thriving and that many people that ISME represents are finding it difficult to make ends meet.  I do not believe any of us is talking about a business that cannot afford to pay anything more than what it is paying, but let us be realistic.  There are businesses that fall into the category represented by ISME, as well as businesses in the category that employs more than 250 employees that are reaping in profits.  I believe in the basic concept that if a business is profitable and workers help to make it profitable, there is nothing wrong with ensuring some of them share in that by receiving a dividend, perhaps in the form a better wage.  I am not talking about people on the median wage of &euro;19 per hour; I am only interested in this context in those who are on a wage of &euro;8.65 per hour.  It is my genuine belief that if the State did not have a minimum threshold, in many cases some workers in some of these categories would be paid less.  The State gets involved in redistributing wealth.  We co-share in the contribution to salaries.  Approximately &euro;300 million per year is paid to people who work full time through family income supplement.  On top of this, we recognise that some employers would like to take on additional staff but are not at the stage where they could fully pay to recruit an additional person.  That is the reason we have introduced initiatives such as the JobsPlus scheme.  Therefore, I do not believe it is only the State that is responsible for redistributing wealth.  Wealth is created in other sectors.  If a company in the category ISME represents is profitable, what is wrong with it paying its employees a little more?</p><p>I agree with the Deputy when a company can afford to pay.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Mark Fielding:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->I never said that they should not.  I am talking about the minimum wage here and about the redistribution of wealth.  </p><p> If a company is in profit then of course it should pay and of course there should be wage increases.  There is nobody here saying anything to the contrary.  The Deputy asked, in the context of a British representative body welcoming a 20 pence increase in the minimum wage in the UK, why we disagree with an increase.  Since the year 2000 IBEC has sold us down the Suwannee in the context of the minimum wage and wage increases.  We did not agree to what was happening at the time but we were not then part of social partnership, we were excluded.  That is one of the reasons we lost our competitiveness - by about 40% - over those years.  Big business did not give a monkey's about what small businesses were doing.  It is the prerogative of large business organisations to agree with something but the SME sector is struggling to get back on our feet after seven hard years.  We have so many businesses that are struggling.  I agree with the Deputy's point that once businesses are profitable, they should pay employees appropriately.  We all know that is wise.  We are still in business because we look after our staff when we can make the money to do so.  I am not saying that we will hoard all of the gains, of course not.</p><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as ucht an cur i l&aacute;thair suimi&uacute;il.  Bh&iacute; s&eacute; an-mhaith ar fad.  Everybody agrees that we have a problem with low wages in this State but how we actually resolve the problem is the issue.  We know that there is also a problem with underemployment.  We have one of the highest proportions of low-paid employees in the EU and OECD countries.  Has any research been conducted on the level of unemployment created by increases in the minimum wage?  In other words, in other jurisdictions, what is the typical correlation between a 50 cent increase in the minimum wage and unemployment levels?  My understanding is that while the minimum wage is important, there are many other tools that the Government can use to alleviate poverty.  Furthermore, while the minimum wage is important to an employer, in real terms and in the long run, it does not affect the level of employment or unemployment very much.  As a committee, we like to operate on the basis of evidence.  What evidence is available on those specific questions?</p><p> My understanding is that Ireland's income gradient is quite steep in comparison with other countries, where it is more level.  Would that be an accurate interpretation?   I take the point made earlier that to introduce GDP figures into anything in this country skews everything because there is such a large foreign element to the economy.  It seems to me that both witnesses are making the argument that the State should be involved in welfare transfers but to my mind, however, the State is subsidising people on low incomes, as well as employers, with such payments.  If the State took the &euro;300 million to which Deputy Lyons referred out of the equation, many of the people who work for very small businesses would simply not be able to work for them anymore and if employers wanted to employ them they would have to pay more them higher wages to make their efforts worthwhile.  </p><p> Reference was made to Denmark taking a bigger chunk of tax from people on low incomes.  Does that include taxes like USC, water charges, property tax and all of the other taxes that are charged in Ireland, many of which are not income dependent?   We are very conscious that most self-employed people - especially the newly-self-employed - are living hand-to-mouth and that from month to month they are not sure if they can pay themselves an income.  However, I am also conscious that some of the unemployment figures are skewed in terms of who is deemed to be self-employed.  A person could be deemed to be self-employed who only works for one hour per week in a self-employed capacity.  Would Mr. Coffey have any issues with regard to the precise nature of the self-employed figures?<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2304"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2304&amp;amp;pid=PeadarToibin&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> On ensuring businesses remain competitive, is it not necessary for society to focus on all of the other cost bases affecting them, rather than wages?  Wages should be the last place one looks at to guarantee cost competitiveness.  For example, physical infrastructure represents a big cost, as do upward-only rents, utility bills, insurance bills and legal bills.  All of these costs within the grasp of the State which, if tackled, would improve the cost competitiveness of business.  Rather than seek to target those on low pay, we should look at all of these other places first.</p></speech>

While there is an overall rate of 20% of PRSI, if one looks at the detail, we do not have 20% of people in a worse position than in other countries.  </p> <p>  In reply to Deputy Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's question on the minimum wage and employment, I say, "What a question for an introductory course in economics?"  It is a question addressed to all first year students and seems to have a standard answer in theory which is that while a minimum wage harms some people, that is, those who cannot find employment, it benefits those in employment whose pay it brings up.  One has winners and losers.  While that is the theory, we have no evidence that suggests one answer over the other is right.  Various studies show a very large employment effect of a minimum wage that will reduce the numbers, while others show very little employment effect.  If one looks at the evidence, it goes both ways.  One issue is how to obtain the data to check.  Studies have been conducted in various counties and the USA that border different states where minimum wage rates are higher and some find a substantial employment effect, in particular in low-pay sectors, including service sectors, food and retail.  However, other studies including different variables do not find any employment effect.  I cannot give a definitive answer as it depends on which study one wishes to choose.  One will hear people say there is a very strong employment effect, but I could equally find a study that indicates there is none.  It is very difficult to say what impact an increase in the minimum wage would have on employment.  In theory, economics suggests it has an effect, but we do not know in practice.</p> <p>  When it comes to the self-employed and the part-time employed, an important indicator the CSO collects is the number of people who are workng part-time and underemployed - those who are essentially forced into part-time work and would wish to work more.  Up to 2012, that figure had increased and was increasing substantially as people were on reduced hours and days.  Thankfully, we have seen that rate fall for the last two years since the start of 2012.  The number is down by approximately 35,000.  Whereas at the start of 2012, 195,000 people counted themselves as working part-time and underemployed, the figure is now down to approximately 160,000.  While it is moving in the right direction, we still have 160,000 people who would like to take on more work.</p> <p>  On the income gradient in Ireland, the distribution of income is unusual in comparison to that in other countries.  Our disposable income is in line with that in other countries, but our earned income is not.  If one takes the overall economy across everybody, Ireland has the most unequal distribution of earned income, but that is driven by the fact that we have so many who are earning nothing and not in the workforce.  Equally, even within the workforce, if one takes workers only, the distribution of income in Ireland is unusually high.  EUROSTAT has figures comparing the bottom decile with the top decile.  In Ireland the median gap is approximately four, whereas the standard across the European Union is approximately three.  If one takes a figure of &euro;20,000 at the bottom, one is looking at a figure of &euro;80,000 at the top.  In other countries, the gap is not as wide.  Our tax system may have a role to play in that regard.  While they have lower incomes in Ireland, we tax less at the bottom and the gap in net terms is reduced.  That is what the system does.  There is no doubt, however, that the income gradient for earned income in Ireland is unusual.</p> <p>  In relation to the subsidy, one could argue that the figure of &euro;300 million is a subsidy to employers.  However, one could also argue that we have a &euro;4 billion subsidy to deal with unemployment.  I have no problem with the Government spending money.  If people do not have the ability to earn or are not earning, it should provide it.  The issue in Ireland is that there are so many schemes to get money to households that it becomes overly complex and people view the money as going to different areas.  A broader, more universal approach would clean up many of the problems we have.</p><p>Deputy Peader T&oacute;ib&iacute;n said that if the Government pulled back and did not pay what might be called subsidies to employers, employers would have to pay more.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Mark Fielding:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not a game that once the subsidies are taken away the employers would pay more.  If the employers cannot pay more they go out of business, as we have seen in the past number of years.</p><p> In response to the question on the minimum wage rising and the unemployment level going up or down, it is all about perception.  Deputy Calleary mentioned the increase in PRSI last year from 4.25% to 8.5%.  That put a stop to new employment.  The word on the street is that the minimum wage could increase by a euro, and that is putting a stop to people taking on staff.  It is about the perception.  As Mr. Coffey states, one can prove different things from the different statistics.  At present, employers are worried and are saying that they do not know if they will take on an additional two or three people.  The members of ISME are not talking about taking on hundreds but twos and threes in small shops and factories around the country.  People are saying they will hold off to see what will happen.  That is the present difficulty.</p></speech>

There is a two-tier economy, comprising of small and medium businesses on the one hand and capital intensive industries on the other hand.  The young people working in Google, Facebook and Paypal are doing very well.  The capital intensive industries do not create employment.  Their <i>modus operandi </i>is to be as capital intensive as possible.  The multinational companies pay the highest wages and this puts pressure on small and medium Irish companies.  I do not have a problem with the minimum wage but with the knock-on effect an increase in the minimum wage will have on others, who will feel that if a new person is getting this much money they should get more, and more in the following years.  People seem to be oblivious to the tension this creates among employees.  I fully agree with the concept of the minimum wage in spirit but in many cases the reality is that it impedes companies taking on staff.  One has to face up to that Senator Cullinane.</p></speech>

There is a perception that people in business are making a fortune, they are making money by doing something irregular, or breaking the law.  There needs to be an honest debate on business.</p><p> There are 250,000 people who are unemployed, with 1,600 emigrating every week.  What is important is how we deal with that issue and how we get people back into employment.  As I have said on numerous occasions, a job gives people much more than money, it gives them a place to go every day, where they will mix and socialise.  It transforms their lives.  Nearly half of the 250,000 people who are unemployed have been unemployed in the long term.  That is a terrifying situation.  It is a bigger issue than how it is being addressed, where there is perception that those who have been unemployed in the longer term are playing the system.  I do not believe that. </p><p> Those in business want to grow their business.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Mary M.

What is the case beyond Europe?  I note in the United States of America, 15 states have brought in a living wage.  Does a perspective from the US throw any light on how we go about this issue?  Can we learn from other countries and other economies outside of Europe?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.291" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Coffey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015022400002#S00300"><p>Some US states have adopted a minimum wage but, by and large, it tends to be a voluntary code.  It is established what is a living wage which is then put into legislation.  It has a slightly different standing to a minimum wage.  There is no legislative authority for companies to pay it.  Although many companies sign up voluntarily, I would imagine most of them are where the pay rates already exceed the living wage.  In the state of Washington, particularly in the city of Seattle, we will get an experiment as to whether the living wage actually becomes the statutory minimum.  It will set up a small area within the state where it will require all companies to pay.  Again, this will give us the data to see if it does have an employment effect.  However, as it has only happened in the past eight months, it will take some time to feed through to see the impact.</p> <p>  In the US, the living wage has much traction but does not quite have the traction to become the minimum wage.  It has become a voluntary code up to which employers can sign.  One issue with the living wage is that individual circumstances differ.  Comparing a living wage for a student who just wants ten to 15 hours of part-time work to someone trying to run a household is not entirely appropriate.</p> <p>  We use the EU as a benchmark because our economies are similar.  There are not substantial differences in our tax and transfer systems.  Over the next 12 to 18 months, we will see the living wage still have an impact.  I do not believe the voluntary code will have much of an impact but if we follow what is happening in Seattle we may learn something.</p><p>It has been a pleasure to listen to the delegations.  I have travelled around the country a lot over the past couple of years, visiting shops and other small traders.  I have mainly met members of ISME, the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association.  They are in a very competitive market.  Of the shops that I visited, several have gone out of business.  Other shops are concerned whether they will stay alive while others have succeeded very well.  In general terms, those who succeeded very well are not now paying the minimum wage.  They did start by taking somebody on the minimum wage.  However, if they were going to hold onto that successful employee, they had to pay them more, otherwise they would lose them to somebody else.  This belief in a competitive market is successful.  It works very well and means people are automatically lifted up if their business succeeds.  If the business does not succeed, they go out of business.</p><p> Many people cannot figure out how Members in Leinster House can say we should do this when they have never created a job or never actually borrowed money to start a business.  They get frustrated and feel we should be discussing upward-only rent clauses, for example.  We need to help businesses, survive, thrive and succeed.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Feargal Quinn:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=1972"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator Feargal Quinn"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=1972&amp;amp;pid=FergalQuinn&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator Feargal Quinn"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->This would help to ensure that those who are brave enough to borrow the money to start a business and employ somebody, even at a low rate, will know they will have to pay staff more if they are to keep them.  If they do not pay them more, if they do not keep them, and if they do not succeed, they will go out of business and everybody loses.  Our task is to ensure that businesses are given an open playing field to succeed and to leave it up to those who are going to work very hard to succeed.  The objective of every business is to survive the coming year.  A significant number of companies believe they are not going to survive unless they get a free hand.</p></speech>

Those who decide to set up their own businesses are the real risk-takers in society.  We do not have a safety net for them, which makes it difficult.  We must look at an overall package.  As Mr. Fielding has said clearly, it is not just about wages.  The well-being and happiness of a society is also about the number of people working.</p> <p>  In the UK there is a tiered minimum wage system.  Currently the rate in the UK is &pound;6.50 and it drops down based on one's age.  What would be the view of the witnesses on introducing that system here?  It is appropriate across the UK, in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.</p></speech>

It is clear that the incidence of low pay is much higher for younger people and it declines as people get older.  The rates in Ireland are relatively high across the age profile, but they do decline.  For those under 30, the incidence of low pay is around 40%, yet it is down to 20% for those between 30 and 39.  Perhaps those are relatively high rates, but it does decline.</p> <p>  I would not quite say that we do not have a safety net for the self-employed.  They are not entitled to unemployment benefit, but one cannot get insurance against a risk one can trigger oneself, so we are not particularly unusual in that regard.  There is a certain safety net in that everybody is entitled to unemployment assistance.  It is means-tested, so that if somebody has the means, they will not get the money, but the safety net is there.  The issue is that if there is a basic benchmark for everybody, we can reduce some of these anomalies.</p> <p>  The issue of low pay in the self-employed sector deserves more scrutiny.  The focus here is on pay for employees but there are significant difficulties in the self-employed sector, whether it is, as Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n referred to, people classifying themselves as self-employed despite not working very much at all, or the difference in the tax treatment of employees and the self-employed, in that an employee gets the employee tax credit, but there is no self-employed tax credit.  The reason for that might be high-earning self-employed people, who can use expenses to reduce their overall tax liability.  A self-employed person earning very little has no tax liability to offset against.  This is something worth considering at the bottom of the pay distribution for the self-employed.  The broad point I am making is that we should have a more universal safety net, rather than one that targets individual groups.</p><p>Senator Quinn is correct.  One pays the minimum wage when starting out.  One sees how employees are getting on and then if one wants to retain staff, the minimum wage is just a starting point.  I also agree that we should be looking at other costs, rather than just wages.  It is a definite issue.  Of course upward-only rent reviews come to mind.  To be fair to small and medium business owners, when things got rough in other countries, when businesses were pulling back on costs, staff were let go first.  In Ireland, we held on to our staff.  We reduced their hours but we held on to our staff and we did not reduce their rates.  Now we are running into difficulty because as we come out of the recession, we still have the rate of pay set in 2006-07 as we bring people back into the workplace full-time, working 37.5 or 40 hours a week.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Mark Fielding:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is not all doom and gloom in terms of bad employers and so on.  </p><p> On the tiered minimum wage system, we already have a system where, when younger people come into the workplace, they are paid a percentage.</p></speech>

I am an economist and the senior research officer at the Nevin Economic Research Institute.  I am also a member of the Living Wage Technical Group, formed last year to establish a robust, transparent and sustainable methodology for calculating a living wage for the Republic of Ireland &ndash; a point I will return to later.</p><p> I also welcome the attention the committee is giving to the topic of low pay and the living wage.  In the context of its examination and our discussion this afternoon, I think the following pieces of data are informative.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In 2012, EUROSTAT published its analysis of the 2010 EU-wide labour force survey.  It classified 20.7% of workers, or one in five, in Ireland as low paid, meaning that they earned below a low pay threshold of &euro;12.20 per hour, a figure equivalent to two thirds of national median hourly earnings.  EUROSTAT also found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that low pay was more common among women, those with low education levels and workers on fixed duration contracts.<br/><br/>The latest CSO poverty figures for 2013, which were published in January of this year, indicate that, of all those in poverty, 11.7% are working.  They are in the group known as the working poor, representing approximately 85,000 workers.  The latest quarterly national household survey data show that there are almost 125,000 workers underemployed, that is, working part time but not for as many hours as they would wish.  This phenomenon is bound to have a negative impact on their incomes.<br/><br/>The distribution of direct income in Ireland, namely, earnings from all sources, is heavily skewed.  The latest data, which is also for 2013 and published by the CSO in January of this year, show that the pre-distribution of income is such that the top two deciles - the top two 10% groups - receive more than 50% of all direct income and the top three deciles receive more than 67%.  The top 20% receive 25 times the share of the bottom 20%.  The scale of this inequality continues to place large pressures on the redistributive system, particularly the social welfare system, to even out the income distribution.  It does this well, but at an ever increasing cost to the State.  The latest Department of Social Protection annual report shows that, in 2013, the number of working families in receipt of family income supplement, FIS, increased by almost 30% to 42,000 low-income families, supporting more than 90,000 children.<br/><br/>In the context of figures such as these for Ireland and other countries, attention has turned in recent years to the adequacy of earnings, in particular the adequacy of low pay rates.  The attention given to this issue underscores a growing appreciation for society to consider low wage rates, not just in the context of competitiveness and competition, but also in the context of income adequacy and living standards.  In effect, it reflects a belief that, across societies, individuals working full time should be able to earn enough income to enjoy a decent standard of living.<br/><br/>The living wage technical group was set up a year ago with an objective of establishing a transparent, robust and sustainable way of determining a living wage.  The group's members included the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, Social Justice Ireland, TASC, Unite the Union and SIPTU.  Over a period of four to five months, the group met and developed a methodology, based on the available data for Ireland and the precedents and lessons in the international research literature, and published it alongside a 2014 value for a living wage last July.  The documents are available on the living wage website, <i>www.livingwage.ie</i>.  I have appended a document to my presentation that provides more details.<br/><br/>The living wage figure established for 2014 was &euro;11.45 per hour.  This figure is the average gross salary that will enable full-time employed adults, without dependants, across Ireland to afford a socially acceptable standard of living.  That standard of living covers spending across 17 categories of expenditure and up to 2,000 goods and services and takes into account the structure of the taxation and social protection systems.  The calculations, which draw on the minimum essential standards of living analysis of the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, were completed for the country as a whole, with expenditure figures calculated for Dublin, other cities, towns with populations of more than 5,000 people and the rest of Ireland, including small towns and rural Ireland.  The results from this analysis were brought together to establish the national figure.  The group plans to update the living wage figure on an annual basis, with the next update to be during this summer.<br/><br/>In a research paper published at NERI last year, I detailed some of the impacts and challenges that the establishment and introduction of a living wage would have.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The committee may be interested in examining that paper because it provides a lot of detail.</p><p> The impact on the individuals and employees in terms of income gains and consequent improvements in living standards for them and their families should not be underestimated.  For example, a &euro;1 per hour increase in the pay of a full-time low waged worker is equivalent to a gross income gain of &euro;2,033 per year, which is a multiple of any possible budgetary change to social protection or taxation levels.  While there are also impacts on employers, whose wage bills will increase, the research literature shows the impacts have limited consequence in sectors such as finance, banking and construction where there few earners below the living wage threshold and thus any increase in costs is small.  In sectors with a greater proportion of low paid employees, such as retail, food production, bars and restaurants, the wage bill impact is likely to be more pronounced and it would be sensible to phase in any move to a living wage in these sectors.  The research literature also indicates impacts for employers in terms of cost savings and gains from increases in staff retention, reduced absenteeism and improvements in productivity and efficiency.  While these may not fully offset the increased wage costs in the high labour sectors, the literature indicates that they would make a significant contribution towards reducing these costs.  There are also impacts on the State, which gains through increased taxation, particularly indirect taxation, reductions in social protection expenditure and increases in both employers' and employees' social insurance contributions.</p><p> The implementation of a living wage is likely to be a gradual and voluntary process.  In sectors such as finance, where only small numbers of employees are below the threshold, achieving increases should be possible and the international research shows little or no impact on companies.  There is no reason why, for example, the IFSC could not become a living wage zone.  There are greater challenges in labour intensive low-pay sectors, such as retail and accommodation, and a phased approach to achieving a living wage is more feasible for these sectors.  Similarly, local authorities, like in other countries, should take a leadership role and ensure their employees and contracted workers are all paid at least the living wage.  The experience elsewhere shows that the idea of a living wage evolves from being considered impossible to being viewed as of benefit to society, although that transition and its acceptance by employers, workers and society in general can take time.</p><p>I am grateful for the invitation to address the committee on the issue of low pay and the concept of the living wage.  I will outline IBEC's position on the national minimum wage in the first instance and will then ask my colleague, Mr. Fergal O'Brien, to address the economic background to these matters.  The important element of the issue of the national minimum wage is that it needs to reflect the economic circumstances that obtain at any time.  IBEC supports the principle of a national minimum wage but believes it is vital that the wage be appropriate, competitive and affordable, taking into account at all times the cost of living in the economy.  An inappropriately large national minimum wage or any excessive increases to it can potentially damage employment growth prospects, business investment and, ultimately for many small firms, ongoing viability.</p><p> The data on the national minimum wage are incomplete but CSO statistics suggest that the number of those currently engaged in the national minium wage is not significantly different from the pre-crisis level.  The estimated figure for 2007 was 4.9%, compared to the current estimate of 4.7%.  This suggests we are not seeing a significant change in the demographic profile of people employed on the minimum wage.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Ms Maeve McElwee:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The Low Pay Commission's review of the national minimum wage must be evidence based.  It should take into account a number of factors including labour market conditions, international comparisons and competitiveness, sectoral and regional affordability and cost of living trends.</p><p>I thank the committee for the invitation.  I will elaborate on the economic criteria that should be considered when making a decision on future changes to the national minimum wage.  The first criteria is labour market conditions.  While the labour market is in a much better place than during the depths of the crisis, and nearly 100,000 jobs have returned to the Irish economy over the past two years, we still have a very long way to go.  While the unemployment rate might dip below 9% this year and we are making good progress, many low-skilled and young jobseekers are still having difficulty returning to the workplace.  They are the jobseekers who would be most affected by any inappropriate change to the national minimum wage.  Labour market conditions are still very fragile and this must be factored into any decision.<br/><br/>Ireland has a high minimum wage by international standards and compared with the countries with which we compete, despite the fact that we have not had an increase during the crisis years.  Our statutory minimum wage is the 5th highest in the EU, and 4th highest when Luxembourg is excluded.  The UK comparison is crucially important.  When the economic crisis hit us, food processing, tourism and manufacturing was very heavily impacted by competition from the UK and Ireland's lack of competitiveness <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the UK.  At today's exchange rate, the UK minimum wage rate is probably a little higher than ours, whereas at last year's exchange rates, Ireland's minimum wage was 10% higher.  While the Low Pay Commission has acknowledged the importance of exchange rates, it is very important that whatever decision we make about the national minimum wage leaves room for inevitable future exchange rate volatility and that we do not leave ourselves exposed on the competitiveness front, particularly from the UK, by failing to leave room for these inevitable exchange rate fluctuations.<br/><br/>Even when we use cost of living benchmarks such as purchasing power parity, PPP, our minimum wage is still high, the 6th highest in the EU.  Another important benchmark is to examine it against median earnings in the economy.  By this measure, our minimum wage is almost half the median wage, while in the US it is approximately one third.  We have a relatively high minimum wage.<br/><br/>It is important that sectoral and regional affordability are taken into account in any decision.  In terms of regional issues, it will have to be a one-size-fits-all rate and cannot be benchmarked against the cost of living in Dublin.  Previously, our members in the regions, particularly those with weaker economic performance such as the north west, have definitely suffered the most from a business perspective as a result of the increase in the minimum wage.  A competitive cost base is very different in Dublin from the regions.  A useful indicator is the minimum wage as a percentage of median earnings in the regions.  While our data is incomplete, the evidence we have examined suggests that while the national average is below 50% in the north west, the minimum wage is as high as 60% of median earnings.  A minimum wage increase will hurt business and employment in Donegal much more than in Dublin, and this must be taken into account.<br/><br/>Just three sectors of the economy - hospitality, retail and wholesale and other services - account for more than half of all minimum wage workers.  We must be realistic about the fact that while the economy is recovering the level of output and turnover in many businesses is well below the crisis peak.  In retail for example, turnover is still 15% below the pre-crisis peak.  Many businesses in the sector are still impacted by legacy costs, and, for many of them, labour is still a legacy cost because the majority of businesses did not cut pay rates during the recession.<br/><br/>The final criterion I would like to comment on is cost of living.  It is appropriate that the minimum wage be increased in line with cost of living so its real value is maintained over time.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Fergal O'Brien:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->In Ireland we have done this very effectively since the introduction of the minimum wage.  The minimum wage buys one 20% more than it did when it was introduced in 2000.  I believe much of the reason there is concern about low pay and a strong debate on a living wage - a disconnected topic that is somewhat relevant to this discussion - is that in other countries the statutory minimum wage has not kept pace with the cost of living.  In the United Kingdom, for example, its real value is less than this benchmark, while in the United States, it is considerably less, at approximately 30% lower.  In the United States the minimum wage now buys one 30% less of a shopping basket than it did in 2000.  This is crucially important as in Ireland it buys one 20% more and the fundamentals are very different.  When one considers the rate of inflation across the economy, business is not able to pass on higher prices.  If there is an increase in wage costs, the vast majority of businesses will not be able to recover it in the form of higher prices.  There is no inflation in the economy and our cost of living is still below where it was in 2008.  As the price of some items has risen, the price of many others has fallen and the overall shopping basket cost is below where it was in 2008.  There is no cost of living justification for wage increases across the economy or, specifically, a minimum wage increase.</p><p>I thank Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins, Mr. Fergal O'Brien and Ms Maeve McElwee for their presentations which will be helpful in drafting the document that will consider low pay, in-work poverty and a living wage.  There is a mountain of data showing there is a problem with low pay and deprivation and poverty among people who are working; not people who are unemployed.  Dr. Collins provided the joint committee with some of the figures, as did Mr. Seamus Coffey earlier.  I note that 20% of the workforce are on low pay and that 400,000 suffer from poverty and deprivation.  Moreover, 11.7% of people who are working are in poverty, while 8.7% of those who are working are in consistent poverty.  These obviously are real figures; there are people behind them and they are of real concern to members as, I hope, everyone present wishes to see a fair and decent economy with decent wages and so on.  That should be one's starting point.  I argue that the current model is not working because we have such high levels of in-work poverty and low pay.  Therefore, one must investigate what the problems are, acknowledge that there are problems and then consider what the solutions are.  Dr. Collins has made reasonable, realistic and deliverable proposals on a living wage.  The joint committee must consider them and I agree with Dr. Collins's analysis that a living wage is not something that will happen overnight.  It will be gradual and happen over time.</p><p> As for the contributions made by Mr. O'Brien and Ms McElwee, can they back up some of their assertions with data?  The IBEC briefing notes state the living wage "comes with a fiscal cost as it will hurt employment".  On what data, research and evidence is this assertion based?  The joint committee has also heard from the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, that an increase in the minimum wage or an increase in wages would hurt our competitiveness.  However, countries such as Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium and Austria have much higher personal taxes, higher corporate taxes, higher wages, higher employers' PRSI and better labour protections.  They all have much better workers' rights and much better wage levels and are much more competitive.  This came from the global competitiveness report, a survey of business, which showed that if one builded a model and a more sustainable economy on decent work, decent pay and decent workers' rights, it would be more sustainable for everybody.  </p><p> The delegateses from IBEC made an interesting point which was also made by Dr. Collins and with which I agree, namely, that wage levels and increases are one way to lift people out of poverty.  Obviously, the concept of a living wage is aimed at doing some of this, but I refer to Government policy on public services.  The delegates quite rightly mentioned housing supply and child care costs as two critical issues, to which I would add health care.  From where would the increased revenue come to pay for the investment in these services?  While I am open to correction, I do not believe IBEC is calling for increased taxes across the economy.  From where will the increased revenue come to pay for these services?  If one does not argue for wage increases, especially for those who need them and if one states more money will be necessary to solve the housing supply problem and resolve child care issues, one must then ask from where will the money come.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> We say more money is necessary to pay for the housing problem, for housing supply and child care.  We must argue about where the money will come from.  Does Mr. O'Brien have a position on rent controls, which is one proposition put forward?  I am interested to hear the IBEC position on this.  What data will IBEC use to back up the assertion that it would be bad for the economy?  I argue that more competitive countries and those with more sustainable economies pay better wages, have better working conditions and have higher taxes on corporations and wealth.</p><p>On the overall measurement of competitiveness of the economy and how Ireland compares with other high income and high cost economies, when doing international comparisons it is crucial to compare Ireland to countries we are competing with on a day-to-day basis.  Our most significant competitor for a range of business activity is the UK.  We must be pragmatic when we look at comparisons, whether with respect to inward investment, small businesses trying to sell into the UK market as the first port of call for exports, or imports coming into the country, the majority of which will be coming from the UK.  Prior to the crisis, the cost of doing business in Ireland got out of kilter, particularly with the UK and a number of other countries.  We need to keep the UK strongly in focus in terms of competitiveness arguments.  Comparing ourselves to Nordic countries, which have completely different social models, is not a relevant comparison in terms of its impact on business.</p><p> The impact of competitiveness on jobs was somewhat lost in the run-up to the crisis years because so much happened at one time.  We had banking and construction crises, an exchange range crisis that added to the competitiveness crisis and, in the run-up to 2007, we were adding jobs in construction but losing jobs in manufacturing.  One of the reasons we lost all of the manufacturing jobs between 2001 and 2007 was because our cost base was out of line against the UK.  We cannot forget that.</p><p> In terms of the comments we have not made, when the crisis hit and the decision was made to reduce the minimum wage in 2008, IBEC did not support the reduction.  We felt the minimum wage was an important component of the cost of doing business and competitiveness but we did not support its reduction.  We need a competitive minimum wage.</p><p> In terms of the concept of a living wage, public expenditure, housing and education in particular, from the business perspective we want to see high-quality jobs in the economy.  We want to see more ambitious investment in education and skills development to help people to upskill and gain higher quality employment after entering the workforce.  The argument about the living wage is that it is crucial business is not asked to compensate for the high costs emerging in our economy, including housing, rent and health care.  That will lead to a spiral of loss of competitiveness and jobs and it will damage economic recovery.</p><p> It is the Government's responsibility to make sure it has the proper policy to deliver affordable housing and the supply of housing the economy needs.  In terms of how that will be funded, the Senator is correct that we do not favour higher tax rates but we do favour more tax revenue.  We can have more tax revenue by supporting activity through a competitive cost base but not by having higher tax rates.  This is one of the things we saw in the 1990s and early 2000s.  We like to put a lot of it down to a property bubble but there was a solid economy that grew strongly on the back of competitive tax rates.  We can do so again in terms of growing a revenue base without higher tax rates.  Crucially, the Government must lead policy in terms of investment in housing.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Fergal O'Brien:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The private sector will support it and there are lots of options for it to support investment in housing.  There is a lot of money available in the markets.  Workers are looking for jobs and those with money are looking for investment vehicles, but Government policy must lead, as we cannot expect business to bear the cost of policy failures in the housing sector that will cost further jobs in the economy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.312" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015022400002#AA00200"><p>I will pick up on two of the Senator&rsquo;s points.  There is an issue surrounding the sustainability of the State&rsquo;s involvement in dealing with the scale of income inequality or low wages.  We can see this in the significant growth in family income supplement over time.  There is a great deal of merit in having family income supplement as a transitory payment for workers who need assistance, but as it moves to becoming a permanent feature of the labour market, it is a concern.  The numbers have been going up over time.</p> <p>  The overall effort the social protection system is making is very significant.  There were several reports last week of Ireland being at European levels of income fairness or inequality.  This is principally delivered by the State in redistributing.  There is, however, a great fear that it will be difficult for it to sustain this task in the future.  That brings us back to the fact that while we need a good social protection system and good public services, we need a more adequate base of direct income and earnings.</p> <p>  There is merit in joining the dots between the provision of public services and pay requirements.  If there is poor provision for public services, more people will have to spend money and, therefore, have to earn more.  Figures for items such as the living wage would be higher.  The living wage figure I mentioned could fall if there were better public services because people would not need as much money to maintain a particular standard of living.</p> <p>  When the living wage technical group was working through the data last year, as well as reporting a living wage figure, we stated we would show a family living cost because individuals and couples with children faced such significantly higher costs.  There were dramatic costs, fundamentally linked with differences in child care costs and the different costs incurred by children.  Child care costs were significant.  We felt it was completely unfair to ask employers to carry the cost because of the fact that there were deficiencies in the public sector and public service provision.  We should, therefore, be thinking about these, too.</p><p>Dr. Collins&rsquo;s points about the sustainability of the State subsidising low pay and about in work poverty came up in our last discussion.  I would also like to hear Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s and Ms McElwee&rsquo;s opinions on this matter.  Most employers attempt to pay decent wages, but there are some big multiples in the retail sector which do not.  They are profitable companies that do not pay decent wages.  The State, through family income supplement and other measures, is subsidising these companies, which hurts everybody.  What is IBEC&rsquo;s position on that issue?</p><p> We need to increase tax revenue because we have the third lowest tax take in Europe.  As long as that is the case, there will be underlying inequality in society because we do not have the revenue to invest in the public services we need.  How do we raise that tax revenue?  We have to be specific in how we do it.  We cannot just say it will come from economic growth.  This is a global issue which came up for the first time at Davos at the World Economic Forum which discussed the growing gap between restrained wages and the income of the majority, on the one hand, and the massively expanding wealth at the top, on the other.  It is a big global problem.  What proposals would the delegates put forward to deal with these inequalities?<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator David Cullinane:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=2357"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2357&amp;amp;pid=DavidCullinane&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator David Cullinane"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->How do we get to the root of the problems affecting many workers?  In a sense, if we are to look at how we deal with them, we must put ourselves in the shoes of those workers on low pay and look at what supports they need.  There is a weakness in the response in terms of the specifics of how we would do some of this work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.315" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal O'Brien" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015022400002#BB00200"><p>On the tax issue, what we are about in the economy is broadening the tax base.  It makes economic sense to do this and that we are shifting our reliance away from work because the taxes on work in the economy are very high, in particular the taxes on highly skilled work.  We hear this all of the time from employers when they look at the cost of a highly skilled job in Ireland versus that in other jurisdictions.  We have a high marginal tax rate and a high effective tax rate for highly skilled employees, which is a big challenge.  In growing the economy, we need to broaden the tax base and get more people back to work.  That would give us the tax revenue we need for improved public services.  </p> <p>  On the inequality issue, Dr. Collins has said Ireland has a redistributive tax and social welfare system.  We actually have the single most redistributive tax and social welfare system in the world, bar none.  We raise a lot of tax revenue which we redistribute in terms of a strong social protection system.  We do this more effectively than any other country.</p> <p>  When one looks at pre-tax and pre-social welfare levels, the question is why we have this inequality which is an outlier at a pre-tax and a pre-social welfare level.  The single main reason we can see is that there are so many homes in which no one is working.  That is the real issue in terms of inequality in society.  We have the highest rate in Europe for jobless households and had the second highest rate before the crisis hit, even when there was a full employment rate.  We have not really grasped that policy challenge.</p> <p>  Investment in education, skills and appropriate reform of the tax and social welfare system which would help to get people back into work is the priority because the number of homes in which no one is working is the real cause of inequality in society.</p> <p>  Ms McElwee will respond to the question on pay.</p><p>On the concept of the living wage and how it would be applied in areas in which we typically look at the issue of low pay, there are many definitions.  It is not a new concept, but it is very much a current topic for discussion.  Internationally, there has been no ability to define exactly what a living wage should be.  Looking at the work to which Dr. Collins referred, the technical group is still looking at 28 versions of a living wage, depending on the construct of the family and the location in which somebody is living.</p><p> There is the idea that the living wage could fall once it had been implemented, but that is not really a practical assessment because, in reality, no employer would be in a position to reduce a wage once the concept had been implemented.  The idea of the living wage does not address the reality in the labour market.  The family wage which has been constructed on there being mostly a sole male breadwinner does not recognise the position of women in the labour market and the flexibilities required by different cohorts in the labour market, nor does it deal adequately with dependants within the family.  When we look at how we would implement something along the lines of the living wage and making it reasonable and decent, it is entirely impractical for employers to be able to manage this.  They pay wages which are competitive and sustainable for their businesses.  As we have seen, over the course of 2014 and into this year, more employers are predicting pay increases where they are affordable.  This leads to greater productivity and competitiveness because employers and employees together drive competitiveness to achieve these wage increases.  When we look at some of the sectors that are typically seen to be low pay, we look at the retail sector and talk about some big retailers which do not pay well and do not pay decent wages.  However, if one looks at the data, most of the big retailers do not have anybody working at the national minimum wage rate.  </p><p> When we talk about those on low pay having difficulties in achieving greater pay rate, we are back to the areas about which Mr. O'Brien spoke.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Ms Maeve McElwee:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->We are looking at Donegal in terms of small employers challenged with work crossing the Border, for example, retailers and hoteliers who constantly have a price pressure between where they are operating in a very small environment and the competitive rate they face just across the Border.  </p><p> The issue of introducing a living wage is a voluntary concept.  It still has its own problems and would bring into play its own workplace relations issues, but it does not resolve the issue of low pay because, in effect, employers who can afford to pay it will do so without it necessarily needing to be guided one way or the other.  Those who cannot afford to do so will still have to fall back to what is a commercially sustainable rate of pay for the business they are in.</p></speech>

It is clear that what we are collecting currently is not sustainable, and we are still borrowing.  As growth  continues there will be some recovery in that.  We can expect that but if we look at the projections the Government has set out in its budgetary documents some months ago into the years to come, they are questionable in terms of the costs the economy is likely to face and the feasibility of what are declining overall levels of taxation revenues proportional to national income.  That does not make sense regardless of the way one looks at it.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Brien mentioned that we have the most redistributive tax and social welfare systems in the world.  I am not sure if we do.  I suspect we are very close to it if we do not, but the reason for that is because the starting position is so bad.  It is because we have such an inequity in terms of starting distributions of earnings and because the State has to step in through the tax system and, most principally, through a social protection system to even it out.  That is why I said earlier that the State does a very good job at doing that, but we forget the fact that it is the starting position that is so problematic.  One of the solutions to adequate levels of income, therefore, is that we end up looking at adequate levels of pay to be the base for that.</p> <p>  I will make some brief points on the living wage, picking up on some of the other comments.  I wish to clarify that it is one figure that is being set out, not 20 or anything like that, and it is for the country as a whole.  There is a very clear technical document laying out the calculation of it for the Republic of Ireland.  It does work in other countries.  It is fairly well established in London, for example, and outside London in the United Kingdom, as there are successful living wage schemes in other parts of the world, including in the United States, Canada, New Zealand and so on.  Employers make that work, and they make a link to the fact that this is about saying that if an individual is working full-time, they should be earning sufficient to be able to afford a decent standard of living.  That is what the living wage is intended to do.  That is not to say it is the answer to all our problems or that all our problems will disappear, but the significant contribution it makes is that it provides an annually updated benchmark, which will tell us the level of income employees need to be earning for them to be able to afford a decent standard of living.  When they are below that, they are clearly cutting back and when they are above that, they have some discretion in terms of their spending.</p><p>I thank the two presenters.  I will make two points.  First, I am slightly concerned that Dr. Collins's method of calculating a living wage seems to exclude the role of the State in terms of either taxation or transfer in that it appears to place it all on the shoulders of the employer.  In the context of what  Mr. Seamus Coffey had to say to us before the representatives came in - I do not know if they were here for it - the EUROSTAT figures show that the wage share in Ireland is only slightly below the EU average for the wholesale and retail trades, for accommodation and food service activities and for administrative support service activities, which are areas, I assume, in which one would be assisted by a living wage, so we are not necessarily way off the EU average in terms of it.</p><p> Second, Dr. Collins also raised the idea that local authorities should pay the living wage as a type of experiment, but that gets paid for by the same people he wants to pay for the minimum wage, namely, ratepayers, who are already getting nothing for paying their rates.  That will increase their cost base.</p><p> There seems to be an inherent contradiction in Mr. Fergal O'Brien's presentation.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Dara Calleary:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2201"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Dara Calleary"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2201&amp;amp;pid=DaraCalleary&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Dara Calleary"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->According to a press statement on the IBEC website, the majority of companies intend to introduce pay increases in 2015.  It also refers to a spectacular economic recovery in 2014 and indicates that 49% of companies awarded pay increases to staff in 2014, with this figure set to increase to 51% this year.  Mr. Mark Fielding of ISME disputed these figures.  How many workers in IBEC member companies are on the minimum wage?</p><p> Given that the figures presented by Mr. Seamus Coffey show that the wage share is lowest in industries that are dominated by foreign owned companies, in particular US multinational firms, in other words, IBEC members, is it not slightly contradictory, if not hypocritical, for IBEC to oppose an increase in the minimum wage when its own members are awarding pay increases to those on substantially higher incomes and are doing so from a lower base?  </p><p> A single person on the minimum wage with no children or debt receives &euro;16,960 per annum.  IBEC speaks regularly about input costs in the economy, for example, energy and waste costs, being poor.  The same applies to individuals.  While purchasing power here is in line with the European average or perhaps a little higher according to EUROSTAT, one is left with very little from &euro;16,960 when one subtracts from it rent, travel and food costs.  Given that IBEC members paid staff on higher incomes an increase in the past couple of years, is it not wrong that the organisation advocates that those on the lowest incomes who serve its members on higher incomes should not receive any increase in pay?</p><p> Mr. Fielding made the colourful remark that IBEC had sold out small business by supporting the minimum wage.  I ask the IBEC representatives to respond to his comment. </p></speech>

As such, I am unable to answer the Deputy's question.</p> <p>  IBEC has a significant number of very small companies among its members.  In terms of the survey we circulated of increases in pay, the majority of employers who responded indicated that they intended to increase pay.  This covers all sectors of IBEC's membership.  However, when one breaks down these figures, one finds that more than half of companies with fewer than 50 employees have indicated that they are not in a position to increase pay this year.  There is, therefore, significant diversity in the ability of companies to pay.  This diversity is based on sectoral and regional factors.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked why IBEC had rejected calls for an increase in the national minimum wage.  The reason is that we do not believe there is any cost of living requirement for an increase in the national minimum wage by IBEC members in particular sectors.  I refer specifically to the retail, hospitality and low cost manufacturing sectors which need to manage competitiveness to keep in line with their competitors in the United Kingdom.  We are still in a very early phase of recovery and many of these sectors are not recovering at the same rate as some of the larger companies where pay increases are being awarded.  We must bear this in mind and allow these sectors to build a sustainable recovery.  We also want to encourage smaller businesses, irrespective of whether they are members of IBEC, to increase employment, for which they require stability and need to be able to pay a competitive rate of pay.</p></speech>

The way the labour market is working is that those employers who can afford to give pay increases are doing so, which is great for the workers in question and the domestic economy.  As Ms McElwee stated, many small businesses across IBEC's membership cannot afford to award pay increases at this point as to do so would threaten their viability and jobs, either in terms of the number of people employed or the hours employees work.  There is, therefore, no contradiction in our position, which is a reflection of developments in the labour market.</p> <p>  IBEC members employ approximately 1.1 million people across all sectors of the economy.  We are very happy to reflect as best we can all of the issues and business needs of our members and believe we do this quite well.  It is great that businesses doing well in export markets and the technology sectors are awarding pay increases.  However, for those businesses where labour accounts for more than 50% of the cost base and which are operating in sectors in which turnover is still 15% or more below the pre-crisis turnover figure, wage increases would not be the appropriate course of action.  They would cost jobs and prevent more people from returning to work, which must be the priority in addressing the inequality challenge.  Again, I see no contradiction in IBEC's position on this matter.  It is a reflection of the reality in the labour market and its economic fundamentals.</p><p>On the point raised by Deputy Calleary, while the living wage takes account of the taxation system, it does not take account of the transfer system because, ideally, one should not need transfers if one were earning sufficient income for a living wage.  The living wage is structured on the basis of an estimate for a single individual.  Transfers for families occur through child benefit and so forth.</p><p> The reason I referred to local authorities introducing the living wage is that this is the route by which its introduction has tended to take place elsewhere in the world.  Elected representatives have decided that employees of local authorities should be paid a living wage and the living wage is introduced in that way.  There is merit in that approach and a number of local authorities in Ireland have been examining the issue.</p><p> A living wage has also been introduced in other countries by large businesses, which tend to be the types of companies that embrace the living wage.  Large finance businesses and some of the universities and accounting firms have introduced it.  For the most part, such firms have few employees on very low wages and these tend to be cleaning and catering staff and so forth.  These employees are then paid a living wage.  Some of the leading supporters of the introduction of a living wage, for example, in the United Kingdom, are big businesses which like to be seen to be paying their employees properly.  It often comes as a surprise to them that they were not paying their employees properly and the result is a willingness on their part to embrace living wages.  </p><p> I propose to address the logic of an increase in the minimum wage, an issue on which I disagree somewhat with Mr. O'Brien and Ms McElwee.  To take first the change in consumer prices since the previous increase in the minimum wage in July 2007, prices had increased by 2.3% between July 2007 and the end of last year.  There is, therefore, an issue related to the value of the purchasing power of those earning the minimum wage, which has declined over time.  Throughout this period, there were significant variations in prices, with periods of deflation and inflation.  To some degree, we are in another period of deflation.  Nonetheless, there are issues around the decline over time in the purchasing power of those on the minimum wage.  </p><p> I agree with Deputy Calleary that there appears to be some logic in the argument that, in a period in which wage increases are broadly beginning to appear in the economy, as shown by data from the Central Statistics Office and reports from IBEC for two years in a row indicating that its members are awarding wage increases, it would seem to be almost a bit mad that the wages of those at the very bottom who need an increase most are not increasing.  The idea that there would be no increases for this group but increases for those further up the ladder does not make sense.  There is merit in ensuring further divides do not emerge.  This returns us to the logic of increasing the minimum wage.  </p><p> One of the great problems with the structure of the minimum wage in Ireland is that we tend to revisit the level at which it is set only occasionally.  In other words, we only consider increasing it every couple of years.  Asking employers to pay, for instance, one increase of 60 cent rather than four increases of 15 cent spread over four years is a much more difficult request to implement.  The decision of the Government to establish a low pay commission to examine the minimum wage on an annual basis is very welcome.  We should consider making smaller changes in the minimum wage over time to maintain its adequacy for low income workers than to revisit the issue occasionally, as has been the case until now.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That would make a lot more sense than the occasional visiting we've been doing up to now and I think will give us better outcomes.</p></speech>

Could Dr. Collins confirm another figure that is quite remarkable, that the top 20% of workers receive 25 times the share of the bottom 20%?</p> <p>   The issue being discussed here is low pay; sometimes when the issue is discussed with IBEC or ISME attention gets slightly diverted to those outside of employment.  The challenge we have here is that there is such a problem with low pay in Ireland.  I believe it is the objective and the responsibility of the Government to ensure that a person working full-time can cover their full expenses in life.  There is a difficulty if a wage fails to do that.  I find that often in these discussions it is argued that low wages are good for competition but high wages are also good for competition and that logic affects the distribution of income.  The fact of the matter is the competitiveness of the State is founded on all of its income and all of its pay; a flatter income gradient would be more beneficial for the competitiveness of the State because people who earn &euro;100,000 are also competing with people who earn &euro;100,000 in Britain.  </p> <p>   Sinn F&eacute;in has been involved in bringing about a living wage in Belfast City Council.  This cost Belfast City Council &pound;21 per staff member per year and was accomplished with no increase in the rates paid by businesses, so it can be done if an organisation is determined to do it.  </p> <p>   Mr. O'Brien suggested increasing the tax base while reducing the tax rates.  That does work at certain points of the economic cycle; my worry is that it has proven to have the opposite effect at other points of the economic cycle.  When there is contraction in the economic cycle, as there will be, we find that it has a procyclical influence on the process and sometimes has the effect of making the bottom end of the cycle more difficult for the economy.</p> <p>   We discussed FIS earlier, which to a certain extent is a subsidy; the State, in effect, is paying a subsidy to employers to pay workers.  If that subsidy did not exist these individuals would not take the job because the job would not be worthwhile.  Some of the people who are in receipt of FIS work for companies that are very profitable and do not need FIS.  If IBEC believes in market forces, does it believe that certain businesses should have subsidies paid to them in this way?  For example, I am aware that IBEC does not support large subsidies to farmers in a similar fashion year on year.  If some companies do not need subsidies and others would not survive in the real market should the state be repeatedly paying them a subsidy?  </p> <p>   It has been asserted that we are in direct competition with people in Britain as opposed to those in the Nordic countries.  I do not fully agree with this; I believe we are probably in competition with all of those economies.  It is those models which are most competitive that we should be aiming to converge upon.  The difference between the minimum wages in Ireland and Britain has been mentioned but how does the purchasing power in Ireland compare to that in Britain?  How can purchasing power be increased without increasing the minimum wage?  One suggestion was to reduce the costs of public services; are there any other ways that could be done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.326" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Fergal O'Brien" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015022400002#GG00100"><p>I thank the Deputy for his questions.  In our conversation, inequality in society and the statistics we use to measure it are mainly looked at in terms of household income data, including social welfare.  I would go back to some of the comments made earlier about the source of inequality.  I believe it is due to having such a high rate of jobless households and that this is the single source of inequality in society.  The issue is not just the social welfare system, but more about how we can help people in these households find jobs.  These are people whose parents may never have had a job.  This is one of the biggest challenges we face and is crucial to the debate on inequality.</p> <p>  In terms of tax, my point is that there tends to be significant revisionism in terms of the economic history of the 1990s and 2000s and of the cuts in taxes making the system unsustainable.  The problem was we had a very narrow tax base.  Our argument would be that we should broaden that tax base.  We must learn from that crisis.  When the economy collapsed, there was nothing coming into the public coffers.  This was because we had an excessive reliance on income tax and transaction related property taxes.  Broadening that tax base to services and property makes sense and will protect us in future downturns.  We argue that having competitive income tax rates, in what is now becoming an increasingly mobile, global labour market, is how we will maximise tax revenue from the perspective of income.</p> <p>  A narrative has developed that the State is subsidising employers to keep people in work.  That view is unhelpful to this discussion and we disagree with it.  Many of these jobs would not exist if they were a higher cost.  The employer may be paying 70% or 80%, but the State would be paying 100% of that cost if it was not competitive to keep that job in this economy.  If wage costs are significantly higher, we will lose many of these jobs.  We hope we will move to higher quality jobs over time.  For that reason we will invest in skills and education to try to create an environment where more people have higher quality and higher paid jobs in the economy.  However, many of the higher cost jobs we have here will move out of this country.  We have seen this in the past.  Before the economic crisis ever hit us, hundreds of thousands of jobs moved out of this economy because of wage cost competitiveness.</p><p>I shall start by confirming the figures for the Deputy.  The figures are from the most recent CSO survey on income and living conditions, the most detailed survey and data we have on income in the country.  It gives us the picture of where we are before taxes and social welfare occur.  It is the case that the top 20% receive 25 times the share of those at the bottom.  One of the other numbers was that the top 30% of all earners get 67% of all the income.  This is the starting point of the State steps to redistribute.  If we have such high inequity to start with, it is a big job to redistribute income and even out the situation.  This brings us back to issues around how to begin to address in some way the issue of more adequate earnings and incomes.  This is the reason we have an effective tax and social welfare system.  We must have that.  Otherwise we would have even more unequal income distribution, which would be even more problematic.</p><p> We must remember competitiveness is not just about wages.  Wages are important, but there are issues in regard to public services, infrastructure and the education system.  Competitiveness touches on all of these also.  In terms of low paid workers and the general groups the committee is looking at, we must remember it is not all about pay and that there are issues around precariousness of employment or precarious work practices and uncertainty for employees, who do not know from one week to another what their work hours or income will be.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Putting people and families in a position such as that is not sustainable in terms of ensuring adequate and decent standards of living for society.  </p><p> I agree with Mr. O'Brien that a jobless household is the real issue.  There is no doubt about that.  Given the scale of the economic crash we have had, we have many of these households.  The great concern is that if we have significant numbers of lower skilled people unemployed, the potential jobs awaiting them are not a great improvement from their current position.  We want to get these people back to work, but we want to get them back into decent jobs and work.  We must think about this agenda.</p><p> On the broadening of the tax base, we have still got quite a bit of work to do.  We have made significant progress over time, but broadening it further would probably include issues such as increasing employees' and employers' PRSI, which are quite low.  Neither of these two groups are paying sufficient currently to support the social insurance system we have in place or the social insurance fund, which continues to require subvention from the Exchequer.  Given the structure of the economy and the population and given the likely costs that face us in the years to come, this brings us back to thinking realistically about how we will pay for these.</p><p> I and some of my colleagues at the Nevin Economic Research Institute have been pointing towards the fact that we must stop dealing with the day-to-day crises we have been dealing with, in positive and negative times, for approximately three decades and begin to embrace seriously where we are going as a society.  We must think about that.  This will require us to think about structural reform and about preparing for the long-term challenges.  It is unrealistic to look at the tax take we collect currently and the likelihood of what is ahead for society without realising that we must either make significant public spending cuts in the years to come or collect more tax.  We have not had that debate, but it would be useful to have it.</p></speech>

Therefore, if we reduced the minimum wage by half, we would have a higher demand for labour.  However, if a person is working full time and cannot afford to pay his rent and feed his children, the State must fill that gap.  In other words, we need to find a morally responsible wage level that means the State does not need to keep filling the pot for people who need support to look after their families and their rent.  This wage needs to be found and employers need to pay that rate.  This makes the argument that there is a necessity for an increase in the minimum wage in order to achieve that.</p><p>One of the disadvantages of being last to contribute is that most of the questions have been asked.  I agree with Mr. O'Brien that one of the main issues in regard to household income is jobless households, but I must also state the obvious, namely, that earning &euro;8.65 an hour is a significant contributor to income inequality.  It also affects a person's opportunity to not just survive but be part of society.  With all due respects to Ms McElwee, it is no consolation that approximately the same percentage of the population is on &euro;8.65 an hour as before 2007.</p><p> The minimum wage of &euro;8.65 an hour is not an acceptable wage for anybody.  I recognise we look at the world from a different viewpoint and I respect that Mr. O'Brien and Ms McElwee are here as IBEC representatives.  I speak from a different side.  For example, we know the VAT reduction for the hospitality sector cost the taxpayer a significant amount.  We will hear from unions that come before us at a later date that no negotiations were held on issues such as the nature of work rather than pay alone so as to ensure better quality conditions for these people.  We know that some people in the hospitality sector have refused to engage in registered employment agreements, REAs, or joint labour committees, JLCs, which might ensure a better quality of life.</p><p> As was said earlier, the issue is not just about wages, but about everything else also.  I am disappointed with IBEC's response on this and almost feel there is a conspiracy in this regard.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Lyons:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2307"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy John Lyons"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=BUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2307&amp;amp;pid=JohnLyonsLab&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy John Lyons"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Deputy Calleary had asked if there are any figures on how many IBEC members have employees who are paid &euro;8.65 per hour.  I assume that there are some people who do.  It is great to hear people talking about wage increases.  Surveys have shown that more people are expecting wage increases and that employers are going to do this.  We know that is happening.  They are the types of employers who have a good social responsibility attached to the way that they treat their workers.  </p><p>  The current estimate of people employed on the minimum wage is 4.7%.  I respect that there are employers who cannot pay because of the circumstances they find their business in right now but to call a spade a spade, there are businesses who employ people and who would employ them at less than what they pay them now if they could.  It is not acceptable to sugar coat the situation and say that does not exist.  That is what the issue is about here today.  I am not concerned with people on middle or higher incomes getting more this year.  I recognise that Government policy on this is required, and that is being looked at.  One of those significant pieces in the jigsaw is income rates.  It is not acceptable for anybody to earn &euro;330 a week; it cannot buy anything.  Even if it does provide 20% more purchasing power now than it did seven years ago or pre-crash, that is still very little.  </p><p>  I will finish on this point.  Nobody here earns close to the minimum wage.  There has been very little discussion about the real life implications of what it really means for these people.  I respect employers and acknowledge that they have a massive social responsibility but we cannot escape from the fact that if the minimum wage was reduced by &euro;2 tomorrow there will be some employers who are represented by IBEC and others who would decrease the wages they pay immediately.  Those people are the reason we are here today and why the introduction of some sort of regulation is necessary, to protect people who are in such vulnerable situations.  </p><p>  I will leave it at that.  I do not expect comments back because most of the questions have been asked and answered.  I want to make that point.  The real conversation here today is about the people who earn &euro;8.65 per hour.  We do fund work; we fund work for wealthy companies that are well able to pay and give people full-time, 40-hour contracts per week but choose to give them less than that for the benefit of the company rather than the worker.  Nobody here can produce documents to show that but we all know that exists.  It would be a shame to have this conversation without reference to the reality that people are living and who we hear from on a day-to-day basis.  </p></speech>

Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked a question about the purchasing power in Ireland versus that in the UK.  The latest numbers that IBEC has looked at show that in Ireland it is about 10% higher.  The other thing that it is important to recognise is that Ireland does a very good job of keeping minimum wage earners out of the tax net; their effective tax rate is about 3%.  In most other countries tax on minimum wage is quite high; in the UK it is about double.  That is an important part of the conversation.</p> <p>   The reduced rate of VAT and the impact it has had on the economy is relevant to much of this discussion and the conversation we had on tax rates and revenue.  The Deputy made the point that the VAT reduction would cost the taxpayer.  I would argue that the VAT reduction has actually yielded revenue for the taxpayer because it put more people back to work.  It showed the cost-sensitive nature of many of the sectors in which it would have impacted and ultimately it was an economic gain for the country.  It actually benefitted the taxpayer.  It took people off social welfare, put them back into work, ensured that employers were paying more employer PRSI and that there was more spending power in the economy.  That is what appropriate tax rates can do in terms of supporting economic growth and activity but it also demonstrates the cost-sensitive nature of some of the sectors being discussed.  If they have lower costs there will be more activity; if they have higher costs there will be less activity and unfortunately less employment.  I think the VAT reduction proves much of that.</p><p>Very quickly to respond to Deputy Lyons's comments.  I just wanted to link it to the living wage benchmark.  One of the reasons it was developed was to provide a figure that shows how much employees need to earn to be able to cover all of their costs and to have a decent standard of living.  When they earn below that figure they are making cutbacks and so on.  I think that figure is very useful in terms of pointing towards the sustainability or challenges that employees face.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Dr. Miche&aacute;l Collins:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->That figure is very useful in pointing towards sustainability or the challenges employees face when they are on below the living wage, struggling and having to make cuts.

It is not sufficient to put them on silent mode.  They need to be turned off because they could cause problems with the broadcasting equipment.<br/><br/>As people will know, the committee is carrying out a series of meetings in regard to what would happen to Ireland in the event of a British exit from the European Union.  Prime Minister Cameron said that if elected in May, he will hold a referendum in the UK in 2017 or earlier.  We are interested in finding out exactly what that might mean for Ireland.  It is important to state that the committee took the decision to examine this issue at this time in view of the potential impact it might have not just on Ireland but on Irish citizens in the UK.  We are having a series of meetings to discuss the impact and are talking to a range of academics, politicians and the like.<br/><br/>Today's discussion will focus on the economic interdependence of Ireland and the European Union.  The UK is Ireland's most important economic partner with just over one third of Irish imports coming from, and one sixth of Irish exports going to, the UK market.  We are delighted to be joined by Mr. Joe Durkin who is from the school of economics at UCD and who is very welcome. <br/><br/>Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with today's proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>I remind members that after Mr. Durkan's presentation, we have a number of items of private business to discuss and that the discussion today is not about whether the UK should have a referendum but about the implications of an exit on Ireland.  I invite Mr. Durkan to speak.</p><p>I will talk a bit about the background to the UK leaving.  I will then say what I think the likelihood is for the UK and for its relations with the European Union.  I will also say something about the likely performance of the UK economy being out of the EU and what that means for us because it is really through trade that we will face an impact.  The focus is on the UK.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe Durkan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The basis for the UK leaving, as presented, is almost entirely political and driven by the political needs of the present government and how it perceives Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party, and the growth of the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP.  That lies behind it and in order to justify it many arguments have been used, most of which do not stand up.  There is a claim that the UK is not integrated within the EU economy and in particular the financial services sector, the services sector, has not been integrated.  The data does not support that.  The growth in the UK trade with Europe has been very rapid, much more so than in previous periods.  Work that has been done in the United Kingdom that has tried to separate out the Single Market effect and the growth effect suggests that the UK&rsquo;s penetration of Europe has increased, as has the penetration of other EU countries into the UK. </p><p> In respect of the services sector it is probably true that it has not integrated as well but that is true of all countries, not just financial services but accountancy, legal and all the rest of those services have not developed to the extent that one might have expected under the Single Market programme.  It may be that it takes a bit longer than people had expected.  That is important.  There is also a problem with red tape and the claim that the UK economy is held back by red tape but exactly the same red tape applies to every other country and not all countries are held back.  Some work has been done to try to quantify the effect of red tape and suggest that the UK has less regulation than most other EU countries, particularly in the labour market, with the exception I think of Holland, which is the most liberal.  The degree of regulation in the United Kingdom is no different from that in the United States. </p><p> There is also a question that the UK contribution is excessive in spite of the rebate but in fact its net contribution amounts to 0.5% of UK GDP so this is not the huge burden that it makes out.</p></speech>

It is not huge.</p><p> The other argument is that immigration has given rise to a huge flow of people into the United Kingdom, which has damaged the economy and resulted in pressure on the health and social services.  That claim is also in dispute because most of the immigrants from the new accession states have contributed to output and output has been higher as a consequence.  The number of welfare immigrants is very small.  It is not in reality a big issue.  The political process is different.  It will make a lot of comment about these things even though they do not stand up. </p><p> If the UK does leave it is not just a question of leaving, it will want access to those markets.  It cannot just leave and say that is the end.  It will want to have a relationship with the EU.  We have examples of only a few countries, Norway and Switzerland being the prime ones, that are outside the EU but have agreements with it.  In effect both of these countries must meet EU rules if trade is to take place.  The UK will find itself in exactly the same position.  It will not be allowed to trade advantageously because it has managed to get rid of rules.  Leaving will not confer a competitive advantage in the short term.</p><p> In terms of the financial services sector, the City of London will find it is just as influenced by the rules that will be developed within the EU with the one proviso, that it will have no input into those rules.  If it leaves and new rules for the financial sector are determined the UK will be obliged to abide by those but will find that it has no say in their operation.  At the moment it does have a say.  This is very important and not clearly understood in Britain.  I think people there believe they can leave and behave as they want but that is not the case.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe Durkan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> It is true that the UK contribution will go down.  Interestingly enough, both Norway and Switzerland are obliged to make a contribution towards the economic development of the new accession states that need funds.  The United Kingdom will almost certainly be required to do so.  In the case of Switzerland, it amounts to about 55% of the contribution it would make if it was a member of the European Union.  That is kind of interesting and suggests that Britain's going will not save that much money in terms of payments.  </p><p> There is also the question of CAP which I might say a bit more about later.  Britain must think about the reduction of CAP payments because the burden of adjustment will fall on the British Government.  Therefore, it would save money directly but indirectly it would have to support agriculture unless it decides to do something else.</p><p> It is almost certain there would be less immigration.  I have read some material which suggests that Britain does leave there will have to be a repatriation of people.  That seems highly unlikely because I think the people who are in Britain will remain.  </p><p> The third issue I want to talk about is how the UK economy will perform.  If the referendum is held in 2017 then we are faced with two years of uncertainty about the outcome and uncertainty is detrimental to investment.  The last referendum held in Britain led to a reduction in investment and a capital flight because of the fear that Britain would not be a member of the European Union.</p><p> There is no doubt that the UK economy's performance would deteriorate in the short to medium term.  That is almost inevitable because of the uncertainty.  Britain would also have to negotiate a trade deal with the European Union which may not be favourable.  It will also find, when world trade is being discussed, that it will be by the European Union, the US, China, India and Japan.  The UK will be peripheral to that discussion because it is so small relative to everybody else and Britain will find itself excluded from negotiations.  I also suspect that the city of London will lose its relative position.  It is not in the eurozone at the moment.  Due to the UK not being in the eurozone it is peripheral and it will become more peripheral if it is out, I believe.    The UK economy is likely to suffer a lower growth path in the long run.</p><p> The idea that it can abolish red tape is fanciful.  A lot of the red tape, while it might be burdensome for companies, is necessary and would be introduced anyway and it is not just imposed by Europe.</p><p> What are the implications for Ireland?  The UK economy is very important for Ireland and one cannot just get that by looking at trade.  One third of food exports from Ireland go to the United Kingdom which, to my mind, is the key to it all.  A lot of the rest of the exports would be chemicals and pharmaceuticals which are produced by  multinational companies and they will go anyway.  The food sector could be affected.</p><p> Why is the UK so important?  We have two episodes that show us how important the UK is to us and one was the mid-1980s.  We began to recover from the recession in the mid-1980s due to the growth in the UK economy following the loss and boom.  I wrote a paper on this issue a long time ago which showed that the timing of our growth in exports was directly related to the growth of the UK economy and led our recovery.  It took a good few years before it was evident that a recovery was in place.  In the same way, the slow recovery that we are experiencing now began last year and is related to the growth in the UK and US economies.  They are the two factors that have driven our recovery, as well as some domestic foreign direct investment.  For us, the performance of the UK economy is critical.  If the UK weakens then it will lead to a weakening of the growth of this economy and I do not see how such an outcome could be avoided.</p><p> For us, the important things will be trade, foreign direct investment and tourism.  In terms of trade, the effect will be weaker.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe Durkan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is no likelihood that FDI that goes to the UK will come to Ireland.  Most of the companies go to the UK because the market is big but they also see access to Europe as important.  Car manufacturers such as Toyota, Nissan and Honda are located there.  If they lost that big market and European springboard, this investment would cease and there would be capital flight.  The companies will not necessarily come here.  I could not imagine companies such as these coming here because our market is small and, therefore, I do not see us gaining much from that.</p><p> With regard to tourism, it is inevitable that a weaker UK economy will lead to weaker tourism.  We experienced this during the current recession.</p><p> Agriculture matters very much to us but it is not clear what would happen in the UK.  It would lose the transfers under the CAP and the UK Government would have to make a decision on whether it would support agriculture.  The amounts are huge.  I saw data that suggest that over the next five years, almost Stg&pound;20 billion will go into agriculture through the CAP.  That money would not be available and, therefore, the UK Government would have to make a decision on supporting agriculture.  The worst scenario from our point of view would be if the government resorted to the same policies it had prior to entry into the EU when the UK had a deficiency payment system under which lower prices were guaranteed to farmers but incomes were maintained through additional payments.  The effect of that was to reduce the price of meat and dairy products, in particular.  Some members may recall that prior to joining the EU, Ireland subsidised the export of butter to the UK because of that deficiency payment system.  We would not want to go back to that but that is a big risk for us, as we would find it hard to sell in the UK.</p><p> The milk quota system was a big barrier to the growth of the agriculture industry.  It conferred income gains to people in the short run but it meant that output was constrained for the past 35 years.  That constraint on milk output meant that the agriculture industry found it hard to develop.  With the lifting of the quota, output will increase by between 40% and 50%.  The producers and processors have geared up for that but our main market is still the UK and we could easily find that market distorted, which is a major risk.</p><p> The risks are high if the UK leaves.  There could also be issues with the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  The policy would cease because from the Uk's point of view, it would re-establish control over its fisheries.</p></speech>

From our point of view, if the UK left, there could be border restrictions and that would not be good.  The best outcome is the UK remaining in the EU and that is what Ireland should aim for.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Durkan.  I commend the Chairman on holding these hearings in advance of any possibility of Britain leaving the EU.  It is better to be there before the horse bolts.  There is no great economic benefit for Britain in leaving the EU.  It is doing well and it would not be wise to leave.  The general consensus is that no political party in Ireland would even contemplate leaving the EU if Britain left because there would be no benefit whatsoever.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator Terry Leyden"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator Terry Leyden"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The announcement of the referendum, which is premature with the election in May and when people do not know who will be in power, has undermined the economy before people know who will be in government.  It may be a combination of the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party but the Scottish nationalists do not want to leave.  The Labour Party might be convinced that it is now politically advantageous to hold a referendum.</p><p> Yesterday, 850 jobs were announced by Apple for Athenry.  It is coming to Ireland because we are guaranteed to stay in the European Union and the company can supply the European Union from a location in Ireland.  It is a massive investment and a great endorsement of the country but it did not go to England.  We are giving mobile companies stability and we are the only English speaking country in the region.  There is a massive implication for Britain and all we can do is put across our point of view, which we are doing in a balanced and reasonable manner.  We can first say that we do not want the UK to go and we will do anything we can to persuade it to stay.</p><p> It is good we have a strong Commissioner in the European Commission.

He is one of a number of contributors to the debate and the problem is that it is like playing devil's advocate.  We are considering the ifs and buts that permeate the debate.  The committee started by trying to speculate about the effects on Ireland if Britain pulled out but we have not yet come to terms with the Tories and their suggestion that they will have a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; referendum if they get an overall majority in the next election.  The first hurdle must be overcome, which is whether the Tories get an overall majority.  Most speakers have outlined the lunacy of the current thinking of the Tories and the negative effect of a pull-out, although it is not like unplugging from a socket, for Britain and Ireland.<br/><br/>We have a divided nation, with Six Counties still occupied by the British establishment.  We have the Border and we are in Europe and in the euro, while Britain is in the sterling zone.  The ramifications for Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Border are tremendously complicated.<br/><br/>With UKIP basically a racist and anti-immigration force at play in Britain, the hysteria was illustrated by the media presenting themselves at airports to see the immigrants who were going to rob the welfare system dry in England.  The media discovered only one man was coming in but he had a job.  Romanians and Bulgarians did not flood in and most people agree the benefit to any nation of inward immigration is because of the motivation of immigrants, who want to work and are productive in the workforce.<br/><br/>What will happen in Northern Ireland politics?  First of all, there is a substantial Unionist representation that takes its seats.  It would be interesting to hear the analysis of how the brothers in the Unionist fraternity would relate to the Conservative Party in Great Britain.  The irony of it is the position of Scotland and, by implication, Wales.  Is there an argument that UKIP, if successful, would eventually end up wrecking the United Kingdom?  Sinn F&eacute;in, being eurosceptic, will not take part in the debate in Westminster.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eric Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=142"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Eric Byrne"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=142&amp;amp;pid=EricJByrne&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Eric Byrne"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->How will the political dice in this regard roll <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales?<br/><br/>Some people seek an out in the context of Norway and Switzerland.

As everyone is aware, Switzerland shares borders with France, Italy and Germany and I understand that the result of the referendum to which I refer cannot be implemented because it is not possible to create quotas in respect of European workers entering and leaving particular jurisdictions.<br/><br/>Is it fair to state that we should anticipate that negotiations on the part of Westminster in respect of unravelling whatever treaties the British feel need to be unravelled will probably last two years?  As is the case with Greece, does our guest believe that Britain would find itself very short of friends if it were to leave the current community of 28 member states?  Are there any implications for England in the context of the TTIP negotiations?</p></speech>

A number of questions arose at our previous meetings which I will now put to our guest.  We can tell what would likely be the impact on Britain and Ireland if the former were to exit the EU.  To what extent has the impact on the Union itself of a possible exit been examined?  If Britain leaves, then the Union will be smaller.  In addition, if this course of action were followed, it would be the first occasion on which a member state would leave the Union since its inception as the European Coal and Steel Community.  In a sense, it would also be the first reversal of the European project.</p> <p>  What has motivated the British establishment to contemplate taking this route?  As Deputy Eric Byrne indicated, if the Tories win the forthcoming general election, it is their intention to hold a referendum on this matter.   One is conditional on the other, of course, and an exit might never happen.  In such circumstances, one must query the wisdom of putting forward the proposal relating to a possible exit in the first instance.  What are the issues which motivate members of the British public?  Is it a case of their having an us-and-them view of Europe?  Has Britain ever taken ownership of the European project?  Has it resiled from that project and, if so, to what extent?  How much impact has this had on the entire European integration project?</p> <p>  Mr. Joe Durkan referred to Norway and Switzerland.  The latter is situated in the middle of the European Union and is, therefore, in a very advantageous position geographically.  While not so centrally positioned, Norway has the compensation of its natural resources.  The case of Britain is somewhat different, particularly in the context of its relationship with the island - namely, this one - located off its western shores.  There are some pundits in this country who have suggested that Ireland should also consider leaving the EU.  Such a course of action would be disastrous.  It would give rise to a double whammy by causing major damage to the EU and - by virtue of their isolation from the Continent - the economies of both Ireland and the UK.</p> <p>  Mr. Joe Durkan referred to the City of London and how remarkably and effectively it is integrating with the European area in general.  There would be a serious effect on the level of trade between the City of London and other global financial services centres if the UK were to leave the EU.  The knock-on effect of this would be felt in the UK's economy.  There are suggestions to the effect that if the City of London is doing well in terms of trade, then the remainder of the British economy follows suit.  In the event of Britain removing itself from the EU arena, what will happen to the trade carried out in the City of London?</p></speech>

The United Kingdom is apparently embarking on a process whose conclusion is uncertain, but this exercise is helpful in assisting the committee to a greater understanding of the issues.  Together with the other briefings we have been given, Mr. Durkan's contribution is invaluable.</p> <p>  The first question I intended to ask has already been answered and I have only one other question for the witness.  Mr. Durkan referred to the risks of an EU exit being quite high for the United Kingdom economy in the short to medium term.  I am not an economist and must defer to his vast experience and expertise in these matters.  Will he elaborate on how, in the normal run of things and given the bigger picture, the UK economy would suffer?  I will refrain from asking about the impact on the Irish economy, because we will just have to wait and see how the dice falls in that respect.</p></speech>

My question follows on from that of Deputy Keating.  I take a completely different view from the latter, namely, that the purpose of our having these types of discussions is to consider how we might place ourselves in a state of readiness in the event that the UK does decide to exit the European Union.  Mr. Durkan has set out very clearly the implications of such an outcome and I accept his analysis.  The questions that follow for us relate to the type of contingency planning we should be doing, what types of precautionary measures we should be taking and whether we should include certain measures in our budgetary process that would leave us in a state of readiness in the eventuality of a UK exit.</p></speech>

In his view, can Ireland or any other EU member state exert an influence on the UK's decision?  Going back as far as 1975, despite all media and most parties supporting British membership, the referendum on whether the UK should remain part of the then EEC was only carried by a 2:1 majority.  In 1993, John Major's Government almost fell on the issue of the Maastricht treaty.  Current polls show that the majority of people in Britain want out of the EU for various reasons.</p> <p>  An interesting development in the debate in recent months has been the references to Norway, Sweden and Switzerland - countries which are outside or on the periphery of the EU and have managed to achieve greater growth than any of the best performing countries of the EU or its economy overall.  All three of these countries have direct trade with Europe and their economies are performing exceptionally well.  Will Mr. Durkan comment on that?</p> <p>  It is important to note that it is not just the Conservative Party driving this issue.  Some members of the British Labour Party are very wishy-washy about the EU and cannot give a guarantee on how they will vote.</p></speech>

That is the official policy.  Of course, every party includes members who are sceptical.</p><p>From speaking to people in the British Labour Party, my impression is that there will be a referendum no matter who is in government after the election.  I would go so far as to say there will undoubtedly be a referendum.  Although the majority wanting to leave the EU has reduced and now stands at some 53%, 82% of British people want a referendum on the question.  None of the parties will be able to ignore that.</p><p> IBEC has argued that in the event of a UK exit from the EU, a margin of businesses in Ireland could cede to a more attractive credits-based tax regime in Britain, as set out under Conservative Party proposals.  That party seems determined on having a referendum and on a UK exit.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Halligan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2315"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy John Halligan"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy John Halligan"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is already beginning to offer tax incentives to businesses to establish operations in Britain.

The United Kingdom has a long history of immigration.  Obviously, many Irish people have gone there to live and work.  Has it tended to differentiate between immigration from the countries of the British Commonwealth and that from other European Union member states?  Have studies been carried out of the economics of migration?  In that context, I recall a recent newspaper headline which read, "Is there no one left in Britain who can make a sandwich?"  We all know the point that was being made about the skills, etc., people possess.  Have studies such as those to which I refer been carried out?</p> <p>  Agriculture is extremely important to Ireland, particularly in the context of direct transfers.  In view of the fact that the United Kingdom is a net contributor to the European Union, what impact would a possible exit have on the direct supports we receive?  There are many small holdings in Scotland and Wales and, as a result, both are much more dependent on direct transfers.  What impact would a possible exit have on those involved in farming in these countries, particularly in terms of their ability to remain in operation?</p> <p>  In the context of business - be it small, city-based or whatever else - everyone wants to reduce the amount of red tape which must be dealt with.  Are there specific policies which companies, both large and small, might identify and state that if they were removed, operating would be easier?  Everyone is opposed to red tape, but I am just wondering if there is differentiation in this regard?</p><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tUasal Joe Durkan.  Different people have come before the committee to discuss this matter and there is agreement that a possible UK exit from the European Union could have a huge impact on Ireland.  As Deputy Bernard J. Durkan inquired, should we be focusing on the possible impact on the European Union in general and the United Kingdom?  We are motivated in terms of the impact it would have on Ireland.  A person who previously appeared before the committee suggested the IFSC was very much viewed as a satellite of the City of London and noted the potential impact an exit could have on Ireland in this context.  Does Mr. Durkan share the concerns expressed by the individual to whom I refer?</p><p> If Britain were to decide to leave, how long would it take to negotiate new trade agreements?  Deputy Timmy Dooley indicated that Ireland needed to put in place contingency plans.  Does Mr. Durkan have suggestions to make in this regard?  The strategy the Tories appear to be pursuing seems to be based on the premise that by announcing an intention to hold a referendum on a possible exit, they will strengthen Britain's hand in negotiations with the European Union.  Does Mr. Durkan share my view in this regard?</p><p> Under the Tories, Britain is seen as one of the most pro-TTIP countries in the European Union.  However, the British Labour Party has indicated that it has major difficulties with the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism.  Some countries in Europe, including France and Germany, have also outlined their concerns about this mechanism.  If Britain does pull out of the European Union, will it have an impact on investment?<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1774"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=1774&amp;amp;pid=SeanCroweSF&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Another speaker suggested that if Britain was to move under a Tory leadership, certainly it would be much more comfortable moving towards the US in terms of trade.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015022400002#K00200"><p>I thank Deputy Crowe.  I wish to ask a question that has not yet been asked, namely, in relation to the financial transaction tax, the Robin Hood tax, the total tax.  Mr. Durkan mentioned in his evidence that he expects the City of London to get more peripheral if the UK pulls out of the European Union.  One of the reasons Ireland was not one of the original 12 or so countries that signed up for the intergovernmental agreement to establish the financial transaction tax in some European countries, was we thought that would drive people from our financial services centre across to the UK.  If the UK withdraws from the European Union does Mr. Durkan expect Ireland to have to sign up for the financial transaction tax?  Would that then become a done deal?  Everyone who wished to contribute has had an opportunity to do so.  Deputy Dooley sends his apologies.  He has another meeting but will read the answer to his question in the transcript.</p><p>Senator Terry Leyden asked about Ireland leaving the European Union.  I thought about it very peripherally and I did not think there was the remotest possibility that we would leave because the balance of advantage for us has to be to stay within the European Union.<br/><br/>Deputy Eric Byrne's questions were mostly political.  I am not heavy into politics but try to think of the economics of things.  When one looks at the UK one has to ask what is driving it.  It seems to me that the referendum is being driven by a small group of people, the Eurosceptics within the Tory Party and the fear of UKIP.  The trouble is that the more these people make noise, the more Mr. Cameron and so on responds to it an attempt to show that he is not being caught offside.  He may be painting himself into a corner - that is what I suspect.  I cannot see, given what everybody believes about the disadvantages to Britain, that it would do something that is not in its interests.  I just do not believe that but the UK could be driven to it if the vote turns out to be the way it is.  I would expect the members of the committee to know more about this than me because they are in the political process and I am not.  I try to avoid it if I can.  <br/><br/>In terms of the negotiations, Article 50 of the treaty allows for people to exit so the procedure is laid down.  I think it would take a long time, it may be two years before it could get out and then it could spend another two years negotiating a trade agreement.  Trade agreements take much longer than one would think.  Switzerland still has not completed its part of EFTA but is not part of the European Economic Area so it still has not got a formal agreement on all the trade that is needed.  I am not really into the politics. <br/><br/>There was a very interesting article in last week's edition of <i>The Economist</i>which talked about the fragmentation of the political system in Britain.  Instead of  being just two parties there is now an awful lot more in it.  One cannot ignore Scotland any more and one cannot ignore Northern Ireland.  I am not sure about how Wales fits in but it has to take account of that.  It will be the United Kingdom leaving the European Union - it is not one bit of it that will leave, the whole lot will leave.  Scotland will not have the option of not leaving, nor will Northern Ireland.  The whole of the United Kingdom will leave.<br/><br/>Deputy Durkan asked me about the really important question, namely, the impact on the European Union.  The European Union will have an interest in concluding a trade deal with Britain.  It is in its interests.  It does not want Britain to be outside.  Britain is still a big market and it sells a lot.  It will want to do a trade deal.  It will not want to be too advantageous for Britain.  Obviously it cannot let Britain decide it will get rid of a whole rake of regulations.  It will still have to conform to the regulations in place.  That is inevitable.  It will not be able to get rid of the red tape.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe Durkan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> As for the European project, Britain never bought into it and I am not sure we did either.  Members should bear in mind that this grew out of the Second World War.  I taught a course on European integration to my students and spent three or four lectures talking about what happened after the war because that is the motivation for the European project.  People might forget it because it is 70 years ago but it is still there.  Many people in Germany remember what it was like just after the war.  There was an extraordinary level of displacement as people were forced to leave parts of what is now Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.  The devastation wrought by that and by similar events throughout Europe is something they do not forget.  We did not experience it so we may not have bought into it.  We bought into it because it looked like it involved money or employment but the originators of the project probably had a different perception of what they were trying to achieve from the one we have.</p><p> I was asked about the performance of the UK economy.  There is no doubt that in the run-up to the referendum investment in the UK will be weaker.  It is inevitable and the consequence of that will be a reduced medium-term performance and a weaker supply side of that economy.</p></speech>

This is not just speculation as it happened in the 1970s at the time of the last referendum.  Investment did actually fall and that inevitably reduces a country's long-run potential growth.  There will be uncertainty if the UK does leave as to what the terms of any trade agreements will be.  Everyone will call for them to remain more or less as they are because otherwise it is very disruptive.  If UK income falls it will impact on Europe because it means Europe will sell less.  It is important we do not see weakness in an economy as an advantage because it really is a disadvantage.  The richer countries become the better it is for everybody because they are then more likely to be able to trade successfully.</p></speech>

It is not sufficient to put them on silent mode.  They need to be turned off because they could cause problems with the broadcasting equipment.<br/><br/>As people will know, the committee is carrying out a series of meetings in regard to what would happen to Ireland in the event of a British exit from the European Union.  Prime Minister Cameron said that if elected in May, he will hold a referendum in the UK in 2017 or earlier.  We are interested in finding out exactly what that might mean for Ireland.  It is important to state that the committee took the decision to examine this issue at this time in view of the potential impact it might have not just on Ireland but on Irish citizens in the UK.  We are having a series of meetings to discuss the impact and are talking to a range of academics, politicians and the like.<br/><br/>Today's discussion will focus on the economic interdependence of Ireland and the European Union.  The UK is Ireland's most important economic partner with just over one third of Irish imports coming from, and one sixth of Irish exports going to, the UK market.  We are delighted to be joined by Mr. Joe Durkin who is from the school of economics at UCD and who is very welcome. <br/><br/>Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with today's proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>I remind members that after Mr. Durkan's presentation, we have a number of items of private business to discuss and that the discussion today is not about whether the UK should have a referendum but about the implications of an exit on Ireland.  I invite Mr. Durkan to speak.</p><p>I will talk a bit about the background to the UK leaving.  I will then say what I think the likelihood is for the UK and for its relations with the European Union.  I will also say something about the likely performance of the UK economy being out of the EU and what that means for us because it is really through trade that we will face an impact.  The focus is on the UK.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe Durkan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The basis for the UK leaving, as presented, is almost entirely political and driven by the political needs of the present government and how it perceives Eurosceptics within the Conservative Party, and the growth of the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP.  That lies behind it and in order to justify it many arguments have been used, most of which do not stand up.  There is a claim that the UK is not integrated within the EU economy and in particular the financial services sector, the services sector, has not been integrated.  The data does not support that.  The growth in the UK trade with Europe has been very rapid, much more so than in previous periods.  Work that has been done in the United Kingdom that has tried to separate out the Single Market effect and the growth effect suggests that the UK&rsquo;s penetration of Europe has increased, as has the penetration of other EU countries into the UK. </p><p> In respect of the services sector it is probably true that it has not integrated as well but that is true of all countries, not just financial services but accountancy, legal and all the rest of those services have not developed to the extent that one might have expected under the Single Market programme.  It may be that it takes a bit longer than people had expected.  That is important.  There is also a problem with red tape and the claim that the UK economy is held back by red tape but exactly the same red tape applies to every other country and not all countries are held back.  Some work has been done to try to quantify the effect of red tape and suggest that the UK has less regulation than most other EU countries, particularly in the labour market, with the exception I think of Holland, which is the most liberal.  The degree of regulation in the United Kingdom is no different from that in the United States. </p><p> There is also a question that the UK contribution is excessive in spite of the rebate but in fact its net contribution amounts to 0.5% of UK GDP so this is not the huge burden that it makes out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-02-24a.389" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015022400002#C00200"><p>What is that in absolute numbers?</p><p>I can send it to the Chairman.  It is not huge.</p><p> The other argument is that immigration has given rise to a huge flow of people into the United Kingdom, which has damaged the economy and resulted in pressure on the health and social services.  That claim is also in dispute because most of the immigrants from the new accession states have contributed to output and output has been higher as a consequence.  The number of welfare immigrants is very small.  It is not in reality a big issue.  The political process is different.  It will make a lot of comment about these things even though they do not stand up. </p><p> If the UK does leave it is not just a question of leaving, it will want access to those markets.  It cannot just leave and say that is the end.  It will want to have a relationship with the EU.  We have examples of only a few countries, Norway and Switzerland being the prime ones, that are outside the EU but have agreements with it.  In effect both of these countries must meet EU rules if trade is to take place.  The UK will find itself in exactly the same position.  It will not be allowed to trade advantageously because it has managed to get rid of rules.  Leaving will not confer a competitive advantage in the short term.</p><p> In terms of the financial services sector, the City of London will find it is just as influenced by the rules that will be developed within the EU with the one proviso, that it will have no input into those rules.  If it leaves and new rules for the financial sector are determined the UK will be obliged to abide by those but will find that it has no say in their operation.  At the moment it does have a say.  This is very important and not clearly understood in Britain.  I think people there believe they can leave and behave as they want but that is not the case.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe Durkan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> It is true that the UK contribution will go down.  Interestingly enough, both Norway and Switzerland are obliged to make a contribution towards the economic development of the new accession states that need funds.  The United Kingdom will almost certainly be required to do so.  In the case of Switzerland, it amounts to about 55% of the contribution it would make if it was a member of the European Union.  That is kind of interesting and suggests that Britain's going will not save that much money in terms of payments.  </p><p> There is also the question of CAP which I might say a bit more about later.  Britain must think about the reduction of CAP payments because the burden of adjustment will fall on the British Government.  Therefore, it would save money directly but indirectly it would have to support agriculture unless it decides to do something else.</p><p> It is almost certain there would be less immigration.  I have read some material which suggests that Britain does leave there will have to be a repatriation of people.  That seems highly unlikely because I think the people who are in Britain will remain.  </p><p> The third issue I want to talk about is how the UK economy will perform.  If the referendum is held in 2017 then we are faced with two years of uncertainty about the outcome and uncertainty is detrimental to investment.  The last referendum held in Britain led to a reduction in investment and a capital flight because of the fear that Britain would not be a member of the European Union.</p><p> There is no doubt that the UK economy's performance would deteriorate in the short to medium term.  That is almost inevitable because of the uncertainty.  Britain would also have to negotiate a trade deal with the European Union which may not be favourable.  It will also find, when world trade is being discussed, that it will be by the European Union, the US, China, India and Japan.  The UK will be peripheral to that discussion because it is so small relative to everybody else and Britain will find itself excluded from negotiations.  I also suspect that the city of London will lose its relative position.  It is not in the eurozone at the moment.  Due to the UK not being in the eurozone it is peripheral and it will become more peripheral if it is out, I believe.    The UK economy is likely to suffer a lower growth path in the long run.</p><p> The idea that it can abolish red tape is fanciful.  A lot of the red tape, while it might be burdensome for companies, is necessary and would be introduced anyway and it is not just imposed by Europe.</p><p> What are the implications for Ireland?  The UK economy is very important for Ireland and one cannot just get that by looking at trade.  One third of food exports from Ireland go to the United Kingdom which, to my mind, is the key to it all.  A lot of the rest of the exports would be chemicals and pharmaceuticals which are produced by  multinational companies and they will go anyway.  The food sector could be affected.</p><p> Why is the UK so important?  We have two episodes that show us how important the UK is to us and one was the mid-1980s.  We began to recover from the recession in the mid-1980s due to the growth in the UK economy following the loss and boom.  I wrote a paper on this issue a long time ago which showed that the timing of our growth in exports was directly related to the growth of the UK economy and led our recovery.  It took a good few years before it was evident that a recovery was in place.  In the same way, the slow recovery that we are experiencing now began last year and is related to the growth in the UK and US economies.  They are the two factors that have driven our recovery, as well as some domestic foreign direct investment.  For us, the performance of the UK economy is critical.  If the UK weakens then it will lead to a weakening of the growth of this economy and I do not see how such an outcome could be avoided.</p><p> For us, the important things will be trade, foreign direct investment and tourism.  In terms of trade, the effect will be weaker.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe Durkan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->There is no likelihood that FDI that goes to the UK will come to Ireland.  Most of the companies go to the UK because the market is big but they also see access to Europe as important.  Car manufacturers such as Toyota, Nissan and Honda are located there.  If they lost that big market and European springboard, this investment would cease and there would be capital flight.  The companies will not necessarily come here.  I could not imagine companies such as these coming here because our market is small and, therefore, I do not see us gaining much from that.</p><p> With regard to tourism, it is inevitable that a weaker UK economy will lead to weaker tourism.  We experienced this during the current recession.</p><p> Agriculture matters very much to us but it is not clear what would happen in the UK.  It would lose the transfers under the CAP and the UK Government would have to make a decision on whether it would support agriculture.  The amounts are huge.  I saw data that suggest that over the next five years, almost Stg&pound;20 billion will go into agriculture through the CAP.  That money would not be available and, therefore, the UK Government would have to make a decision on supporting agriculture.  The worst scenario from our point of view would be if the government resorted to the same policies it had prior to entry into the EU when the UK had a deficiency payment system under which lower prices were guaranteed to farmers but incomes were maintained through additional payments.  The effect of that was to reduce the price of meat and dairy products, in particular.  Some members may recall that prior to joining the EU, Ireland subsidised the export of butter to the UK because of that deficiency payment system.  We would not want to go back to that but that is a big risk for us, as we would find it hard to sell in the UK.</p><p> The milk quota system was a big barrier to the growth of the agriculture industry.  It conferred income gains to people in the short run but it meant that output was constrained for the past 35 years.  That constraint on milk output meant that the agriculture industry found it hard to develop.  With the lifting of the quota, output will increase by between 40% and 50%.  The producers and processors have geared up for that but our main market is still the UK and we could easily find that market distorted, which is a major risk.</p><p> The risks are high if the UK leaves.  There could also be issues with the Common Fisheries Policy, CFP.  The policy would cease because from the Uk's point of view, it would re-establish control over its fisheries.</p></speech>

I commend the Chairman on holding these hearings in advance of any possibility of Britain leaving the EU.  It is better to be there before the horse bolts.  There is no great economic benefit for Britain in leaving the EU.  It is doing well and it would not be wise to leave.  The general consensus is that no political party in Ireland would even contemplate leaving the EU if Britain left because there would be no benefit whatsoever.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Senator Terry Leyden:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;amp;HouseNum=24&amp;amp;MemberID=636"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Senator Terry Leyden"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=636&amp;amp;pid=TerryLeyden&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Senator Terry Leyden"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->The announcement of the referendum, which is premature with the election in May and when people do not know who will be in power, has undermined the economy before people know who will be in government.  It may be a combination of the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party but the Scottish nationalists do not want to leave.  The Labour Party might be convinced that it is now politically advantageous to hold a referendum.</p><p> Yesterday, 850 jobs were announced by Apple for Athenry.

It is a massive investment and a great endorsement of the country but it did not go to England.  We are giving mobile companies stability and we are the only English speaking country in the region.  There is a massive implication for Britain and all we can do is put across our point of view, which we are doing in a balanced and reasonable manner.  We can first say that we do not want the UK to go and we will do anything we can to persuade it to stay.</p><p> It is good we have a strong Commissioner in the European Commission.

He is one of a number of contributors to the debate and the problem is that it is like playing devil's advocate.  We are considering the ifs and buts that permeate the debate.  The committee started by trying to speculate about the effects on Ireland if Britain pulled out but we have not yet come to terms with the Tories and their suggestion that they will have a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; referendum if they get an overall majority in the next election.  The first hurdle must be overcome, which is whether the Tories get an overall majority.  Most speakers have outlined the lunacy of the current thinking of the Tories and the negative effect of a pull-out, although it is not like unplugging from a socket, for Britain and Ireland.<br/><br/>We have a divided nation, with Six Counties still occupied by the British establishment.  We have the Border and we are in Europe and in the euro, while Britain is in the sterling zone.  The ramifications for Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the Border are tremendously complicated.<br/><br/>With UKIP basically a racist and anti-immigration force at play in Britain, the hysteria was illustrated by the media presenting themselves at airports to see the immigrants who were going to rob the welfare system dry in England.  The media discovered only one man was coming in but he had a job.  Romanians and Bulgarians did not flood in and most people agree the benefit to any nation of inward immigration is because of the motivation of immigrants, who want to work and are productive in the workforce.<br/><br/>What will happen in Northern Ireland politics?  First of all, there is a substantial Unionist representation that takes its seats.  It would be interesting to hear the analysis of how the brothers in the Unionist fraternity would relate to the Conservative Party in Great Britain.  The irony of it is the position of Scotland and, by implication, Wales.  Is there an argument that UKIP, if successful, would eventually end up wrecking the United Kingdom?  Sinn F&eacute;in, being eurosceptic, will not take part in the debate in Westminster.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Eric Byrne:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=142"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Eric Byrne"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=142&amp;amp;pid=EricJByrne&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Eric Byrne"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->How will the political dice in this regard roll <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales?<br/><br/>Some people seek an out in the context of Norway and Switzerland.

As everyone is aware, Switzerland shares borders with France, Italy and Germany and I understand that the result of the referendum to which I refer cannot be implemented because it is not possible to create quotas in respect of European workers entering and leaving particular jurisdictions.<br/><br/>Is it fair to state that we should anticipate that negotiations on the part of Westminster in respect of unravelling whatever treaties the British feel need to be unravelled will probably last two years?  As is the case with Greece, does our guest believe that Britain would find itself very short of friends if it were to leave the current community of 28 member states?  Are there any implications for England in the context of the TTIP negotiations?</p></speech>

A number of questions arose at our previous meetings which I will now put to our guest.  We can tell what would likely be the impact on Britain and Ireland if the former were to exit the EU.  To what extent has the impact on the Union itself of a possible exit been examined?  If Britain leaves, then the Union will be smaller.  In addition, if this course of action were followed, it would be the first occasion on which a member state would leave the Union since its inception as the European Coal and Steel Community.  In a sense, it would also be the first reversal of the European project.</p> <p>  What has motivated the British establishment to contemplate taking this route?  As Deputy Eric Byrne indicated, if the Tories win the forthcoming general election, it is their intention to hold a referendum on this matter.   One is conditional on the other, of course, and an exit might never happen.  In such circumstances, one must query the wisdom of putting forward the proposal relating to a possible exit in the first instance.  What are the issues which motivate members of the British public?  Is it a case of their having an us-and-them view of Europe?  Has Britain ever taken ownership of the European project?  Has it resiled from that project and, if so, to what extent?  How much impact has this had on the entire European integration project?</p> <p>  Mr. Joe Durkan referred to Norway and Switzerland.  The latter is situated in the middle of the European Union and is, therefore, in a very advantageous position geographically.  While not so centrally positioned, Norway has the compensation of its natural resources.  The case of Britain is somewhat different, particularly in the context of its relationship with the island - namely, this one - located off its western shores.  There are some pundits in this country who have suggested that Ireland should also consider leaving the EU.  Such a course of action would be disastrous.  It would give rise to a double whammy by causing major damage to the EU and - by virtue of their isolation from the Continent - the economies of both Ireland and the UK.</p> <p>  Mr. Joe Durkan referred to the City of London and how remarkably and effectively it is integrating with the European area in general.  There would be a serious effect on the level of trade between the City of London and other global financial services centres if the UK were to leave the EU.  The knock-on effect of this would be felt in the UK's economy.  There are suggestions to the effect that if the City of London is doing well in terms of trade, then the remainder of the British economy follows suit.  In the event of Britain removing itself from the EU arena, what will happen to the trade carried out in the City of London?</p></speech>

The United Kingdom is apparently embarking on a process whose conclusion is uncertain, but this exercise is helpful in assisting the committee to a greater understanding of the issues.  Together with the other briefings we have been given, Mr. Durkan's contribution is invaluable.</p> <p>  The first question I intended to ask has already been answered and I have only one other question for the witness.  Mr. Durkan referred to the risks of an EU exit being quite high for the United Kingdom economy in the short to medium term.  I am not an economist and must defer to his vast experience and expertise in these matters.  Will he elaborate on how, in the normal run of things and given the bigger picture, the UK economy would suffer?  I will refrain from asking about the impact on the Irish economy, because we will just have to wait and see how the dice falls in that respect.</p></speech>

My question follows on from that of Deputy Keating.  I take a completely different view from the latter, namely, that the purpose of our having these types of discussions is to consider how we might place ourselves in a state of readiness in the event that the UK does decide to exit the European Union.  Mr. Durkan has set out very clearly the implications of such an outcome and I accept his analysis.  The questions that follow for us relate to the type of contingency planning we should be doing, what types of precautionary measures we should be taking and whether we should include certain measures in our budgetary process that would leave us in a state of readiness in the eventuality of a UK exit.</p></speech>

In his view, can Ireland or any other EU member state exert an influence on the UK's decision?  Going back as far as 1975, despite all media and most parties supporting British membership, the referendum on whether the UK should remain part of the then EEC was only carried by a 2:1 majority.  In 1993, John Major's Government almost fell on the issue of the Maastricht treaty.  Current polls show that the majority of people in Britain want out of the EU for various reasons.</p> <p>  An interesting development in the debate in recent months has been the references to Norway, Sweden and Switzerland - countries which are outside or on the periphery of the EU and have managed to achieve greater growth than any of the best performing countries of the EU or its economy overall.  All three of these countries have direct trade with Europe and their economies are performing exceptionally well.  Will Mr. Durkan comment on that?</p> <p>  It is important to note that it is not just the Conservative Party driving this issue.  Some members of the British Labour Party are very wishy-washy about the EU and cannot give a guarantee on how they will vote.</p></speech>

That is the official policy.  Of course, every party includes members who are sceptical.</p><p>From speaking to people in the British Labour Party, my impression is that there will be a referendum no matter who is in government after the election.  I would go so far as to say there will undoubtedly be a referendum.  Although the majority wanting to leave the EU has reduced and now stands at some 53%, 82% of British people want a referendum on the question.  None of the parties will be able to ignore that.</p><p> IBEC has argued that in the event of a UK exit from the EU, a margin of businesses in Ireland could cede to a more attractive credits-based tax regime in Britain, as set out under Conservative Party proposals.  That party seems determined on having a referendum and on a UK exit.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy John Halligan:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=2315"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy John Halligan"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=2315&amp;amp;pid=JohnHalligan&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy John Halligan"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->It is already beginning to offer tax incentives to businesses to establish operations in Britain.  I imagine Ireland is probably Britain's biggest competitor in this area.</p><p> With respect, I do not believe the influence of the Irish Government will make a bit of difference in this matter.  I base my view on the results of opinion polls, what is stated in the UK press and the actions of those in the Conservative Party and some in the British Labour Party who seem to be hell-bent on having a referendum held and who will probably support an exit from the European Union.</p></speech>

The United Kingdom has a long history of immigration.  Obviously, many Irish people have gone there to live and work.  Has it tended to differentiate between immigration from the countries of the British Commonwealth and that from other European Union member states?  Have studies been carried out of the economics of migration?  In that context, I recall a recent newspaper headline which read, "Is there no one left in Britain who can make a sandwich?"  We all know the point that was being made about the skills, etc., people possess.  Have studies such as those to which I refer been carried out?</p> <p>  Agriculture is extremely important to Ireland, particularly in the context of direct transfers.  In view of the fact that the United Kingdom is a net contributor to the European Union, what impact would a possible exit have on the direct supports we receive?  There are many small holdings in Scotland and Wales and, as a result, both are much more dependent on direct transfers.  What impact would a possible exit have on those involved in farming in these countries, particularly in terms of their ability to remain in operation?</p> <p>  In the context of business - be it small, city-based or whatever else - everyone wants to reduce the amount of red tape which must be dealt with.  Are there specific policies which companies, both large and small, might identify and state that if they were removed, operating would be easier?  Everyone is opposed to red tape, but I am just wondering if there is differentiation in this regard?</p><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an tUasal Joe Durkan.  Different people have come before the committee to discuss this matter and there is agreement that a possible UK exit from the European Union could have a huge impact on Ireland.  As Deputy Bernard J. Durkan inquired, should we be focusing on the possible impact on the European Union in general and the United Kingdom?  We are motivated in terms of the impact it would have on Ireland.  A person who previously appeared before the committee suggested the IFSC was very much viewed as a satellite of the City of London and noted the potential impact an exit could have on Ireland in this context.  Does Mr. Durkan share the concerns expressed by the individual to whom I refer?</p><p> If Britain were to decide to leave, how long would it take to negotiate new trade agreements?  Deputy Timmy Dooley indicated that Ireland needed to put in place contingency plans.  Does Mr. Durkan have suggestions to make in this regard?  The strategy the Tories appear to be pursuing seems to be based on the premise that by announcing an intention to hold a referendum on a possible exit, they will strengthen Britain's hand in negotiations with the European Union.  Does Mr. Durkan share my view in this regard?</p><p> Under the Tories, Britain is seen as one of the most pro-TTIP countries in the European Union.  However, the British Labour Party has indicated that it has major difficulties with the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism.  Some countries in Europe, including France and Germany, have also outlined their concerns about this mechanism.  If Britain does pull out of the European Union, will it have an impact on investment?<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe:</span--><!--a href="http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;amp;HouseNum=31&amp;amp;MemberID=1774"><img src="../images/info.gif" border="0" alt="Information on Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe"/></a--><!--a href="../zoomin?readform&amp;amp;chamber=committees&amp;amp;code=EUJ&amp;amp;memberid=1774&amp;amp;pid=SeanCroweSF&amp;amp;year=2015&amp;amp;month=02&amp;amp;day=24"><img src="../images/zoom.gif" border="0" alt="Zoom on Deputy Se&aacute;n Crowe"/></a--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span-->Another speaker suggested that if Britain was to move under a Tory leadership, certainly it would be much more comfortable moving towards the US in terms of trade.</p></speech>

I wish to ask a question that has not yet been asked, namely, in relation to the financial transaction tax, the Robin Hood tax, the total tax.  Mr. Durkan mentioned in his evidence that he expects the City of London to get more peripheral if the UK pulls out of the European Union.  One of the reasons Ireland was not one of the original 12 or so countries that signed up for the intergovernmental agreement to establish the financial transaction tax in some European countries, was we thought that would drive people from our financial services centre across to the UK.  If the UK withdraws from the European Union does Mr. Durkan expect Ireland to have to sign up for the financial transaction tax?  Would that then become a done deal?  Everyone who wished to contribute has had an opportunity to do so.  Deputy Dooley sends his apologies.  He has another meeting but will read the answer to his question in the transcript.</p><p>Senator Terry Leyden asked about Ireland leaving the European Union.  I thought about it very peripherally and I did not think there was the remotest possibility that we would leave because the balance of advantage for us has to be to stay within the European Union.<br/><br/>Deputy Eric Byrne's questions were mostly political.  I am not heavy into politics but try to think of the economics of things.  When one looks at the UK one has to ask what is driving it.  It seems to me that the referendum is being driven by a small group of people, the Eurosceptics within the Tory Party and the fear of UKIP.  The trouble is that the more these people make noise, the more Mr. Cameron and so on responds to it an attempt to show that he is not being caught offside.  He may be painting himself into a corner - that is what I suspect.  I cannot see, given what everybody believes about the disadvantages to Britain, that it would do something that is not in its interests.  I just do not believe that but the UK could be driven to it if the vote turns out to be the way it is.  I would expect the members of the committee to know more about this than me because they are in the political process and I am not.  I try to avoid it if I can.  <br/><br/>In terms of the negotiations, Article 50 of the treaty allows for people to exit so the procedure is laid down.  I think it would take a long time, it may be two years before it could get out and then it could spend another two years negotiating a trade agreement.  Trade agreements take much longer than one would think.  Switzerland still has not completed its part of EFTA but is not part of the European Economic Area so it still has not got a formal agreement on all the trade that is needed.  I am not really into the politics. <br/><br/>There was a very interesting article in last week's edition of <i>The Economist</i>which talked about the fragmentation of the political system in Britain.  Instead of  being just two parties there is now an awful lot more in it.  One cannot ignore Scotland any more and one cannot ignore Northern Ireland.  I am not sure about how Wales fits in but it has to take account of that.  It will be the United Kingdom leaving the European Union - it is not one bit of it that will leave, the whole lot will leave.  Scotland will not have the option of not leaving, nor will Northern Ireland.  The whole of the United Kingdom will leave.<br/><br/>Deputy Durkan asked me about the really important question, namely, the impact on the European Union.  The European Union will have an interest in concluding a trade deal with Britain.  It is in its interests.  It does not want Britain to be outside.  Britain is still a big market and it sells a lot.  It will want to do a trade deal.  It will not want to be too advantageous for Britain.  Obviously it cannot let Britain decide it will get rid of a whole rake of regulations.  It will still have to conform to the regulations in place.  That is inevitable.  It will not be able to get rid of the red tape.<!--/p--><!--p><span class="speaker_continuing_label">(Speaker Continuing)</span></p--><!--p--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#91;</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">Mr. Joe Durkan:</span--><!--span class="speakercontinuing">&amp;#93;</span--> As for the European project, Britain never bought into it and I am not sure we did either.  Members should bear in mind that this grew out of the Second World War.  I taught a course on European integration to my students and spent three or four lectures talking about what happened after the war because that is the motivation for the European project.  People might forget it because it is 70 years ago but it is still there.  Many people in Germany remember what it was like just after the war.  There was an extraordinary level of displacement as people were forced to leave parts of what is now Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union.  The devastation wrought by that and by similar events throughout Europe is something they do not forget.  We did not experience it so we may not have bought into it.  We bought into it because it looked like it involved money or employment but the originators of the project probably had a different perception of what they were trying to achieve from the one we have.</p><p> I was asked about the performance of the UK economy.  There is no doubt that in the run-up to the referendum investment in the UK will be weaker.  It is inevitable and the consequence of that will be a reduced medium-term performance and a weaker supply side of that economy.</p></speech>

This is not just speculation as it happened in the 1970s at the time of the last referendum.  Investment did actually fall and that inevitably reduces a country's long-run potential growth.  There will be uncertainty if the UK does leave as to what the terms of any trade agreements will be.  Everyone will call for them to remain more or less as they are because otherwise it is very disruptive.  If UK income falls it will impact on Europe because it means Europe will sell less.  It is important we do not see weakness in an economy as an advantage because it really is a disadvantage.  The richer countries become the better it is for everybody because they are then more likely to be able to trade successfully.</p></speech>
