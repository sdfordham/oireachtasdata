Are the minutes of the meeting of 8 March 2017 agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising?  No.</p> <p>  Next on the agenda is the work programme agreed at the meeting of 8 February.  If any member has a suggestion for changes to the programme, please contact the clerk.</p> <p>  The next item is correspondence received.  The list has been circulated.  There is correspondence from the Equality and Rights Alliance and from the Environmental Pillar.  It is proposed that we invite the groups before the committee as part of the scrutiny process for budget 2018.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Another item of correspondence is from the Department of Health in reply to the committee's letter regarding the increase in the costs of the national paediatric hospital.  It is proposed that we review the matter when the full reply comes to hand, in particular in respect of the issue of building costs inflation of 9%.  We can take up that issue next week with the Construction Industry Federation.  This will have implications for the capital budget.  Members may also raise the matter today in our interaction with Transport Infrastructure Ireland.  Is there any other business before we bring in the witnesses?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Nolan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017032200002#B00200"><p>I thank the Chairman of the joint committee for the invitation to attend.  </p> <p>  Before I address the topics tabled by the committee, I will briefly outline what our organisation does.  Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, was established under the Roads Act 2015 which provided for the merger of the staff and functions of the Railway Procurement Agency and the National Roads Authority.  It is a non-commercial semi-State body operating under the aegis of the Department for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It implements policy as determined by the Minister and, accordingly, has operational responsibility for the delivery and maintenance of national roads and light rail-metro infrastructure.  Having said that, we are mindful of the key role transport infrastructure plays in diverse policy areas, including economic development, spatial planning, achieving a regional balance, environmental protection, climate action and sustainability.  TII actively engages, therefore, through the Department and directly with agencies with responsibilities in these areas.  The merging of the organisations has not only brought together management and technical expertise but also significant experience in the management and delivery of the country&rsquo;s most transformational transport infrastructure.  The opening of the Luas cross-city service at the end of this year will provide opportunities for the reallocation of resources to the design and delivery of other TII projects.  TII is uniquely positioned, therefore, to respond quickly and effectively in the design and delivery of new transport infrastructure.</p> <p>  I will now address specific matters of interest which come within the remit of TII.  The first is the current status of the Building on Recovery programme of works.  The capital investment plan, Building on Recovery, provides for the construction of eight major national road projects.  It also identifies five other projects to be progressed to construction, subject to achieving planning consent.  The total allocation for this investment is &euro;730 million.  However, 90% of this funding is profiled over the last three years of the seven-year plan.  This funding profile dictates that most projects can only hit construction phase after 2019, with the exception of the widening of the M7 at Naas, which will start earlier.  TII's strategy is to advance enabling and de-risking works during the early years of the plan.  Under the current PPP programme, three new major roads are under construction.  These are the M17-M18, Gort to Tuam motorway; the N25, New Ross bypass and the M11, Gorey to Enniscorthy motorway.  This PPP programme is on target and set to deliver significant benefits and value for money.  It should be noted that roads have been excluded from the next phase of the PPP programme.</p> <p>  TII is working closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on the Government's mid-term review of the capital investment plan.  While the detail of submission to the Department forms part of an ongoing deliberative process, the focus of the submission concentrates on increasing funding for maintenance and renewal works, accelerating projects within the capital investment programme, constructing additional projects, progressing the planning of other road projects deemed critical to support a growing population and economic recovery and mitigating some of the potential negative impacts of Brexit.  As it can take five years to achieve planning consent for a major road project, there will be a shortfall in the number of projects available for inclusion in subsequent capital investment plans.  Failure to prepare for future needs will lead to increased congestion, longer and less reliable journey times, roads that are less safe, higher costs and suppressed economic activity.</p> <p>  In respect of national roads, TII's main priorities are aligned with the three key priorities of set out in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport's document, Investing in our Transport Future &ndash; A Strategic Investment Framework for Land Transport, which was published in August 2015.  They are to achieve and maintain steady state maintenance and renewal of the national road network, to address urban congestion and to maximise the contribution of transport infrastructure to national development.  Funding for national road maintenance and renewals has reduced severely since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008.  Between 2008 and 2016, maintenance funding reduced by approximately 35%.  Infrastructure requires investment in renewals if the network is to be resilient and perform safely and efficiently.  Without the necessary levels of investment, the condition of the network will deteriorate and the value of the assets reduce.  Sustained under-investment inevitably results in long-term damage and reduced asset value, together with diminished benefits and additional costs for road users.  The cost of deferred interventions significantly exceeds that of undertaking timely maintenance and renewals of the strategic asset.  This view is shared by the Department which is working towards the restoration by 2020 of the requisite funding for pavement renewals.</p> <p>  TII recognises that alleviating urban congestion will increasingly focus on encouraging a modal shift to public transport, walking and cycling for commuting and short distance trips.  It will seek to build on the success of the Luas and continue to support and promote the delivery of high quality public transport in urban areas, including the new metro north and other Luas extensions.  However, there remains a need to address sections of urban national roads where existing bottlenecks diminish the strategic function of the network as it serves and facilitates a growing economy.  Our studies have identified a number of schemes where enhanced management of and improvements to the key urban national road links are required.  Furthermore, the construction of minor improvement projects on the network contributes to the overall safety of the network.</p> <p>  Efficient and reliable transport infrastructure is recognised as a key driver of economic growth.  A well functioning transport network secures connectivity between different parts of a country, as well as with the rest of the world, linking people with jobs, delivering products to markets, underpinning supply chains and logistics and supporting domestic and international trade.  Given the uncertainty in global economics and the potential impact of Brexit, there will inevitably be a greater reliance on the strategic transport network.  Ensuring the free movement of goods and people across Ireland to both domestic and international markets is vital to strengthen the resilience of Ireland's economy.  To ensure the transport network does not create bottlenecks in the future expansion of the economy, TII recommends the creation of a modest pipeline of major projects that are "ready to tender" and primed for delivery.</p> <p>  TII welcomes the advancement of the national planning framework.  The current absence of a framework for long-term planning has impacted on the delivery of major infrastructural schemes.  TII recognises the significance of the national planning framework and will continue to support the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government through active engagement and access to TII's modelling and analysis tools.</p> <p>  Of all land-based exports to the United Kingdom, between 65% and 80% are destined for markets outside the United Kingdom.  Therefore, the introduction of hard borders could have a significant impact on the manner in which land-based exports operate.  TII is progressing schemes to improve access to Cork Port at Ringaskiddy and to Foynes and constructing an upgrade to the M11 which will enhance the link between Rosslare and the capital.  The continued progression of these schemes will be important in strengthening Ireland's resilience to meet the impact of Brexit.  In addition, as the peripherality of Border counties could be increased, strengthening links both within and to the north west will be required to ensure these communities can be sustained.  The need to upgrade substandard Border approaches has influenced our deliberations on contributions to the mid-term review of the capital investment plan.</p> <p>  I will now address capacity to ensure the delivery of major transport projects.  As stated previously, following the merger and through our partnership with local authorities, TII is uniquely positioned to respond to ensure an increase in activity in the design and planning of major transport projects.  Based on our experience of ramping up previous infrastructural programme and our in-depth knowledge of the sector, TII is comfortable regarding the capacity of the construction and engineering design sectors or the risk of cost inflation.</p> <p>  I have kept my opening remarks brief, but we will be happy to answer questions about any issue raised or any other matter of interest.  Should we not have the information requested to hand, we will follow up with a written response.</p></speech>

I will have to leave shortly after my questions are answered.  It is a pleasure to have the officials in attendance.  This is one of a series of presentations at this committee in the run-up to the budget and the wider capital review.  Mr. Nolan said that a number of roads projects are ready for tender and primed for delivery.  Could he give me a rough indication of how many roads projects are in that category and what the approximately budget for them might be?  I presume they all involve public private partnership, PPP, in which case it is hard to know exactly what the contracts will entail.  Can Mr. Nolan give me a rough outline of how many projects will be pursued within a five-year or seven-year timeframe and, based on the three PPP projects that are being developed at present, what sort of budget will be involved?  I would appreciate it if Mr. Nolan could also outline to me what public transport projects are in the same category of ready for tender and primed for delivery.  What public transport projects are being considered for Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford, in addition to the metro north and Luas extension projects in Dublin that have been mentioned?  I would be interested to know what Luas extension projects are being considered.  I would appreciate it if the Chairman were to allow me to come back in with a second question after Mr. Nolan has answered this one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Nolan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017032200002#C00200"><p>For the avoidance of doubt, we are saying we are recommending the creation of a modest pipeline of projects which are ready for tender and primed for delivery.  At the moment, we have just one project outside the capital investment plan that is ready to go to tender on the roads side.  On the public transport side, we do not have any schemes that are ready to go to tender.  That is where we are.  We are saying we need to invest more money in the forward planning of roads schemes and public transport schemes because we need to ensure they are ready for future capital investment plans.  At the moment, the number of schemes in our preparation pool is quite low.  We have just one small scheme ready to go.</p></speech>

Does it have an outline business-as-usual budget figure under the existing capital plan?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Nolan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017032200002#C00400"><p>Under the existing capital investment plan, the value of the additional contribution from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is approximately &euro;730 million spread over seven years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017032200002#C00500"><p>Okay.  I would like to make a broader point.  When representatives of IBEC made a presentation before this committee, my heart sank from an environmental perspective because they seemed to want motorways and roads everywhere.  It was clear to me when I looked at our national climate mitigation plan last week that we are doing nothing on the transport side for climate mitigation.  Our emissions are increasing sharply and we are facing a bill of at least &euro;500 million in the near future.  It seems that there are no plans in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  Every time we talk to people on the inside, we are told that nothing is happening.  There is no ambition to do anything on climate.  When I see the roads proposals of groups like IBEC, there seems to be an even smaller prospect of us cutting emissions.  It is slightly disappointing that the presentation we have heard this afternoon, like the submission we received from TII in advance of today's meeting, is all about roads and has no vision for public transport.  Even though the national planning framework is open for consultation, TII seems to be all about roads and not about the investment in public transport, walking and cycling that is required if we are to build up our cities, towns and villages.  When people told me at the time of the merger that it was, in effect, an NRA takeover of the RPA, I did not know whether that was a bit harsh.  It seems from the presentation that has been made here today that we are back to looking at an old-fashioned roads programme with no acknowledgement of the congestion that is happening, the crisis that is facing our cities and the gridlock that is about to ensue.  There is no acknowledgement whatsoever of the climate change challenge we face.  Mr. Nolan did not refer to that challenge in his presentation.</p></speech>

We are working closely with the National Transport Authority, NTA, which has set out a vision for public transport within the greater Dublin area.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has signed off on that strategy, which was published by the NTA last year.  We do not stray into policy areas with regard to the public transport arena.  That is a matter for the NRA.  I acknowledged in my statement that public transport is the solution for much of the congestion around Dublin at the moment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1311" speakername="John Lahart" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017032200002#C00700"><p>Essentially, TII has been given no work to do in the public transport area.</p></speech>

We have started our work on the design of the new metro north.  Perhaps my colleague, Mr. Walsh, will speak about what is happening on the capital programme side.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Walsh" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017032200002#C00900"><p>Public transport policy falls under the remit of the NTA.  That is why Mr. Nolan did not stray into that area.  We will deliver the projects as mandated to us by the NTA.  The Luas cross-city project is currently being progressed on the ground.  The new metro north project is in planning.  One of the other projects we hope to start this year is the extension of the Luas to Lucan, which is part of the greater Dublin area transport strategy.  We are suggesting that we should look at the possibility of further extending the green line to Finglas.  I will mention another area that might be of interest.  As a result of the adoption of the Galway transport strategy, we have been asked to take on the requirement for bus routes in the western part of the city.  We will be starting into that this year as well.</p></speech>

I think Deputy Ryan is driving at the setting of policies and goals.  TII has not been given any particular material goals outside the two projects Mr. Nolan has mentioned - the metro north project and the Luas cross-city project, which is under way at the moment.</p></speech>

We are asking witnesses about matters for which they are not responsible.  We are going into areas of transport policy and development that may or may not be worthy of the interest of the Chair and other members of the committee.  We are supposed to be fulfilling the role of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.  In all honesty, it is a bit of a reach to bring in a particular sectoral area as we have done today.  Obviously, that was agreed to by the committee.  With due respect to Deputy Ryan and the Chair, when the conversation starts to move into transport policy areas for which various agencies that are not represented at this meeting are responsible, I think we are going way beyond where this committee should be going.</p></speech>

While I thank TII for its superbly detailed submission, the contents of the documents we have received are utterly depressing.  I have a different perspective on the need for roads projects, particularly in the part of the country I come from.  We shared our views beforehand.  As a committee, we are preparing a review of the capital programme.  Projects are part of the capital programme.  It is completely within our remit to have this discussion.  If Deputy Brophy has a problem with it, he should have raised that before the start of the committee's business.  The detailed submissions that were e-mailed to us early last week are focused on projects.  The frustrations of this agency with regard to PPPs have been very well articulated.  I intend to pursue that matter further.  I think we are completely within our remit.</p></speech>

I would like to ask questions about staffing and costing, etc.  The issue is what kind of funding we can get for the agency on the capital side.  Therefore, I think it is fair enough to ask questions about the projects.  The depressing thing is that there is no pipeline.  We want to get a pipeline.  We want to find out how we can get the money to do that.</p></speech>

It is important for us to look at what we prioritise.  We cannot make such decisions until we get some of the details.</p><p>I become depressed when I hear the agencies say that we do not need to look at a Luas extension to Poolbeg because that is some way off.  As a representative of that area, in a city facing a housing crisis and absolute gridlock, I believe it should be a priority.  There should be an urgency on the part of the agency represented here in the context of doing the design research.  I was involved with the Dublin Transportation Office in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  I remember our priority then, its clear, demonstrable signal, was that whatever you do, build public transport first, build metro first - this was 17 years ago - and then do the roads.  We did the exact opposite and as a result the city is gridlocking and we have a crisis.  This is a hugely significant funding issue.</p><p>  How many staff does TII have actively working on design for new Luas or metro projects in Dublin?  I presume it is nothing for Cork, Galway, Limerick or Waterford.  Of the &euro;700 million that TII has to spend, how much will go to public transport?</p></speech>

The point I was trying to make in the context of the interjections is that it is important, when asking about the areas to which one can contribute, to focus on the areas in which one has the direct knowledge and ability to contribute and not to other people's area.</p> <p>  I have a specific question regarding congestion on the M50.  The matter is referred to in the TII submission.  There is a reference to multi-point tolling and the management of the M50 but I am interested in discovering what alleviation work, apart from tolling, can be considered in the context of the M50?  Is that something on which the TII representatives can comment?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Maher" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CBO2017032200002#D01200"><p>As Deputy Brophy points out, the M50 demand management study of 2014 identified a number of initiatives which could be employed on the M50.  Ultimately, fiscal measures were identified as the only long-term effective means of managing congestion on the M50.  A number of other areas were identified as short and medium-term measures.</p> <p>  We have undertaken a number of initiatives relating to the M50.  It is important to point out that traffic on the M50 has been growing very much in line with the rebound in the economic sphere.  For example, last year there was 7% growth, 6% the previous year and 5% the year before that.  Take, for example, the section between the Lucan and Blanchardstown exits, where the existing toll is approximately 135,000 vehicles daily.  To deal with that we have improved junction layouts in terms of merging, to smooth the flow of traffic in and that has helped.  We work closely with our colleagues and counterparts in different agencies including the Garda S&iacute;ochana, the local authorities and the fire service, in relation to expediting and improving responses to incidents as they occur.  One of the key things is that as there is more congestion, there is a disproportionate increase in incidents such as rear-end collisions, and when traffic is on a knife-edge in its capacity the consequences of those incidents can be very severe.  We have a very active inter-agency co-ordination group on traffic management and that has contributed significantly to improvements in efficiency in the way we deal with incidents as they occur.  Recently, we have put up new signage identifying signed diversion routes for traffic if an incident occurs.  All of this is helpful to the road user when faced with a significant delay on the M50.</p> <p>  We have also commenced work on a scheme for the deployment of variable speed limits on the M50.  That involves, first, the installation of lane-control signalling, which allows us to better manage the traffic in the event of incidents and it also allows for us to more safely manage the M50; in other words, if an incident occurs in a lane we can close it down.  It protects the people involved and the emergency services.  As part of that, the intelligence transport system infrastructure, ITS - the variable message signs - will allow for the deployment of variable speed limits.  As congestion builds, if one reduces the speed of the traffic, then counter-intuitively, one allows a greater capacity to get through.  The primary benefit is safety but there is a benefit to capacity; when one slows down the traffic and increases headway, one avoids stop-start traffic.  This is something that has been employed quite effectively in the UK and other European countries.  We are working on a scheme with the intention of having it up and running in 2019.  That will buy us some time in relation to the performance of the M50.  Ultimately, if traffic volumes continue to rise as they are, we will experience further congestion.  At that point, a decision will have to be made in respect of the M50 as to the implementation of fiscal measures such as additional tolling, to achieve a better management of demand.  Before that happens, the necessary public transport alternatives need to be in place, but we do need to look at that scenario.   The year 2023 was identified as the horizon in the April 2014 demand management report.  By next year we will be more or less at the traffic volumes that were envisaged in 2014.</p></speech>

I am a daily user of the M50 and anyone who uses it can see the economic recovery in the country is directly correlated to the level of traffic on the M50.  It is probably the best barometer one could have of it.</p> <p>  I am sure the Chairman will agree with my next point.  We represent the same constituency and we made it previously to colleagues of the witnesses.  I was very pleased to hear TII's final contribution regarding the development of public transport alternatives within the context of developments relating to the M50.  The major concern for people who live directly adjacent to the M50 relates to the introduction of multi-point tolling and the financial implications of moving traffic off the motorway and into surrounding areas.</p><p>It would, on a social level, be unacceptable to the communities living there.  It would also have knock-on implications for businesses trying to operate in the immediate vicinity of the M50.  There is an inherent design problem with the M50.  We built it and then opened up development on every single junction on it that in a very short period of time made it go from a circulatory ring road, which people used to circumnavigate the city and cut out the traffic, to a distribution road for local traffic.<font color="#FF22FF"></font>Mr. Maher made the point about public transport and other considerations before tolling would ever be considered.  It might solve the M50 problem but it would be devastating for areas immediately adjacent to it.</p></speech>

Is the scheme for the moderation of speed funded?  I live right beside the M50 and I agree that moderating the speed will improve the capacity and reduce the potential for accidents, of which there are many and which bring it to a standstill.</p></speech>

The luxury of having a Luas to Lucan is lovely but there has to be adequate road surface.  The presentation was incredibly frustrating; I was getting madder and madder as I read it.  I want to bring the witnesses through a couple of areas their presentations.  In their submission, they say the current rules of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform state that PPPs cannot be used for roads in future.  Why is that?  Deputy Eamon Ryan asked a question about TII's pipeline.  If PPPs could be used, what would that change in the delivery capacity of the pipeline, given that the only projects being delivered at the moment are three PPP projects?</p> <p>  I can ask all my questions or go through them one by one, whichever the Acting Chairman prefers.  </p></speech>

We have used that funding for primary care centres this year.  TII is precluded from accessing Juncker plan funding for roads here because of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform rules on PPPs.</p></speech>

In the area of national roads, we have quite a few PPPs.  We have delivered 14 PPPs to date, including the three currently under construction.</p></speech>

It is &euro;3 billion in private finance which all has to be paid back through tolls or availability payments.  That &euro;3 billion has delivered &euro;5 billion worth of infrastructure.  It is very hard to see how we would have the network we have today without PPP as without it there would be huge gaps.  When many of the PPP projects were mandated, at a time when the country was quite well off and during the second national development plan, it was quite clear that PPP funding was additional to what was being provided by direct Exchequer funding.  There was a very large direct Exchequer funded infrastructure programme as well.  A key thing for us when talking about PPP is additionality.  It is very hard to see how, without PPP, that gap in funding would have been filled with direct Exchequer funding for what has been achieved to date.  The 10% cap is an aggregate across all expenditure headings.  TII has got quite a large PPP programme and some other areas have much smaller PPP programmes.  The 10% cap applies on a whole-of-Government spending basis.  That is something to bear in mind.  It is pro-cyclical because the 10% cap is leveraged off the current annual capital allocations.  Where the capital envelope reduces, the 10% cap also reduces.  It is pro-cyclical.  We are at a time of quite low capital expenditure at the moment and it reinforces that.  During the height of the fiscal crisis, the European Investment Bank and, slowly but surely, foreign commercial banks started lending back into PPP projects in Ireland at a time when there was no head room for increasing Exchequer funding for infrastructure.  We were sourcing and with the second PPP programme, that is, the stimulus programme that was announced in 2012, there was some significant investment coming in funded through PPP.  That was a countercyclical funding stimulus at the time.  If this rule applied then, it would rule out those PPPs.  It is a policy issue.  It has a significant impact on what we can bring in terms of PPP procurement.</p></speech>

The planning phase also requires a significant amount of capital.  The PPP essentially funds the construction phase of the project and then the operation and maintenance.  Typically, approximately 60% to 70% of the total cost of a project is addressed by the PPP.  The other costs such as getting through design, planning and acquiring land are always for the direct Exchequer funding line.</p><p>We have such a thin pipeline of future projects that it is really hard to see where we could apply a public-private partnership, PPP, procurement right now.  I will hand over to Mr. Nolan, who looks after the planning side.</p></speech>

This would make a person cry.  We will be building fewer kilometres of road in 2025 than we are building at the moment.  We are told that the country is going to recover and there will be capital available and infrastructure available.  There are grand plans for the M50, a Luas line to Lucan and a Luas line to Poolbeg but, in terms of the projected plans, we will be building fewer kilometres of road in 2025 than we are at the moment.

That is probably depressing viewing at the moment.  However, we are working closely with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on contributing to the mid-term review of the capital investment plan.  One of the challenges that we have is the low level of schemes being prepared and going through the preparation pool to have them ready for any subsequent capital investment plan.  The Department is conscious of that.  They are working closely with us.  We have submitted a list of schemes that we think could go forward.  They are high value schemes with a lot of benefits such as closing gaps on the network.  If we could get three or five years funding we would have them ready for any subsequent capital investment plan and then have them ready for construction.</p> <p>  At the moment, we only have two schemes ready to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la at the moment, subject to getting approval for the business case.  Those are the Listowel bypass and a scheme on the N5 between Scramogue and the Ballaghaderreen bypass.  We have a number of schemes listed in the capital investment plan that are going through the planning phase.  Those are the Galway city transport project and ring road, the N28 Cork to Ringaskiddy road, the N29 Limerick to Foynes road, the Slane bypass and the Mallow inner relief road.  There are a few schemes outside that which were prepared before the capital investment plan was published.  Beyond that, we have very little activity in preparing schemes to go to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That is the focus of our submission to the Department on the mid-term review.  We are hoping that flat line going to 2025 will never materialise.</p></speech>

Maybe it is down to what the economy cannot afford not to be happening in view of the growing population.  The national planning framework which is to come out at the end of this year or early next year will put an emphasis on re-balancing regional growth and sharing the benefits of a rising economy.  We realise that we are running out of schemes to present to the Department for any new capital investment plan.  The Taoiseach mentioned that we should be looking at ten year rather than five year capital investment plans.  We have not provided a graphic to illustrate the life cycle of a major project.  It takes between five and 13 years to bring a scheme from conception through to opening and operation.</p></speech>

We are working to the same EU rules on environmental protection legislation, procurement directives and remedies.  People can bring challenges to projects at any stage from conception right through to scheme close-out.  Major projects are challenging and they are becoming more challenging.  A new European Economic Area, EEA, directive will be issued in May which will bring in more parameters to protect the environment, particularly the human environment.  The bar is set quite high, but it is a bar that is set across Europe.  This means that we need to plan now for what our needs will be ten years from now.  The journey on those projects needs to be started now rather than discovering in five years that we have very little to work with.</p></speech>

"Turning to gateways and hubs, a very similar story emerges.  Most gateways and hubs have enjoyed significant increases in employment accessibility."  That refers to the last major investment in roads and road upgrades.  "Ballina, Castlebar and Sligo experienced negligible improvements."  However, I see nothing in any of the documents here that deals with the N26 or the N4.  Is the N4 programme in planning or is it coming near to planning?  The Ballaghaderreen to Scramogue project is mentioned.  That goes back to the other document about the impact of road programmes on employment.  There are 3,500 jobs depending on the N5 scheme.  Those jobs are provided by multinationals in Mayo who are experiencing product damage because of the poor surface of that road.  In the context of the national capital review, protection of employment in regions is a priority because it is very difficult to get new employment there.  Does the TII take that into account in the lists it is currently submitting to the Department?  I do not see anything about the N26 or the N4 in the plans here.</p></speech>

If we do not do that the network pavements will progressively degrade over time.  The problem with pavements is that they do not depreciate in a linear way but are fine for a while before, quite quickly and severely, degrading towards the end of their lives.  If we do not get in before that happens the consequences are very severe and we end up having to spend a great deal more to bring them back to their former state.  Since the financial crisis and over the past six years, we have experienced a deficit of funding for pavements which we can manage for a while and we have done that but, eventually, one cannot do any more as one is trying to plug too many holes at the same time.  In these cases there is a significant deterioration in the overall condition of the network.  This does not happen overnight but we need to look at it on a 20-year horizon, based on a knowledge of how pavements deteriorate and what the costs and consequences are when one goes beyond a certain point.</p></speech>

The graph shows a sharp downturn from the peak in construction in 2005, 2006 or 2008 to a very low point in 2010.  We started a programme of minor schemes which included the N71, N72 and N73.  These minor schemes addressed 2 km or 3 km of really nasty pieces of national secondary, normally legacy, roads.  Our 50 worst bends programme was kick-started in 2010.  We have undertaken about 60 to 70 minor projects since 2010.  This year I believe we have seven under construction.  Unfortunately, with our funding at its lowest level ever, we will only have one or two such schemes next year.  The minor schemes programme will come to an end next year.  We are still trying to have a preparatory pool of about 50 minor schemes ready to bring to the next stage when funding becomes available.</p></speech>

Part of our submission to the Department on the mid-term review was that we could do more on the minor schemes.  We had a target of delivering 150 minor projects in the seven-year life of the road safety strategy, as published by the Government.  We will probably get to about 43 or 44 of those schemes.  Because of funding constraints, we will be well short of that target.  These minor schemes are low cost and high value because we will be taking out some really nasty pieces of the network that have been long-fingered for a long time.  There is a big safety dividend and they are very well received locally.  The planning applications go through An Bord Plean&aacute;la quite easily because there are very few objections to such projects.  We would like to keep that programme of work going because we have developed an aptitude and local authorities are well skilled in delivering small schemes.  It entails considerable discussion and consultation with local communities and landowners and local authorities are well placed to do this.  It has also meant that many small contractors have had a lifeline since 2010 during the recession.  Such projects do not really attract the big players; they attract small family-based companies that employ locally.  They are of a scale that they can handle.</p></speech>

They are targeted, with 90% being on national secondary routes - low volume roads in peripheral areas with low density populations.</p></speech>

The Luas cross-city project is close to completion and will be another great asset for the capital city.  Dublin Airport has reached the figure of 28 million passengers and is heading towards its cap.  It could be heading to become a Gatwick-sized airport.  What is its status?  When he was here a few months ago the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, had us hopping on metro north around 2026 or 2027, which seems like an incredible time into the future.  What work has been done so far?  As Mr. Nolan knows, Fingal County Council is now 100% behind the project which will assist the county.  The local authority received the accolade from the chambers of commerce of being No. 1 in the country for its economic and social planning and so on.  What steps are we taking?  Is it possible to expedite the project to have some system in place to assist Dublin's north side, in particular Fingal and the airport which is such a driver of economic growth?</p></speech>

We are effectively starting with a clean page for metro north which will have to connect Dublin city centre with the airport and on to Swords.  Beyond that, no particular constraint was put on us.  We are obliged to look at it afresh, which we are doing.  The elements that need to be teased out fully are where we will tie into the green line south of the city centre; where we will interact with the city centre and the DART underground service; and the positioning of stations within the city centre.  The positioning at Dublin Airport is fixed and we know exactly where we are going.  The manner in which we will interact with Swords is still being looked at.  The programme is to have the alignment, the preferred route, selected by quarter one of next year.  The public consultation phases will start at the end of this year, in engaging with Fingal County Council, the other local authorities and other interests such as the Dublin Airport Authority prior to that.  By July we will probably be clear on a number of the engineering questions relating to the alignment and can then progress from there.  The plan is to be at An Bord Plean&aacute;la by 2021 and have construction complete by 2026 or 2027.  I know that it might seem like a long way away, but it is a very big project.</p></speech>

I am absolutely delighted to get the opportunity to put questions to these gentlemen on infrastructure projects.</p><p>First, members have attended presentations in Buswells Hotel by organisations such as IBEC.  In the view of IBEC, Ireland has the lowest level of infrastructure <i>per capita</i>than in any other country in Europe.  I want to ascertain the reason for that.  Is it that the TII does not have the projects shovel ready?  Is it that the Government will not fund it even though we are being told that money was never cheaper to borrow than at present?  It is not as if the work is not there to be done, because my county is completely destroyed for the want of proper infrastructure.  We cannot attract jobs, investment of any kind, creed or description.  Where did Kerry Co-op, our own jewel in the crown, finish up?  A few miles out the road on the side of the motorway in County Kildare, because we did not have the proper infrastructure to keep that technology project in Kerry.  The infrastructure is not there.</p><p>Is the Government not making an attempt to provide the funding to source it?  We have been waiting for more than 30 years for the Macroom bypass and the precursor of TII, the NRA, gave a fine presentation with maps in the Malton Hotel, Killarney, in 2004 about the Killarney bypass.  That was 13 years ago and it was about to start at that time but there is no account of what happened to those plans.  Were the plans binned?  </p><p>I was interested to hear Deputy Broughan speak about the N72, and he mentioned as far as Rathmore, but between Rathmore and Killarney there is a bridge that is a couple of hundred years old; it is like a nest going around it and the railway goes under it.  What is the plan for that bridge?  There are bends at Gortahaneboy about which we have been asking at county council meetings for years.  Our renowned footballer and now dancer, Aidan O'Mahony is very local to Gortahaneboy and the stretch of bends where people have been killed.  When will funding for road works be provided?  Does TII have its part of the programme ready?  Is it a matter of getting funding from the Government?  Let me mention three bridges, Listry Bridge, Caragh Bridge and Curraheen Bridge on the Ring of Kerry, which were built approximately 250 years ago and on which traffic is reduced to one-lane traffic.  They were built in the days of the horse and cart and two horses and carts could pass but now two motor cars cannot pass.  The bridges were narrowed to ensure that it is one-way traffic, with traffic in the other direction having to stop.</p><p>The TII witnesses referred to Dublin which has the Luas, the DART and the railway tracks to the North, but in fairness the people in rural Kerry need a fair crack as well.  We have not been getting it and the way things are going, I do not know if we ever will.  I ask the Chairman not to blame me for highlighting the needs of County Kerry, which were brought to our attention by IBEC.  </p><p>Has the TII a sufficient number of shovel-ready projects because the west is lacking proper roads and motorways?  The people have come up to Dublin but they cannot buy a house because they would not be able to pay for it.  One hears reports every morning of a person or two who has been murdered.  There is no law or order here because the authorities cannot manage the number of people in the city.</p></speech>

We take the money from the Exchequer and it is routed through the Vote of the Houses and it comes through the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We can only spend according to the funding we receive from Government.  We know we are under funded.  We have been doing more.

That was at the peak, the really high point.  There is a great deal of work to be done.  We are very conscious of schemes around the country.</p> <p>  In County Kerry, there are two schemes that people from Kerry County Council tell us will have a big benefit to Kerry, namely, the N22 scheme from Macroom to Ballyvourney and then the Limerick-Adare-Foynes scheme.  These are two big schemes to deal with bottlenecks in getting to County Kerry.  The Macroom-Ballyvourney bypass will go to construction in 2020 or thereabouts.  We are at the design stage of the Limerick to Adare to Foynes scheme.  We hope to get that to An Bord Plean&aacute;la by year end or early next year.  We recognise the Adare bypass as one of the last big bottlenecks in the country outside the urban areas.  </p> <p>  We have been active in County Kerry in the past few years.  Since the recession we have built the Castleisland and Tralee bypasses, two major projects.</p></speech>

We have approximately 60 schemes in the country that have been suspended and unfortunately Killarney is among that number.</p> <p>  With regard to the bridges on the Ring of Kerry, and obviously for safety reasons these bridges are not wide enough to take two lanes of traffic passing safely.  It is down to one-lane traffic on a number of bridges around the country.  If the current funding level persists, unfortunately we probably will be doing a lot more of that.  We are spending some money on the Ring of Kerry, and there are a number of schemes on the Ring of Kerry that are in our minor works programme and in the preparation pool.  We have an excellent national roads office, manned and staffed by Kerry County Council and that office is based in Castleisland.  There is an excellent team there that has a fantastic record of delivering many major projects, not just in Kerry but also in the region.  That level of experience and knowledge is still residing in Kerry County Council in the national roads office.  They have another design office in the headquarters.  The staff in Kerry are well positioned to avail of any additional coming in the next few years.  They have the capacity to deliver on major and minor projects</p></speech>

However, as politicians, we are getting a serious bashing with regard to our roads, particularly in west Cork.  If we want to create employment and bring jobs to rural communities, we need good roads, but the roads in west Cork, to be honest, are in an appalling condition and have been for quite some time.  I am talking about the main routes.  Local area engineers have been working very hard to repair many of the local roads that were seriously damaged last year but the condition of the main routes into west Cork, the N71 in particular, is worse than scandalous.  The journey from Clonakilty to Skibbereen, which should be a 20 minute drive, could take 45 minutes because if there is a lorry or tractor on the road, one is held up behind it for the whole way.  We need simple passing bays and I have suggested that in a meeting with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and members of Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, recently.  Passing bays should be considered and they are not being considered.  We are looking for simple solutions.  I am here to urge the witnesses to look at simple solutions for west Cork and to consider bigger solutions as time goes on.</p> <p>  How do the witnesses determine what area gets funding?  Why have we been left at the very tail end of any funding?  We get a little bit of repair money if a road collapses, as happened in Ballydehob last year.  It was almost six months before the road was repaired.  One section of it was closed off and there was not one day when my phone was not hopping with people wanting to know what I would do about it.  Overall, why are we not on the map, as such, when it comes to serious funding for our roads - the N71 serving Innishannon, Bandon, Clonakilty, Skibbereen and Ballydehob and the R586, serving Bandon, Dunmanway, Drimoleague, Bantry and Castletownbere?  These are roads that need investment if we are serious about trying to open up rural Ireland for business.  I would appreciate it if the witnesses would answer some of those questions.</p></speech>

Cork has not been bypassed.  Two of the biggest schemes that are included in the capital investment plan are in Cork, namely, Dunkettle and the N22 from Ballyvourney to Macroom.  The Cork to Ringaskiddy project is going through the planning process and it is hoped that will be brought to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the next month or two.  We have not taken our eye off the ball with regard to Cork schemes.  Three of the very low number of schemes in the capital investment plan are based in Cork.  We could be doing an awful lot more on the N71 and the scheme to west Cork.  There is probably more traffic on the section of the N71 into Cork city than on some of our national primary routes throughout the country.  It is a really busy route and we recognise that.  Maybe we will look at interim solutions such as passing bays.  We will have a look at that and take the Deputy's suggestion on board.  I thank the Deputy for that suggestion.  Given that we cannot build greenfield complete realignments, we may have to resort to short and medium-term measures on some routes, if we have the funding.</p></speech>

We are very grateful for their expertise and knowledge over the years and we want to recognise that.  They are a powerful unit.</p> <p>  The witnesses said that the Killarney bypass has been suspended because there are financial constraints in the country.  There were two parts to that project, the first from Farranfore, bypassing Killarney town and on to the N22.  There was another section going from Lissivigeen across to the Muckross road.  If that scheme could be halved, that would only be about a quarter of the total cost of the entire Killarney bypass.  That would mean an awful lot to the town of Killarney, which is choked in the summertime.  As the witnesses will appreciate, traffic coming from the south west, from Waterville, Sneem and Kenmare, must go through the centre of Killarney town to go to other parts of the country, like Tralee, for example.  They have no business whatsoever going into the town of Killarney, and likewise when they are going back.  It has the effect of choking the town.  While we are grateful for and appreciate so much business in Killarney, traders are afraid that people will get annoyed about being parked on the Muckross road for an hour to an hour and a half and will go to other places and other towns throughout the country.</p></speech>

What is going to be done to save the infrastructure?  It has been there for almost 20 years now without much maintenance.  It needs to get attention and funding.</p></speech>

As I said, it is not just the Killarney bypass that has been suspended or even a portion of it.  There are approximately 60 schemes throughout the country that have been suspended.  We just do not have the funding that we require.  As we said earlier, we have a very low level of schemes going through the planning pool and a very low level of funding to enable us to bring more schemes to that pool.  That is one of the big challenges we are facing a the moment.  As the economy turns around, recovers and that recovery is sustained, we will not have enough schemes to present for construction.  That is one of the challenges and is part of the conversation we are having with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport as we speak.  It is not just Killarney; it is widespread.</p> <p>  Regarding the surface of the N22 from Killarney to the county boundary, we do condition surveys every year on the entire road network.  As I said earlier, we are only spending between &euro;40 million and &euro;50 million on paving restoration and paving renewal, but we should be spending about &euro;100 million more than that.  Again, in terms of asset renewal, we are way behind where we need to be on resurfacing and I am sure this is one of those national primary routes that is suffering because of that.</p></speech>

I am interested to hear their perspective on park and ride facilities, especially in urban settings.  Many Dublin Deputies represent areas where, despite being in the city or suburbia, not everybody lives close to a bus stop.  If people are living half a mile from a bus stop, they are not going to be enthusiastic about walking to it and it is not always practical to do so.  At the same time, we punish people who attempt to park and ride, with double yellow lines, parking meters and so forth.  I see it in my own constituency, in Rathfarnham, Templeogue and so on.  While that was legitimate and justifiable, we put those people back on the roads, more than likely in their cars.  I am not looking for funding but am wondering if it is part of TII's plans.  Park and ride facilities could play a huge part in terms of encouraging those who do not live directly on a bus route to use buses.</p></speech>

We also have a very successful park and ride facility at the Red Cow, where the green bus pulls in very frequently.  It has become a major bus station, as well as allowing for interaction between the different modes.  On the development of the new metro north, park and ride will be a serious consideration in terms of taking people off the M50 and the M1.  Mr. Peter Walsh will speak to that.</p></speech>

There are several park and ride commitments within that.</p></speech>

However, I am referring to more localised facilities, a good number of which we see on the Continent, whereby people can drive and park close enough to public transport and not be penalised for doing so.  Does Deputy Barrett wish to comment?</p></speech>

I was at another meeting next door.</p> <p>  We live in a small country in which many roads have been built.  That is welcome.  The journey time to Galway is now, by and large, two hours if one gets out on to the motorway system.  The journey to Cork is two and half hours.  The problem has been the linking of public transport to the road network to make it more attractive for people to move outside of cities and live in towns within a reasonable distance.  This will not be achieved unless there is an integrated plan involving working with those in transport, road networks and so on.  Substantial investment should be made now when interest rates at practically at zero.  As we all know from our days on local authorities, it takes a very long time from the planning stage to the building of any development.  By the time we get around to the dream that I have, interest rates will have increased and we will back to the response being that there is no money available.  I do not receive complaints from people about the paying of tolls.  Tolling is an accepted practice now, provided the tolls are reasonable.  This small country could be transformed.  We could transform towns that are dying.  Young married couples are paying &euro;500,000 to &euro;600,000 for three-bedroomed semi-detatched houses in places I represent in D&uacute;n Laoghaire and other parts of south County Dublin when they could buy mansions for that amount 20 miles away if they could get quickly to and from their places of work.</p> <p>  We cannot talk about road-building in isolation from other factors.  Perhaps the committee could examine the type of integration to which I refer.  We could use the expertise already available and have papers, in which simple language would be used, submitted to us from which we could work out a programme that would allow us to encourage the Government to use the opportunity that exists to invest in building up towns - whether they be outside Cork, Killarney, Galway, Dublin or into Wicklow -  in which house prices would at least be somewhat affordable for young couples trying to get a start in life.  We could also encourage the creation of a reasonable public transport system or a tolling system to facilitate this.  Such provision would be a key part to the development of this country and not only one region of it and would improving people's quality of life.</p> <p>  If I was to drive by car from Killiney to Leinster House at peak times, the journey could take an hour.  I am fortunate that I can get the DART.  People who know the Rock Road will be aware that one could be caught in a traffic jam and that a journey of eight or nine miles could take an hour to complete.  There is an opportunity to invest now when interest rates are so low, when we have borrowing capacity and when our finances are, to a reasonable extent, back up and running.  Now is the time to put in place an overall plan.  Projects should not be completed in isolation.  Rather, they should be integrated into an overall plan that would lead to the development of towns and villages throughout this country, that would lead to these places being brought back to life and that would improve people's quality of life.</p></speech>

Integration is a major point.  One of the bonuses of merging the Railway Procurement Agency and the National Roads Authority is that we have new thinking in-house on the integration for our networks and to assist in a modal shift.  That is important.  We control and manage the M50 and in terms of the new metro line across the M50.  We recognise the importance of integration.  To continue widening the M50 is not the solution to the congestion on it.  The solution is the provision of public transport, changing the way planning is conducted around Dublin and examining the position regarding area plans.  We see the integration of the networks and the transport modes being critical.  In terms of smart cities in the future, rather than being on transport system, the focus will be on the customer having a seamless journey time aspiration to minimise waiting periods and delays.  There is a major upside to that.</p></speech>

To have a viable public transport system, population densities are required.  Hopefully, this issue will be addressed in the national planning framework but it needs to be borne in mind that the distribution of population militates against an efficient public transport system.</p></speech>

We cannot have it every way.  We must be prepared to subsidise a public transport system in order to achieve other things that are far more important in terms of quality of life.  I refer, for example, to relieving the burden of heavy borrowings on young people, ensuring higher wages, etc.  There is an idea that such provision would be costly in public transport terms.  In my book, however, provided the overall picture is rosy, I would be prepared to put up with subsidising a decent public transport system to have the other benefits.  This issue cannot be viewed in isolation; we have to consider the broader picture of people's quality of life, regardless of whether they are young or old.  Subsidising public transport is an acceptable practice provided it is within reason, but I would not shelve any good ideas because of the cost involved in terms of public transport.</p></speech>

I wish to provide some facts.  The N25 New Ross bypass is an availability PPP and is funded by a project bond involving a pensions company, Allianz, which is the senior lender.  The all-in interest rate for the senior debt is 2.68%, with a debt tenure of 27 years.  The interest rate of 2.68% for that length of term is fixed.  We are hedging that risk and we are also transferring significant risk, whereas with traditional procurement we were otherwise having to self-insure against it.  We acknowledge that the sovereign can borrow for approximately 30 years at approximately a 2% interest rate, so there is that premium.  However, there is additionality with the PPP in terms of the risk transfer and the fixing for the period involved.</p></speech>

The principal thrust of the submissions and evidence from TII today has been to the effect that now is the time to invest or we will pay the price in terms of deterioration.  Moreover, TII has numerous projects that it is keen to get working on.  TII also has many projects that it wants to get to planning stage in order that when a bounce in funding comes, those projects are shovel ready, to echo one of the Deputies.</p> <p>  I have one final question and then we will hear any other comments before we wrap up.  My question is parochial to some degree and relates to the Luas.  TII has joined the red and green lines in Dublin city.  It would make a good deal of sense to do more.  I disagree with TII on the density issue.  There is much evidence to suggest that if we built it, they will come, especially in city and suburban areas.  I realise there are examples that contradict this view.  Are there proposals anywhere in the pipeline?  I know the idea of connecting the green and red lines on the southside was examined ten years ago.  Are there proposals to connect Tallaght and Dundrum?  That would link up a great swathe of population across Dundrum, Ballinteer, Ballycullen, Rathfarnham, Templeogue and parts of Old Bawn.  These are vast population bases and it would connect them and allow them access to the overall Luas.</p></speech>

I thank them for coming before the committee.  The Joint Committee on Public Petitions received a petition from Mr. David Geary, entitled &quot;Financial Ombudsman Review&quot;, petition No. P00035/16.  As part of its deliberation of this petition, the committee considered a response from the Financial Services Ombudsman and agreed at its meeting of 25 January, 2017 to close the petition.  However, it was further agreed to invite the Financial Services Ombudsman, Mr. Deering, to appear before the committee to discuss the three-year change programme currently in operation.</p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure I am required to advise everyone here that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I am pleased to have the opportunity, together with the deputy Financial Services Ombudsman, Ms Elaine Cassidy, to engage with the committee, as requested, on our three-year change programme, the improvements we have already delivered for our service users and the further reforms we propose to implement.  The long established role of an ombudsman is to seek to redress the difference between the resources and expertise available to the individual citizen or consumer and a public body or commercial business.  An ombudsman should seek to achieve a fair resolution at the earliest possible stage through flexible and informal procedures.  An ombudsman does not just rely on the evidence the parties volunteer.  He or she actively investigates cases and makes recommendations or decisions that are based on what is fair in the circumstances, taking account of good practice and fairness as well as legal, regulatory and contractual matters. </p> <p>  The Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, has jurisdiction to deal with complaints made by a consumer against any regulated financial service provider, including banks, building societies, credit unions, intermediaries, stockbrokers, money lenders, bureaux de change, hire purchase providers, insurance companies and retail credit firms.  Our mission is "to resolve disputes between consumers and financial service providers in a fair, timely and impartial manner and to contribute to enhancing the financial service environment for all consumers&rdquo;.  The FSO was established to provide an alternative to the courts for consumers who have unresolved disputes with a financial service provider.  The legislation establishing the FSO is very strong in its intent to establish a true alternative to the adversarial court system.  It clearly sets out that the principal function of the FSO is "to deal with complaints made under this Part by mediation and, where necessary, by investigation and adjudication".  It also sets out that the FSO is "entitled to perform the functions imposed, and exercise the powers conferred, by this Act free from interference by any other person and, when dealing with a particular complaint, is required to act in an informal manner and according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the complaint without regard to technicality or legal form&rdquo;. </p> <p>  It is clear from the legislation that the intention of the Oireachtas was to establish a system for resolving complaints against financial service providers that is informal and where the preferred method of resolution is mediation and only where necessary, by investigation and adjudication.  Yet only a small minority of cases were resolved by mediation prior to 2016, with a very significant number of cases, until then, requiring full investigation and adjudication.  In the main, this had come about because of the reluctance of financial service providers to engage in the mediation process.  While the Act clearly promotes mediation as the preferred method of resolving complaints, it is not found wanting in providing powers for the FSO in terms of investigating and adjudicating complaints.  The Act contains a very wide range of powers available to the FSO where complaints are partly or wholly upheld.  I can direct that a financial service provider rectify the conduct complained of and award compensation of up to &euro;250,000 where a complaint is upheld.  However, compensation is not the only remedy available from the FSO.  I also have powers of rectification.  Such rectification can be very significant as it can involve putting a person back to the position where he or she was previously were before the complaint arose.  This, in some instances, such as where a home or life insurance policy has been voided or a claim denied, may be more important for the complainant than the compensation.  In addition to requiring a financial service provider to rectify the conduct complained of in respect of the particular complainant, I can also require the financial service provider to change a practice relating to that conduct. </p> <p>  The Government has decided to amalgamate the offices of the FSO and the Pensions Ombudsman.  This will require enabling legislation.  The Department of Finance and the Office of the Attorney General are currently progressing the drafting of the legislation.  In the meantime, provision was made in statute to appoint the holder of the post of FSO to the post of Pensions Ombudsman in addition to the post of FSO.  I was appointed Financial Services Ombudsman in April 2015 and Pensions Ombudsman in May 2016.  In advance of the enactment of the legislation necessary for the merger we are committed to doing everything we can to make the amalgamation a success.  Both offices are now co-located and work in close co-operation, albeit under separate legislative provisions.  We are actively working with the Departments of Finance and Social Protection to ensure a smooth amalgamation and the successful delivery of services. </p> <p>  In advance of the proposed amalgamation the FSO bureau is delivering a major change programme.  We have just commenced the second year of this ambitious three-year programme of change.  This programme, which is fundamentally changing how we manage complaints, is being implemented on foot of the recommendations of a strategic and operational review.  The review report, which we published on our website, recommended that we should adopt a more proportionate, informal and preventative approach to dispute resolution.  The review involved very considerable engagement with a broad range of stakeholders, with a particular focus on those who had used the services.  The feedback indicated a number of challenges that are now being addressed.</p><p>These included low levels of service-user satisfaction, due mainly to the formality, complexity and legalistic nature of the processes and the resulting length of time taken to process some complaints.<br/><br/>In 2015 we experienced a very small but welcome increase in the number of mediations, with some very complex disputes being resolved.  However, there was still a regrettable reluctance on the part of financial service providers in particular to engage in mediation.  This, I am happy to report, changed dramatically in 2016.  The review, carried out in 2015, put forward a number of recommendations which are currently being implemented as part of a three-year change programme.  As part of this change programme, we have already introduced major changes in how we manage complaints.<br/><br/>The main focus for 2016 was on the introduction of a new dispute resolution service.  In 2017 the change programme will focus on our new investigation and adjudication processes and in 2018 we will focus on outreach and awareness.  We adopted our new model of dispute resolution in February 2016.  This new model involves considerably more interaction with the parties, particularly in terms of speaking with the parties at an early stage of the process with an emphasis on utilising informal approaches.  This approach delivers a faster, more efficient and effective service that puts the needs of service users at its core.  Informal methods involving mediation, by telephone, e-mail and through meetings, are now the first and preferred option for resolving complaints.  However, where these early interventions do not resolve the dispute both parties will continue to have the option of having their complaint independently adjudicated and a legally binding finding, appealable to the High Court, issued.  However, parties are now strongly encouraged to engage in mediation in a meaningful manner.<br/><br/>On receipt of a completed complaint form and the final response from the provider, the complaint is referred to a dispute resolution officer.  On receipt of the complaint, the dispute resolution officer will contact the complainant and provider to establish the essence of the complaint and seek to resolve it speedily and informally by facilitating a solution that both parties can accept.  Dispute resolution officers use a range of mediation interventions including telephone conversations and e-mail, in addition to meetings.  This gives both parties the opportunity to develop a shared understanding of the complaint and to work towards reaching a swift and fair solution.  While dispute resolution officers help to facilitate a resolution, they do not take sides, apportion blame or judge who is right or who is wrong.  By engaging with the parties directly, it is possible to capture the detail behind the issue in the manner best suited to the parties involved and achieve a timely and satisfactory resolution.<br/><br/>A total of 2,491 complaints were resolved by our dispute resolution team through this new process in 2016.  If a settlement is not reached within the dispute resolution service, the matter will be progressed to investigation and, ultimately, to adjudication.  This is a more formal and lengthy process as all the evidence must be gathered, exchanged and considered in accordance with fair procedures.  Having gathered the evidence and exchanged the evidence and submissions between the parties, the evidence and submissions are considered and a preliminary finding is issued to both parties.  If the parties make no further submissions in response to the preliminary finding, a legally-binding finding in the same terms will be issued and the file will be closed.  If either or both parties make further substantive submissions that identify possible errors of law or significant additional points of fact, these submissions will be reviewed and will be made available to the parties, where necessary, before a legally-binding finding is issued.<br/><br/>The preliminary finding is an additional new step that we have introduced this year.  It gives an indication of the ombudsman's final decision and provides parties with the opportunity to correct any potential or perceived errors of fact or bring to light other evidence that was not previously made available.  Of necessity, the adjudication process is more formal than the dispute resolution process.  This means that complaints that go to investigation and adjudication will take considerably longer to resolve.  In addition, they will occasionally require an oral hearing where evidence is taken under oath.<br/><br/>Findings issued by the ombudsman are legally binding on both the complainant and the provider.  Either party can appeal a finding of the FSO to the High Court.  We are hopeful that the introduction of the preliminary finding will reduce the number of appeals.  An information booklet on how to make a complaint to the FSO, is available on the &quot;other quick guides&quot; section of our website, <i>www.financialombudsman.ie</i>.  Our services are provided by the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau, which comprises the Financial Services Ombudsman, the deputy ombudsman and the management and staff.  It is a statutory body funded by levies from the financial service providers.  I want to pay tribute to the management and staff of the bureau who have demonstrated a huge flexibility and commitment to quality customer service during what has been an extraordinarily busy and productive period of change.  They are, in my view, a great example of public servants focused on, and committed to, responding to the needs of service users.<br/><br/>As we say as Gaeilge, &quot;T&uacute;s maith, leath na hoibre&quot;.  We believe we have made a very good start to our change programme.  This view has been affirmed through feedback from those who use our services.  With the continued commitment of all concerned, we believe we can continue to improve the service we provide in the coming years and we look forward to implementing the next phases of our change programme.  It is only by listening to our stakeholders, particularly those who have used our service, that we are able to continuously meet their needs and expectations.  It was for this reason that we surveyed complainants and service providers in 2015 and again in 2016.  The feedback from the 2015 survey identified the changes we needed to make.  The survey of complainants and providers who used the new dispute resolution service in the first half of 2016 has provided an early, positive endorsement of the effectiveness of the new service.  The results indicate that the newly implemented processes are working well and that changes made have had a positive impact.  The feedback shows us that we have built strong foundations on which we can continue to develop the service and improve how complaints are managed.  We will continue to survey users of our service to monitor satisfaction levels on an ongoing basis and we will publish the findings of these surveys annually.<br/><br/>I assure the committee that, together with our team, the deputy ombudsman and I will continue to review and improve our services in order to contribute to the enhancement of the financial service environment for all consumers.  We will also continue to play our part in providing redress for complainants where we are of the view that the conduct of their financial service provider was contrary to law, unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory.  I thank members for the opportunity to engage with them today.  Ms Cassidy and I would be happy now to deal with any questions that arise.</p></speech>

If the FSO engages with a person in dispute with a financial institution and a file is created, can the financial institution, or debt recovery people on its behalf, pursue that person?  A couple of constituents of mine engaged with FSO on a technical matter pertaining to a financial service but a debt recovery agency is now pursuing them.  It is exceptionally traumatic for them to have to engage the services of the financial ombudsman but the debt recovery agency is now pursuing them on behalf of the financial institution.  Is that in order?</p></speech>

However, we ask financial services providers to be reasonable while the matter is being decided.  One of the benefits of the new dispute resolution process is that people can get an agreement within a month, or two or three months, and most matters are resolved very quickly.  If a case has to go to adjudication it will take longer, up to another four to six months with the exchange of information and documentary evidence.  It is hard to say that the financial institution is not entitled to seek to recover its money during that period but it depends on the nature of the dispute.  The dispute is often not over the amount of money owing and sometimes it is unhelpful if a person does not engage.  I have seen cases where somebody has stopped paying their mortgage or loan for six months or a year and that does not help anybody because, generally speaking, the money will often remain owing at the end of the process.</p></speech>

These people are engaging with the financial institution and are meeting their payments but there is a technical dispute over a number of issues.  Are financial institutions adhering to the ombudsman's guideline not to pursue people when a dispute resolution process is ongoing?</p></speech>

The difficulty was that if there was a long-term process that involved possibly a year, a mortgage not being paid for that length of time or less money being paid could be a problem.  In the main, the banks will come to an arrangement with the complainant, particularly while the MARP process is ongoing.</p></speech>

I want to turn to a particular group of people - those who are older - in respect of which there is widespread financial abuse.  This was captured very well by a study conducted by Dr. Corina Naughton from the School Of Nursing, Midwifery and Health Systems at UCD and published in 2010.  The study reported that financial abuse in Ireland affected 1.3% of the population.  This translated into an estimated 6,000 cases of financial abuse within the older population, which is quite staggering.  Every time, I read that statistic, I am surprised and shocked by it.  We are talking about large sums of money relating to this group of individuals.  Department of Social Protection expenditure accounts for 29.1% of gross Government expenditure and pension payments amount to &euro;6.9 billion, with illness, disability and carers' payments amounting to &euro;3.55 billion.  These transfers via the Department of Social Protection alone - which would not represent all the wealth of older people - to those who may be vulnerable to financial abuse are substantial and deserving of oversight and protection.  Given the widespread financial abuse of older people and adults who may be vulnerable, what protections does Mr. Deering think should be in place?  What specific actions can the Financial Services Ombudsman take in respect of the scale of this kind of abuse of a wide section of the population?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.189" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Deering" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017032200002#D00300"><p>One of the things we always check is whether the various codes have been implemented.  The various codes from the Central Bank include how to deal with vulnerable customers.  I am not saying that all elderly people are vulnerable, but some are.  First, we would check to see whether the person is vulnerable and in that respect, whether the bank or financial institution dealt with them properly as a vulnerable customer.  Going back to our changes, our new service suits elderly people and vulnerable customers much better than the old service.  In the past, it was very much about document exchange whereas we now deal with people on the telephone.  That can make access easier for many people, not just elderly people, who may find access difficult because they can now talk to somebody on the phone.  I notice from the notes and messages we are getting from people that this is the kind of service they want.  They want somebody to listen to them.  One very interesting statistic we found from our research was that of the people who made a complaint to us who had been with larger institutions like banks and insurance companies, only 20% of them had managed to speak to somebody in that institution before they brought the complaint to us, which meant that 80% of them did not get to speak to anyone.  We now get on the phone, talk and listen to people, get the financial institution on the other side, try to bring some reality to the difference and rebalance the arms between the two sides.  It is the case that a financial institution is in a far better situation than an individual dealing with them.  Our role is to rebalance the imbalance that exists between the resources of both parties.</p></speech>

Sometimes the exchange of documents does not always tell the full story.  Is Mr. Deering satisfied that this is enough for the protection of people in those categories given that we know there is a very large-scale problem?  Does Mr. Deering feel the measures are in place in to protect those people?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.191" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Deering" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017032200002#D00500"><p>I believe they are.  I should have been more explicit when I spoke about enforcing codes.  We see whether the code was applied to that person and if it was not, we can either provide compensation or require the financial institution to provide compensation or redress - indeed putting them back where they were.  One sees this quite a bit with insurance, where the information was not properly collected or the person taking out the insurance policy did not fully understand the questions being asked and innocently answered a question in a way where one can tell that he or she was not trying to hide anything or deceive anybody.  In that situation, we would look at whether it was fair and reasonable.  I refer, for example, to the attitude the insurance company took if it voided a policy.  Voiding a policy can have serious implications for a person.  It means he or she cannot get insurance anywhere else.  In those situations, we can direct the insurance company to reinstate the policy.  The answer to the Senator's question is that we have the powers to provide compensation and rectification in situations such as those.</p></speech>

I would not be quite as content about the measures and systems we have around people who may be vulnerable.  The fact that someone is old does not mean he or she is vulnerable but abuse of people with disabilities does exist.  An example would be family members collecting disability allowance and the person not getting access to his or her money.  There is a slew of evidence to show that those situations exist.  Obviously, if these people come in contact with the ombudsman, that is great.  If they do not, how do we make sure this group is protected?  If Mr. Deering has any views on what might be good measures in an adult-safeguarding context, I would be delighted to hear from him today or later.  I have some other questions but, obviously, other people want to come in.</p></speech>

It is much larger than indicated by the number of individuals who approach the FSO.  This has been proven by research.  A significant amount of public money is involved in those transactions, particularly things that are transferred through pensions.  I am concerned that what Mr. Deering is proposing is quite reactive rather than proactive.  He talked about outreach and other measures.  As Financial Services Ombudsman, he wants to enhance the financial services environment for everybody.  What more can be done?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.197" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Deering" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017032200002#D01100"><p>It is important to draw a distinction between ourselves and the Central Bank, which is the actual regulator in this area and which can make rules across all the organisations.  I know the Senator described us as reactive but we can only respond to a complaint from an individual.  We do not have a regulatory role and that is how it should be because the Central Bank has that role.  We can only deal with a situation where we have a complaint.  That said, we can order banks, financial institutions or insurance companies to change a practice but, again, only in the context of a complaint we would have received.  An important first step for us was to make our service more accessible to vulnerable people.  That is probably the most important thing we can do.  In terms of actual powers, as far as I am aware, the FSO has more powers than any other financial services ombudsman.  We can award compensation of up to &euro;250,000 and there is no limit on rectification, which can be extremely important.  An example would be if somebody's house burned down and, after assessing the claim, the insurance company says the customer did not provide certain information when he or she took out the insurance policy.</p><p>In such a situation, if I deem that to be unreasonable, I can direct the insurance company to pay the claim, and there is no limit on the amount payable.  We are anxious to retain the powers of the Financial Services Ombudsman and are happy that they will be retained in the new legislation.  New legislation is required to amalgamate the two offices.  There are some further proposals in the new legislation concerning an extension of the six-year time limit for the publication of findings.  We welcome these proposals and think they could be very useful.  If our findings could be published, people could know about our decisions and be very clear on the outcome of such a situation.  We cannot yet publish our decisions but in the next week or so we will publish case studies, which will give people an understanding of the kinds of complaints we deal with and the outcomes they can expect.  It is important to draw a distinction between our role as ombudsman dealing with individual complaints and the role of the regulator.  Our role in that regard is to draw the attention of the Central Bank to practices with which we are not happy and with which we have difficulties, and we do so.  The codes are strong if implemented.</p></speech>

The Central Bank may fine people and has done so on certain occasions.  That would be a matter for the Central Bank.  In our case, the sanction for not implementing the code is that we can award compensation to the individual concerned, which, frankly, in such a situation, is the most important thing to the individual.</p></speech>

We propose to develop that further in 2018.  For example, regarding tracker mortgages, we prepared a report which we then gave to the Central Bank and which pointed out many of the issues that had been raised across the cases of tracker mortgages we had seen.  Where we come across a systemic issue or something we believe to be systemic, we report that to the Central Bank, which is then in a position to examine it across all the institutions.</p></speech>

It is true that this group - older individuals and those who may be vulnerable because of their disabilities - suffer financial abuse disproportionately, and I would like the ombudsman to take that on board.</p></speech>

The Pensions Ombudsman operated more in that space in any event.  The amalgamation makes sense because in several areas it has not always been easy to determine whether a complaint should have gone to the Financial Services Ombudsman or the Pensions Ombudsman.  Sometimes investments and pensions are very closely aligned.  Yes, we will be busy, but it is a challenge we are happy to take on.</p></speech>

The reason I raise this is that the vast majority of people who come to our offices to discuss financial matters are very frightened of financial institutions - and I mean that.  This is why I welcome what the ombudsman does.  I just wonder if we as a committee could spread even further the word around the country that the ombudsman is available to help people.  We think we are getting to the root of the issue but we are not.  The worst thing is to see poor families in courts being thrown around the place, and one asks why they did not go to their Teachta D&aacute;la or the ombudsman.  Is there a way we could perhaps jointly spread this word around the countryside, getting into the regions and all the counties, to make sure nobody is falling through the trap and getting lost?  In the cases of which I am aware, when families lose their homes, I think the effect is sometimes very bad on parents but it is really bad on children, and I do not think we ever think about this.  It is a harrowing situation, as we know.</p></speech>

I am reminded of a card that arrived in our office from somebody who recently used our service.  It read, "I can breathe a little easier now."  It gives an indication that behind the numbers to which the Deputy has just referred, there are many personal stories of people with grave difficulty and problems.  We would be very happy to get the message out.  One matter we discussed with our colleagues in other ombudsman offices recently was the possibility of a clinic in Leinster House.  In a previous life of mine in the National Employment Rights Authority, we provided something similar.  We came into Leinster House and it was very useful to interact with Oireachtas Members because, as the Deputy pointed out, they are very often the people to whom these people with difficulties will turn.  The more people here understand our role, particularly now that we have changed our processes, the more we could inform Members of that.  We would be happy to co-operate with anything along those lines or any other ideas the committee may have.  We accept that we need to increase our outreach; we just feel we need to do so in a phased way.</p></speech>

There is one particular group that has been in the past very unlikely to come to us.  I refer to those who have possibly been put off by the thinking that a consumer is an individual person.  The definition of "consumer" is very wide and covers farmers and small to medium-sized businesses.  Often, in these cases, the family home and the business are quite interlinked.  We should not cause an awful lot more stress.  It is well worth politicians' time getting out there and informing people that our services cover not only individuals, but also those groups.</p></speech>

First, how does the ombudsman find the attitude of the financial institutions, including the credit unions?  Second - that I may ask two questions together rather than taking up time - to go back to Senator Kelleher's point, I find that elderly people often come to my office to discuss online banking.  It is appalling that online banking being forced down the necks of people who are elderly.  Perhaps I would not use the words "financial abuse" but I would, in the case of the people to whom I refer, use the words "terrible frustration".  Older people worry whether their direct debits will be paid and whether their bills will be paid on time.  They have significant worries about this because it is something new and different.  Does the ombudsman find this to be the case?  Does he also find that some of these people have many complaints about the way in which the legal people sometimes handle their business?  Can the ombudsman deal with that?</p></speech>

I think we have all experienced the banks pushing people in the direction of online banking, yet we have also come across people who want online banking who were not given access to it.  The full range of services should be available to people.  They should not be forced into online banking or out of online banking or not allowed to have online banking.

We get complaints from credit unions and about credit unions.  We would not have a huge number of complaints against credit unions.  It comes back to the point that I made earlier, where we found in our survey that 80% of people never got to speak to anybody.

Some credit unions are very good at dealing with their own complaints.  Others are not as good, maybe because of the committee structure and such things.  We find that many credit unions are good at dealing with complaints, and a smaller number are not as good.</p> <p>  The attitude of banks has changed very significantly in that, up to 2014 and even in 2015, the banks refused to engage in mediation in 99.9% of cases.  We researched why that was the case.  The kind of feedback we got was that banks had made their decision and there was no point in engaging.  We pointed out that that was incorrect, because a significant number of complaints leave our office different from how they came in, which means that the bank was not quite right.  I have to be fair and say that the banks and insurance companies have engaged in the process.  They are seeing a benefit as well as the consumer seeing a significant benefit.</p></speech>

He used the word "gentle".  It is a case of being gentle with a sledgehammer.  The physical actions that banks have taken for the reorganisation of the floor-space of financial institutions, where they have shrunk counter-space from in excess of eight counter-spaces down to two and will shut services at 3 p.m., hurt small businesspeople as well as elderly people.  They are used to dealing in a physical manner with their banks.  The banks are unashamed in that.  I remember being in a meeting with Mr. David Duffy in his time at AIB, five years ago, when I was still a councillor.  He was open about it with regard to branch closure and also the fact that chequebooks were redundant.  He said they were a thing of the past and the bank would get rid of them.  They are unashamed in their manner.  Small businesspeople are affected as well as elderly people.  That is spinning out to the utility companies in this country, which will force customers down direct debit routes.  That is having a knock-on impact on our post office services and people physically using the services in town centres.  It is a bigger spectrum than just financial services and the issue of interaction.  It has a wider implication for town centre usage as well.  Those debates emanate from there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.234" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1362" speakername="Denise Mitchell" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017032200002#F00700"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending  Their presentation gives an outline of the current powers and functions that the ombudsman's office has.  I want to ask a few brief questions.  My colleagues have referred to many matters.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses feel that the ombudsman's office needs any further powers to increase consumer protection?  Is there any other regulatory body that they look at where they can see that?  I welcome that they hope to publish the complaints procedures and the complaints received.  I ask the witnesses to give an outline of the timeline of when complaints come in, how long it takes, and if they have any updated figures on how many complaints were received and how many were successful.  The witnesses mentioned compensation.  How frequently is compensation given and what amount are we looking at?  Will the amalgamation of the two services have any effect on consumers?  Would the ombudsman seek the strengthening of any powers following the amalgamation?  My colleagues mentioned the banks.  Are any banks resisting engagement with the ombudsman?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.235" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Deering" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017032200002#F00800"><p>I will take Deputy Mitchell's last question first.  There is a different level of engagement by different financial service providers.  Some may take longer than others to come on board.  If financial service providers do not come on board with the system, at the end of the day it is important to remember that we have the power of adjudication and we will make the decision.  The vast majority of them have come on board reasonably well.  If banks do not engage and do not come to an agreement with the complainant, ultimately we can make a finding and decide.  The consumer will get an outcome from the process one way or the other.</p> <p>  The benefit of mediation, particularly for complainants, is the speed at which they can get it.  Something like 46% of complaints were dealt with through mediation within two months and 56% were dealt with within three months.  The other extreme of that is adjudication, as I mentioned.  The mediation process will probably have been gone through, followed by adjudication, which will probably take four to six months, depending on how complex the issue is.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked how many complaints there were.  Last year, 44% of complaints were either upheld or partly upheld.  That would be the range of complaints that received something.  That can be anything from an amount of money where somebody was denied access to a service, up to having their insurance policy reinstated.  An issue that we have some concerns about is the extent to which insurance policies are sometimes cancelled, because that has serious implications for the person.  We can direct the company to reinstate the insurance policy in that case.  In total, last year, 1,800 people got some level of financial of financial outcome or redress through mediation and adjudication through the office.</p></speech>

It can be over within a week or so for simple things.  It could go on for months for complex complaints like permanent health insurance and difficult insurance claims, but more due to the nature of the complaint.  It goes into investigation before adjudication if that is not successful.  The investigation process involves exchanging documents in line with fair procedures.  We have to exchange documents.  We cannot shorten that process in any way.  That typically takes about four to six months, and then an adjudication will follow within the next couple of months afterwards.  That is the timeline for complaints, step by step.  There was also a question about powers of the ombudsman's office.</p></speech>

When I meet my colleagues and look at the ombudsmen in this position across Europe, I see that some are elected by industry and some are funded by a voluntary organisation which the financial service providers can opt in or out of.  That is not the case here.  It is a mandatory scheme.  Anything regulated by the Central Bank or the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is covered and cannot escape our remit.  We can award compensation of up to &euro;250,000, and that is quite significant.  There is no limit on redress.  We feel that the extension of the six year rule for long-term financial products will be beneficial.  We know there are proposals to amend that in the new legislation.  We feel that being able to publish our findings will also have a significant impact.  We welcome those changes.</p></speech>

I do not think it is going to make a huge difference.  Both offices provide a good service.  There have been occasions where there has been confusion as to whether it is an investment product or a pension product.  That will not matter now.  There will be one point of entry.  There is a lot of confusion.  We get a lot of calls for the Public Service Ombudsman's office or for other ombudsman offices, so it is good if we can do more to streamline things.  It will be better for some consumers and avoid confusion.</p></speech>

He or she may only have provided a very small amount of detail on the complaint form, so the office will ask questions and try to get the whole history of the complaint and understand the effect it has had on the complainant.</p><p>What is very important is that we really try to listen to people.  As Mr. Deering mentioned, people have often gone through a complaints process in a bank which might have lasted months and they never got to speak to anybody.  There were interactive voice systems and email but nobody ever listened to them and asked how they were affected or whether there was anything that could be done to help them.  That has a huge impact.</p></speech>

After that phase has taken place, the dispute resolution officer will contact the bank and ask questions.  He or she will also put the complainant's side to the bank, explain the impact it has had and requisition the documents required at that point.  On the mediation side, officers try not to get bogged down in the paperwork because it may not be necessary.  They try to push the point to the bank that these are their customers and that the right thing to do is to try to resolve the matter without getting too legal.  If this mediation process is unsuccessful and we proceed to an investigation, this is where we get very heavy on documents.  We send a lengthy schedule of evidence required and ask detailed questions of the provider about how it had behaved towards the particular complainant and how it deals with this type of complaint generally.  We ask for recordings of all conversations with the complainant.  We listen to all of them and ask the bank how it behaved under all of the aspects of the consumer codes.  The file of information the bank must provide on foot of this is very hefty.</p></speech>

I recall it now.  Please forgive me.</p> <p>  We have a new development in the motor industry regarding the provision of 0% finance.  The personal contract plan, PCP, is one model and there are others.  I have anecdotal evidence that people have taken out a PCP product.  It is so prevalent at this stage that I do not think I will offend anybody by naming the brand.  The anecdotal evidence I have been hearing is that after people have paid the interest and it comes to paying back the principal, they get the shock of their lives because they never read the small print.  They then realise they must pay a capital amount in financing the car.  Have the delegates received complaints of this nature or have they had any interaction with the finance houses on ensuring customers of these products have absolute knowledge of what they are buying into and what the permutations will be at the end of the lifetime of these products?</p></speech>

They are recent and it will be a year or two before we start to see the first of the problems and then complaints will be made to us.  It is very important to point out that those selling these products must be registered with the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC; as such, they fall within our remit.  We can and will deal with complaints.  If we start to see issues and problems arising in this regard, we will certainly go back to the industry and perhaps speak to the CCPC to see whether anything needs to be done.  The CCPC is aware of the issue and we have had conversations with it about it.  It has an overarching role and is very concerned and watching that space.</p></speech>

Ar son Gas&oacute;ga na h&Eacute;ireann, t&aacute;imid bu&iacute;och as ucht an deis labhairt os comhair an choiste inniu.  Many thanks for the opportunity to address the committee today.  This is our first time to come before an Oireachtas committee.  It is an important occasion for us today.  &Oacute;c&aacute;id t&aacute;bhachtach stairi&uacute;il at&aacute; ann.  We see this as a milestone for Scouting Ireland and a recognition of the opportunities scouting provides for young people in all age groups throughout the island.</p> <p>  Scouting is a collaborative effort and therefore I will introduce our team.  On my left is our chief scout and president of our organisation, Christy McCann.  Our operations manager is Noel O'Connor.  Our research officer is Dubheasa Kelly.  Our rover scout is Ciara Keegan.  Our adult volunteer is Ray Moran.</p> <p>  We hope to clearly convey a sense of who we are, our position within the youth sector and within education and of how we can develop further over the coming years.  Our chief scout, Mr. Christy McCann, will speak briefly about scouting in a general context.  He will outline a clearer picture of what we do.  I will then outline our structures and strategic aims for the future with the help of my colleagues Ms Kelly and Mr. O'Connor.</p> <p>  The committee will then hear from our youth members who will convey a real-life context of what scouting means and has meant to them.  With your indulgence, a Chathaoirligh, I will hand over to our chief scout, Christy McCann.</p></speech>

As chief scout, president of Scouting Ireland and lead senior volunteer, I chair the national council and national management committee.  I am responsible for co-ordinating the activities of Scouting Ireland.  I am honoured to be invited here to speak on behalf of the members of Scouting Ireland.</p> <p>  Scouting is a worldwide movement of young people with a membership of 40 million in 160 countries and territories.  Scouting Ireland represents 50,000 of these members across the island of Ireland, making it one of the largest youth organisations in the country.  We are co-educational, non-denominational and non-political.  We have proudly served the young people of Ireland for 110 years.  Our programmes are as popular and as relevant as they have been for the past century.  Our work in the development of young people is spread over 500 communities throughout the island.  The aim of scouting is simply to create a better world.</p> <p>  Scouting is based on friendship, fun, challenge and adventure for young people.  While Scouting Ireland is delivered in a fun and friendly environment a powerful educational method is at play in our programmes.  Positive outcomes for young people include character building, leadership skills, self-awareness and a sense of personal responsibility.  Scouting develops young people to enable them to become the leaders of tomorrow in the context of their lives and their communities.  Scouting is about nurturing proactive and caring citizens.  Academic research shows that scouts and former scouts are more likely to vote, to be politically engaged, to be in positions of leadership in the communities and to contribute to our society.</p> <p>  Scouting Ireland works in partnership with local communities.  Our youth membership age ranges from six to 26 years of age.  The members are supported by 12,000 volunteers.  The staff is comprised of 35 full-time employees and is headed by our chief executive, John Lawlor.  They support this volunteer-led organisation.  I will now hand back to John Lawlor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.280" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Lawlor" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017032200002#B00400"><p>Scouting Ireland was established as a successor to the historical scout organisations in Ireland in 2004.  Since then, it has thrived and currently it is at an all-time high in membership.  Membership has been growing at a rate of 4% year-on-year for the past seven years.  Based on the most recently available Central Statistics Office figures, we currently reach 5% of the youth population, that is to say, those between six and 17 years of age.  This figure is extraordinary by comparison with a corresponding figure of 0.9% with France.  Our research officer, Ms Kelly, will put context around these figures presently to provide insight to the impact we make for young people.</p> <p>  The 12,000 adult volunteers referenced by the chief scout represent 30% of all adult youth volunteers in the sector.  No other organisation is comparable in scale or comes with this number of trained and vetted youth volunteers working week in, week out with children.  Our ratio of professional staff to volunteers is the leanest and most efficient in the sector, with 35 staff to 12,000 adult volunteers.</p> <p>  The objectives and programmes of Scouting Ireland are aligned to the national policy framework document for children and young people - Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures - and to the national youth strategy.  The targeted national outcomes of being connected, being respected and contributing, achieving in all areas of learning and development, being active and healthy, having economic security and opportunity and being safe and protected from harm are well served through the scout educational method and programme.</p> <p>  We strongly believe that the role of non-formal learning, as delivered through scouting, and its complementary interaction with formal learning in the development of young people will become increasingly important as we embrace what is generally described as 21st century learning.  There is clear evidence that positive out-of-school activity that promotes empowerment and leadership has a powerful effect on outcomes for young people.  Significantly, recent research has demonstrated the positive long-term effect on mental health of involvement in scouting.  The combination of our scouting method, our work, increased membership and youth engagement is a testament to our 110-year method.</p><p>We have waiting lists for membership in most of our existing groups.</p><p> Like any organisation or sector of society, we have challenges.  As an organisation, we are finding it increasingly difficult to support our volunteers and youth members in the way we would like due to the cost of implementing additional compliance requirements in areas such as safeguarding, the national qualities standards framework, NQSF, charities regulation and governance to give four examples.  Mr. Noel O&rsquo;Connor, our operations manager, will speak briefly on this.</p><p> Like most organisations, the impact of Brexit will be significant for us.  As Ireland&rsquo;s only all-island youth organisation, it becomes an even bigger challenge.  We currently have 60 groups operating in the North.  Access to ERASMUS funding for our groups, access to Peace and Reconciliation funding which helped us build our world class centre facility at Castle Saunderson on the Cavan-Fermanagh border, and our good working relationship with the Scout Association UK which also operates in the North, all have to be addressed in light of a Brexit.  That is not to mention our significant number of volunteers and youth members who cross the Border on a weekly basis to attend meetings.  How will a hard Brexit affect them?</p><p> The issue of identity and our youth members seeing themselves as EU citizens is also significant.  Our uniform carries a strip which has on it the EU flag and our members in Northern Ireland proudly wear that badge.  It is not an inconsiderable issue that this right may be stripped from them. In the true "Late Late Show" fashion I will have one for everyone in the audience to remind the members of the significance of EU citizenship for our youth members in Northern Ireland.</p><p> Before I pass over to Ms Dubheasa Kelly and Mr. Noel O'Connor, I want to say that we are a project-based organisation and have been engaging in several large projects, which is worth bringing to the attention of members, as they may better create a sense of what it is we do as a youth movement.  Our youth employability scheme is a project of which we are particularly proud, and we hope to replicate and expand on it in the future. Our Lelievlet boat-building project based in Limerick city aligns with the Government&rsquo;s national policy framework objectives.  The project aims to provide young people with skills such as welding and woodwork and to give them FETAC standard qualifications in order to prepare them for work.  These are young people in the needs category, not in employment, education or training.</p><p> Scouting Ireland is also working on a number of programmes aimed at supporting refugees in Ireland.  We run a Refugee Access Programme in conjunction with the City of Dublin Youth Services board aimed at integrating unaccompanied minors into Irish society.  We are also establishing links with direct provision centres around Ireland to break down the stigma that exists in regard to these centres. </p><p> In 2015 Scouting Ireland won an international bid to host the World Scout Moot to be held in 2021. This ten-day experience will see 6,000 international scouts aged 18 to 24 from more than 120 countries travel to Ireland.  It is our hope to showcase Ireland in the best possible manner but perhaps more importantly use the experience of hosting such a world prestigious event to develop our young people and our organisation.  The single most important objective in winning and hosting this major international event is to use its preparation and its successful delivery as a platform for transformational development in Irish scouting.  It is that for programme of development that we actively seek the committee's support today.  It is a wonderful opportunity to have the World Scout Moot come to Ireland.  It is an opportunity we want to ensure leaves a lasting legacy.</p><p> Those are some of the projects on which Scouting Ireland is currently working.  I will now hand over to Ms Dubheasa Kelly and Mr. Noel O'Connor before the members hear from our youth representatives who will give them a sense of what scouting really means to young people and the impact it has on their lives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.282" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Dubheasa Kelly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017032200002#C00200"><p>I will briefly highlight some of the measurable impacts scouting has on young people.  The impact of scouting is wide-ranging and varied.  Through research conducted by Scouting Ireland in 2015, we found four main areas of measurable positive impact, and these were identified by our youth members.  The first was emotional development.  This included increases in confidence, positivity, maturity and patience.  Second, there was personal development and they identified areas such as team work, leadership, time management, independence, responsibility, respect and even critical thinking as being explicitly taught in scouting.  Others described how being a member of the organisation impacted on their social skills with increased friendships, improved sociability and people skills.  Practical skills were also identified and youth members reported gaining skills such as first aid, cooking, navigation, budgeting and problem solving to mention a few.</p> <p>  Additional research published in 2016 identified that those who engage in scouting are more likely to report better mental health later in life.  The results were based on a life-long study of 10,000 people born in the UK in 1959.  Researchers found that those who have been active members of scouts tended to have better mental health by the age of 50.  In addition, it was noted that engaging in scouting activity seemed to remove the higher risk of mental illness in those from poorer socio-economic backgrounds.  Research published in the UK in 2012 demonstrates a substantially higher proportion of scouts engage in voluntary activities than children and young people who had not engaged in scouting.  This effect is identified as being long-lasting with 35% of former youth members volunteering regularly at least two hour per week as opposed to 26% of the general population who volunteer regularly.  Of the former youth members who volunteer, 66% said that scouting had positively impacted their decision to get involved.  Overall, it is clear from research studies conducted, that scouting provides long-lasting and varied benefits to young people and society.  </p></speech>

In terms of compliance, we want to be seen as a transparent organisation with a reputation for accountability and probity.  Our work in this area while heavy on our limited resources is a major priority and will safeguard Scouting Ireland for future generations so that they can benefit form the same opportunities that so many young people have had over the past 110 years.</p></speech>

I began scouting as a cub scout at the age of nine.  I am now 21 and I remain an active rover scout and an adult scouter with Blancharstown, 104-144 scout group to this day.  My years in scouting have taught me a number of things.  It has taught me that my best is always good enough.  It has taught me that there does not have to be borders if I do not want them there.  It has taught me that I get to decide my own path in this world because scouting has empowered, motivated and encouraged me to think for myself.  I have never been told where to go; I have just been told that there is nowhere I cannot go.  We are taught to reflect on our actions and be proud of them, or take responsibility.  We know that our actions have an effect and that sometimes they have an effect on a person or a group but also if we want to, and I mean really want to, we can effect the world in a really positive and meaningful way.</p> <p>  I know how to stand up for myself, take action for myself and I know how to take action for others when they cannot do so at the time.  Soon we will have scouts volunteering on the refugee camps in Greece.  Their main job will be to give the young people there a sense of childhood, care and importance because we know the value of empowering a child, even if only for a brief moment.  This is another value we have been taught.  We have been taught to care, or maybe it is not something that can be taught but rather experienced.  This is what we call learning by doing.  We do this by hands-on experience that is not only team driven but self-driven in the real world.  This is how I know what I know.  It is by real hands-on experience away from any sort of screen or classroom, out with real people who care and who one can trust.  </p> <p>   We are told today to be frightened of so many things and because of being involved with the scouts I am not frightened.  I have been pushed to knock on that stranger's door in Hungary and ask them if I can camp in their garden and then find out they are no longer strangers.  I was handed a pocket knife at the age of ten and hesitated to use it but because somebody trusted me to do it, I have learned to trust my capabilities too.</p> <p>  I have got lost in the Mourne Mountains and knew that was fine because I was with a team who cared about each other and that there were no problems there, just challenges.  I have stood up in front of the World Scouting Conference and helped deliver the bid for the international event that John has mentioned and not even flinched because that was nothing in comparison to when a tropical storm hits in Japan and one has decided one has put up one's tent well enough to withstand anything.  I have been equipped through scouting to withstand anything, but if it comes to a point when I am knocked back, I will be fine too.</p><p>Scouting breeds resilience.  That is a difficult thing to master but scouting makes us bouncy in spirit and in nature.  Probably the biggest thing I have learned on my travels is that I am totally happy with who I am and that there are so many people out there who are happy with who I am too.  What we are doing is a positive thing for the self-esteem of young people like me.  It has a positive effect on our young people's overall mental health.  If we can continue to do that for nearly 50,000 young people in Ireland, that is something I want to remain a part of and help make happen.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.289" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Moran" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017032200002#D00300"><p>Good morning.  My name is Ray Moran.  I live on a council estate in Dublin 7 with my mam.  I am 26 and have been in scouting for the past 19 years.  I am a leader of the cub scout section in Dublin 7 that I grew up in.  It is a pleasure to be here today to share how scouting has changed my life.</p> <p>  I grew up in a disadvantaged area where the easiest thing to do was just to get into trouble.  My mam knew this.  She enlisted me in scouts with my two older brothers just to try to keep me busy and out of trouble.  Without doubt, scouting has been the foundation of my upbringing.  I have experienced so much while growing up in scouts.  I have travelled the world, befriended so many different people and learned to be a good person.  One of my most memorable experiences was when I travelled to Romania to assist in an orphanage for mentally and physically disabled children.  Experiences like this form a strong foundation of leadership, volunteering and teamwork.  Scouting taught me to aim high, learn from failure, succeed beyond expectations and that, no matter how difficult things may appear, a solution always exists.</p> <p>  I have volunteered with several other causes.  I am currently months from finishing my PhD in computational biology.  I have been relentless in achieving my goals.  I will be the best in the world at what I do and I will change other people's lives.  I am determined that this will be so.  Scouting has given this to me.  It has taught me that I do not need to be the smartest person in the room.  If I work hard, be prepared, do my best and am helpful, I will succeed.  I consider myself lucky for growing up within a local scout group.  Without it, I would have followed the path in front of me rather than creating my own and succeeding beyond my expectations.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017032200002#D00500"><p>I thank all of the witnesses.  I agree with the Chairman that the contributions from Ms Keegan and Mr. Moran gave us a real sense of the personal development that is involved in scouting.  This is the first time they have appeared before an Oireachtas committee.  We want to ensure that their appearance here is a positive one in terms of what the committee ask of them.</p> <p>  Mr. Lawlor referred to the World Scout Moot which is to be held here in 2021 and that he wants to use that as a platform for transformation and development in Irish scouting.  He is seeking our support for that programme.  Can Mr. Lawlor tell the committee how we can support Scouting Ireland in that?</p> <p>  Scouting is clearly a very positive movement of which we are all personally aware in our local areas.  The boat-building project in Limerick city is one very positive example.  The last time I met Mr. McCann was on the banks of the Shannon in regard to an outdoor development for one of the local troops in Limerick.</p> <p>  I note that the percentage of the population reached by scouting is 5%.  It is growing but it would be good to be able to spread the benefits even wider.  To have 12,000 volunteers is very impressive.  The witnesses said that there are waiting lists.  What are the obstacles to growing in terms of granting access to those on waiting lists and those who have not had the opportunity to engage with a local scouting group?</p> <p>  The witnesses have made us aware of the challenges Brexit poses for Scouting Ireland and probably other voluntary organisations as well.  I am particularly familiar with the ERASMUS programme.  People in Northern Ireland will possibly have difficulty accessing it.  Brexit will cause many difficulties.  What can the committee do to support the witnesses in their work, particularly in the context of this transformational programme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017032200002#D00600"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation and also for the extraordinary work that scouting does in communities throughout the island.  The ratio of 35 staff to 12,000 volunteers and 50,000 members is incredible.  I thank the witnesses personally because, as a youth member of the 37th Togher and an adult member of the 5th Cork, the Lough Scouts, I have benefited from the unique experience, training and education that scouting provides and experienced what it does for one's sense of confidence and leadership skills.  I know exactly how valuable and empowering involvement in scouts is, as either a youth or adult member.</p> <p>  I will come back to the ratio of staff to volunteers.  On a certain level it is a great positive.  It is also a significant challenge for any organisation to try and manage that so many volunteers with that number of staff.</p> <p>  As Deputy Jan O'Sullivan said, there are areas where scouting is very, very strong.  Cork would be one of those.  However, there are parts of the country that probably have less coverage.  I imagine that, because of the way it is structured, access to premises and getting people to become trustees are issues.  Could the witnesses tell the committee what proportion of scouting groups operate without their own premises or premises to which they have permanent access?  How many rely on community halls or GAA halls or places like that?  I imagine it is a minority.</p> <p>  Changes in charity regulations have put a very significant onus on scouting groups up and down the country.  If I understand it correctly, they have to register themselves as individual units.  That is obviously a big undertaking for volunteers.  How is Scouting Ireland responding to that?  Do Scouting Ireland and other voluntary groups need further resources from the State to ensure that they are able to meet their obligations under the charities regulations?</p> <p>  I will be travelling to NIjam at Crawfordsburn Scout Centre this summer.  There are very strong links between the North and the South.  I am concerned that Brexit will be very difficult for an all-Ireland body such as Scouting Ireland, which has a good relationship with the Scout Association of the United Kingdom and the Northern Ireland Scout Council.</p> <p>  I support the two projects involving Scouting Ireland working with unaccompanied minors.  There is work ongoing with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to bring over another category of unaccompanied minors from Calais.  Members of the Oireachtas were pushing for about 200 but I think it is going to fall short of that.  Has the Department engaged with Scouting Ireland on whether their programme can be expanded or whether another category of unaccompanied minors could be brought into that project?</p> <p>  Is Scouting Ireland considering expanding the Lelievelet project in Limerick to other places?</p><p> I have a few questions in terms of asks for the committee and things we can support.  What is the current state of play in relation to Scouting Ireland's applications for capital funding for Larch Hill and Killaloe?  The applications were made a number of years ago for those two very important projects.  Second, there are 35 full-time staff to 12,000 voluntary staff and 50,000 members.  It is a reflection of a very efficient organisation.  However, is it adequate and is there a need for additional funding for Scouting Ireland from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs?  Is it something the committee needs to push?</p></speech>

It is a very important project for us.  There is a bit of the John Kennedy thing about it.  We are not trying to do it because it is easy, we want to do it because it is hard.  If we set ourselves a major target and objective, it had be one in the face of stiff opposition.  There was a brilliant performance at the world conference by Ciara Keegan and the young team to win the bid.  It is very much about developing our young people on the route to the moot.  We have a thing called AcadaMoot which is about certifying our young people in project management skills, logistics and all of those skill necessary to run an event of that scale.  It can be very good for scouting in Ireland.  It also involves a focus on our older age group, our young adults, which is really important.  The committee has seen two wonderful examples of them here today.  It could also be very good for the country with 120 nations represented.  We would love to bring some of them to the Houses of the Oireachtas to meet Members and perhaps have a youth parliament or United Nations of scouting, which would be wonderful.  That would be a great opportunity.  That could be very good for the country and do for scouting what the Special Olympics achieved in terms of perception and the impact across the country.  That could be quite important.</p> <p>  We have worked with the Minister and her officials to seek support for this.  It is a bit like the Olympics.  Iceland is hosting the moot this summer, the flag will pass to us in July and our event will take place in 2021.  Iceland is a lot smaller than Ireland in terms of population and scouts there had significant support from the Icelandic Government for the event.  We seek support from the Government here and are working actively with the Minister and her officials to secure it because it is a big challenge for our organisation.  I hope that answers the question.</p> <p>  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire raised the issue of the challenge of staff ratios and coverage across the country, which is really important.  To give an example, we have one development officer to cover the area from Sligo to Clare.  Development officers are the people who work to open new groups.  We have set a target of opening between 15 and 20 new groups a year and, perhaps, expanding 90 existing groups to allow more young people to benefit from scouting.  We have done that in Lettermullen and Letterfrack in the west recently.  However, it demands work from professional staff.  We have identified that professional support is particularly required to open groups among communities in disadvantaged areas.  As such, we are engaging with the Department now to try to get more development officers so that we can open scouting in those areas, which we think is very important.</p> <p>  Access to premises was also raised.  Approximately 50% of our groups have their own property or exclusive access to a property, which is a very important thing for a scouting group.  One cannot imagine a GAA club operating without its own premises and it is similarly the case for a scout group.  It is a big challenge given our programme.  It is approximately 50%.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. O'Connor to deal with supports for changes to the charities legislation.  He has been actively involved in ensuring compliance with charities and company law changes.</p></speech>

It identified a number of issues for us which is resulting in a proposal for a national and local restructuring.  That means our groups will now have to register as individual entities, i.e. as individual charities.  Obviously, that entails big challenges for us.  We have already registered our groups in Northern Ireland with the Charity Commission there, so that process is finished.  However, to get that done, we had to have people in place to assist groups.  We had to develop resources and provide training and we had extra insurance requirements because we were asking people not only to be volunteers locally anymore but to take on legal responsibilities as trustees of their groups.  Until now, a scout group council could have a membership of 20 or 30 people sharing the responsibility of running it.  The proposed restructure to help us with compliance in this area will shrink the group down to five or seven people who will be the identifiable trustees and responsible for all the actions of the scout group.  That clearly imposes big challenges in terms of how we maintain democracy within the group to provide all our volunteers and young people with a say in how it is run.  That requires a new way of thinking and a great deal of work is having to go into that.  Our national council in three weeks time will debate these challenges, cast some votes and decide how to make progress in this area.</p> <p>  From a Scouting Ireland point of view, this has been a three-year project and it has been resource heavy.  That means we have had to use our volunteer resources, including expert volunteers in this area.  We have also had to use professional resources meaning people who are knowledgeable and qualified in the area on our professional team.  We also had to pay for some support on this also with financial and legal advice.  Every time we have to allocate resources to something like this, it takes away resources from something else.  Typically, it is the front-line stuff that suffers straight away.  We are pulling people off our front-line support to allocate some of their time to help us with this project.  The project is obviously a major and worthwhile one.  We want to be compliant and to demonstrate accountability, transparency and probity but that does not come without a cost.  It seems to us that this added cost is an unintended consequence of the legislation.  Other groups and organisations are having to face this now.  We see it within our own NYCI network.  It is a sectoral issue rather than just a Scouting Ireland issue.  Any organisation dealing with young people, working with local communities, handling money and going through vetting is facing these challenges.</p> <p>  As we pull resources from our front-line support, it means we are not getting to our scout groups as often as we would like.  We are failing to provide the level of support to groups that we would like and we are not developing as many groups or sections as we would like.  To be blunt, we need more resources allocated to us to allow us to do both.  We want to do both.  We want to be compliant and we want to develop and provide people with more opportunities.  Ultimately, it is the case that there is only so much money in the account and so many hours in the week.  Extra resources are needed for us to do everything we want to do.</p></speech>

I was not a scout.  I have to put my hand up there.  What really struck me in the presentation was the material on youth mental health.  I advocate for mental health and campaign on mental health progression.</p><p>I know from involvement with the arts that using arts or community organisations can greatly strengthen their resolve.  Young people can learn more about themselves and take care of their emotional well-being much better and improve their personal development.  There is a blueprint already in the scout movement, which the witnesses have highlighted.  While it may not have been highlighted in the past, I hope we will continue to speak more openly about mental health problems although there is still a stigma attached to them which we all have to try to combat.  The scout movement seems to contribute to combatting it.  Young people are growing up in a different way and with a different outlook from those of generations before theirs.  That is a cultural change which has to be flagged but there is an opportunity to use that.  The scout movement is probably aware of it but I am not.  We need to do more to promote that type of education because the marketability of the scouts in respect of mental health is strong and young people will identify with that.  Presentations to this committee show that cyberbullying starts at eight and nine years of age.  That can be combatted.  The committee might consider how to co-ordinate resources.  </p><p> Have the scouts approached any mental health organisations to work as partners in a strategic way rather than in isolation to promote good mental health?  While ensuring everybody's health and safety, is there any red tape that can be shed in respect of compliance that would free up the witnesses' time?  Do the witnesses see fluctuations in the people joining the scouts when it has recruitment drives?  We know that in a time of economic prosperity volunteerism drops.  Does that happen in the scout movement?  In a time of recession volunteerism goes up maybe because people have more free time. </p><p> Is there a big fluctuation between city and rural members?  If there are fewer rural members we could tie the scouts into our work on rural regeneration.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming here today.  I have read their presentation.  I was not a scout but my sisters were and they loved it.  I am very friendly with the family who <i>per se</i>ran the scouts over the years.  I am not sure what the organisation is now in Mayo, where I come from, but they were very committed and provided a lot of enjoyment to children in the area.</p><p>Is there any reason to believe that funding will not be forthcoming for the World Scout Moot next year?  It seems to me to be a project that would necessarily receive funding.  What level would the funding be?  In communities where scout groups do not have their own buildings, are GAA clubs, town halls and community centres generally co-operative in providing a venue?  I would imagine they are.  I thank the witnesses for the positive work they do for children around the country. </p></speech>

We know the movement wants more money but Mr. Lawlor might put that in the context of the annual funding it receives from the State, if any.  Where does it come from and where do Mr. Lawlor wish to see it going?  The objective of this meeting is to highlight the work the scouts do, create awareness of it, recognise the State's involvement or lack thereof and see how we can improve on that.</p> <p>  I would love to see a scouting group begin in Clonakilty, where I come from.  How would I or any member go about that?  What infrastructure is required to start a group to add value to our society by introducing scouting in our area?</p></speech>

This year it stands at &euro;876,000.  That represents a 5% improvement on last year which was a 2.5% increase on the previous year.  Before the recession, it stood at &euro;1.3 million.  Like most organisations in the sector, we suffered a cutback of approximately 35%.  That knocked us back a fair bit.  We have had to be prudent.  We understood the challenge to the nation and shouldered our burden.  The fact that we are growing helped a little but it has imposed strains on us.</p> <p>  Apart from that annual funding we receive project funding for certain projects, for example, the youth employment project in Limerick, which came from dormant accounts.  We very much appreciated that support which allowed us to do some different things.  Our refugee programmes have not been funded but we are optimistic that the next round will be, particularly the funding for the rover scouts working with the Greek scouts, which we think is a very important programme for Ireland.</p> <p>  On the capital side we were disappointed because we engaged in major capital works last year at Killaloe and Larch Hill, which cost approximately &euro;1.3 million.  We made significant submissions to Government on that.  We received a grant of &euro;50,000 towards the Killaloe project but we had made significant submissions on that.  It fell in the change of Government, which was a disadvantage.  In Larch Hill almost &euro;1 million was invested without any State support whatsoever.  That is our major centre in the Dublin area.  It is a state-of-the-art 56-bed hostel and training centre.  We are delighted to have it but it would have been much easier for us if we had support on that capital project.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question. </p> <p>  Starting up a scout troop is very expensive and we support that internally.  Before Ms Kelly took on the role of research officer she was a development officer in the west of Ireland and so is probably best qualified to give an insight into what is involved in supporting the establishment of a new scout troop.  We would be thrilled to do that in Clonakilty if and when we can. </p></speech>

It is the local community to which we respond and with which we engage about opening a scout group.  Normally somebody from the area picks up the telephone and asks, "Where is my local scout group?" or "How would I go about setting one up?"  People engage with the national office and details are sent to the local development officers.  The community person is then asked to go out into his or her community to rally the troops and gather as many people as possible who would be interesting in setting up a scout group and volunteering as scout leaders.  It takes a number of months to train the adults.  It takes significant time on the professional side to engage with them and it is only after all of the adults have been trained and when they are ready to engage with the children that we recruit them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.306" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Lawlor" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017032200002#G00200"><p>I will ask the chief scout to comment on the issues of dens, property and so on which are related to the charity issue.  Local groups are our strength.  They are based in the community and, a little like a GAA club, absorb whatever energy is in a local area to make things happen.  That is more challenging in disadvantaged areas.  We have wonderful support in our engagement with other community organisations, but it is a big issue for groups to have somewhere to meet, store their equipment and train.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.307" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Christy McCann" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017032200002#G00300"><p>I welcome the intriguing and interesting questions because it shows that there is engagement.  Sometimes we cannot see the wood from the trees and sometimes think scouting is only what is important, whereas it is about the young people whom we are there to serve.  It is our great intention to increase the percentage of young people involved in scouting, but that has a knock-on effect and, in some cases, presents tremendous challenges.  There was a question about the number of scout halls.  As Mr. Lawlor alluded to, half of our groups have their own premises.  Anyone connected to a group with its own premises would probably only then value having a safe haven where young children could meet and parents would not have to worry that they were out and about or in danger.  They are under the right supervision with their friends and have a place in which to meet to talk about, for example, mental health or LGBT issues.  They can meet in small groups and talk among their peers.  That is a core foundation for the success of scout groups around the country.  Unfortunately, we do not enjoy that luxury in every town, but we have the goodwill of the GAA and various schools and organisations that share premises.  However, it is never the same as it is like sharing a house with somebody else.  One cannot leave one's pictures on the wall or log one's photographs and one does not have a sense of belonging.</p> <p>  These are the challenges and while it would be great to have a scouting group in every town and be able to answer that need and because we do not like to refuse a scouting place to any young person, before we launch a scout group, we have to make sure it is sustainable and that there is a future and a lifeline, whether it be funding or support.  Not everything we do is created through funding; much of it is done through partnerships with the likes of Pieta House.  They allow us to tap into resources such that our programme becomes relevant and meaningful.  Whether we have scout dens, we have partnerships in local communities and scouting will survive.  It takes support nationally and locally, which is why we are so successful with the number of groups we have.  However, we know that our reach could be much greater, but then we are very much dependent on adult volunteers.  We have 12,000 adult volunteers doing scout work - I keep being told that is greater than the number in the Army or the Garda - but they are under time pressures and trying to maintain their own families.  They also have to cope with all of the other pressures in life.  What generally keeps many of them engaged is the fact that they can bring their own children into the organisation when they are involved.  It is part of growing up and becoming a family-oriented activity.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the Moot.  In Ireland we are good at acknowledging that it is a global movement and the best way to show this is by bringing the world to Ireland in order that people can see various cultures.  Diversity and inclusion are at the core of our programmes.  When we create an event, not only are we selling Ireland as a country but we are also selling the culture and mixes and matches that go within it.  That is why we encourage biting off more than we can chew, but we recognise the greater long-term benefits.  When the Moot is over and the memories are still there, we will have a legacy from it in so far as the national campsites will have been enriched, local communities will be more aware of what scouting is about and premises will become available.  Without knocking on the door of NAMA and similar bodies, there are tonnes of premises lying idle in communities and perhaps with the will and support of public representatives, doors might be opened.  We are good at the scouting part but not good at the begging part.  That is why we do not ask for enough money and help, but this is our opportunity to ask public representatives to open the door and point us in the right direction.  The goodwill, as witnessed here, is also witnessed within the community, but scouting is perhaps the best kept secret.  Much of the good scouting happens on the hills or in forests.  It is now time for us, in using opportunities such as this, to shout from the rafters that we are working with young people and that it is not so much about scouting.  We welcome the opportunity to do so.</p></speech>

A positive response to the challenge of strangers coming to our shores should be cherished among young people.  That is why scouting groups are involved in this issue in a world in which fear is being bred and there is the exact opposite response from leaders.  It is correct to establish that value and state clearly that Ireland is a country that welcomes those who are at a distance from their homes.  We are involved in the refugee access programme for the benefit of those coming to our shores but also for that of our young people in order that this value is inculcated in the nation.  That is part of what Ireland is about.  We have good engagement with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on this issue and look forward to receiving support in this regard in the future.  We will expand our refugee programmes in the next few years and would like to part of the new programmes coming on stream.</p> <p>  The Deputy also referred to the number of staff.  It is far too few to run an organisation of our scale.  We have outgrown our professional capacity.  Our recent manpower planning suggests we are ten to 12 staff short on the basis of the current volume of business, which means that we have to rob Peter to pay Paul to keep projects going and keep balls in the air.  We understand the country has gone through a difficult time.  However, there are 40,000 youth volunteers, of whom we have 12,000.  There are 1,400 paid youth workers, of whom we have 35.  Scouting Ireland is, therefore, good value for money.  It will be important in the years ahead as the economy strengthens to recognise this.  The fact that Scouting Ireland has been good at this should not disadvantage us and we should be allowed to improve our programmes.  That will require professional support to open new groups, work in disadvantaged areas and expand our programmes for young people.</p></speech>

I would like to end with a word of encouragement.  We have a large young viewership, but we could promote scouting on social media.  We are big at this time of the morning on live television.  I do not wish to put the representatives on the spot, but they have made powerful presentations, although I do not want to take from anybody else's contribution.</p><p>With regard to what makes the community we create different, I do not know of any others that are as pure.  Our whole ethos is concerned with actual human connection and interaction.  That message is getting lost a little, especially with social media.  There is something really nice about the fact that I feel as though I have a friend in every county.  Regardless of whether I know them, there is someone there with a neckerchief.  As I got older, I started to see that, in the exact same way, I had a friend in every country that has scouting.  It is a global view.  What one is entering into is a global network.  There is not much I can think of that I cannot do because I have a friend or brother or sister scouts all over the world.  I cannot see that kind of insurance and trust in the world in any other organisation.</p></speech>

I have friends I tried to convince when I was younger.  The earlier one goes in, the more one gets from it.  It is particularly hard to get involved with things like this in the teenage years.  If one becomes part of the organisation as a cub or beaver, it is just part of one.  It is very hard to explain.  If one is from a disadvantaged area such the one we are from - most people would be in the DEIS category - it is so easy to get into trouble.  Scouting is a great opportunity to get out of it and find something else.  One does so many fun things.  One does what one wants to do.  The most important thing I have got from it is meeting different people.  Particularly if one is from a disadvantaged area, one is thinking about this a lot, in every situation.  It hinders one's confidence but when one grows up in the scouts, one meets so many people from different socioeconomic classes and becomes aware of them.  One talks about silly things, particularly when one is a kid.  Particularly when one is a kid, one will talk about anything and say anything.  One learns from this.  Then one learns that where one is from does not actually matter.  One does not realise it when one is younger.  When I was starting university - I was the only one from my school - I did not know anyone.  No one in my family could even tell me what it was like.  The prospect terrified me but when I went in on the first day I was fine.  I said the people were like people I meet everywhere.  That is the big difference it made for me later on in life.  It really prepares one for anything one meets.  It is a lesson.  It is like life education.  To me, it teaches one to be a good person and have common sense and empathy with others.  It results in a desire to help people wherever possible.  When one does that, people usually want to be a part of one's life.  That is the biggest thing I have got from the scouts.</p></speech>

I welcome those watching our proceedings online.  </p><p>On behalf of the committee, I warmly welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, who is accompanied by the Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Jim Breslin, as well as by Ms Laura Casey and other officials.  The purpose of the meeting is to allow the Minister to have an input into the committee's work and outline his views on possible reforms.  </p><p>The Committee on the Future of Healthcare was established in June 2016 because of a recognition that cross-party political consensus was needed in order to reform the health service.  A key objective is to devise a ten-year plan to reform the service.  The committee's terms of reference also emphasise the need to establish a universal single tier service in which patients will be treated on the basis of health need rather than ability to pay.  A consensus based approach has been adopted to all of our work.  In order to help to achieve this, the committee has held a number of workshops in recent months.  Since last June we have consulted widely on a range of possible reform options.  The committee is working with a team of health policy researchers from the centre for health policy and management in Trinity College Dublin to examine international evidence on universal health care systems.  Since our establishment, we have consulted a wide range of people and groups, including national and international health policy experts, a large number of patient organisations and several professional groups.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I again welcome the Minister and invite him to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to set out some of my views on the future direction of health policy.  We all know the challenges that we face in the area of health and that these issues have been with us for many years.  We also know that it takes time to give effect to reforms in the health service.  I believe that, for a variety of reasons, there is a certain amount of reform fatigue, one of which is certainly the absence of a long-term plan founded on the consensus necessary to have confidence in its delivery.  That is why I was so strongly supportive of the commitment in the programme for Government, the commitment of all parties in the D&aacute;il and, in particular, that of the Chairman, Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall, to establish this committee to avail of the considerable advantages in having broad political consensus on the strategic direction of reform.  Of course, the Minister of the day has responsibility for setting policy and should be and is accountable to the D&aacute;il.  However, if we can achieve consistency of approach at a high level for a period of years, we can improve the position for patients, their families and the many dedicated staff who work in the health service.</p> <p>  I await with great interest the outcome of the committee&rsquo;s deliberations.  As members know, there are certain issues such as those related to system governance and the finalisation of a five-year HSE service plan, mentioned in both the confidence and supply agreement and the programme for Government, on which I have deliberately not moved until I have the benefit of the committee&rsquo;s work.  However, I have now been Minister for the best part of a year and have a strategic perspective on these and other major issues which I would like to share with the committee in the hope that it will be of assistance.  Genuinely, it is in that spirit that I am here.  While I wish to share my views and perspectives, what is most important to me and all members of the committee in the work they have been doing is that we arrive at a political consensus.  For what they are worth, these are my views, but reaching political consensus is of paramount importance.</p> <p>  The report of the committee and the work that will follow will be significant for the country.  This is the last chance for a generation to get it right.  We all know the compelling reasons we have to make the most of this chance.  I will elaborate further in the course of this statement on each of the priorities which I believe need to underpin the future direction of health policy, but, broadly, they include a shift in the model of care towards more comprehensive and accessible primary care services; an increase in health service capacity in the form of physical infrastructure and staffing to address unmet needs and future demographic requirements of citizens; exploiting the full potential of integrated care programmes and eHealth to achieve service integration based on the needs of patients across primary, community and acute care services; strengthening incentives for providers to respond effectively to unmet health care needs by ramping up activity based funding; empowering the voice of clinicians and providing them with opportunities to contribute to the management of health services; further developing hospital groups and community health organisations, aligning them geographically and, as they develop, devolving greater decision-making and accountability to them; following this with the provision of a statutory basis for hospital and community health organisations, operating as integrated delivery systems within defined geographic areas; and, once statutory responsibilities and accountability have been devolved from the centre to hospital and community health organisations, dismantling the HSE and replacing it with a much leaner national health agency.  In the interim, because we cannot wait for all of this to happen, we need to reform the existing legislation within which the HSE operates to improve its governance structure.</p> <p>  It is important to place Ireland&rsquo;s experience of health service delivery within a comparative international context and take a long range view.  That is not to say, however, that we can simply adopt another country&rsquo;s health service, but through comparisons we can learn about ourselves; our strengths and weaknesses.  In the past attempts have been made by reputable international bodies with health expertise to rank health systems.  I have referenced a number of comparative exercises in my full statement which I will take as read.</p><p>First, we compare well on health status.  In particular, live expectancy has increased by five and a half years over the past two decades in this country.  Second, we have relatively high levels of reported unmet needs and the main reason for this is the cost of health care.  I believe this is confirmed by our own experiences as public representatives.  The biggest challenge facing our health service relates to coverage and access.<br/><br/>Over the past few months, I have made no secret of the frustration that I felt, and I am sure members of this committee feel, at some of the problems our fellow citizens face in accessing health and social care.  I say health and social care because problems of access are not confined to surgery or unscheduled hospital care.  Access is also an issue in respect of community-based services. <br/><br/>In line with the key theme that has emerged from this committee&rsquo;s consultations, I believe we must find a way of bringing about significant improvement in access.  We should do so without losing focus on other crucial goals such as patient safety, efficiency and cost effectiveness.  The overarching objective must be population well-being and disease prevention or what we now refer to as the healthy Ireland agenda.<br/><br/>In devising a strategic way forward, we must also have three other factors in mind.  First, every country faces challenges in this area.  As we live longer, as technology changes, as new treatments are developed, and as people&rsquo;s living standards improve, the demand on our health service will probably always challenge the level of provision.  At any given point in time there will always be limited resources available.  That is just a reality and a statement of fact.  I think we will all agree that we need to do better than we are doing at present.  To do so, we must have better systems in place to guide us in setting priorities and allocating finite resources.  Over the next decade we need to get past the stage of constant firefighting to a place where we can have a mature debate on how to set priorities and where to develop our services.  <br/><br/>The second point I would make is we are not starting from a blank page.  It is always tempting to sketch the perfect system on a blank piece of paper but health policy is not just an academic exercise.  It is about trying to develop, reform and build a system while at the same time providing services day in and day out to the people who need them.  That is part of what makes this a unique and demanding challenge.<br/><br/>The third point I would make is that there are many disparities in the way in which we, as citizens, experience health care.  Health inequality is a major issue.  It will become even more marked in the years ahead unless we find ways to serve all of our people better.  This will require us to pay greater attention to addressing differences in access and outcomes as a central part of ongoing performance evaluation and to work with other sectors, nationally and locally, to address underlying social issues that impact on health and well-being. <br/><br/>I mentioned at the outset that I have not moved ahead with structural change or changes in HSE governance in deference to this committee's work.  I am not a believer in structural change just for the sake of doing so and it has not proved a panacea in the past.  However, if our structures are not best serving patients, then change they must.  I must stress that when I talk about HSE structures not serving patients or others in need of services, I am not talking about HSE staff.  In fact, I know from my interactions with staff that they suffer negative impacts by structures that place too many layers between health service leadership and front-line staff.<br/><br/>Just as important as the design of structures is how we bring them into operation.  Improving a system while simultaneously delivering services places a premium on a planned approach.  For example, this requires the development of the actual capability to discharge functions before they are transferred or devolved to another.  A benefit of a ten-year horizon is that it provides a context for carefully planning the evolution of structures so as to avoid unduly disrupting the primary focus on improving care delivery.<br/><br/>The key entities for managing service delivery that are now in place in the Irish health service are hospital groups and community health organisations.  These are at different stages and both require significant further development.  This will bring decision-making closer to the point of care delivery and will provide a counterweight to the over-centralisation of decision-making and accountability that impedes service responsiveness.  <br/><br/>I am convinced that hospital groups and community health care organisations, CHOs should be geographically aligned.  Due to considerations of specialism and critical mass, hospital services generally require to be organised across larger populations than community services.  Therefore, I do not believe that in the first phase it is necessary to have the same number of hospital groups and CHOs but a hospital group should ideally cover the same geographic area as one or more CHOs.  Having hospital groups and CHOs operating on this basis will facilitate collective performance and accountability arrangements based upon pre-agreed and shared goals, budgets and incentives.<br/><br/>The next stage would be to provide a statutory basis for hospital groups and community health organisations.  Rather than do this separately, it is my view that we should legislate for integrated delivery systems within defined geographic areas that, for now, I might refer to hospital and community health organisations.  What I am outlining here is a clear journey towards a more devolved, responsive and integrated delivery system, although I acknowledge it will require time and careful planning.  An integrated approach will enable us to move beyond the silo mentality and structures that often exist in the delivery of current health services.  <br/><br/>My Department is on the record as saying that the current HSE directorate governance arrangements, as set out in legislation, need to be reviewed.  While this committee is developing a ten-year vision for the health service, and this may, I would imagine, and hope will result in significant change, including legislative change, in a number of phases, I respectively suggest that more immediate improvement in existing national governance arrangements is merited.  Subject to the committee&rsquo;s report, I intend to ask my Department to come forward with proposals to improve governance arrangements for the HSE for so long as the HSE continues in its current form.  This will include examination of the current vesting of governing authority in the HSE directorate, including the fact that the director general is currently responsible to the directorate for the performance of his or her functions.  Many members of the directorate, however, are actually subordinate to the director general.  We really need to take a new look at this matter.  I do not think we need to wait for the end part of a ten-year strategy to move ahead with this matter and I hope that we can develop a political consensus on that.  However, with the development of stronger, more accountable and geographically-aligned providers, the opportunity will arise to begin to more fundamentally consider organisational arrangements at national level.  The overall HSE project initiated in 2005 can be legitimately criticised in a number of areas but the need for national arrangements for planning and sharing of expertise and services for a population of less than 5 million people cannot.<br/><br/>We have gained much in recent years through national initiatives in areas such as the cancer programme, the integrated care programmes, the fair deal scheme, eHealth and other areas.  We need to retain such capability and avoid reverting to stand-alone geographically-based organisations in the mould of the old health boards.  However, the national health capability that takes the place of the HSE is likely to be a much slimmed down body.  In my view it is likely to be more equipped to lead than to directly control and, accordingly, with fewer management layers between the top and the front line.  <br/><br/>There is also a question as to the respective roles of such a body and the Department of Health.  In some countries of not dissimilar size, such as Scotland, the Department itself commissions services from regional providers but in others, an organisation at a remove from Government of the day, and the Civil Service, plays this role nationally.  I genuinely have an open mind on the question of where such a national agency should sit in terms of the Department.  I would appreciate input and guidance from the committee in that regard.  <br/><br/>The challenge in any set of proposals is to devise a clear set of principles and a framework of accountability that ensures better and more rapid decision-making and responsiveness.  They must also fully recognise the demands of parliamentary accountability. <br/><br/><b></b>I am sure all members are familiar with the demographic and epidemiological challenges this country faces.  These challenges are common to the vast majority of developed economies.  I shall not go over this matter in detail this morning, although I have elaborated a little further in my full speech that has been circulated.  As things stand, the annual increase in the number of people over the age of 65 in Ireland is approaching 20,000.  The overall number in this age group is expected to increase by more than 36% between 2016 and 2026. What this all means is that the nature of the demands that the health service must provide for has changed.  Today, the great challenge is the management of chronic disease.  These are long-term conditions that can be treated but not cured.  In some respects, chronic disease is simply a feature of living longer but in many other cases the onset of disease is influenced by lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption.<br/><br/>As chronic diseases are often managed rather than being cured, this shift in the burden of disease requires a shift in the way that health care is conceived, provided and managed.  Traditionally, health services have been structured to provide episodic care but we now need a far greater emphasis on continuous care.  That is why the World Health Organization has placed so much emphasis on the development of person-centred and integrated care, which is care that is organised around patients and not just around groups of conditions or around health facilities such as hospitals.<br/><br/>Ireland faces particular problems in meeting this challenge because, historically, our health system has been highly hospital-centric with a comparative under-development of primary and community-based services.  In effect, the challenge we face is to develop a new model of care that is better suited to the needs of our population now and into the future.  We need our hospitals to work more effectively, we need to develop primary and community care and we need all of the components of the system to work in a more integrated and co-ordinated way.<br/><br/>Many of the necessary features of the new model of care are already apparent and some are already being put in place.  First, because chronic disease is related to lifestyle, we need to drive ahead with the healthy Ireland agenda.</p><p>As a country, we have made considerable strides in tobacco control, and there is a growing consciousness of the need to have healthier diets and take more exercise.  However, we cannot be complacent; we must drive ahead with implementation of our strategic approach.  This includes public health measures targeted at discouraging harmful levels of alcohol consumption.<br/><br/>Second, because chronic disease is continuous, care and management of patients with these diseases must also be regular and continuous.  It must begin with better information and self-management but must also be provided and supported to a far greater extent through primary and community care.  I know this is an area that has been discussed in detail as part of the committee's deliberations.  The programme for Government seeks to achieve this decisive shift of the health service to primary care with delivery of enhanced primary care in every community.  I suggest that this is not a politically contentious point because both Government and Opposition have supported this goal over recent decades.  However, successfully implementing such a strategy is not as straightforward as saying we support it.<br/><br/>As we look to develop more comprehensive and integrated primary care, we need to consider the challenges which experience has shown us we are likely to encounter.  Achieving a high level of teamwork across diverse professionals with different employment and contractual relationships, priorities, cultures and approaches has proven to be challenging.  It has not always been easy to combine the efforts of salaried HSE staff and general practitioners paid through capitation for medical card holders and fee per visit for others.  Coverage and eligibility have also been issues.  For example, how can the role of primary care in population health, disease management and hospital avoidance be fully realised when the State's financial support is predominantly concentrated on paying for access for the one third of the population on the lowest incomes?  Also, in introducing improved primary care facilities, we now have examples of very successful primary care centres but we have faced problems in some areas with GPs locating in such centres.<br/><br/>While these challenges are closely related to our existing organisational, contractual and eligibility arrangements, all health services seeking to promote primary care face the twin challenges of achieving successful team-based, multidisciplinary working and enhancing the status of primary care professionals within the overall health service.  Let me be clear: despite these challenges, augmenting primary care services is central to any successful strategy to address health care needs and to promote population health.  I will be very interested to hear the committee's considered views on how the vision of enhanced, more integrated primary care can be achieved and the challenges in doing so overcome.<br/><br/>I suggest we can build upon important developments in the primary care arena in recent years.  These include the extension of eligibility for GP cards to children under six years, the development of the diabetes cycle of care and the ongoing investment in the physical infrastructure of our primary care.  Over the next ten years, however, we will have to significantly expand the scope of our ambitions as to what can and should be delivered in a community and primary care setting.  This will involve investment in people, buildings, diagnostics and training as well as, crucially, expanding the scope of eligibility for primary care services on a phased and prioritised basis, taking account of resources and capacity within primary care.  If we do not address this, we will continue to have a primary care system whereby the State's crucial link is to provide cover for a third of the population but not to provide financial support for the other two thirds.<br/><br/>As the committee is aware, we are at the early stages of negotiation of a new contract for GPs.  This is an important piece of work but is by no means the only element of the transformation we must effect.<br/><br/>My Department will shortly launch a consultation paper on the future development of community nursing.  In line with the recently concluded proposal put to both the INMO and SIPTU, we are planning to introduce new advanced nursing posts operating across primary care and acute hospitals.  These initiatives have the potential to support the delivery of multidisciplinary care, including active case management, through the introduction of greater nursing expertise in the community that until now has been located solely in the acute hospital setting.<br/><br/>We are also undertaking a significant programme of work in the area of home care.  We will launch a public consultation process in the coming months to allow those who have views on this issue to have their say, most particularly older people and their families.  We need to provide much better access to home care and we will seek to bring as much certainty to this access and the associated financing arrangements as we currently have for nursing home care.<br/><br/>We must also consider how services which are currently hospital-based can be deployed in community settings.  Community intervention teams and the maternity strategy are two good examples, and there is a little more on both in my full written statement.<br/><br/>Hospital groups will enable better configuration of hospital services with benefits in respect of safety, quality, access, cost and sustainable medical staffing and recruitment.  Hospitals working together will be able to support each other, providing a stronger role for smaller hospitals in delivering less complex care and ensuring that those who require critical emergency or complex planned care are managed in larger hospitals.<br/><br/>The evidence for how hospital services should and can be organised in a manner that achieves quality and sustainability is now being confronted by health systems the world over.  Medical technology and practice and global competition in training and retention of highly skilled health practitioners are all reshaping our hospital services.  However, as politicians, we have on many occasions been hesitant in interpreting and reconciling these unavoidable factors with the existing understanding and expectation of the public we serve.<br/><br/>We cannot simply rely on clinicians to explain to the public how the reality of hospital care is changing and set to change further, not just in Ireland but in every health service committed to achieving above all else excellent patient outcomes.  The committee had the benefit of hearing from the very eminent professor Tom Keane, who contributed so much to the progress we have made in cancer care.  Professor Keane gave very well-deserved credit, in my view, to the political leaders of the time who initiated and provided crucial support for these reforms.  Such credit is overdue because some of these political leaders were at the time the subject of unrelenting criticism in this House and outside from a range of political parties, including my own.  I believe the committee, through its final report, has an important opportunity and, I would respectfully suggest, a duty to explain these developments so that future Ministers for Health have greater support than heretofore to do the right thing on the basis of sound health policy.  In the era of &quot;new politics&quot;, without such support, the change necessary to deliver ambitious improvements in our health service as envisaged by the committee risks being severely hindered.  The recently completed report on the Northern Ireland health services, called Systems, Not Structures, summed up the challenge as follows:</p><blockquote>The choice is not whether to keep services as they are or change to a new model.  Put bluntly, there is no meaningful choice to make.  The alternatives are either planned change or change prompted by crisis.</blockquote><p>That is the view in Northern Ireland.  I believe the setting up of this committee was a vote for the former on our part.<br/><br/>I talked earlier about the importance of comparative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the Irish health service.  The extent to which public and private are interwoven in our health system is one of its most distinct and sometimes controversial aspects.  Our publicly funded hospitals deliver care to both public patients and private patients.  As far back as 1999, in the White Paper on Private Health Insurance, the potential drawbacks to this mixed system were outlined and these concerns expressed.  Nevertheless, in the interest of putting all the facts on the record, the White Paper also identified certain advantages of the coexistence of public and private practice in public hospitals.  These are set out in my full written statement.  In the intervening period, concerns about the allocation of scarce public hospital resources to private patients have grown.  This is partly attributable to the heightened concern about access for public patients generally.  It may also be indirectly influenced by the growth in private health insurance coverage from 1.5 million people, or 42% of the population, in 1999 to 2.1 million people, or 46% of the population, in 2015.  Over the intervening years, there have been proposals to eliminate private practice in public hospitals entirely on the one hand and, on the other, through mandatory competitive private health insurance, to extend private insurance to the entire population.  Whatever the direction of change, it requires careful consideration as it is likely to have a very extensive implication for hospital costs and resourcing as well as contractual and remuneration arrangements for hospital consultants.  Other more detailed aspects of current arrangements are worthy of consideration, including the misalignment of financial incentives, as between public and private patients.  At the moment, public hospitals receive a block grant for public patients and a <i>per diem</i>rate for private patients.<br/><br/>Movement to activity-based funding for public patients will see public activity remunerated on a per-case basis.  It would make much sense and is certainly worthy of consideration in this context to introduce a case-based charge for private patients and to equalise the tariff for public and private patients based on the efficient economic cost.  This would eliminate a concern expressed by many that the hospital would have an incentive to accommodate more private patients.  Full alignment of incentives would also require a movement away from fee-for-service payments to hospital consultants for private patients towards an annual remuneration inclusive of both public workload and the permitted and planned level of private activity.<br/><br/>I offer these as examples of how the detail of any change proposed in current arrangements will need to be thought through carefully because of provider issues, not least the fact that almost half the population has private health insurance and very many people with such insurance currently receive their care in public hospitals.  Wherever the political consensus lands is appropriate, but we do need to make those decisions in the context of these facts.<br/><br/>Wider consideration of incentives suggests that the introduction of stronger provider incentives for responsiveness and productivity can assist in addressing the widespread concern about access issues.<br/><br/>A strength of our primary care system compared to some others is that there are generally no delays in accessing GPs, although there can be issues in some parts of rural Ireland and some deprived urban areas in this country.  The responsive nature of general practice owes something to the strong financial incentives under the capitation-based choice of a doctor scheme for medical card holders and the fee for service for private patients.</p><p>In contrast, the traditional block grant approach to hospital funding entails very weak financial incentives for productivity.<br/><br/>I hope the committee will concur that activity based funding should continue to be used to promote stronger performance incentives for acute providers.  Much of the technical work is now in place to allow activity based funding for hospitals to be significantly ramped up over the period ahead, with further work potentially undertaken to incorporate measurement of quality and appropriateness.<br/><br/>A crucial aspect of quality and appropriateness is integrated care.  As we change hospital services and strengthen primary and community services, we will be challenged to ensure services are designed around patients, rather than the institutions that provide them.  Across the world, health services are grappling with the question of how services can be integrated in order that patients' needs are managed holistically and in as seamless a manner as possible.  This will not be easy to achieve - there is no magic wand for integration - but we are working to find the right path for the future.  In this regard, I refer to the integrated care programmes.  As members will be aware, the HSE is developing a number of integrated care programmes, which are focused on piloting new ways of working within the health service.  The integrated care programme for older people has put in place a number of<b></b>local initiatives on pilot sites.  The integrated care programme on chronic disease is developing four projects which include asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, heart failure and diabetes models of care, again focusing on multidisciplinary teams.  As insight is gained from these projects, translating those lessons into the broader health service will be one of the big concerns of the next decade.  The integrated care programmes are a great example of the benefits of clinical leadership in reshaping our health services.<br/><br/>As a society, we greatly value clinical judgment in relation to our personal health and that of our family.  It flows from that value that we must ensure we empower the clinical voice within the health service and facilitate a greater clinical role in health service management.  Clinicians in management roles should not be the exception to the rule but rather one of the legitimate options for management of our hospitals and health services.  This will involve the development of a range of opportunities and pathways for clinicians to get involved in management.  I am struck, when visiting health services, by the palpable frustration of clinicians who feel their voices are not heard in hospital decision making structures.<br/><br/>A significant amount of the work done in the health service consists of collecting and using information, yet the health service is a long way behind other sectors in society in using information technology.  I am aware the committee has given this matter serious consideration and we are making progress on the individual health identifier and electronic health record.  A clear strategy and programme of work are now in place and I look forward to these interacting with the outcomes of the committee's deliberations. <br/><br/>I refer again to the issue of capacity.  I have repeatedly made clear that increasing capacity is a priority.  This includes physical capacity, the staffing capacity to support this and harnessing untapped potential in the system.  My Department is managing a large capital programme, much of which involves the necessary replacement and upgrading of existing buildings, rather than adding to the capacity of the system.  This is an unfortunate consequence of the age of our health service facilities.  While managing this problem, we must also address the question as to what is the level of capacity required into the future, which is the reason my Department is working on a capacity review.  Unlike previous reviews, this capacity review will extend beyond acute hospital beds and will examine issues such as the provision of additional capacity in primary and community care.  This is the right approach which is also in tune with the thinking emerging in the committee.  While we need to have a view on capacity, it cannot be divorced from the need to shift the model of care that is more integrated and continuous, person centred and delivered at the lowest level of complexity consistent with patient safety.  It misses the point to argue that more hospital beds are the exclusive answer.  It is within this context that the capacity review will be undertaken.<br/><br/>I am also on record as stating there is no point in increasing physical capacity if we do not have the necessary staffing.  I acknowledge the intensive efforts of staff, management and the HSE who work daily to ensure those in need of services receive the highest possible quality of care.  I am acutely conscious of the challenging staffing environment our health services are facing.  Many initiatives are under way to improve staffing levels and we will continue with these efforts.  Increasingly, we operate in a highly competitive market for attracting and retaining many health professionals who are in short supply globally.  This is obviously relevant in assessing both pay and tax rates.  However, it also means we must enhance the attractiveness of the work environment with ongoing learning and career opportunities.  In return we should expect approaches to flexibility and change which are comparable to those demanded of health professionals in other health care systems, both abroad and in the private sector.  All of this will be required to achieve the vision set out on the establishment of the committee.  Whatever our direction of travel, the capability of our health workforce - health professionals, administrative staff and managers - will be essential to the success of the committee's proposals.<br/><br/>While I appreciate I have covered a wide agenda at some length, it is difficult to do so in a shorter time.  Having followed the work of this committee for a sustained period, I wanted to share with members my insights from my perspective.  The work of the committee to date has highlighted the considerable consensus around some of the key building blocks and we can all accept that this will require transformational as opposed to piecemeal change.  The challenge for the committee now is in determining the implications of each of its recommendations, what can be achieved realistically in the time period and in what sequence.  This involves prioritisation and, where progress will be resource dependent, consideration of cost.  This is no small ask but, through success, the committee will provide the reference point for successive Governments and D&aacute;la&iacute; in implementing real change in how members of the public experience health services.<br/><br/>I wish the committee well in its final deliberations and, once again, I offer it my continued assistance and that of my Department as it finalises its work.  I sincerely thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the non-partisan and dedicated way in which they have gone about their work to date.  This is also the way in which I try to go about my work.  I thank members for the opportunity to present my views today.</p></speech>

The first group of speakers will be Deputies Billy Kelleher, Hildegarde Naughten and Joe O'Reilly.</p></speech>

Are the views he expressed consistent with the view of the Department or are they personal?  I would like to find out whether there is broader support across the administrative system for the Minister's proposals and the views he expresses.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to hospital groups, community health organisations and geographical compatibility.  When he speaks of top-slicing the Health Service Executive and giving more dispersal to hospital groups, the key issue is who will be the future employer of staff.  The number of staff employed by the HSE when section 38 organisations are included is substantial, standing at approximately 127,000.  Will hospital groups become the employer in future or will staff be retained in a broader, larger national administration?</p> <p>  On hospital groups, when a hospital closure or withdrawal of a hospital service is proposed, often on the basis of clinical evidence, a HIQA report or guidance, politicians very often assume the role of advocating for members of the public.  In doing so, they do not necessarily advocate for hospital safety or patient safety.  If we are to develop a system, it must be sufficiently robust to withstand this type of influence, while also providing some form of accountability to a specific entity.  The democratic process needs to be engaged but this must be done without political interference, which was one of the failings of the health board system.</p> <p>  Does the Minister have a clear view of the geographical competencies of the hospital groups and community health organisations?  There is no doubt that decisions must always be based on clinical rather clinicians' reasons because there is a fundamental difference between the former and latter, as was clear in the process by which hospital groupings were proposed and various hospitals linked, which was not necessarily always based on clinical factors but for reasons related to clinicians.  We need to be conscious of this issue. </p> <p>  The Minister is correct that clinicians at all levels are frustrated by a lack of access to or say in management, even at ward level.  I ask the Minister to elaborate on how he envisages greater clinical input being achieved in the management and delivery of services.  </p></speech>

I understand the number of staff at this level has surpassed the level at which it stood before the crash.  Is it reasonable to continue to do this?</p><p>Finally, what type of organisation does the Minister envisage for running the national framework?  Would it be a slimmed down body similar to the National Roads Authority model, a streamlined body that would just guide national policy and let the hospital groups implement it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.332" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1315" speakername="Hildegarde Naughton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2017032200002#F00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his comprehensive presentation.  I note his comments on the importance of listening to the voice of the clinician, particularly the clinical director, and the importance of empowering that voice.  Will he expand on that?  The 2008 consultants' contract includes a reference to giving the clinical director executive powers, authority and accountability over developing and planning services and managing the allocation of resources.  Will the Minister discuss the powers of the clinical director in respect of budgetary decisions and how that would work?  As he said, many of them are frustrated with their role as they do not feel they have enough powers.</p> <p>  The health sector capacity review is very welcome.  The committee was provided with a response from the Department relating to the scope of that review.  There are at least ten public servants on the steering group as well as two academics in the health service.  It is important that the capacity review would be independent of the HSE so people can have confidence in its outcome.  I am aware that a review group of international experts will examine it, but I anticipate that they would only be validating the findings of the group.  It is important that the review is carried out independently so people have confidence in it.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's comments on the importance of the governance structures and re-aligning the CHOs.  The two big issues for hospitals at present are managing both the inflow of patients and the egress of patients, which is happening in the community and primary care setting.  That alignment must take place to have optimum management of patient flows, so I welcome the Minister's views in that regard.  I also look forward to his comments on the capacity review and the role of the clinical director and how he sees that being rolled out in our health services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2017032200002#F00300"><p>I welcome the Minister and his officials.  One of the terms of reference of the committee is the need to establish a universal, single-tier health service where patients are treated on the basis of need rather than ability to pay.  I do not see how that fits with what the Minister says with regard to performance incentives and his heavy duty reference to the private sector.  It appears that the Minister is alluding to continuing with the <i>status quo</i>.  While we are examining a universal, single-tier health service that is available when people need it, the Minister is talking about private health insurance and private patients in public hospitals.  That is a concern.  As I have told the Minister on a number of occasions, I believe that while we are working in this committee and doing our best to produce a good report that will inform policy and strategy for the future, the Government and officials in the Department are busy undermining and undoing any potential we have for success.  Nothing in the Minister's statement gives me a reason to change my mind.  It is disappointing that we all read much of what was in his statement in the newspapers at the weekend and earlier this week.  However, I suppose that is par for the course.</p><p>With regard to the reference to the organisational reform of organisations that the Minister acknowledges are suffering from reform fatigue, does he envisage a devolution of power to ward level?  I am referring to giving local clinicians and local managers the capacity and ability to recruit their own staff.  Under the current system, it is very difficult to recruit staff because the power does not rest in the hands of the people who should be making the decision.  Perhaps the Minister would elaborate on the continuation of the public and private mix and on whether, in future, he envisages allowing the clinicians and front-line staff to have the power to recruit their own staff.  Without that and for as long as we maintain the current system we will continue to lose staff at a rate of knots and not recruit the staff to replace them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2017032200002#F00400"><p>In response to Deputy Kelleher, I always thought the Department's and the Minister's views were supposed to align and that I was supposed to set the policy and the Department was supposed to implement it.  I assure him my speech reflects that.  Deputy Alan Kelly would remember how it is meant to work.  Obviously, I have worked with the Department in developing my views on this since I took office but, in fairness, much of that builds on the thinking of the Department of Health over a number of years.  We must be honest with each other.  Often it has been the political system, and I blame myself and my party for this as much as I blame anybody else, that has failed to deliver on the long-term policy proposals that are generated by the system.  In fact, many of the challenges that the HSE and others face, which I outlined in my speech, are challenges that have been imposed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, rather than by any unnamed bureaucrat or civil servant.  These are my views, but I wish to get to a situation whereby the committee's views become the view of all parties in the House so that they will provide ten year certainty in terms of the direction of travel.  That has been lacking to date.</p> <p>  In terms of the employer, the Deputy asked a very important question.  Two models could be considered, and I am interested in the committee's view on the way we should go.  One could have stand-alone employments for the hospital and community health organisations whereby they would employ their own staff.  The other model, and perhaps the more sensible way, is that one could have people employed as members of the overall health service and then assigned to the various group structures - which one is preferable would have to be teased out.</p> <p>  With regard to geographical locations, I am always a little nervous about politicians drawing lines on maps as I am not sure that we are best placed to do that.  I am not sure that we need the current number of hospital groups and I certainly do not believe we need the current number of CHOs.  This is a small country.  For a start, the CHOs and the hospital groups definitely need to align.  That is my priority.  What the geographical boundaries are is something on which I am happy to accept expert opinion and views and, indeed, local views through clinicians, hospitals, hospital groups and so forth.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right to highlight the difference between a clinical reason and a clinician's reason.  There is a big difference.  If hospital groups, or whatever we wish to call them, are to work, that will involve a consultant or other doctors being assigned to more than one hospital.  It will involve somebody living in a more remote or rural area having a consultant from one of the larger hospitals visiting their hospital to provide the appropriate services to be delivered in that hospital.  The Deputy is right to differentiate.</p> <p>  We agree on the clinical voice in management.  This has got lost somewhere along the line over the last decade.  The Deputy and I meet the doctors as we go about our business.  They are really frustrated.  We hear them in the media.  They basically feel that short of approaching the Deputy or me or going to the media, they cannot get their viewpoint across.  That should be a cause of alarm for all of us.  The clinical directorship was an idea to try to address that but I am not sure it has been fully empowered in the way I would like it to be.  We should reflect on that.  The three maternity hospitals in Dublin are all run by clinicians.  I believe they are doing very well.  It proves that clinicians can also lead the management team.  That does not mean that every clinician must be a manager or every manager must be a clinician, but it is a viable option that should not be seen as the exception to the rule.</p> <p>  Regarding what the national agency will resemble, I would appreciate the Deputy's views on that.  My view is that we do not wish to lose all that is good about the national agency.  It is easy for people to come here and slag off the HSE, point fingers or to be politically partisan about it.  It achieved some good things in terms of national standards and programmes.  Would the cancer control programme have been put in place without the HSE?  Of course not.  Those political and national decisions were taken.  In my view, standards, care pathways, commissioning and budgeting rest with an agency.  The daily operations and strategic planning for parts of this country should be devolved to a more local structure.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Naughton on the voice of the clinician and I have tried to address that.  I understand the Deputy's concerns regarding the capacity review.  Indeed, Deputy Kelleher and others have made those points to me as well.</p><p>We do not want the HSE and the Department to simply decide on a given number of beds and then take the view that the box is ticked.  We have tried to get the balance right with the international group and expert oversight.  However, I believe it is important for the Department to have a sense of ownership of the document.  In the past the Department has commissioned work only for it to become another report from another management agency.  There is a question of balance and we will endeavour to get that right.</p><p> The comments on the realigning of the community health care organisations and hospital groups were dead right.  We all visit hospitals.  We have all witnessed the hospital manager expressing complete and utter frustration when a patient is ready to go home but the manager cannot get him or her home to the community.  This is because the manager does not have in his possession the levers to try to get the patient into the community.  The manager has to go to an entirely new management structure, the community health care organisation structure.</p><p> We talk about an integrated approach to health care but we have two silo approaches.  For example, let us suppose Mrs. Murphy goes to hospital today.  She goes in through the hospital group structure.  Then let us suppose Mrs. Murphy needs to come back out today and she needs home care, an aid or appliance, nursing home care or access to the community and social care structure.  It is not at one and I do not believe we can stand over it, certainly not as part of a ten year plan.</p><p> I brought along to the meeting a picture that was sent to me when I became Minister for Health.  It is of Bevan, the founder of the HSE.  When he was setting it up, Bevan said that illness is neither-----</p></speech>

In any event, he said, "Illness is neither an indulgence for which people have to pay, nor an offence for which they should be penalised, but a misfortune, the cost of which should be shared by the community."  No matter how many times certain people try to tell the people of this good country that I have a given view that I do not have, that comment represents my view.  That is the view to which my party, the Government, the Opposition and all parties in the House have signed up.  We want to get to a point of universal health care based on need.  However, I have a duty to put it to any member of the committee who may become Minister for Health that he or she is going to have to find out what to do with the shortfall following any decision to the effect that private income would go from the hospitals.</p> <p>  I want to move towards a place where our citizens do not believe they need private health insurance.  However, we are a long way from that.  It would amount to blowing a &euro;700 million hole in the health service budget were we to get rid of that private income.</p> <p>  People should not try to misrepresent my views at what is a cross-party committee.  I am here in good faith.  People should not try to misrepresent my views in a partisan sense.  Deputy O'Reilly may be trying to create an ideological war.  I believe in universal health care.  Deputy O'Reilly can keep telling people that I do not, but that is my belief and that is what I want to deliver.</p> <p>  I also have a duty in this role to inform the committee of the complexities of arriving at that point.  We have to address that in the report of the committee and in my consideration of how we work together.  That is why it is right and proper, in fairness to the Chairman and the committee, to look at the ten-year horizon, because we cannot get from point A to point B immediately.  It is a question of how we sequence arriving at that point.  That is the challenge for all of us.</p> <p>  Reference was made to reform fatigue.  The major reason people have reform fatigue is that they have seen a great deal of time spent on structural reform without many benefits for patients.  It seems reform has been more about the structures and the systems rather than the patients.  Therefore, any structural reform we undertake has to be stress-tested against the question of whether it will make a difference to patients.  I genuinely believe that by removing layers in between the patients and the care they receive today, for example, the duplication of management structures between community health care organisations and hospital groups, we can improve things.</p> <p>  Reference was made to recruitment, delegated sanction, localising the process and empowering people.  As committee members will be aware, we have localised the ability to recruit nurses through delegated sanction at director of nursing level in hospitals.  This is based on a view that the INMO and SIPTU put to me.  They made the point that it is all well and good for me or committee members or anyone else to say we are going to hire 1,200 new nurses this year, but when they staff go back to the hospitals they find great difficulty in doing that.  We have delegated sanction to the director of nursing for 2017.  It will be interesting to see how that works during the year.  We have given a level of autonomy that they have not had before now.</p></speech>

This group is working to try to take the politics out of health and to deliver for years to come.  The Minister is the sitting prince, for the want of a better phrase, and so we have to put questions to him as the person who holds the mantle at the moment, even though this will transcend his period in office.</p> <p>  This is a moving target.  Things will change.  Technology will change.  Needs will change.  Standards of living will change.  Everything will change.  What we put in place will have to be adaptable for the future.  There is no such thing as best practice.  There is practice and there are circumstances.  It is a question of how we implement it.  We have to be able to tailor it.  My question is as much for Mr. Breslin as for the Minister.  In any event, does the Minister believe that there is capacity in the Department of Health and the current structure of the HSE to do these things?  Does the Minister believe there is the capacity, including the intellectual capacity, dare I say it, the will or the drive to do these things?  It is not a personal thing; it is a real request.</p> <p>  We all know the HSE has to change.  The Minister referred to dismantling and a leaner system etc.  I agree with the Minister's comments on alignment.  However, I am concerned that any decisions that might be made may impact on what we are going to deliver.  I appeal to the Minister to bear that in mind.</p> <p>  I agree with the Minister on a range of issues relating to primary care, capacity, etc.  However, we are stuck for time so I will fire on with my questions.  The Minister is currently in discussions with the general practitioners - as well as consultants - regarding contracts.  The Minister referred to activity-based funding.  That is an interesting thing and if we have more time, we will get into it.  I have real concerns here.  These are central issues.  If any advancement in these areas is made that is contrary to what we come up with, then we could have be a real issue.  We need close alignment.  We are aiming to head towards a single tier universal health service based on need.  Any potential commitments made to either of the groups I have referred to would certainly impact on that.  Will the Minister bear that in mind?</p> <p>  Reference was made to the capital programme.  We know what we have to do in terms of capacity.  We know that we have to improve it.  I agree with the Minister regarding alignment.  There will be decisions on the capital plan but there is a cross-over in terms of the work of this committee.  We have to be careful that decisions are not made from which we cannot row back.</p> <p>  Reference was made to case-based charging in the insurance area.  That is an interesting concept and I would like to have more time to go through it.  Will the Minister elaborate on his vision as the sitting prince?  What does the Minister mean by that?  How would it work?  I am somewhat nervous in respect of going down this road about how it would actually work.</p> <p>  There are two areas where we cannot wait for this committee.  I would be happy for the Minister to advance these areas.  Ever since PPARS and every other information technology disaster that has arisen over the past 15 years, there has been no capital expenditure for e-health.  From a technology point of view, the situation for health care is a joke.  I hope the Minister will advance that matter.</p></speech>

The same point also applies to integrated care.</p> <p>  The Minister referenced new politics.  I do not believe new politics.  I am of the view that the concept is a joke, frankly.  How would someone sitting in the Minister's position deal with the situation?  We are going to put in place a plan for ten years.  Yet, potentially, a report on the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, could conclude that maternity services, accident and emergency services and paediatric services have to go.  How will that come into place?  I am not suggesting that it should.  I am simply using it as an example.  How would that come into place if there is a Minister who is representing that area sitting beside the Minister for Health at Cabinet, especially given the political times in which we live?</p> <p>  I am somewhat annoyed about this last matter.  We read all the principal issues arising from the Minister's statement in the media before he came before the committee.  That was disrespectful to the committee.  Why did it happen?  If it was simply a mistake, the Minister should say so and we will all move on.  However, it is something the Minister should explain.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.342" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1432" speakername="Mick Barry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2017032200002#G00800"><p>I listened to and read the Minister's speech.  He put an emphasis on the integration of services, the integration of hospital structures with community health care organisations and the need to move away from silo structures and the silo mentality.</p><p>The Minister did not comment on the biggest silo of them all, however.  He did not comment on the area that indicates the greatest need for integration.  I refer to the fact that we have a health care system that is divided into at least four components, namely, fully owned and controlled public hospitals, the section 38 sector, the section 39 sector, and a growing private sector, including hospitals, nursing homes and home care agencies.  The remit of this committee is to come up with a plan to deliver a universal, single-tier health system.  It has been clear from the vast bulk of the witnesses we have had in and the vast bulk of the submissions that we need a stronger public health care system.  I put it to the Minister that this objective is not compatible with a health care system in which only one section of four is fully owned and controlled by the State.  The private sector has a vested interest in doing down the public sector.  As many experts have said, for the private sector to succeed, the public sector must fail.  Sections of the health service, including those under sections 38 and 39, and the private sector, could not survive for even a week in some cases without public funding and the backing they have from the taxpayer and public health service.</p><p> It is interesting that the Minister carries a photograph of Nye Bevan around with him at all times.</p></speech>

It is a case not just of what we want to deliver for people but also of how we do it.  Nye Bevan saw the instrument for doing this as a national health service free at the point of use, funded from general taxation of a progressive character and underpinned by legislation putting the responsibility on the Minister for Health.  I put it to the Minister for comment that we are never going to deliver universal single-tier health insurance in this country without an Irish national health service of the type described that fully integrates under the banner of the public health system.  This does involve measures such as nationalisation of the section 38, section 39 and private health care sectors.</p></speech>

He spoke about a slimmed-down version of the HSE.  I would like to draw his attention to a document we all received a few weeks ago on the health executive structure.  It refers to 24 different people, not including the staff of the seven hospital groups and nine community health care organisations.  We were taken aback a little by the numbers.  When we met Mr. Tony O'Brien early in our deliberations, we received a similar chart, which did not show half of this particular structure.  I get the feeling that the HSE is moving in one direction.  Perhaps it needs to be aware that this is happening.  The Minister's thoughts are very much in line with those of the committee.  This matter needs to be tackled before it gets out of hand.  There are 24 people in positions, with contracts signed and so on.</p> <p>  Another issue concerning contracts has arisen on a few occasions.  The general practitioner contract is of significant importance in making future progress.  There is an issue concerning the negotiation of the general practitioner contract.  The Irish Medical Organisation is on board and the National Association of General Practitioners is not.  I do not remember the name of the third general practitioner group.</p></speech>

There will not be a meaningful contract otherwise.  I hope the Minister can take that on board.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about bringing the HSE under the Department and perhaps considering a director general over the whole structure.  Would that bring politics more into the running of the HSE as opposed to less into it?  We all have the ambition to try to take politics out of the future running of our health care service as much as possible such that it will be independent of whoever is in power and follow and stick to a plan.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to progress and to the initiative for the under-sixes.  I do not believe that was progress; it was more of a retrograde step.  Any future access has to be on the basis of need.  Programmes should be extended to those in need.  In this regard, reference was made to those with chronic illnesses, etc.  These are the people whom we should be targeting.  Clogging up the system with people who do not necessarily need the benefit in question is not the way to go forward.</p> <p>  Primary care was mentioned.  Everybody in this room is very much on par in this regard.  Investment in primary care, in addition to accountability and governance, is critical if we are to provide a good service in the future.</p> <p>  With regard to the hospital groups, the Minister spoke about more integration and carrying out more procedures in the smaller hospitals.  It is a great idea but, in reality, unless there is somebody accountable for driving this and making it happen, it just will not happen.  Hospitals will look after their own backyard.  Unless there is somebody in charge of each hospital group, with, I suggest, a board of management to which they are answerable, we will not make progress in this regard.  That is something we can put in place quickly.</p></speech>

With regard to Deputy Kelly's points on a couple of areas, I assure the Deputy I will not be moving ahead until we benefit from the committee's report.  There are one or two exceptions, to which I will now speak.  Any of the structural changes would require legislative change.  We have a minority Government.

On the question of whether the Department of Health and HSE have the capacity, I have a couple of points.  Building up capacity will be key.  There are many excellent people in the Department of Health and HSE but it is disconcerting to note that when one advertised in the past for certain jobs, including some senior roles at various levels within the health service, there was not the level of interest one would have liked there to be.  One would hope that by paring back management structures, one would be able to have fewer managers, but perhaps remunerated according to a package that would attract international expertise.  That is my genuine gut feeling on this.</p> <p>  There has been a lot of good work done in the Department of Health on building up expertise over recent years.  Not that the Department would ever say it to me, I sense that there is nearly a desire in the Department at official level to get on with driving these measures.  It needs the political leadership that I hope we can collectively bring to this on the publication of the report.</p> <p>  I acknowledge there are very strong views on e-health.  This is an area in which we are genuinely advancing already.  I was talking to those concerned in the maternity part of the hospital in Kerry only last Tuesday.  They are now producing e-health records for all babies.  Digital birth recording is now occurring in Kerry.  That follows on from the initiative in Cork.  It is being rolled out in the Rotunda next, I believe, or to Dublin in any case.</p> <p>  One hopes there will shortly be movement on the national children's hospital.  I expect to see a significant e-health element to the project also.  We have a lot to do in this regard.  There is a significant capital ask.  I expect there will be a considerable amount of work on this in the committee's report.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelly probably used Portlaoise hospital as an example of a bigger issue.</p></speech>

The benefit of trying to reach a political consensus is it strengthens the Minister of Health's hand.  I regularly read in newspapers local calls for me to do this or that in the health service that contradict directly the clinical advice to me.  I try to hold the line and follow clinical advice.  It is important to differentiate between clinical advice and clinicians' views, which differ.  Before any change happens in a hospital we have to make sure there is capacity in another hospital.  I am not convinced there is spare capacity in many of our public hospitals. </p><p> I hope I understood the question about the private versus public charging mechanism.  There is an odd incentive, which people have raised by way of parliamentary questions and at this committee, in terms of the private patient being more lucrative for hospital income than the public patient.  One idea I have proposed is to try to align that rate of pay so that there is not a reverse incentive for a consultant to see more private patients.  </p><p> In respect of the media, when I am asked at the weekend am I still planning to fulfil a programme for Government commitment to dismantle the HSE and what will I tell the committee next week, I am perfectly entitled to outline some of my views.  When I was a member of Committee on Public Accounts, PAC, however, I was always struck that it was not generally the witnesses who tended to leak the speeches.  People might want to reflect on that today based on some of the commentary I have read and the level of detail.  </p></speech>

One reason health has been a partisan political issue for many years is it has suited many of us to exaggerate our differences on health.  The overwhelming majority of people in this House, and I am one, want to see universal health care that can provide on the basis of need rather than ability to pay.  The Deputy and I probably have different views on how we arrive at that point.  I think we arrive at it by building the capacity in the public sector and convincing people that they can rely on the public service.  It is possible to take out private health insurance in the UK but very few choose to do that.  I do not see us outlawing private health insurance or private hospitals.  As we improve the health service people will begin to move.  The National Health Service, NHS, is far from perfect.  We should also consider the headlines in the British press about its financial sustainability, recruitment and retention of professionals and see that it has similar problems.  We should not hold up the NHS as a model but it is available as a founding principle for universal health care.  I am wary of suggesting, as my party has done in the past, that we can go to any country and lift its health policy to use here.  We need to have an Irish version of the system. </p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Brassil about governance.  I will need a parliamentary majority to embark on a ten-year strategy and deliver universal health care.  We should be embarking very quickly on a Bill to improve the governance structures of the current HSE while on that journey.  If we can muster a majority and if the committee has views on what that structure might look like I would like to move ahead with it urgently.  That would address some of the issues outlined in terms of making sure that my views, those of the committee and the Department can be properly conveyed to the HSE.  The director general of the HSE has stated publicly there is a shared frustration at the current governance arrangements.  That should be one of the first things we set about doing, as an interim measure. </p> <p>  The Deputy is dead right about the Department versus a national agency.  The concern is that if it is subsumed back into the Department, it returns to the political realm.  As for how much politics has been taken out of health care since the establishment of the HSE, in truth many of the issues I am asked about are operational matters.  It is questionable how much has actually been removed.  It is a legitimate point and that is why I have kept an open mind on it.  I am very clear that the national element of the health service needs to be much slimmer and leaner.  I am open to persuasion by this committee on its location as a stand-alone agency or within the Department.</p></speech>

We also recommended that the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, would be involved to provide a strong policy base for the contract.  </p> <p>  There is a lot of concern in the committee about the lack of independent oversight of the HSE and the fact that it does not have an independent board.  It is very hard to see how that could be addressed without addressing the organisational structures at the same time.  There are many views around the table on the other aspect of it.</p></speech>

I am not pre-empting the report but if there are parts of it we can move on quickly alongside that I would be happy to do so.  If there are parts that would take months I respectfully suggest and we can engage further on this, that we consider a temporary measure to improve governance because I do not believe the current governance structures are in any way adequate for me to discharge the functions the House expects me to discharge.</p></speech>

Underpinning that shift will be a GP-led service in community and primary care and a new GP contract.  This needs to be a radically new contract, as opposed to one that tinkers around the edges.  Negotiating a new contract with only half the GPs is not good and will not yield a good outcome for the contract or the patient.  We need the views of all GPs, not just a section of them.  The Minister will repeat the errors of the past if he does not include all GPs in this contract negotiation.  He needs to be courageous and decisive.  In the context of the new health service we are proposing, it is very important to have a strong GP contract.  It is a fundamental error not to include all GPs in that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.368" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2017032200002#K00200"><p>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his input and comments.</p> <p>  I have no ideological hang-up about the private and public health sector.  I am a strong supporter of the public health sector and hope that that is part and parcel of what we require in this country.  The public and private sector should complement each other rather than occupy each other's space.  The input of the clinicians has been referred to as a cause of frustration.  We have often talked about having an accountable, democratic forum where decisions are made and there is accountability.  That is missing from the system that has been there for the past number of years, and that has to change.  I believe the proper structure should comprise about four regional authorities which are directly accountable to the Department of Health and the Minister, who is in turn accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  That line of responsibility and accountability will remove many gripes taking place at present which cannot be removed or dealt with otherwise.</p> <p>  Health education has been referred to as a contributory element in the delivery of a good health service.  I agree entirely with that.  A much greater emphasis needs to be placed on health education, good health policies in schools with children and identification of the various health issues likely to emerge in the future long before it becomes necessary to refer them to a hospital.</p> <p>  I think we need something else as well.  Living within our means with regard to the delivery of all services is important.  At election time, we politicians tend to succumb to promising what we would like to deliver.  We would all like to deliver everything but unfortunately we cannot afford to deliver everything.  Therein lies the problem that emerges some time later when we take from what we already have in place in order to provide for something that we cannot afford without making the necessary provisions.  It goes on all the time.  We all contribute to that and that needs to stop.</p> <p>  The Minister referred to beds not being the entire answer.  I am not 100% sure about that and I go back a long way on that.  I heard this 20 years ago and 30 years ago throughout the health service.  There was a shift away from beds in the UK, which said that no beds were required and to strip the number of beds down.  We did that in this country, and yet every time a constituent comes to us, as politicians, inquiring as to when he or she is likely to get service, we ask why that person cannot get service and what the problem is.  Has his or her consultant or GP gone on holidays, or is there a lack of beds?  Lack of beds comes up again and again, and people say that their consultants cannot find beds.  There has to be some reason that is the case, and unless we deal with that, we are wasting our time, because we are going to have a blockage in the system and it is going to hold up someone else.</p> <p>  Let us be careful about primary care.  It costs money as well and the critical issue is the extent to which it is going to take money from other parts of the system.  We need to put more money into it.  There is no doubt about that.  We need to have it along with the rest of the system and working in conjunction with it.  As has been discussed by the committee, the linking up of the hospital system with regional authorities and dovetailing one to the other, from primary care to regional authorities, is an excellent idea.</p> <p>  I want to make a point on a matter I have heard a few times recently.  The Committee of Public Accounts has no function relating to policy.  It is specifically excluded from infringing on that area.  We should never forget that.  It deals with value for money and efficient spending of resources made available.  It is not a policy-making body and has nothing to do with that.</p> <p>  We have the opportunity to reinvigorate the health services in line with the requirements of now and the future.  We have previously been providing health services in line with what was sufficient ten or 15 years ago.</p></speech>

To reverse out of that, nobody is unaware that I fundamentally believe that one cannot quantify activity without geographical alignment of community health organisations and groups.  Borders need to be found.  I am putting on record for probably the 20th time that I do not see how it can work without that.  I feel very strongly about clinicians in management roles.  There cannot be an assumption that just because somebody has a medical background or is clinically trained that that person somehow has a deficit in management skills.  Many GPs run practices where they manage a business as well as the clinical end.  Pharmacists are able to manage a business along with our clinical roles, and to declare my interests there, I am a community pharmacist.  I cannot understand what the difference is once one moves into the acute hospital set-up.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan mentioned good health policies in schools.  To follow on from that, I firmly believe that giving medical cards to children under six was a very good move.  I believe in that because I have seen throughout my career that just because somebody is well-off does not necessarily mean that that person brings his or her children to the doctor, and just because somebody is badly-off does not mean that that person does not bring his or her child to the doctor.  I fundamentally believe that every child in this country is equal and should have equal access to everything, good health care being the first of those things.  If we foster a generation that is brought up in the health service and is being monitored by GPs in the primary care setting, we then raise a healthy generation that is within the system, a bit like the digital babies in Cork.  We start off with good data for a particular generation.  I can understand how some people would argue that it should be need over age group, but there is an argument there for a phased approach to bringing people into the system, so we are looking at defined age groups within our population.</p> <p>  Moving to a primary care model requires money and also a change in mindset, for people to get it out of their head that they have to attend the accident and emergency department with a broken toe.  We have to, through the work in this committee, in the Joint Committee on Health and the Minister's own work, convince the public that primary care is not a second class place to go.  They will get the optimum treatment.  That is something that cannot be brought in overnight.  It is something that we have to work to deliver to get public buy-in to it.</p></speech>

I echo what Deputy O'Connell said about his statement.</p> <p>  One thing that came up more frequently in general terms, particularly with the TCD team, was about a "big bang" approach as distinct from a phased approach.

Would he accept that the present system constitutes perverse incentives for hospitals where there are targets set for private income and that arrangement very much militates against public patients?</p> <p>  The Minister talks about a statutory basis for local structures within the health service in the proposal he has.  I am keen to know what he has in mind for that.  What kind of prop or structure would he be talking about?</p> <p>  On the issue of giving greater strength to a clinical voice in management, the Minister talked about the frustration for clinicians.  I think it is fair to say that the frustration works both ways.  One of the strong recommendations made to us as a committee, by Professor Tom Keane, was that hospital consultants would be made accountable at hospital level.</p><p>I wonder if the Minister has a view on that.  He actually suggested that it should be underpinned by legislation as is the case in a number of other jurisdictions.  I would welcome the Minister's views on those points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.374" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2017032200002#L00200"><p>I thank the Chair.  I will try to be quick as I know the committee is tight on time.  I agree fully with Deputy Harty.  One of the crucial terms of reference of the committee relates to the decisive shift to primary care.  I have been very clear in my view that one cannot do that without a new GP contract.  I add that GPs are not the only part of the very important shift to primary care.  There are also advanced nurse practitioners, community nurses and many other specialties including pharmacy, dentistry and a range of therapists.  However, a new GP contract is needed.  The current contract is not fit for purpose because it originated 44 years ago and while it has been tinkered with in many ways, it has never been changed radically.  A great deal has changed over more than four decades.</p> <p>  While Deputy Harty does not fully agree with me on this at all, I have tried to be more inclusive than any negotiations with GPs have ever been before.  Even by his own declaration, the fact that Deputy Harty is a member of the NAGP and the IMO is interesting in and of itself.  I wonder how many replications of similar GPs there are across the country.  Certainly, I have the impression anecdotally that a lot of GPs are in both organisations.  The reality of the situation is that there is a framework agreement between the IMO and my Department on the negotiation of GP contracts.  I am respecting that framework agreement which it is important to do in this industrial relations environment.  I believe in honouring agreements and that one says we must negotiate with the IMO.  However, I have not just done that.  I have brought the NAGP into the process for the first time ever.  Deputy Harty will remember that it was excluded from the under-sixes contract.  If one looks back at the record of the Houses, one sees that some responses to parliamentary questions suggested that the NAGP would never find itself sitting down with the Department of Health and the HSE.  I am now finding a formal consultative role for it and I am willing to work with it on the formalisation of that role.  Over time, let us see how that role develops and evolves.</p> <p>  While I agree that there needs to be a significant change in a new GP contract, it will not be a static document.  I do not expect that we will negotiate now and that a Minister in 40-something years will have another conversation.  This is an evolving process.  I am due to meet with the NAGP shortly and look forward to having a fruitful engagement with its representatives on the issue.  The ICGP is a slightly different body because it is the college.  I note the Chair referenced that as well.  I have had a good meeting with the ICGP and, while it does not negotiate for its members, I absolutely see a role for it in terms of feeding into the process.  We will ensure that happens during the consultative process too.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan is consistent on the issue of democratic accountability and he is right to be.  We must ensure that whatever structure we put in place includes a way to provide democratic accountability.  I will answer the Chair's question on my views in that regard in a second.  I am not proposing in my contribution today that we go back to the health board structure and rip up all that is good about the national structures.  There is a balance to be struck between devolved local decision-making on day-to-day operational issues and the absolute need for national structures and standards.  One will not deliver a maternity strategy, a cancer control programme, integrated care, fair deal or e-health without those sorts of things.</p> <p>  There is a clear need for more beds in Irish hospitals.  I am not suggesting otherwise.  What I suggest, however, is that it is not a panacea as I have seen in hospitals this winter, including in one where we opened a significant number of beds.  It provided temporary respite in terms of trolley numbers and then they flared right back up again.  We must recognise that a bed is not the same as something the members or I would sleep in at night.  It is much more complex.  What type of bed is it?  Is it an ICU bed, a rehab bed, a community bed or a general surgical bed?  There are lots of different beds and where they are located within the health service, the community or hospitals is something we need to examine.  There are also other ways to create capacity and if we make it about bed numbers only, we will let people off the hook in that regard.  On predicted data discharge, it is inappropriate for a patient to go into a hospital today who is fit to go home on Saturday but who, because the work has not been done to ensure he or she goes home, ends up stuck there until Monday.  He or she no more wants to be there than he or she needs to be there.  Predicted data discharge provides capacity and hospital length of stay activity based funding encourages more procedures to be done on a day-case basis also.  This is somewhere we can evolve.  The Deputy is dead right on demographics.  We must plan not only for the present but for very different demographics, in particular in relation to chronic disease and older people.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell mentioned geographic alignment.  I am one with the committee on this.  Where those alignments happen and how one draws lines on a map is probably not a question for now, but I agree on geographic alignment.</p> <p>  On clinical leadership, I share the view that clinicians have a greater role to play in terms of management, but that is as part of a team.  They cannot just be independent republics.  They need to be answerable and accountable.  Just because one is a doctor, it does not mean one cannot be a manager, but it is also the case that just because one is a doctor, it does not mean one will be a good manager.  It should however be seen as one of the viable options for managing the heath service and parts of it rather than just something we do in the maternity services and which some perceive as being of a different era in terms of structure.  It is a valid structure that should be looked at.</p> <p>  The way one ensures that primary care is not seen as secondary, if that is not ironic, is to put specialists out there.  In the eyes of the public, primary care is probably seen as a matter of going to see a GP before going to a pharmacy to get medication and returning home.  We are about to do work to put advanced nurse practitioners and specialist nurses in the community.  Currently, one must go to a hospital to see them in relation to a number of chronic disease conditions.  It is a step in that direction.</p> <p>  I agree that the under-six contract was good.  If one is talking about primary care, one needs to extend universality.  One has to start somewhere.  Starting with our children makes sense.  However, there are lessons to learn in terms of how it was rolled out as I have heard very clearly from GP organisations.  We need to ensure that the capacity exists within general practice.</p> <p>  Deputy Josepha Madigan referred to a phased approach as opposed to the big-bang approach.  We would all love to get to where we want to go by tomorrow.  However, recent history sounds a number of alarms in that regard.  Saying "I will abolish the HSE", as has been said in the past, turns out to be a great deal more complex than it sounds.  The decision to put in place hospital groups proved to be a lot more complex than it sounded.  Changing the model of funding ended up having to be abandoned.  Setting up the HSE did not work out as anyone expected, albeit it was a well-intentioned idea.  There is no way to do it other than by way of a phased process.  This would be a committee for a six-month health vision rather than a ten-year health vision if that were not also the D&aacute;il's general view.</p> <p>  On the Chair's questions, it is fair to say there is currently a perverse incentive.  I tried to allude to that in my speech.  One gets paid more for treating a private than a public patient.  I am not sure how one could describe that other than as a perverse incentive.  The 1999 White Paper outlines the drawbacks of that but also outlines some potential benefits in terms of consultant retention and the like.  These issues need to be teased out in a great deal of detail.  There are measures one can take relatively quickly to remove the perverse incentive while having the broader longer term discussion.</p> <p>  There was a reference to how we wanted to place the hospital and community groups on a statutory footing.  I would very much welcome the committee's views on this, but I envisage that this will be underpinned in legislation and that a board will be appointed.  Obviously, we have hospital groups on an administrative basis with the idea of boards on an administrative basis, but it needs to be made statutory from a governance and proper accountability point of view.  We need to consider in advance of drafting that legislation what we are devolving to groups and what we are retaining at the national level.</p> <p>  On the issue of clinicians, I fully agree with the Chair that clinicians are and should be seen as part of the solution.  We cannot make people better without them.  At the same, however, they have to be accountable in terms of their own work practices.  As I said in the speech, there are issues in relation to pay and tax that people raise when one talks about recruitment and retention but hand in hand with those discussions must go responsibilities, new functions and new roles.  As such, I am interested in exploring Professor Keane's idea further.</p></speech>

I wanted to get some clarification first.  The word "may" is used under the advice of the Attorney General.  If "shall" is put into the Bill, it limits me when it comes to discussing the matter further with other people.  The use of "may" enables consultation with other people.  The use of "shall" is a more definite decision and I would have to do it.</p></speech>

It would also empower the Minister to consult with others, as appropriate.  It is only technical wording, but I believe it would uphold the process of consultation with the same people with whom we want to progress this important legislation.  It would help from a health aspect to formalise it.  I realise it is a minor technical point, but I believe it is worthy of consideration in the context of the Bill.</p></speech>

It may have other difficulties for us.  That is where our concerns arise.  The expression "shall not grant a licence" is used in other sections.

I had this discussion 40 years ago in the House.  It relates to where "may" and "shall" are in conflict.  In the case of "may" the person with the authority had direction to do or not to do whatever is proposed or not proposed.  If the Bill states "shall" then there is no discretion.  It shall happen on every occasion.  That is the difference.</p></speech>

Let us consider the expression: "the Minister shall consult with such persons as the Minister considers appropriate, which may include".  The idea is to proscribe a process of consultation without necessarily ring-fencing the Minister in respect of who that might be.  I believe it is worthy of consideration that the Minister would uphold a greater threshold of consultation under the section in question.  Would that be more appropriate?</p></speech>

In most other similar legislation, we spend most of our time helping people caught up in the dreadful position of being drug takers and drug addicts.  In my constituency, down the road from my constituency office, is a methadone centre, over which I came under pressure for years because the constituents did not like it.  However, I recognised that it was an attempt to get people off hard drugs.  It is still in operation and I will continue to support it.  I do not have a problem helping people who take drugs with this dreadful problem.  I do have a problem with the fact that we are now as a State closing our eyes to drugs sold illegally on the street being brought into premises to be used in those premises, which are under the care and responsibility of the State, and that there would be no obligation on the user to engage in any form of rehabilitation on that premises.  There is nothing in the legislation which states that these people should engage, or even be encouraged to engage, in a form of rehabilitation.  </p> <p>  A very serious step has been taken in proposing legislation that the State get involved in this regard.  It would be different if it were a private matter, but it is proposed that the State set up these premises and take responsibility for them and that the taxpayer pay for them.  This is not just Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett trying to be awkward; it is a very serious situation, as far as I am concerned.  I am not suggesting for one minute that we should not do everything we possibly can to help people caught up in this situation.  However, we have an obligation when passing legislation that it can stand up to scrutiny.  As lawmakers, we cannot turn a blind eye to drugs sold illegally being brought into premises run by the State and used in those premises and pretend it is legal without any suggestion of rehabilitation.  At the very least, the Bill should be brought back to Report Stage after 12 months to whoever is in these Houses to examine what exactly has occurred after these measures have come into play.  There is not yet any provision in the Bill for this.  I ask the Chairman for his indulgence in respect of my comments.  As I said, I would have made these points earlier, only that I was out sick when my Second Stage slot was available.  I am availing of the opportunity to speak now because this is a terribly serious matter.  I have been in this House since 1981 and I do not ever remember legislation being brought into the House for Members to pass which would in effect turn a blind eye to the sale of illegal drugs and provide for a premises in which those illegal drugs could be taken without any suggestion of help for the people taking the drugs.  That is the point I wish to stress.</p></speech>

Deputy Barrett began by speaking about methadone clinics and the fact that in the past there were huge objections to them in communities and that we as public representatives were asked to stand over them.  The fact is that many methadone clinics have made a huge impact on people's lives.  I remind the Deputy that the legislation is committed to in the programme for Government and that we are committed as a Government to supporting a health-led approach to drug use rather than one based on criminal justice.  Unlike Deputy Barrett, I am not an expert on the law or anything else but I wish to point out a few things to him.  For far too long, people who are addicts have been labelled across this country, in every little town and village and in our capital city, as people who do not matter.  They do matter.</p></speech>

As we all know if we read the many articles on the matter that have appeared in newspapers and magazines over the years, many of them have died on the streets, in back lanes.</p></speech>

Everywhere they have been provided, yes, there was opposition when they began to operate but that has all subsided because people see definite change not only in the communities in which they live - for example, a reduction in material being left behind in public places by drug users - but also in the facilities themselves being provided to people with chronic conditions.  For many of them, it is the first step into any facility where they have the services of doctors and nurses, if required, and there are people who come out the other end.  This is an opportunity for this little country of ours to reach out a hand to these people who perhaps in the past felt very isolated and not very well looked after by the State.  It is the first time we have had legislation that could save the lives of those who are addicted to drugs, and it is about saving lives.  One can get into other arguments on the matter.  We have sat with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and consulted with a range of many people across the medical sector, all of whom have indicated to us that they fully support the legislation as currently proposed.  All I ask Deputy Barrett is that he give it a chance.  We all deserve a chance in life, as do these people.  The Deputy can home in on the fact that they are chronic users of illegal drugs, but that is a different argument altogether.  These are human beings who find themselves in the position of chronic drug use.  This is the first opportunity they are getting to go into clean, safe environments where they can build up trust with the doctors and nurses and other people working there and, perhaps, in time, come through a process of rehabilitation.  All we ask is that we be given an opportunity to introduce the Bill in order to allow these people, who are the most marginalised in society and whom most communities do not want, the opportunity to have a life and perhaps an opportunity to save their lives as well.  Nobody has died in any of these facilities.</p></speech>

I have the height of respect for any Member who has been here since 1981 and gets legislation far better than I probably ever will.  I understand some Members&rsquo; concerns about the turning of a blind eye to the sale of illegal drugs.  As I said on Second Stage, the legal classification of a drug does not change its side effect profile.  It does not matter whether it is legal or not.  It will be the same side effect and same problem.</p> <p>  I have worked in methadone services for years and was a pharmacist in regional towns 12 years ago during the epidemic stages of heroin use in the midlands.  To echo what the Minister of State said, this cohort is on the fringes of society and has managed to escape the GP, local community services and so forth.  These are vulnerable people down alleyways or in backyards, sharing syringes and bits of tinfoil, using bad diluents and bad solvents and ending up with secondary conditions as a result of their heroin habit.  We can either let these people continue to die in alleyways or we can try to do something about it.  We can all say it is terrible and ask why people take these drugs.  We can honestly make efforts towards dealing with the societal issues which lead people into this but that is a work in progress.  This legislation is about dealing with a problem on our doorstep.</p> <p>  Sometimes medicine is not about curing people.  Sometimes it is just about managing people and giving families a chance.  The Minister of State spoke about saving lives.  This sort of service can save the lives of the individuals in question but it can have a massive knock-on effect for their families too.  There is an attitude that heroin use only affects the worst-off in society and is a certain class issue.  It happens in nice sitting rooms the same way it happens in alleyways, however.  In anything we do with health policy, it should be to try to reduce harm.</p> <p>  I understand the issues of the legality and the scheduling of heroin.  While it is a schedule 1 drug here, these facilities have been established in other countries where it is also a schedule 1 drug.  If it can happen in other countries, it can happen here.  I would not be against a review of the facility or policy in a year&rsquo;s time.  However, I do not envisage a situation where, if an injecting centre is set up and these clean environments are provided, people will wake up some morning and decide to start taking heroin.  This is for people already on heroin.  There is a small cohort of users who cannot be targeted by services.  When it comes to rehabilitation points, these people are not in any way engaged.  If we can get them into these centres and develop a rapport and relationship with the people on site, we then have some chance of tapping in and improving their lives, the lives of their families and communities.</p></speech>

We have the highest number of intravenous drug users in Europe.  The negative health outcomes of leaving users on the streets and ignoring the problem are not working.  The evidence base is what we should all be focused on as legislators.  The evidence base from cities across the world is that such facilities have a positive effect in bringing people into a pathway of harm reduction and then rehabilitation.  That is why I and my party support the piloting of such a centre.</p> <p>  Will the licence for the injecting facility come under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts 1994 and 2003?  What is the comparative regime or will there be a new licensing regime?  Is the Minister of State intending to amend those two Acts or will their provisions suffice?</p></speech>

We are lawmakers. When passing laws, we must ensure they stand up to scrutiny and we have to be able answer people.  There are two questions I posed.  It is a real problem and we cannot hive it off by becoming emotional about the unfortunate people in question.</p><p>The main problem concerns where these people are going to buy the drugs.  These are illegal drugs being brought into premises that are the responsibility of the State.  The State has an obligation to uphold two laws, one on the purchase of illegal drugs and the second on the use of such drugs.</p><p> As I have said, nothing I am asking for is in this legislation.  There should at least be a provision allowing the legislation to be reviewed or a provision allowing advice to be made available to people so they may come off drugs.  The legislation is purely functional.  Section 2 is on the application for a licence.  The interpretation section speaks for itself.   Section 3 is on the granting of a licence, section 4 is on the surrender of a licence, section 5 is on the revocation of a licence, and section 6 is on the transfer of a licence.  Section 7 refers to the authorised user, section 8 is on the obligation of the licenceholder to provide information, section 9 is on the liability of the licenceholder, section 10 is on the disapplication of sections 3, 19 and 21 of the Act of 1977, section 11 is on the power of Garda to enter a supervised injecting facility and section 12 concerns regulations.  There is nothing in the legislation that would suggest that, as part of this process, we are trying to help people, not just give them some comfort regarding how they inject themselves.  There is nothing in the legislation about any form of rehabilitation or even a mention of the word.  Second, we still have not answered the question that, as legislators, we will be obliged to answer, namely, the question of how these people will get the illegal drugs.  They are being purchased by drug dealers, who will be able to operate within 50 yd. of the injecting facilities.  I do not want to be presented as somebody who is not sympathetic to people who are caught up in this horrible situation.  Of course I am as anxious as anybody else to help them.  This, however, is legislation that we have to stand over.</p></speech>

We had a debate in the D&aacute;il on Second Stage and I understand that Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett was unavailable on both occasions.  I am quite happy to listen to his comments, however.  He can bring them up when the legislation goes back to the D&aacute;il.  With regard to the Bill itself, there have been no amendments.

At the very least, we should provide that the legislation can be reviewed.  I am not asking that we throw out every provision in this legislation and I am not trying to be unsympathetic to those with a drugs problem but, as a legislator, I am trying to produce legislation that will stand up to scrutiny.  As it stands, it will not.  The only defence will be the emotional side, involving our being questioned whether we are going to do nothing about these unfortunate people.  That is not an answer to legislation.  We are the makers of the law and we should ensure it will stand up to scrutiny.</p></speech>

We all agree this is a gateway to harm reduction and that it would be desirable to follow through with rehabilitation and intervention to give people a chance.  Even in terms of language, it is worth signalling to the Oireachtas and the people that this is what we are trying to do.  It is making an intervention, first at the harm-reduction level and then giving people the rehabilitative piece.  An effort has been made to model this legislation on measures in places that have actually have tried to achieve this objective.  That it is not mentioned formally could indicate this is not what we are focused on, although it is what the Minister of State is focusing on, as I know.  Perhaps it is worth incorporating in the Title or elsewhere a reference to following through with rehabilitative intervention, thus signalling it is something the Minister of State is trying to achieve.  It is not in the Bill currently.</p></speech>

Originally my understanding was that we did have a methadone-like element included but I was wrong.  The purpose of the exercise has already been pointed out.  This proposal is not aimed at reduction but at protecting the health of those who are already serious users of illegal drugs.  It is merely to give some sort of control over the manner in which the drugs are used.</p> <p>  Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett made a valid point in that the question arises as to whether we can, on the one hand, be opposed to the use of illegal drugs while, on the other, allowing their use and supervising their consumption in an enclosed setting.  There are regulations in this area, which the committee has already discussed.</p> <p>  I am not an expert in this area and do not know the likely outcome in the event of a constitutional challenge.  I do not know what that would involve.  It is in this regard that a challenge could arise.  The purpose of the exercise, as I see it now, is not reduction but merely regulating the manner in which drugs are consumed and trying to ensure the worst-case scenario does not prevail, as happened in the past whereby injecting took place in all kinds of places, including in front of children and passers by.  The methods of such injecting are such as to raise serious health issues, which in turn could become a legal responsibility of the State at some stage down the road if, for instance, it were seen to ignore what is happening in the public arena.</p> <p>  I would have no problem with the Minister of State including, if she desires it, a clause stipulating the legislation should be reviewed after a year or two to ascertain its effectiveness or otherwise but we need to realise what the purpose of the exercise is.  There are two distinct issues that could well be in conflict.  One is the administration of the law, as it stands, and the other seems to be in conflict with that.  The purpose of the exercise, however, is not to have one confront the other; rather, it is to confront the issue of people injecting themselves in stairwells using unhygienic procedures and of their overdosing regularly.  The contention under this legislation is that there would be advice to users that would in some way influence them to prevent overdosing.  I hope that works.</p> <p>  I brought to the Chairman's attention earlier today another element that may be helpful in this matter.  It would introduce a reduction measure that could be very beneficial.  That will have to be done separately.  I was asked to bring it to the attention of the committee.  I will give the information to the Chairman and other members of the committee at a later stage.</p> <p>  The objective of the Bill is harm reduction.  It cannot reduce the extent to which drugs are used by people.  Without a doubt, the facilities would see supplies drawn from illegal sources.  I raised that question previously.  I raised it in the context of whether the Garda has a right to accost users of illegal drugs going to or from their injecting facilities.</p><p>I was concerned as to why the garda&iacute; would not have the right to do so.  That was where my misunderstanding was.  We are informed that it is legally applicable.  It does not matter whether something is in the programme for Government or not.  The Government can never introduce legislation that it knows to be illegal or unconstitutional.  It cannot be done.  This is what I spoke about earlier this morning.  We as politicians very often have great ideas that might not necessarily be applicable and certainly might not be legal in certain circumstances.  That something is in the programme for Government does not make any difference.  Legislation coming before the House at any particular time must be known not to be in conflict with the Constitution.  </p></speech>

I have no problem with the principle of taking these people off the street but as law makers, we must deal with reality and the reality is that we cannot introduce legislation that is clearly against another piece of legislation which says it is illegal to purchase drugs and that it is illegal to have drug dealers effectively standing outside selling them.

The Bill purposely states that the purpose is to reduce harm to people who inject drugs; enhance the dignity, health and well-being of people who inject drugs in public places; and reduce the incidence of drug injection and drug-related litter in public places and thereby to enhance the public amenity for the wider community.  I am very passionate about the fact that we have an opportunity in this country to make legislation that would help those people who society in general disregards.  I am passionate about that and I will not apologise for it.  I am not accusing anybody in the D&aacute;il or this committee of not having a heart or not believing that these people should be helped.  I never said that.  I may come across as being emotional at times but that is who I am.  I am passionate about this legislation and I am passionate because we have studied different countries and looked at legislation.  We visited a particular facility in Copenhagen and saw at first hand people who are chronic users who are at the lowest ebb in their lives being treated as human beings with trust and dignity and given an opportunity to be examined by doctors, nurses and other professionals when they are in the facility and have rehabilitation added to their services if they wish.  Many of them have never entered a facility like this before.  That is what this is about.  It is a pilot project.  In response to Deputies Barrett and Chambers, I do not know whether it will work in Dublin but I think it is worth a try.  Given that it has happened in other countries, we must give these people an opportunity.</p> <p>  Representatives from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na appeared before the committee and we have spoken at length with them as well.  There are people injecting and using drugs openly on the streets of Dublin night and day.  In many ways, but for the pragmatic and professional way in which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na operates, I can guarantee that there could be 300 people in jail in the evening.  Garda&iacute; in the city get to know people on their way to facilities like Merchants Quay Ireland or the Ana Liffey Drug Project at an individual level.  They know they are addicted.  They know they are not drug pushers.  There is no other group of people dealing with a very serious illness on a daily basis, namely, addiction.  I am very sorry if I come across as being emotional and passionate about this but I feel strongly that we are not the first ones to do this.  There are 90 such projects in the world and they work.  The statistics show that they work so why can we not try this in Ireland?  </p> <p>  I understand Deputy Barrett's legal mind.  I am not a legal person and would never come into any room or Chamber and insult anybody about whether they were compassionate or not.  That is not my job.  My job as Minister of State is to bring legislation through the Houses that will facilitate harm reduction to help those who are chronically ill.  That is why we are here and this is why I believe this legislation is so important.  It is an opportunity for us as a State to recognise that all people in the State have a right to be looked after if they are ill.  These people are ill.  I am not doubting Deputy Barrett, Deputy Chambers or any other Deputy in this committee or the Chambers who thinks otherwise but I think it is worth a try.  We are not doing it on our own.  We have gone through extensive discussions and have met with different groups, including An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the HSE.  Dr. Eamon Keenan was with us in Copenhagen.  We have spoken to different people who are already seeing the benefits of a facility like this.  That is what this legislation is about.  It is up to the Minister of State of the day, be it me or somebody else, to intervene if they feel the facility is not working to the regulations arising under the Bill.  This will be done.  I cannot give any guarantee other than I believe this facility is needed in Dublin at this point in time.  We need to go ahead with this pilot project.  Nobody deserves this facility more than those people, who are the most marginalised.  We all see them on a daily basis if we walk through this city or any other city in this country.

I do not doubt for one minute the sincerity of the Minister of State.  I do not doubt for one minute what she is trying to achieve.  This is fine.  I share her concerns and understand what she is trying to do.  We are here to pass legislation that will stand up to scrutiny.  What I am trying to say is that we should put every effort into the legislation, regardless of whether it is another section or not or, as Deputy Chambers mentioned, a provision stating that facilities be made available if those people who are using this facility wish to avail of advice about drugs.  We should put in something like that.  At least it shows that we are not blinded by emotion.  We must always temper our emotions when passing legislation and realise that we must stand over what will become an Act.  If any of us are questioned about how we can pass legislation that will allow for people to stand outside one of these facilities and sell illegal drugs to people going in and do nothing about it, we need to have an answer.

The purpose of this part of the meeting is to have a discussion on this issue.</p><p> I welcome Mr. Eoin Carroll of the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice.  We are joined by Mr. Kevin Hargaden in the Visitors Gallery.  On behalf of the committee I thank Mr. Carroll for his attendance here today to discuss this important issue.  I advise the witness that the format of the meeting is that he will be invited to make a brief opening statement and this will be followed by a question and answer opportunities for members.</p><p> I must caution the witness about privilege and I draw his attention to the fact that he is protected by protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence he is to give to the committee.  However, if he is directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, he is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded that under the salient rulings of the Chairman, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

I welcome the opportunity to speak to the committee today and I am heartened that it has identified penal reform as a priority for 2017.  Today I would like to focus on the need to reduce the amount of people in prison and to improve prison conditions; with an emphasis on young adults.  As part of my submission to the Committee I included our report Developing Inside: Transforming Prison for Young Adults &ndash; A New Approach to the Unique Needs of Young Adults (aged 18&ndash;24) in Prison.  We all have a tendency, a desire even, to produce more and more reports and we are also at fault in this regard.  It shows action and outputs.  We do not, however, sufficiently measure the outcomes we have achieved from these.  Ways to reduce the amount of people in prison are already known.  Two reports produced by this Committee - which I have included in my submission- provide blueprints for radical penal reform.  These reports are the report of the Sub-Committee on Crime and Punishment of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights entitled Alternatives to Fines and the Uses of Prison from March 2000 and the report by Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality's entitled Report on Penal Reform from March 2013.  These were cross party, non-partisan publications.  There were no minority reports, so everyone was in agreement.  Why is pressure not put on the Minister to implement all the recommendations of these reports?</p> <p>  In March 2000 the report Alternatives to Fines and the Uses of Prison determined that the balance of resources is skewed heavily towards prison and that punishment in the community should be the norm.  In 2000, when the report was written, we had 2,948 people in prison.  Today we have 3,722 people in prison.  Given the skewed resources, we fail to address some of the underlying reasons why people commit crime, such as poverty, deprivation, social exclusion, educational failure, unemployment, homelessness, mental health and drug addiction.  Some 13 years later the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality came up with the Report on Penal Reform, March 2013, which was more explicit, and recommended a decarceration strategy and called for the prison population to be reduced by one third.  This target would mean around 2,900 people would be in prison by 2022, which will be some achievement, being a further reduction of 800 on today&rsquo;s figures.  If we look at the aspirations in the 2000 report, however, this would still be too high.  Worryingly, the current figures suggest that progress in reducing prison numbers may have stalled.  The number of people in prison last week was 3,784.  This is higher than the average daily prison population in 2015.  The 2000 report highlighted that the size of the prison estate and by extension the number of people we have in prison, is to a large extent a political calculation that "despite popular belief to the contrary, imprisonment rates have a very small impact on crime rates and can be lowered significantly without exposing the public to serious risk".  I can refer the committee to several reports that attempt to forecast prison numbers in Ireland, but all these reports fail to realise that it is ultimately a political decision and can be as large as those numbers as we have seen in the US, or numbers as small as those seen in Scandinavian countries.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the issue of women in prisons.  While the numbers of people in prison on any given day has reduced significant in recent years, the numbers of people being sent to prison continues to increase.  This is particularly so for women.  The Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice is concerned about the dramatic increase in the daily population of women in prison and numbers of women being sent to prison annually.  Proposed solutions to reducing the number of women in prison &ndash; by providing a step-down unit &ndash; reflects the failed institutionalised approaches of the past.  Large hostel style accommodation post-release or part of a step-down programme will not dramatically break the cycle of homelessness or poverty.  The approach taken within the housing organisations such as the Housing First approach is required.</p> <p>  We would have a number of recommendations about prison numbers.  A renewed commitment to the recommendations of the two Justice Committee Reports should be placed on record.  A decision should be made - maybe not today - around what number of prison places we should have in Ireland and ultimately a cap placed on prison numbers.  We recommend a Housing First approach as an alternative to the step-down facility for women exiting prison.</p> <p>  With regard to conditions the 2000 committee report highlighted that many prisoners are held in conditions which are unnecessarily secure.  It said that a &ldquo;one size fits all philosophy is not appropriate. There is a need for different mixes of restriction and supervision [and that for the future] prisons constructed should be flexible, arranged around self-contained units. Regimes should be programme-driven and open to the possibilities of individual change".  This was also echoed in the 2013 report which called for a greater use of open prisons.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, for the most part our prison estate is a one-size model.  Since 2000 we have continued to increase prison sizes and we still rely on closed prisons, which still dominate, with limited access to self-management.  New builds since 2000 including the Midlands Prison and Cork Prison - and also in Castlerea Prison - did not look to innovate in how we detain people.  The Midlands Prison accommodates 870 people which, along with Cork Prison, mimics prison design from the 19th century.  To put this in context, prisons with a maximum capacity for 300 persons are seen as best practice. The 1985 Whitaker report recommended 100 as maximum capacity.  Prisons seen as progressive such as Shanganagh Castle and Fort Mitchel were closed in the early 2000s.</p> <p>  How people experience prison conditions is heavily influenced by how much time a person spends in their room or cell.  Lock-up times have not changed in over 30 years despite constant recommendations for change.  The overwhelming majority of people are in closed prisons where the regime is 16 to 17 hours per day in the cell.  The 1985 Whitaker report recommended a minimum of 12 hours out-of-cell time.</p> <p>  The principle of normalisation has been spoken about for decades, including within Irish Prison Service documentation, in order to make prison life more like that of life in the community.  The current daily routine could not, in any way, be considered normal.  Our recommendations around prison conditions and sizes are to reduce prison sizes and provide accommodation based on security need, avoiding the one-size fits all model, and at least 12 hours out-of-cell time with meaningful activity.</p> <p>  The issue of young adults in prisons is of particular interest to the centre.  We have produced a report that was distributed to the members.  I also have hard copies with me today.  Imprisonment is inherently a destructive experience for everyone, but particularly for young people, no matter how good the facilities within the prison.  A young person&rsquo;s growth and development is linked to decision-making; young people grow by learning from both the positive and negative decisions they make.  In prison, however, a person is not allowed to make any decisions, except the decision to keep your head down and cause no trouble.  Prison is an environment which strips people of their responsibilities, stunts opportunities for development, makes them feel unsafe and restricts their opportunities for integration into adult society.</p><p>As highlighted within our report, Developing Inside: Transforming Prison for Young Adults, emotionally and psychologically they are more like adolescents than adults.  The 18&ndash;24 age group is a period of what is called extended adolescence.  They are more likely to be impulsive and less able to control aggression and risk-taking than adults.  Their impulsiveness and reduced ability to control aggression makes them seem unco-operative and therefore more liable to punishment within the prison system.  The prison system treats them as if they were fully mature adults when in fact we should be treating them as a distinct group and more like children.</p><p> Contained within our report are ten recommendations to transform prison for young adults.  I will touch upon a few of these.  We recommend that young adults in prison be recognised as a distinct group by making them the responsibility of the Irish youth justice system.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs should become a champion for young adults in prison.  Currently, young adults are recognised within the Department of Children and Youth Affairs strategy, Better Outcomes Brighter Futures, as being a distinct group separate from the adult population.  However, there is a demarcation when it comes to young adults in detention who are ignored in this document.  This needs to change.</p><p> We also recommend ending the use of extended lock-up, also referred to as the restricted regime, which in many cases is a form of solitary confinement or solitary confinement itself.  We recommend the abolition of the basic regime standard for all young adults and that all young adults should be placed on the enhanced accommodation standard on entry to prison.</p><p> It would appear that there is no mitigation for the characteristic behaviours of young adults, some of which I have described, and they are over-represented in solitary confinement and on restricted regime, which we detail in our report.  We welcome Deputy Clare Daly's draft legislation on solitary confinement and would recommend that legislation prohibit the use of solitary confinement for young adults.</p><p> The infographic in our report highlights the fact that young adults are more likely to be on basic level than the general adult population.  Basic level means less access to family visits and telephone calls, single cells and less out of cell time, all contrary to how we should respond to the needs of young adults.  We also highlight the need to reduce significantly the number of young adults imprisoned and provide separate, young adult detention facilities with specially trained staff.</p><p> Politically, if we wished to be a European leader in having a low young adult prison population, this would require a 50% reduction in prison places for this group.  Much of this could be achieved through, perhaps, an expansion of the Garda youth diversion programme, which today deals with older children, 16 and 17 year olds, than those it dealt with when it was originally formed.  It would also, in effect, end the use of prison for young women, which we detail within our report.</p><p> Dedicated facilities, similar to those found in other jurisdictions, including Northern Ireland - and I have visited Hydebank Wood College - should now be provided.  Historically, we provided specific facilities for young adults with mixed results.  St. Patrick's Institution was condemned as far back as the Whitaker committee but Shanganagh Castle and Fort Mitchel were both seen as having a positive impact on the lives of young adults.  Any future facility should be campus style with varying levels of security and should be as open as possible to provide maximum freedom.  It must be emphasised that young adults are sent to prison as punishment and not for punishment.  The daily routine should provide meaningful access to education, work and training beyond equivalence to that available in the community.  The last point is an important one.  Third level institutions and further education colleges should be paired with each young adult detention centre.  Young adults should spend a minimum of 14 hours unlocked from their rooms.  Accommodation should be provided in houses with single room occupancy, communal dining and access to food preparation areas.</p></speech>

That comes down to the courts and sentencing.  There is a unique situation in Ireland where the prison authorities have huge powers in terms of back door options.  That was detailed in the last committee report.  There is the opportunity, after someone has spent a short time in custodial detention because the courts have deemed that appropriate, to consider serving a sentence in the community.  It needs to be examined.  Unlike the UK, we do not have the sophisticated data to examine why there are increases.  There are increasing numbers and we do not yet know why.  We can see a reduction in the number of men being imprisoned.</p></speech>

Most would argue that society progresses and we have a greater understanding of what is and is not acceptable.  The Whitaker report and several other reports, including Oireachtas reports, and the Irish Prison Service agree with the principle of normalisation.  To me that means a person gets up in the morning, gets dressed, has breakfast, prepares for the day and go to work, training or education.  Most of us work a seven hour day.  Therefore a prison should model society.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.517" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Carroll" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017032200002#C01000"><p>Hydebank Wood College in Northern Ireland has completely transformed itself.  Three or four years ago it was considered a very dangerous institution and there was talk of closing it.  While it is not perfect now, it has linked with Belfast Metropolitan, a further education college, and it is trying to bridge that education from the prison environment to the community.  That has always been a difficult issue.  The prison service is proud to say that it has several students studying for the junior and leaving certificates and further education but there is a transition point.  It would be a real plus if we could link with our colleges of further education.</p> <p>  Some criticisms of a dedicated facility for young adults are that it would not work and that young adults behave better when they are with older adults.  I posed these questions to the former director general of the prison service in Northern Ireland and she dismissed their legitimacy as reasons for detaining the young adult population with the older adult population.  I recommend that the committee visit Hydebank Wood College in the North, and possibly a dedicated facility for young adults in Germany, to which we also refer.</p><p> The Deputy referred to women.  An examination of current policy towards women is needed.  I make specific reference to a proposed step-down facility for women, on which the Irish Prison Service went to tender in October.  We already have two quasi facilities on the former St. Laurence site, one relatively large institution run by an NGO and another smaller institution run by another NGO.  The question is whether they could be better used.  Ultimately, we want to keep down the number of people we put in any form of institutional setting.  If one looks at what Focus Ireland and the Fr. Peter McVerry Trust are looking at, one can see that it is something like the Housing First model.  I think the outcomes the Irish Prison Service want from a step-down unit can be better achieved through a Housing First model.  Under this model, the person is placed in their own home and provided with individualised supports based on their needs.  </p></speech>

The reports have been very useful.  The report last year on young people was excellent.  I have tried to follow up on some of the recommendations in that report through parliamentary questions.  What Mr. Carroll probably highlighted today is the glaring contradiction between what is being said in many of the reports that are being produced, even by Oireachtas committees, and the reality on the ground.  The language is changing, the dialogue is more informed and we talk more about reform but even though there has been enlightened thinking at the top, there is a contradiction on the ground in the prisons.  Is that related to the idea of training and meaningful activity and the point about beyond equivalence?  The centre's most recent report made the point strongly that because of the disadvantage experienced by young people in particular, the types of facilities in prison do not need to be the same level as those in the community, they need to be beyond that to compensate and bring people up to speed.  Perhaps we are looking at things the wrong way around.  Security is always the starting point of prison management.  It is all done against the backdrop of lower numbers, which has probably been an issue, and training and meaningful activity element is second.  If we are to get to grips with this, we need to start with meaningful activity first and stand that on its head.  That is one area I would like more detail on.</p> <p>  The question of women in prison is interesting.  I think one other contributor pointed out that the number of women in prison, albeit proportionately smaller, is increasing more rapidly.  Various reports such as the Corston report show the dislocating impact of putting women in prison.  They show that if a woman is imprisoned, her children face the danger of homelessness.  In terms of alternative models and houses in the community, is there anything in that and is there anything we could do to push them as an alternative?  </p> <p>  My other point relates to the radical suggestion that we pick a number and cap it at that.  I like that idea because unless there is something there, the Judiciary will keep sentencing people beyond the capacity that is there.  Was this type of approach used in other jurisdictions that, in essence, almost halved the prison population such as the Scandinavian countries?  Is there a precedent somewhere?  </p> <p>  We would have liked the Bill I brought forward to be more radical but the committee wanted to extend it to the 19 hours.  The Minister has even objected to that and has said that the committee is going beyond its remit.  Again, is there any international experience on that?  </p> <p>  I do not know whether the centre has the wherewithal to address mental health and the crisis involving acutely psychotic prisoners but these issues are reaching a critical point not just for inmates but for staff.  The Central Mental Hospital says some people are too high-risk so it will not take them.  However, these people are not getting treatment in prison.  There is a waiting list of over acutely psychotic 20 people who are queuing for weeks and months and who need to be managed by the prison service.  I do not know if the centre has looked at any precedents or models in other areas that might address that.</p></speech>

The Deputy should point out if I have missed something.  I could not agree more with the points the Deputy made regarding mental health.  We were involved with the group in 2007 and tried to essentially reform the accommodation in the Central Mental Hospital.  We were standing behind a group of family members who did not want the Central Mental Hospital to be co-located on a prison site.  Other than that, it is not something we have looked into.<br/><br/>In respect of prison numbers, it is a leap to say that we will just have a cap.  A way to get around it that sounds a bit more sane is for each institution to have a fixed number that would indicate when it was full.  In fairness, the now deceased Inspector of Prisons, Judge Michael Reilly, tried to introduce institutional numbers.  Giving institutions numbers is certainly the starting point.  The Inspector of Prisons has figures for each of the prisons, as does the Irish Prison Service.  The Irish Prison Service is working towards the Inspector of Prisons' capped numbers.  Worryingly, an article in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>this week referred to somebody having to sleep on a mattress.  If there was a rule that the prison had to shut its doors when it was full, alternatives would have to be provided but such an arrangement does not currently exist.  <br/><br/>In respect of the provision of community facilities for women either as an alternative to prison or post release, our reports makes reference to two projects in the US.  We forget that while nearly two million people are in prison in the US on any given day, I think it is about 700 per 100,000 of the population, one sees glimpses of innovation in terms of justice initiatives.  There are projects out there.  <br/><br/>I might have missed the Deputy's initial point about out of cell time.  In respect of the regime that operates in the young adult facility in Germany, inmates spend approximately 14 hours out of cell.  All of us here try to spend eight hours in bed but the figure might be seven.  We may think we would like to spend 12 hours in our bedroom the odd time.  Currently, people in prison spend 16 or 17 hours in their cells.  Solitary confinement is a serious issue.  There are interpretation issues around solitary confinement but it has been clearly stated that it does not matter if somebody is placed in solitary confinement if it is a request or punishment.  It is still considered solitary confinement and is inappropriate if it is used consecutively for longer than 15 days.  They are minimum standards so we should not be working towards them.  We should be working towards nobody being in solitary confinement.  We would argue that the characteristics of young adult mean that solitary confinement should not be allowed.  The UN minimum standards for juveniles say that solitary confinement should not be used for juveniles.  Of course, it allows the State to determine what a juvenile is and in Ireland, a juvenile is someone aged up to 18.</p></speech>

They did not have the learning support staff, learning assistants or special needs assistants that now exist.</p><p>Our understanding now is that children require this.  What we are saying is that young people, or all people, in detention have previously been failed by the education system.  Therefore, based on their educational needs, they have a right to education and it is legitimate to say there should be educational provision beyond equivalence.  If one is a pragmatist, this makes sense.  If we can attempt to address within the prison system the educational, work and training needs of those with literacy and numeracy issues and provide them with an opportunity when they leave prison, does it not make sense to do so?</p></speech>

Like others, I recognise the work his organisation does.  I have two or three questions to ask him.</p> <p>  One point we have heard made on penal reform by many delegates concerns the failure of politics, politicians and political parties at many levels.  Over time we have all collectively embraced populism on penal reform, which involves a false dichotomy.  In the 1980s, I believe, there were reduced crime rates but prisoner numbers doubled.  Penal policy in Ireland has been created and formulated by accident rather than by design.  In many ways that is still the case, with changing budgets.  We have seen a failure among all politicians and parties in truly embracing the common ground on penal reform.  The problem is that there have been a number of reports from justice committees that have not been prioritised by the Department of Justice and Equality in the context of its budget and agenda.  That leads to my first question.  Bearing in mind Mr. Carroll's input into the policy process, what significant initiative on penal reform in the past ten years has been a follow-through on reports that have been produced?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.526" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eoin Carroll" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017032200002#E00300"><p>We did not end up with Thornton Hall.  That was the result of the Thornton Hall review group.  To be honest, I do not believe we needed a review group to tell us we did not need it.  Probably the most pragmatic reason for not developing it was that we could not afford it.  Furthermore, it would have led to an increase in the prisoner population of approximately 1,200.  The decision was positive.  Perhaps I was overly harsh on the report that the committee produced in 2013 because, in effect, many of the recommendations have come through.  We now have the community return programme and the community support programme.  The community return programme allows somebody to serve the remainder of his or her sentence within the community once he or she has served 50% of it within prison.  That was recommended in the report.</p> <p>  There were other aspects of note in the report, including the making of a commitment to reduce the prison population.  The director general of the Irish Prison Service has stated this is his objective.  At this point, because numbers have levelled of and with an increase last year, I am curious to see how we will continue to reduce prisoner numbers.  The 2013 report mentioned increasing remission by up to one third.  It is already achievable and no legislation needs to be brought forward.  Perhaps a little policy might be required just to clarify what somebody in prison needs to do to achieve it.</p> <p>  The report made recommendations on stopping the use of imprisonment for sentences of less than six months.  Certainly, the number in prison on any given day serving a sentence of less than six months has gone down.  With the young adult population, however, an analysis of those serving sentences of less than two years shows a ratio of 2:1.  I am nervous about mentioning statistics that I do not have in front of me, but they are included in the report.  Certainly, a higher proportion of young adults are serving sentences of two years by comparison with older adults.  It begs the question as to whether young adults are receiving sentences for offences for which an older adult might not receive the same sentence.</p></speech>

It is a therapeutic community prison.  I went there with representatives of the Prison Officers Association.  We were meant to have somebody in attendance from the Irish Prison Service, but as there was an industrial dispute taking place between it and the Prison Officers Association, unfortunately a representative did not travel.  Grendon Prison is certainly a good model.  I do not know whether any member has had the opportunity to visit Coolmine.</p></speech>

It has a very specific approach that would appeal to a certain type of prisoner.  It may appeal to a prisoner who has tried something before that has not worked.  The Grendon Prison and Coolmine models could not be rolled out across the entire prison estate.  The Irish Prison Service had indicated that it was seeking to establish a therapeutic community within the prison system.  It made reference to Coolmine as part of that process, but that proposal has disappeared.  We have not heard about it.</p></speech>

Within the context of the prison system, it was innovative.  It wanted small units in which prisoners could self-manage.  There were units divided in eight or ten.  Older prisoners are a real issue.  I do not want to say what is being done is wrong because what the Irish Prison Service is doing for older prisoners is positive.  Having said that, there may now be an even bigger gap.  I am not too sure whether we should be regarding some prisons as work and training prisons.  If so, what are all the other prisons?</p> <p>  When I look back at reports, including the report of 2000 which included recommendations about new prisons, I note that we must undertake what was described as a security audit.  This means that we need to determine, based on the current prisoner population, the level of security needed for that group.  Leaving aside where they are now, what security levels do we need?  Mr. Kevin Warner and others have constantly been saying we need open prisons.  Bizarrely, because the numbers have dropped in the prison system, it now looks as if we have more prisoners in open prisons.  Proportionately, we do.  The figure is approximately 5% to 7%.  In Scandinavian countries is about 30%.</p> <p>  Any future infrastructural development within the prison service should involve the use of more innovative, community-based, semi-open facilities.</p><p>Cork Prison was a missed opportunity because it defaulted back to an old model of prison architecture.</p></speech>

These seems to be a broad consensus that prison does not work and that we do not do things as well as we should or make the changes that we should.  Has that more to do with ideology or with cost?  Many of the initiatives that I would like to see in prisons would probably cost a few bob more to do them properly, particularly measures that would help prisoners to develop properly and to create the facilities that are required to support them when they leave prison rather than just abandoning them.  Does Mr. Carroll think the cost factor is stronger than the ideology, which has not gone away and which may be summarised in the words, "They misbehaved so to hell with them"?  The punishment element has also not totally disappeared.</p> <p>  He mentioned that the fact that both Cork Prison and the Midlands Prison mimicked prison designs from the 19th century.  Was there much dialogue and consultation about how those prisons should be designed?  Was much input sought from progressive groups that might have had something more interesting offer?  It is scary that they mimic 19th century designs given significant money was spent building them and they were not done right.  What approach was taken?  Who made the decisions that left us with new prisons that were outdated before they were finished?</p> <p>  Mr. Carroll made a good, interesting point about fixed numbers.  I recall when Deputy Daly and I were arrested in respect of the Shannon incident, we were taken to Limerick Prison but the prison officials would not take us because they said the prison was full.  I am not sure whether it was because it was genuinely full or whether they did not want us but we did not get in anyway.  My understanding is there are two prisoners to a cell in Cork Prison which is crazy given it is the most recent prison to be built.  Would Mr. Carroll recommend that cell numbers be reduced to one?  Does he have a particular number in mind in the context of the fixed number he mentioned?</p> <p>  There is no doubt that some people are sent to prison for ridiculous reasons.  Should all the judges be sent back to school and given a little education in these matters?  If they are still sending people, especially women, to prison for theft in supermarkets, we have a problem.  Does Mr. Carroll think we should have a chat with the judges?</p></speech>

I would like to think that in the future we should be able to respond in a more therapeutic way.  However, prison is a damaging experience for people and the numbers being sent to prison need to be limited.  Ideologically, whether one is on the left or the right, having smaller prisons works.  If we can keep reducing prisoner numbers, it will cost less.  If more open prisons can be provided, it will cost considerably less.  The State and institutions have had serious failures in the past trying to assess whether somebody is bad or not.  I am a believer in the principle of just desserts which is enshrined in our legislation.  It is primarily used as a mitigating concept whereby somebody receives a punishment that is just sufficient or just deserving.  It is a principle of proportionality.</p> <p>  With regard to picking a number, if I work off the report the committee's predecessor produced in 2013, it would be approximately 2,900.  If I use the report of former Deputy, Jim Higgins, it would be between 2,500 and 2,700.  When we want to move from the extreme right or the extreme left to the middle - it happens with everything - my statement seems more dramatic now than when if it was said in 2000 but I am recommending nothing different from what was being recommended then.  It seems like I am suggesting something dramatic.  This is the safest way to pick a number.  For example, the management of offenders policy document in 1995 sought to increase prison cell numbers to eliminate overcrowding but it, ultimately, led to an increase in the prison population.  That is why a fixed institution number would overcome that.</p> <p>  With regard to prison architecture, our organisation put in a request to see a plan for Cork Prison and we were refused.  I know someone who put in a request for the plan to assess the size of facilities for work and training and education.  That person had to go through freedom of information legislation to obtain the data.  My understanding is that Cork Prison has a smaller educational facility than the previous prison.</p> <p>  We have advocated for the principle of one person, one cell.  I spoke to the POA representatives before attending the meeting and they say it is now part of their campaign.  The director general and the Prison Service have, in fairness, said that is their aspiration.  They have also said that just because Cork Prison has two-person cells that does not mean they will be used as such.  However, the present circumstances have answered that question.</p> <p>  I would be nervous about making comments about the Judiciary.  My background is in social science and I am not a legal person.  However, we need to find out why judges are sending people to prison for longer and why more people are being sent to prison.  As Deputy Chambers said, there is no correlation between crime rates and prison numbers.  As soon as we can get our heads around that, we can start to reduce prison numbers and tinker with sentencing practices.  The IPRT hopes for the inclusion of text in legislation along the lines of the phase,"Prison as a measure of last resort".  Judges have to justify custodial sentences now but the more that text can become part of the train of thought of our Judiciary, the better.</p> <p>  On costs, all the recommendations should reduce the amount being spent on prison.</p><p>For example, if we were to decide to send 800 fewer people to prison, we could seek to shrink prisons and bring them down to a size below the 300 mark, which would be seen as an international maximum or minimum figure.  The Whitaker report was also seeking to create smaller communities of no more than 100 prisoners.</p><p> Ireland has been innovative with prisons, an approach largely driven by the Office of Public Works in the building of Wheatfield Prison and, more recently, the D&oacute;chas Centre.  There has been innovation, but there has also been a default back to earlier prison models in the form of Cork Prison and also the extension at Wheatfield Prison.</p></speech>

It works in many areas.  As Mr. Carroll was speaking, I tried to get an understanding of his experience with adolescents.  If one has an adolescent who is starting to play up and get into trouble, in his experience, what would be the proper intervention services to provide or means of preventing that young person from going down that route?  One can almost see it happen sometimes, particularly if there are mental health issues such as depression, anxiety or addiction and there are so many reasons for it.  He or she might come from a dysfunctional background.  If there was a proper intervention service, does Mr. Carroll think that would prevent him or her from entering that cycle of being in and out of St. Patrick's Institution or prison?</p> <p>  Why does Mr. Carroll think the Training Unit in Mountjoy Prison did not work?  What stopped it?  Was it the culture of the Irish Prison Service?  I imagine it has a very strong culture and that it might be the old model Mr. Carroll outlined.  Is it hard to change that old model?  How could we change it?  Does he think it would be a good idea to get involved with the prison officers training unit, for example, and talk to prison officers about a newer, more therapeutic and compassionate model?  Often people who are in and out of prison feel bad about themselves subconsciously; therefore, if somebody is constantly reminding them that they are bad, undoubtedly they will continue to be in and out of prison.  It is just familiar to them.</p> <p>  Mr. Carroll mentioned Hydebank Wood Prison in the North and a prison in England.  What was its name?</p></speech>

In our report we also refer to a facility for young adults in Germany.  Grendon Prison is generally for an older population of prisoners who have been sentenced for serious crimes, including murder, rape and child molestation.</p></speech>

Would it be a good idea to take one of these models for use in this country?  Mr. Carroll has spoken a little about this.  If we were to choose one of these models, which one would be the best in his experience?</p> <p>  The main element for me is always addiction and the role it plays.  In percentage terms, how many young people, particularly adolescents, go down that destructive route to addiction?  Is it a high percentage or is it related more to mental health issues?  What are his ideas in that regard?</p></speech>

Most people stop committing misdemeanours by the time they reach their late 20s.  As a society, we wish to try to disrupt negative, inappropriate or bad behaviour, but, ultimately, we know that the majority of us will come out the other end and will live good and law-abiding lives into old age.  I sometimes wonder whether it would have a better impact if we could keep children away from criminal justice agencies.  It probably would.  That is a conversation for another day, but I worry about the continual expansion of Garda diversion projects and question why a criminal justice agency is providing for what we would describe as a social or community need, given the risk of labelling the children involved.</p> <p>  On the cycle, we all know that schools are the first touch point for children in need.  It is about trying to see how we can best use schools.  As it is not an area of policy I examined, I should make that qualification.  However, I speak to teachers.  My wife is a teacher, as are her friends.  Sometimes they do not know what to do if they have a concern about a child.  It is not a concern about the level of child protection provided because schools have very much got their heads around the need for child protection.  Tusla is also in place.  To be honest, I do not know much about that area of policy, but I believe a school is the key engagement point for children in distress.  I previously worked with Focus Ireland in homeless services for children.  They were 15, 16 and 17 year olds who had all dropped out of school.  Had the school system not failed them, the likelihood of their getting involved in anti-social behaviour could have been broken.  Ultimately, however, we must always recognise that the majority of people in the age crime curve will get out of it.  There have been studies in Scotland which suggest all children - I would say all of the population - commit approximately the same number of offences.  The Scottish investigation showed that in many cases children from poorer communities essentially were receiving harsher punishment than children from middle class and wealthier communities, for want of a better term.  There is a real issue in that regard.  A longitudinal study in Scotland is identifying some of these points.  Our behavioural tolerance is lower in poorer communities than it is in more wealthy communities, even though many people might think it has flipped the other way around.</p> <p>  As to why the Training Unit did not work, it was just a gradual slip.  I do not know.  It would be interesting to question the representatives of the Prison Officers Association who will appear next before the committee on that issue.</p> <p>  With regard to prison officers, the Prison Officers Association has changed dramatically.  I have been involved in the area of penal reform for ten years and prison officers have moved.  The study trip to Grendon Prison with them showed that to be the case.  Prison officers are now receiving more education in Bellad House, the training college for prison officers.</p><p>It would have been better to provide prison officer training in a third level institution rather than Beladd House.  The current approach reminds me of priests being sent to a training college for priests.  Why should a priest not receive general arts education in a regular college, for want of a better description?  I wonder why there needs to be a separate institution because prison officer trainees would benefit from interacting with students studying general arts courses such as English, philosophy, psychology, sociology.</p><p> Members should quiz the Prison Officers Association about the training unit.  The association will be open to the idea of a therapeutic community because it has members who want to work in a different environment.  There are many differences among prison officers, with some who do not want change and others who want to work in different environments.  For example, work-in-training officers historically have been people with a background in a trade who wanted to work in this area rather than what we might stereotypically think of as turnkeys.</p><p> On the facilities in Germany and the Grendon and Hydebank facilities, Germany is where it is at for young adults.  My German is not great but there is a description in our report.  What I would like to see, which is what one sees in Grendon, is therapeutic practices being introduced in the prison system.  Whereas we do not need to create a prison system consisting exclusively of Grendon type institutions, we need therapeutic and restorative practices.  Some interesting work is being done in a school in Tallaght, in which the Senator may be interested, on creating schools that are based around restorative practices.  The programme in Tallaght is involved in this.  This approach would be a major game changer in the prison system in terms using more restorative practices to deal with conflict.</p><p> The issue of prison population has been dealt with relatively well by the Prison Service, although it must continue to work towards achieving a target population of 2,750.  Segregation remains a significant issue and one which the Prison Officers Association may also raise.  Segregation must be challenged.  Fr. Peter McVerry will give an interesting description of the colour coding system used in Mountjoy Prison to indicate who can associate with whom.  Perhaps we should address this culture of machismo, gangs and non-association with others.  Prison provides a space for doing this because segregation is an issue.</p></speech>

Does he believe there are forces in society, for instance, media-led commentary on crime with a small or big C, that influence sentencing?  Are these factors influencing judges' disposition towards particular circumstances?</p> <p>  While I cannot remember the name of the programme that preceded the youth diversion programme, one thing it did not have was an association with the Garda.  Parents whose children participated in the scheme have expressed the view that the subtext of the programme is a suggestion that their child's involvement in it was an indication that he or she would fall foul of the law without the provision of this support.  This amounts to unnecessary labelling.  While Garda input is important, it should be part of a natural scenario.  The notion behind youth diversion is if the child is not part of the programme, he or she is likely to end up in juvenile court or whatever the case may be.  This view is a fair reflection of parental concern about the designation of the scheme.  Does Mr. Carroll have a view on that issue and the issue I raised regarding sentencing?</p></speech>

While I must introduce the caveat that I have not drilled down into this policy area, from conversations with academics in community studies, the programme does not make sense to them.  I do not know if members are familiar with Activelink, which is a go-to website for people seeking employment in the community and voluntary sector.  Garda diversion and community projects are still expanding.  I wonder whether this could be done with greater partnership with community bodies or youth clubs.  It does not need to be targeted at children who are getting involved in misdemeanours.  We all know children benefit from youth clubs.  Perhaps an analysis of this would benefit.</p> <p>  On the Judiciary and sentencing, we are all influenced by the media.  News is constant and live, and judges cannot but be affected by this.  However, it is a case of providing legislative options for judges and realising that, for many people, a community alternative is just as tough as a prison sentence.  If anything, when a judge states he has sent a person to prison three, four or five times, it should become clear that prison has not worked for the offender and another option should be available, which means providing a menu of options for judges.</p> <p>  I once heard a TED Talk by a South African woman who discussed what is known as ridicule risk, which is our absurd fear of risk.  She spoke of the importance of the concept in public services and at a broader level.  Her idea was that provided our motivation is correct and we have all our ducks in a row, we should be allowed to take a risk.  The community return or support programme was allowing for ridicule risk at one level.  If something does not work, we should protect politicians and policymakers as long as their motivations were correct and they behaved properly.  We should take more innovative risks in terms of how we respond to these issues.</p></speech>

It is unnecessary to have this association.  The scheme had a different designation previously and should have a different one again.  There is no reason to believe children from any particular area will necessarily take up a wrong path in life.  This is an offensive view which works against the interest of the practical and positive features the scheme has to offer.  I also agree with Mr. Carroll that the media have an inordinate influence on sentencing.  I will leave it at that.</p><p> I thank all the members and Mr. Carroll and Dr. Warner in the Gallery.  I invite them to join us for a family photograph as part of our montage for the production of our report.  I am glad Mr. Carroll made the point about the 2013 committee report because attention has been paid to its recommendations.  I assure him that the committee, given the record of reports we have produced, has continued to press the respective areas of address.  The recommendations we make are not just hanging out there in the ether or sitting on a shelf, as it were.  We want action to follow and we will address this report in exactly the same way and with the same intent.</p></speech>

The joint committee has identified this as one of its priority issues in its 2017 work programme.  I welcome Mr. John Clinton, general secretary, and Mr. Jim Mitchell, deputy general secretary.  On behalf of the committee, I thank them both for their attendance to discuss this important issue.  The format of the meeting is that they will be invited to make a brief opening statement which will be followed by a question and answer session.</p> <p>  Before I invite Mr. Clinton to make his opening statement, I must caution the witnesses in respect of privilege.  I draw attention to the fact that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Under the salient rulings of the Chair, members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

We last made a presentation to a justice committee on 16 November 2011.</p><p>The Prison Officers Association, POA, was established in 1947 and we now represent up to 3,200 Prison Service grades based at prisons all around the country.  Our written submission includes items on reducing the number of people who get custodial sentences, conditions of people in prisons, solitary confinement, post-release programmes, mental health, drugs, gangs and violence.  We will deal briefly with each issue this morning and then will be pleased to take questions from members of the committee.<br/><br/>We want a prison system which rehabilitates the prisoner, as we have stated in the past.  It should assist him or her in dealing with the past and engaging in responsible citizenship in the future in an environment that is safe for both prison officers and prisoners alike.  This rehabilitation happens for many prisoners but regretfully not for all and the onset of gang culture in the prison system is certainly not helpful in this regard.  There are many reasons sufficient progress on rehabilitation is not being made, such as lack of motivation by the authorities and a major lack of interest by wider society.  We are key stakeholders in this entire system and want to see a progressive prison system built today that we can all be proud of in the future, as well as a Prison Service that has addressed many of the challenges and difficulties that we currently face.  Many of the following areas must be addressed to achieve a service of which we can all be proud.<br/><br/>First, the number of people who get custodial sentences must be reduced.  While the reduction of people being committed to prison is largely beyond the remit of the Prison Officers Association, our members at the coalface must deal with the consequences of system failures such as prison overcrowding when it hits the system.  We have had to deal with this difficulty numerous times in the past.  A snapshot of the prison population will show that on 3 March 2017, a total of 3,815 prisoners were in custody with 253 on temporary release and 543 on trial or remand.  That is a total of 4,204 prisoners in the system, which includes 87 prisoners on life sentences residing in the community and 28 prisoners residing in the Central Mental Hospital.  The construction of additional cell spaces in the Midlands and Wheatfield prisons, as well as refurbishments in Mountjoy and Limerick prisons, the new prison in Cork and the re-designation of St. Patrick's Institution have helped to alleviate the difficulty of overcrowding.  It should however be noted that the imminent closure of the training unit on a temporary basis has reduced the prison estate capacity by 96 spaces.  This is a matter of concern to us.  It is also noteworthy that there is a further disparity between what the late Inspector of Prisons viewed as bed capacity, and what the Prison Service figures show as bed capacity, to a quantum of 97.  These numbers, if applied, represent a return to over 100% occupancy in the prison system and a consequent return to the competition for resources that blighted the early part of this century in the penal system.<br/><br/>Another area to address is conditions of people in prisons.  The incentivised regime protocol, IRP, was introduced to the IPS following proposals put forward by the POA at the national pay talks for the public service agreement 2010 to 2014, the Croke Park agreement.  We outlined to management the benefits of the introduction of an incentivised regime programme to the Irish Prison Service.  The POA sought an incentivised regime, which would form part of the agreement.  As for the main benefits of the incentivised regime protocol, it links prisoner behavioural patterns to incentives.  Prisoners who engage in work, training and meaningful activities will be rewarded.  In addition, it includes meaningful sentence management plans, has the potential to reduce the number of prisoners on protection, prioritises prisoners who wish to engage positively and provides a safety net for prisoners who refuse to engage.  It also provides a consistent approach to prisoner rehabilitation across the estate, demonstrates the advantages to positive engagement within the prison communities and links the behaviour in prison of individuals to accepted norms in society.  It brought in an introduction of personal officers to explain the IRP to prisoners, to encourage individuals' involvement, to lend support and to aid their personal development.<br/><br/>It is the case in every other area of our society, whether it be the work place in the private sector or the work place in the public sector, that performance relates to reward whether this is by way of financial remuneration or promotion.  If we are going to manage custodial sentences in a way which encourages and supports prisoners in their endeavours to live law-abiding and purposeful lives as valued members of society, then we must bring some form of normality to that process and match performance and behaviour to reward.  We believe there is an opportunity to transform areas of the prison estate into units of therapy and education, UTEs, which has been successful in other jurisdictions, in particular the Villabona project in Spain.  This model transforms prisons into educational spaces, using an alternative model that immerses prisoners in an educational environment that teaches skills and, more importantly, values such as empathy and kindness.  This reduces violent behaviour and lowers the rates of re-offending.  The units of therapy and education have created micro-societies that enable inmates to learn to live as they would outside the prison walls.<br/><br/>We have met Mr. Faustino Zapico Garc&iacute;a from Spain, who developed the Villabona project, on a number of occasions in conjunction with Ashoka Ireland, as part of the exploratory work as to whether the stakeholders in the Irish Prison Service would consider the setting up of UTEs in the Irish Prison System.  We viewed this as a worthwhile project and arranged for Mr. Garc&iacute;a to address the justice trade council of the European Confederation of Independent Trade Unions, CESI, in Brussels. which is a European affiliate trade union body in which we are involved.<br/><br/>We arranged a visit to Grendon Prison in September 2014 through our colleagues in the Prison Officers Association in the UK.  We were accompanied by Mr. Rory O&rsquo;Carroll from Ashoka and by Mr. Eoin Carroll, social policy and communications co-ordinator of the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, Dublin.  The Grendon regime is unique as the therapeutic programme is the core work of the establishment.  The POA sees merit in exploring further the concept of therapeutic programs and we will continue to explore the possibility of having these programs introduced into the prison system.<br/><br/>There is still a huge over-reliance in the prison system on closed prisons, despite the recommendations from the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality's Report on Penal Reform in March 2013.  This report was clear in its recommendation that the proportion of open prisons should be increased.  On Thursday, 16 March 2017, there were 3,793 people in custody and only 235 of those were in open centres.<br/><br/>Solitary confinement is another area to address.  <i>A Sourcebook on Solitary Confinement</i>, published in 2008 by Dr. Sharon Shalev, identifies a number of common themes on solitary confinement.  It finds that solitary confinement is an extreme and potentially harmful measure and should only be used in the most exceptional of cases.  Periods in solitary confinement should be for the shortest period possible and prisoners should be held for that time in decent conditions and offered meaningful human contact and access to purposeful lives.  The recommendations made include procedural safeguards, directions as to the placement of an individual in solitary confinement, the physical conditions and regime of solitary confinement and the health of the individual.  The POA supports the conclusions in Dr. Shalev&rsquo;s sourcebook.  Solitary confinement is not used in the prison system and we have been consulted on and issued with and the Irish Prison Service policy on minimum out of cell time that incorporates rules 44 and 45 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, that is, the Mandela rules.  Our support for the conclusions of Dr. Shalev is practical and based on the creation of a safer environment for all.<br/><br/>Post-release programmes are another area to address.  The only real tool to prevent recidivism is the availability of positive activity for an individual following discharge, assisting him or her in the avoidance of further criminality.  A person who goes to meaningful work every day while also providing for dependants is less likely to revert to previous criminal activity.  The provision of such support is not the responsibility of any single group or organisation but prison officers hold the view that we must find some form of a multidisciplinary approach, which supports the individual willing to make an effort.  The act of going to work every day and returning at the end of it to a normal setting is one that many of us take for granted.  However, most of those in custody will not have come from that background and the normalisation of the act of going to work for many individuals is a learned function.  We therefore believe that the decision of the Minister to close the training unit, albeit temporarily, represents a retrograde step in the penal system, as it was a semi-open, drug-free prison.  Prisoners were going to work in the community on a daily basis and returning at the end of their working day to an establishment separate to the main prison complex in Mountjoy.<br/><br/>Mental health is another area to address.  A study of male remand prisoners in 2005 showed that 7.6% of them exhibited indications of psychiatric illness.  Many prisoners commit crimes while suffering from a psychiatric illness and end up incarcerated in the prison system where there are insufficient resources to address their illnesses.  This, in turn, can make them volatile and unpredictable while in prison and exacerbate their symptoms.  Prisoners with mental health issues are more likely to assault staff, particularly if their psychiatric illness is combined with a drug problem.  These prisoners require additional supervision resources compared with prisoners who do not present with psychiatric illness.  The Prison Officers Association believes that diverting people to appropriate care facilities in the community earlier in the judicial process is more likely to yield positive dividends than having these people go through the trauma of incarceration and then being transferred to the appropriate facility.  We are undoubtedly approaching the treatment and rehabilitation of such prisoners in reverse order and this needs to be reviewed.<br/><br/>Drugs and gangs are another area to address.  The misuse of drugs in prisons continues to be a common theme running through many of the challenges we face.</p><p>Compliant prisoners are often put under pressure to get their families to bring drugs into prisons.  This can be done to pay off a drug debt or simply because of their compliant profile as they are not suspected by prison staff of being involved in trafficking.  The punishment for refusal can be severe, and thereafter the prisoner who refuses will probably end up on voluntary protection.  Very often, those at the top of the drug trade in prisons are involved in drug trafficking as a display of their power within the facility.  The much-publicised gang war that has claimed lives also has its protagonists within the prison system.  At the other end of the spectrum, there is always a market in prison for drugs, and many prisoners commence their drug-taking, leading to their consequent addiction, while in prison.  While achieving an entirely drug-free estate is very difficult, the establishment of drug-free areas within estates is practical and has the support of all the stakeholders.</p><p> Regrettably, the issue of violence in prisons continues, with a number of very serious incidents involving assaults on prison staff.  In a recent analysis conducted by the State Claims Agency, the projected number of assaults by prisoners on prison staff for 2017 was estimated at 107.  This is based on a number of direct physical assaults between 2011 and 2015 of 475.  The nature of these assaults included concussion, lacerations, cuts, fractures burns and bites.  Most of these injuries were to the head and face, thereby leaving permanent reminders to the injured officers of the incidents.  The starkest statistic is that 77.9% of staff who responded had been physically assaulted by prisoners in the course of their operational duties.  The level of prisoner-on-prisoner assaults is much higher and represents only those assaults that are reported or observed by prison staff.  The records for 2013 show 604 prisoner-on-prisoner assaults.  To have an optimal work environment, the challenges these assaults manifest need to be addressed in a consistent manner.  The absence of adequate protection measures that are successfully used in other jurisdictions, such as batons, incapacitating spray and body cameras, is another factor that undermines staff confidence.</p><p> Regarding staffing issues, 2017 is the first time since 2010 that recruit prison officers are entering the Irish Prison Service, and this is to be welcomed.  The Prison Service currently has a shortfall of 230 staff, with a number of staff having completed their minimum service requirements to be eligible to retire.  This has left significant shortfalls within the prison staffing complement and will obviously have an impact on service delivery.  We believe that any penal reform measures should be designed with prison staff at the centre of the delivery as part of a multidisciplinary group.  The Prison Officers' Association and the Irish Prison Service agreed an annualised hours system in 2005 that is predicated on the principle of the availability of constant recruitment panels to replace retiring prison officers.  The moratorium introduced during the crash has created a significant gap in the availability of recruit prison officers, which in turn has caused stagnation in the transfer of many staff to places closer to home.  This in turn has caused many stresses outside of the workplace additional to the many stresses attendant on being a prison officer.  The new recruit prison officers will receive, as part of their induction, many of the tools they will require to function better in the prison environment.  The skills taught will include conflict coaching, resilience training and mindfulness as well as the ability to recognise signs of post-traumatic stress disorder.  It is further planned to roll out these initiatives to all serving staff, who will benefit greatly from this commitment to ongoing professional development.</p><p> I again thank the members of the committee for the opportunity to deliver a presentation to them.  We will take any questions the committee wishes to put to us.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee and Mr. Clinton for his thoughtful presentation.  We have heard from many people involved in penal reform.  There seems to be consistency among everyone, even victims' groups, that we need to get numbers down and make penal reform more effective from the point of view of rehabilitation.  There is a general assessment that things are improving.  I am interested to hear Mr. Clinton's views on this.  The only other issue on which I want his views is solitary confinement.  I note the views he has already expressed on it.  Is solitary confinement necessary to protect prison officers?  Is that what he is saying?  What does he think should be done to try to change the situation of people being subjected to solitary confinement in prisons?</p></speech>

In our view, there appears to be some confusion between a person who has asked to go on protection and a person in solitary confinement.  If one checks the numbers with the Prison Service, I am sure they will show that the vast majority of people on restricted regimes are on them because they requested to go on them for their own protection.  There will be a small number of prisoners the governor may have decided to put on restricted regimes after they have been risk assessed and found to be a danger to other prisoners or staff or even themselves to the extent that they must be watched constantly.  However, the vast majority of people on restricted regimes have gone on them at their own request for protection and, to us, this is very different from the use of solitary confinement as a tool within a prison system.  We do not support solitary confinement as a tool within a prison system.  This is a very practical approach.  Solitary confinement poses resource issues.  It is not the best way for a prison officer to deal with a person with whom they work every day of the week.  This is the context in which we are talking about it.</p></speech>

Are numbers decreasing?  What is his assessment of it?</p></speech>

When I worked in Wheatfield Prison, it started off with ten units with 16 cells each, taking the ground floor as an example, so there were 160 on the floor.  The minute they started to double up, extra beds were added to the cells and people started to talk about bed capacity.  However, our workshops and facilities were all designed on the basis of 320 people being in the place.  Within a short time, that number had increased to 400 or whatever the case may have been.  Once this happens, in our view, one moves into the issue of overcrowding within the system, yet we still see that the term used is "bed capacity".  It is like having a bunk bed for two in a box room in a house and then putting three people into the room.  Everyone has a bed but, in the case of a prison, there are no facilities to cater for anyone beyond the original capacity.  There has been an improvement over recent years in bringing down the numbers, but a simple political decision or any change could in turn change this overnight, and we would still only have the same resources the following day to deal with whatever would happen.</p></speech>

One of the important issues raised at the previous meeting was the issue of recruitment.  I think it was Michael Donnellan who said that we are on the verge of taking people on for the first time since the numbers fell, that we now have the ability to recruit people, that we are in a position to do something a little different and that prison officers have been struggling with lower numbers for a long time.  Is that the case?  New grades have been introduced recently at a very low level of starting wages and conditions for staff, which would make it very difficult.  Is this new recruitment at proper prison officer grade?  There was a new minor grade, not really that of a prison officer, and I am not sure this is a good way to go about it, but-----</p></speech>

What was introduced during the implementation of the Croke Park agreement was a clerical administration grade.  The first intake of staff at this grade were people who transferred from clerical officer positions in the general Civil Service.  They came to the Prison Service with roughly an 8% increase in pay but they were to do purely clerical administration duties, not to work on the landings with prisoners.  Under the British Taylorist system, people called auxiliary prison officers are recruited and put in one place for one specific purpose and they only work in that one place.  We do not do that here.  It is not a very positive aspect of a prison service, and we would never encourage it.  When we were introducing the annualised hours, a recruit prison officer came in at a lower rate than that of a prison officer but we incorporated into this a third level training course so that when they come in on the lowest points of the pay scale, they move up all the time and can become full prison officers.  There is no-----</p></speech>

When we agreed annualised hours, the number of hours per year it would take to run the prison service was capped.  At the time of the introduction of annualised hours, the number of additional hours required to run the system was set at 960 after every task was analysed.</p><p>If 20 people retire in March, 20 other people should come in immediately to fill the backspace because no additional resources come into the system after this.  Every hour must be spent within the ordinary wages employees are paid, or the 960 additional hours that match every task that took place in the prison system.  This was further redefined as part of the terms of the Croke Park agreement, where every task in the system was revisited to see if it could be done in a more efficient manner.  During the Croke Park agreement negotiations, everybody else was told their numbers were to be reduced by 10%.  We were told our numbers had to reduce but we still had to do the same amount of work.  We had already done this task in 2005 and we had to refine it.  Our chairperson at the time of the Croke Park agreement said the methodology we used was probably the best in the public service because we maintained the service.</p></speech>

In addressing a recruitment deficit, getting the numbers right and training people will be key to actual changes on the ground.  Is the Prison Officers Association confident the numbers being spoken about with regard to recruitment will be sufficient to fill the gap?</p> <p>  I could be completely wrong, but it strikes me when we talk about innovation on the ground that perhaps some of the measures that were progressive have not been able to be delivered.  I am thinking of the D&oacute;chas Centre, which was ahead of its time, but because of a lack of staff or resources, particularly training and education, the meaningful training the women do is not great.  I am sure this has a knock-on effect on the staff.  Do the witnesses notice this contradiction?</p> <p>  A theme has been the number of people in prison with acute psychotic and mental health problems, and it is the members of the Prison Officers Association who must deal with them.  How many people are out sick as a result of being at the receiving end of a violent incident in prison?  Do the witnesses believe existing supports are sufficient to address this?  It strikes me as beyond belief that people in our prison system were refused by the Central Mental Hospital on the basis they were too high risk.  The Central Mental Hospital is the professional body dealing with psychotic people, and when it states a person is too high risk for it to deal with, the person is left in a prison setting.  That is appalling for that person and the members of the Prison Officers Association, and it is just not on.  Can anything be done about this?  There needs to be much more of a clamour about this because it is crazy that a waiting list of more than 20 is tolerated.</p> <p>  We raised the issue of the training unit with the director general and I do not know how best to put what we were told.  We had many concerns, which probably were not fully answered at the committee meeting we attended, and the question on the gap in service provision was not answered.  Do the witnesses have a suggestion on how it might be managed?  We are very concerned about this.  The training unit was pioneering in its day and perhaps it has diminished a bit.  Is there something we should recommend?  We were struck by the gap but we did not receive full answers on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.575" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Mitchell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017032200002#M00300"><p>Unfortunately, the projected statistics show there will be 107 incidents of sick leave arising from assault of prison officers in the coming year.  For us, this is two assaults per week in the workplace, which is far too many.  With regard to supports available to staff, the serious physical assault scheme was introduced two years ago for prison officers.  This extends the period of time in which officers who have been victims of serious physical assault receive full pay while out on certified sick leave.  They have an additional six months at full pay as opposed to half pay, which was previously the case.  We are coming across instances where, due to the sheer violence of the assaults on our members, the sick leave taken goes well beyond this time.  We spoke to the T&aacute;naiste before Christmas and part of our discussion centred on the fact prison officers are expected to have full operational capacity to be able to perform their duties across the board at all times.  We sought the maintenance of the terms and conditions of employment of people who cannot perform their full operational duties arising from an assault by prisoners in custody.  In other words, we sought the retention of their prison officer pay.  People are forced out of employment and can no longer retain their jobs in the prison service because of being assaulted.  While the supports available for prison staff have been extended, we do not feel they go far enough.  We believe it should go further.</p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely correct with regard to mental health issues.  We are prison officers and prisoners who present with mental health issues should not be in prison.  We are not trained to deal with such people.  They should be in a mental health facility.  It is a practical issue for us because it is very hard to communicate with some of these individuals for whatever reason.  It has become even worse in recent times because of the growth in distribution of new psychotropic drugs.  This has become a massive issue for our colleagues in England.  These new drugs are largely undetectable because they are synthetic.  They are getting into prisons and are causing individuals severe psychological damage.  These people are very unpredictable.  Generally, they present with violence.  When the drugs began to come into the British prison system they were seen as cheap, but the drug trade is very practical and it is definitely user led.  The issue of price will have altered as time has gone on.</p> <p>  We were absolutely clear about the training unit in our submission.  The reality for a number of people who come into our custody is their background is not in employment.  Many of them come from families with generations of people who did not work.  We all probably take for granted the idea of getting up in the morning, going to work and coming home in the evening, having a wage and paying our bills.  This basic stuff that every single person and every citizen in the State does must become a learned concept.  We believe the training unit provided that.  It has been flagged to us as a short-term measure.  We believe it is damaging because the people who were in the training unit had been progressing.  They were going out to work in the community in the morning and coming back in the evening.  They were learning a particular methodology of going to work, which is something we would all take for granted.  It would appear these people will have to go into the main prison system.  As we outlined in our statement, this will bring attendant pressures because of people looking for them or their families to courier drugs because they are going in and out.  A certain amount of pressure can be brought to bear on them.</p></speech>

If they were put in an area on their own, they could have a greater regime.  The Prison Service is now stating it is looking at the concept of putting them into a super-enhanced facility.  That is the plan in this regard.</p><p> On the staffing question, the Deputy is right.  Everything is resource based so if we are meant to have 200 prison officers on duty in the building on a given day but we only have 160, then there has to be a hit somewhere in the system.  It operates either through diminishing task lines under the health and safety legislation or through a regime management plan.  That plan would be designed for safety reasons.  However, it does mean that we cannot give the services that we want to give.  It is within that context that we raised the Villabona project in Spain.  The man who designed that project, Mr. Faustino Zapico Garc&iacute;a, was brought over here during the lifetime of the last Government, when the Taoiseach was having his meetings about reinvigorating Ireland.  We were introduced to him through Ashoka Ireland and the late Dr. Mary Redmond.  He showed us figures from the Spanish prison system for his Units of Therapy and Education, UTE, project which is run within the building of a normal prison in Spain.  He could run his UTE project with half of the staffing levels of the main prison.  He managed to bring in a system where prisoner-on-prisoner and prisoner-on-staff violence went down to practically zero.  In the Spanish prison system generally, there was a 75% re-offending rate.  The most important element of his system was that the re-offending rate among those prisoners who went through the UTE project was down to 10%.  When he gave us those facts and figures, we thought that they were so interesting that we brought him over here to share them with our other colleagues across Europe.  He seems to have hit on something that is revolutionary in the prison system.</p></speech>

I wanted to ask a little more about the Villabona project in Spain to find out how it works.  Mr. Clinton said that a prison estate is divided up into units for therapy and education.  How does that work?</p> <p>  On a more general level, it must be so hard for prison officers to be working in such a chaotic environment, particularly in the context of addiction.  I have seen myself how difficult that can be and the burnout levels must be very high among prison officers.  I have worked as a therapist in a treatment centre but there would have only been about 20 clients there and a team of highly skilled therapists.  It is quite chaotic and one has to work in a very skilled way to deal with the chaos of addiction and its impact.  There is a requirement for a lot of supervision and so forth.  It must be very difficult for prison officers to be dealing with that without the skills to deal with the impact of addiction.  I am aware that resources are very limited but could modules be introduced into the prison officer's training so that they can deal with the impact of addiction on themselves?  It is very easy to get burnt out.  Would it be possible to provide more supervision and more support in that area?  I understand that resources are tight but I would imagine that if there was some kind of an understanding of how to deal with addiction and mental health problems, it might help.  It might help to reduce the level of violence within the prison system.  I hope that makes sense.</p></speech>

Any form of training that improves their skills set would obviously be very beneficial to prison officers and things have changed and improved in that regard; there is no point in me saying otherwise.  When I joined the prison service, I was given nine week's basic training and then on the following Saturday, I was straight in and on duty.  Nowadays, we have the Higher Certificate in Custodial Care, HCCC, which is a third level course and is far better designed to equip a person with the skills set for the job.  That said, the Senator is quite right that we do need more of that type of training.  The more training one has, the more one understands the situation around one.  It helps the prison officers and, more importantly, it helps the people they are dealing with too.  We would encourage anything that the committee could do to help in terms of improving training for prison officers because it is a very challenging environment.  Prison officers are working with people who do not want to be in prison and there are huge addiction problems.  It is a very challenging job and every tool that we can be provided with to assist us would be more than welcome.  We would be hopeful that this committee will make some recommendations in that regard.</p> <p>  On the Villabona project, I did not actually get over to Spain to see it first-hand because there were some internal difficulties between the prison and the Spanish government in terms of allowing us to go in to see it.  However, I went to see a project which is based on a similar concept in Grendon prison in the UK.  What they do there is to normalise prison to the greatest extent possible.  There were two prison officers running the project when I visited.  One of them was actually the chairman of the local Prison Officer's Association branch and was very helpful to us.  They sit down in a group every day with the prisoners on the project and have very intense counselling sessions.  That happens from the time the prisoners get up in the morning until the afternoon, when they have recreation.  I actually sat in on one of the sessions myself.  I had to get the permission of the prisoners engaged in the project to do so.  They allowed me to sit in on it and it was very beneficial.  Mr. Eoin Carroll, who was here earlier, was with me on the day.  The prisoners speak very openly and honestly.  The project is designed around the concepts of non-violence and normalisation.  For example, prisoners call the prison officers by their first names, which is not a common occurrence in the Irish prison system.  Small things like that make a difference.  </p> <p>  In Spain, Mr. Faustino Zapico Garc&iacute;a, has developed the concept much more.  I got a booklet sent over which was in Spanish and I had it translated.  I have met Mr. Garc&iacute;a on a number of occasions and he explains the project very well.  Put simply, it is about normalisation and prisoners taking ownership of their own situation.  That is combined with the provision of excellent supports, as is the case in Grendon prison.  The flaw I saw in the Grendon prison project was that when prisoners finished the course, they were sent back into the normal prison estate, which was nonsensical.  Prisoners lived for up to two years in the project environment and came around fully.  Some of them would have been big, heavy members of a criminal gang but they were sent back to the criminal gang in the main prison.  Peer pressure from the gang then dragged them back into the old way of life straight away.   It would have to be designed so that when prisoners come out of a project environment, they are either sent to an open centre or a semi-open centre and not back onto the wings of the regular prison.  The concept is excellent and it would be well worth the committee's while to visit Spain to see it in action.  It brings in all of the issues that Senator Black referred to, like addiction training and so forth.</p></speech>

My first question relates to Grendon.  Mr. Clinton went over there with Mr. Eoin Carroll.  I ask him to give us more details on what he saw there and what elements could be incorporated into the Irish system.   How could we make it work here?  Mr. Carroll said that ideally it would be run as a separate unit.  Does Mr. Clinton think we could incorporate it into the current prison system?  I invite him to give us more details on what he saw in Grendon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.589" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Clinton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017032200002#N01100"><p>The first point is that it is a separate entity.  The people in Grendon prison who are on the project are in a standalone unit.  They are not mixing with the general prison population.  It would be akin to going into any Irish prison, taking a wing of it and designating it as a unit of therapy and education and determining that only prisoners involved in the unit will be housed on that wing.  The plan, the project and everything that goes on in it is specifically confined to that area.  The prisoners who are on the project mix with each other but they do not mix with anyone else.  There is a lot of peer pressure on each of them when they go onto the project to stay on board with the programme.  For example, prisoners who have spent a long time in prison and have learned that it is not a great way to live one's life, impart that knowledge to new prisoners.  This is the concept behind the Spanish project.  The older prisoners who have been through the system, who want to get out and to change can influence the younger prisoners and teach them about the flaws of going down the road of spending their whole lives going in and out of prison.  They teach the younger prisoners how not to do that, after they have gone through the UTE.</p><p> We could choose to introduce this concept in any part of the Irish prison system.  We could announce that the services of the counselling and therapeutic community are being made available in a certain portion of the prison system.  It would be possible to take this approach with a prisoner within a day or two.  He would not need to have been in prison for a long time.  The people who run the project would assess the prisoner to determine whether it is worth including him in it.  Each prisoner selected for the project would be given one, two or three chances, but if it became clear that he was not playing his correct part in it, he would be moved out of it and someone else would be given his place.  There is a huge incentive for the prisoner in this approach.  It was very worthwhile to sit through the counselling with the prisoners to get their views and hear how they felt about things.  For example, the day we were there the prisoners were asked whether their social backgrounds got them into trouble.  This was relevant because some of them were going back into those environments.  It was interesting to hear one prisoner say openly and honestly that he was in prison because of the acts he had committed.  He did not want to hear about his social background because he had moved on from it.  The prisoners were open and honest about the crimes they had committed and everything they had done.  It was counselling at a very heavy level.  People had to take breaks after an hour and a half of these sessions before they could come back to them.  It was very worthwhile.  I think it would be worth exploring in the Irish prison system.</p><p> The issue of finding buildings in which this can be done is not a huge one.  The issue is the will to start looking at new types of systems.  When we were introducing incentivised regimes in to the Irish prison system, I visited Maghaberry Prison in Northern Ireland, where a similar system was running.  When they locked the unit at night time, no prison staff were present and prisoners could go in and out of their cells until a specific time to use toilets, etc.  When I looked at that as someone who had worked as a prison officer on the floor, I asked what would happen if a prisoner collapsed in his cell or something like that.  The prison officer in charge assured me that someone would ring for an ambulance in the same way that someone would do so if a person collapsed in his or her home.  We could understand where he came from when he said that.  Local prison managers were fearful about introducing something like that because they felt there would be a blame culture if anything went wrong.  They were concerned that there would not be a non-blame culture.  When more modern systems of penal reform like the Villabona project or the Grendon approach are being introduced, it is important to bring staff along by reassuring them that there will not be a blame culture if something goes wrong.  There is no doubt that mistakes are made when modern processes like this are being introduced.  Such problems will be overcome because they have been overcome in other countries where these systems still work.</p></speech>

Mr. Clinton mentioned that 77.9% of staff have been physically assaulted, which is a stark statistic.  Is that above the international metric?  It seems to be a very high figure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.602" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Mitchell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017032200002#O01300"><p>While that is a stark statistic, the projection that 107 prison officers will be assaulted by prisoners in 2017 is even worse from our perspective.  The State Claims Agency has examined the figures and projected that there will be two assaults per week in the Prison Service as a workplace.  It is as if everyone working in this building knew there was a good chance that they or one of their colleagues would be assaulted.  The stark reality is that it happens twice a week.  The other side of the coin is that our people deliver a service afterwards.  People have to be incentivised to view their jobs in a good, positive and productive manner.  We have looked at the question of penal reform from a positive perspective because it is a practical issue for us.  Some conflicting issues, such as a lack of staff, have been mentioned.  The significant problems with overcrowding that persisted in previous years have been alleviated for the time being.  However, something like a change in bail legislation could easily overturn that.  The tenuous and precarious nature of the job is a real issue for every prison officer who goes to work every day.  The Prison Service statistics we have quoted bear that out.  The validity of international comparisons hinges on the kinds of regimes we look at.  An international comparison with Spain, for example, might not look at the Villabona project to which Mr. Clinton referred.  While the job we do is extraordinary, for want of a better word, it is done by people who view it as a job and who go to work because they have mortgages to pay and families at home.  Their ability to do the job can be destroyed permanently, as I said earlier.</p></speech>

An undercover journalist recently went into Northumberland prison to make a Panorama documentary that showed the stark reality of how bad a prison can get.  I would not like to work in the place, never mind being a prisoner there.  The documentary focused on the developing issue of the use of new psychoactive substances in the prison environment.  It showed a prison officer collapsing as a result of inhaling the smoke in the air in the prison.  He had to be taken out in an ambulance.  Such things are taking off now, unfortunately, and it will be difficult to deal with them in our system.</p></speech>

I would like to raise a few points.  I wonder how much contact the association has with the Minister and the Department of Justice and Equality.  Does it deal mainly with the Irish Prison Service?  There is broad agreement that things could be much better for prisoners, prison officers and staff.  It is agreed that things need to change.  How can we make change a reality?  Do the witnesses feel the prisons are understaffed?  Are prison officers under-resourced to do the job they would like to do?  How would Mr. Clinton and Mr. Mitchell regard the level of staff morale at present?  I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan that people with mental health issues should not be in prison.  We have been led to understand that up to 70% of the prison population have mental health challenges in one area or another.  It seems that judges are going to keep sending people to prison irrespective of their problems.</p><p>People with mental health issues are ending up in prison.  The judge does not have anywhere else to put them and the State is not providing facilities and means to deal with these people in a different way so we are using prison to deal with them.  The prison officers are not being trained to deal with them as it is not their area.  This all seems a bit mad.  I know a small unit is being built in the midlands, which is a good idea but it is clearly a token gesture.  It is not near enough to meeting the challenges of the problem.  What can be done in the area?</p><p> A separate issue is the management of prisons, which to the best of my knowledge is still based in Longford.  Would it make more sense to have it in Dublin?  The witnesses have stated the majority of people who are in solitary confinement are there by their own request.  The problem is that gang culture is alive and well.  Challenging that must be very difficult.  Does the delegation agree it needs to be challenged?  Rather than being happy with saying that a prisoner is in solitary confinement because he wants to be because of another problem, surely we must deal with that other problem.  Is that an impossible task?  Does it require a new apparatus?  It probably needs more resources and perhaps a different structure within the prison itself.  What are the thoughts of the witnesses?  Is it possible to address the major problem with gangs?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.606" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Clinton" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017032200002#P00200"><p>I will start with the first issue.  The staffing issue is very obvious and if one does not have the staff, there is a problem.  As I stated, we designed an annualised hours package so we would know how many hours we had within the system and what we had to work with.  It was designed with the belief that we would have classes of recruits always in training to match retirements.  That is manpower planning.  If they know 30 people can retire in October this year, we should have 30 people in training, ready to walk out and readily replace them.  There are obvious issues around that and we only have one training centre.  The maximum we could probably get is a number amounting to two classes at a time.  There are difficulties all the time in that regard but we should have a system in place with recruits always in training, with proper manpower planning for the amount of people who can go out.  This can be checked fairly well as they know from when a person joins the day he or she can leave.  In the early 1970s there was much recruitment, as there was in the early 1990s, as it was matched to the opening of prisons etc.  One can reasonably predict manpower planning in that regard.  It is not rocket science and it should be done all the time.  I hope that addresses the staffing element of the question.  We are not happy with the current position but it is what it is because we only have one training college.  The course takes a certain amount of time before a prison officer emerges.  We should always have ongoing recruitment to match retirements.  In that way we will keep a far better flow of staff and resources on the ground.  Everything is resource-based and there is no doubt about that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about people in restricted regimes because they ask to be there and whether that can be addressed.  It can be addressed.  There is intelligence on prisoners within the system to know who are the gang people.  They know who they are when they are arrested in the outside community and when they are put into prison.  In the British system they have eight units where they keep people in closed supervision.  One is in Woodhill and they are all category A prisoners.  We do not use that type of classification in the Irish prisons but they are the types who are gang leaders who cause all the problems.  It is that type of prisoner.  Rather than having the person on the other end of the scale - who is forced and pressurised all the time - in the restricted regime, we should turn it the other way around and put those who cause the problems under restricted regimes and closed supervision.  I am not talking about solitary confinement but rather having those types of people in isolation units where they cannot put pressure on the more vulnerable people within our system.  The prison system should be there to help the person who wants to be helped and not the other way around.  The person with power in a gang should not control a prison.  The vulnerable person should be at the centre of our thoughts in the prison system all the time.</p></speech>

We get to see the Minister approximately once per year, when we request it.  In the main, since the introduction of a director general to the Prison Service, industrial relations issues or other matters are directed to the director general and his or her officials.  That goes back to approximately the year 2000.</p></speech>

There are different levels of problems with mental health.

In Mr. Clinton's opening address he indicated that last Thursday, the day before St. Patrick's Day, there were 3,793 people in custody.  Within that figure, 235 were in open centres.  Has the witness any idea of the number of the remaining prisoners who could be in open centres?  Has any such analysis been done?  I presume an analysis has been done in the first instance or there would not be 235 people in open centres.  Could there be another 235 put in these settings or what is the issue?  Do we not have sufficient capacity within open centre settings?  Will Mr. Clinton elaborate a little on that?  On a number of levels and even speaking earlier with the Jesuit centre's representative, it seems to be a more affordable means of addressing the denial of one's liberty.  I am anxious to know what further information can be given in that regard.</p><p>There is the issue of establishing drug-free areas within prison settings.  I take from Mr. Clinton's statement that it is not <i>in situ</i>now but it is an aspiration, hope and ambition.  He has indicated it has the support of all stakeholders but where is the problem if I am right in my understanding they are not <i>in situ</i>?  If all stakeholders are supportive, what further steps might be necessary to see the establishment of drug-free areas within prison settings?</p></speech>

We only have two open centres, which are Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.  One could be the most compliant prisoner under the sun but may not want to be in Loughan House if he or she lives in Dublin because of family visit or various other issues.  The last time we spoke before the committee there was a recommendation to use more open centres.  This should be tied into the issue of sentence management.  There must be more than 235 prisoners coming to the end of their sentences.</p></speech>

It must be tied into the sentence management plan.  We have just taken the semi-open centre out of the system.</p><p>Are we going to replace it with open centres?  The committee did a lot of work on this issue and drew up conclusions as to why we should have them.  We believe we should have them and that we should use the ones we have.  They can be developed much more cheaply than closed prisons and the problem is not insurmountable.  We have drug-free units in ordinary prisons, but we could have more of them and a lot of people would buy into them.  If we were to get a prisoner out of the main area to the drug-free unit, it would get him or her out of an environment in which he or she is pressurised to bring in stuff, which gets him or her involved in the drug culture within the system.</p></speech>

As we had them in St. Patrick's Institution many years ago, it is not a new initiative.  Dr. Vanessa Fowler, the European expert in this area, visited St. Patrick's Institution and, despite all the criticism it had received during the years, she found it to be one of the best she had ever seen, describing it as a model of best practice.  Anyone in Europe could have come to St. Patrick's Institution and seen how to do it properly; therefore, the knowledge and skill sets are available within the system.  We should do a lot more of this.</p></speech>

It is of no relevance to me while I am working with prisoners.  Decentralisation was a political decision and we were certainly not consulted on it.  The main prisons are located in Dublin, but the decision to move was political.  I was at a partnership meeting of all the unions in the Irish Prison Service when decentralisation was announced and nobody had known anything about it before that day.</p> <p>  Staff morale is low.  We could do an awful lot in the Irish Prison Service to improve things and doing it would automatically improve staff morale.</p></speech>

People join the Irish Prison Service for many reasons.  Security of tenure does not come into the reckoning because there are many other jobs.  It is always challenging and the people who join are particularly well motivated.  In time, if they do not have enough resources and are being constantly stretched, it will impinge on morale.  It affects some places more than others.  The more difficult and challenging the job the lower morale will be because officers did not join the service for that reason - they joined to do something positive.  When staff are under-resourced and under pressure, morale becomes an issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.635" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Moroney" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017032200002#D00700"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for giving us the opportunity to appear before them.</p> <p>  The Association of Farm and Forestry Contractors in Ireland, FCI is run by contractors for contractors.  We define a land based contractor as a rural based professional company which is working on behalf of third parties to provide machinery services in the production of arable crops, livestock and forestry and the maintenance of local authority green spaces and hedgerows.  It provides mechanisation services which employ skilled operators and use state-of-the-art modern equipment in a sustainable way for financial reward.  Most of the time contractors carry out their activities in rural areas, but this does not exclude operations in urban areas and cities such as the maintenance of green spaces and engaging in earth moving activities.  Thanks to their expertise and access to advanced technology, they have become key players in the agriculture sector and amenity and forest management.  </p> <p>  The FCI has a membership database which includes over 500 legitimate farm and forestry contractors, representing 70% of the land based rural contractor businesses in Ireland.  Farm contractors seasonally employ close to 10,000 people who operate high technology agricultural, forestry, earth moving and amenity specific machines.</p><p>Our members all work with the soil in moving it, planting in it, fertilising crops that grow in it and harvesting.  In that sense, FCI land based contractors are true "soilmates".  They support and promote the highest levels of safety in operating farm, earth moving and forestry machinery while on public lands and or in the fields.  </p><p> Much attention has been paid in the recent past to tractor testing.  Research data indicate that tractors are involved in just 1% of all road traffic accidents in Europe and that 69% of these incidents involve tractors more than 12 years old.  In Ireland the Road Safety Authority's breakdown of serious injuries by road user type between 2010 and 2012 showed that 0.9% occurred in incidents involving tractors and other vehicles.  The 2008 to 2012 vehicle factors report, published in 2016, showed that in 983 fatal collisions, 17, or 1.3%, of the 1,245 vehicles involved were tractors which were among the oldest vehicles measured at the time.  They are not typical of the tractors used by FCI farm contractors.  Commercial vehicles accounted for more than 15% of all fatal collisions.  All of these vehicles are subject to roadworthiness testing.  FCI land based contractors are already self-assessing the safety of their tractors in Irish conditions and they are not a significant cause of road collisions.  </p><p> We are concerned that there has been no consultation on the proposals to introduce tractor roadworthiness testing with land based contractors, even though the proposed legislation will impact on our members more than on farmers because of the size and modern nature of tractors in their fleets.  Contractor-owned tractors are not even involved in farm accidents to the same extent as farmer-owned tractors as contractors need to have their machines in top condition all of the time to ensure they are working to the maximum available hours dictated by our variable weather conditions.  The proposed tractor NCT will add significant costs for land based contractors in Ireland.  Apart from the strict new proposed compliance costs, there will be huge depreciation costs incurred when there is no specific need for to do so.  The FCI is calling for clarity on the proposal and the Minister to invoke the option of seeking an exemption from the proposed testing legislation in the Irish market.  The United Kingdom has opted to avail of the exemption. </p><p> The recent legislation includes a limit of a radius of 100 km for tractors from their base of operations.  Many modern tractors are required to transport farm and forestry machines and farm produce over greater distances, where the use of a truck would not be practical or economical owing to the relatively low value of the goods in transit such as straw.  The FCI is calling for this limit to be raised to 180 km.  Given where he comes from, I am sure the Chairman is aware of the need of many farmers to buy straw from places in east Cork, which is well in excess of the 100 km distance limit.  That is why it will impact on them.</p></speech>

European research has shown that most on-road accidents involving farm machines happen at crossroads or intersections where a farm vehicle turns right or left or enters the road from the field or under the road.  In this situation the operator of the farm vehicle needs good visibility in all directions to see other vehicles and avoid accidents.</p> <p>  We are witnessing significant and expensive damage to tractor lighting and mirror systems, as well as similar damage to trucks caused by unmanaged hedgerows.  Visibility is severely restricted when exiting fields on many such roads owing to non-existent hedge management by local authorities.  Tractors have longer bonnets and the German Government is looking towards supporting land based contractors in fitting camera systems on the front of tractors where the distance from the driver's seat to the front of the tractor extends more than 3.5 m.  We would like to think the Irish Government would consider supporting a similar initiative here.  </p> <p>  The practical use of L and N plates is a source of significant concern for FCI land based contractors.  It is adding more management issues as, in some cases, when trailers are changed between tractors, there is little option in some fleets other than to paste an L and an N plate on every machine.  There is also an issue for drivers with learner permit W driving licences which are specifically for work vehicles.  The RSA has informed the FCI that the driver who holds a learner permit is required to be accompanied by a qualified driver if there is a passenger seat fitted.  If no second seat is fitted in the tractor cab, the driver is not required to be accompanied by a qualified driver.  There is a huge anomaly attached to this because most of the tractors with the additional seat are more modern, safer, more desirable and typical of contractor fleets.  Do we want people to go back to having ancient tractors in order not to have a second seat in the cab? </p> <p>  FCI member have been subject to considerable hassle by local garda&iacute; who have issues in interpreting some specific regulations as they impact on tractor use on the public road.  They include issues in the use of the hard shoulder.  Is it illegal to use it to let traffic pass, or is it illegal to create a tailback with a slow moving vehicle?  Some of our members have had to endure two penalty points because they pulled into the hard shoulder to let traffic pass and in other cases where they did not pull in, they were considered to be driving carelessly.  We need to have the matter clarified and interpreted locally. </p> <p>  I know that there is a Bill on cycling coming through the House, but there are growing numbers of cyclists on rural roads, particularly in groups at the weekend.  The requirement to allow a space of 1.5 m in overtaking a cyclist is difficult, if not impossible, to achieve on many N and R grade roads.  While it is legal to cycle two abreast, in many instances FCI members meet groups of cyclists travelling four abreast who show little interest in other road users.  We have noted that some of these cyclists move at speeds in excess of 40 km per hour, while the proposal is that at these speeds tractors undergo an NCT.  There is no special licence required to ride bikes at this speed and no formal training is needed.  There is no NCT for bicycles rated at speeds in excess of 40 km per hour.  There are more accidents involving cyclists than tractors, according to the RSA's statistics.  </p> <p>  We represent in excess of 500 legitimate farm and forestry contractors, approximately 70% of those operating in the country, who harvest in excess of 80% of national silage crops and are vitally important to agriculture and rural development.  They manage and handle up to 80% of the animal manure produced on farms.  They employ 10,000 people and in many parts of rural Ireland are the only employers.  They are also significant consumers, consuming more than 500 million litres of diesel annually in harvesting and operating machines.  They operate more than 20,000 tractors, approximately one third of the national fleet.  Typically, they will invest in the region of &euro;100 million per year in new machinery.  In that way, they support many local farm machinery distribution and manufacturing companies, as well as local employment.  FCI land based contractors support and encourage the maintenance of the highest standards of safety in the use of tractors and other items of machinery when operated on and off the road.  The FCI has initiated and will continue to initiate driver training programmes to enhance standards.  FCI land based contractors are responsible machinery users who have at their core the safety of their operators, other road users and their expensive machinery.  They work in challenging conditions when variable Irish weather conditions determine the amount and quality of the work they can do.  They seek recognition of the important role they play in farming and the forestry industry.  We seek fairness in the treatment of legal aspects of operating agricultural and forest machinery when travelling to and from work in using public roads.</p></speech>

I have been involved in the motor and insurance industry for most of my career and in the past 12 years an independent motor engineering assessor and consultant.  As an experienced motor assessor, part of my role is assisting in ensuring modified, crashed and repaired vehicles are in a safe and roadworthy condition by ensuring the correct work process is undertaken and documented.  On a regular basis we encounter vehicles which are deemed to be unrepairable and currently categorised as a write-off by the insurer, but what about vehicles that are not physically inspected or do not go through the insurance system?</p><p>When these vehicles are inspected, which is not always by suitable independent motor assessors, the vehicle report, with its documented information, is not a public document and stays with whoever paid for the report.  If these reports were available, the possibility of returning the vehicle to the road in a safe manner greatly increases.  The present system can be greatly improved to ensure all damaged vehicles, whether going through the insurance system or not, are returned to the road in a safe and roadworthy condition.  At present, the system enables some damaged and repaired vehicles to return to the road without proper documented confirmation of its status, which is unsatisfactory.  There is no regulation to insist such a documented process has to be undertaken.</p><p>This oversight not only relates to the family vehicle but also to all mechanically-propelled vehicles and the like. There must be a regulation that insists that everybody who undertakes any work, whether service, mechanical, body repairs or modifications, documents the process and retains same for possible future inspection and auditing.  The importance of documentation is to ensure a vehicle history trail and accountability can be measured.  From time to time we encounter imported vehicles and the lack of a proper vehicle history being available is an obvious issue, especially with the amount of imports appearing to be on the increase.  Some figures indicate 10% of the UK imports alone are insurance write-offs and therefore all the imported vehicles need to be tested and documented as being roadworthy and safe prior to being allowed on our roads. </p><p> Experience has shown the use of suitably experienced independent-acting motor engineer assessors improves vehicle safety, decreases claim costs and underwriting risk, increases vehicle and repair standards within the motor industry, increases revenue, provides independent investigative assistance and clarification and provides suitable reports on vehicle roadworthiness and modification.</p><p> On claims costs, by not using suitable motor engineer assessors correctly, insurance companies are not suitably equipped to audit and investigate claims when required and this is in part leading to heightened claims costs.  There is also a need for clear regulation regarding the suitably qualified individual and the processes regarding the services he or she supplies.  </p><p> Who can assist with and audit this?  The establishment of a truly open, transparent and independent full-time body or individual is required.  The benefits of such an entity would include a completely documented register of suitable motor engineer assessors, as well as constant auditing and education, an accessible independent voice to assist the motor industry and all related bodies, such as the RSA, EPA, Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Revenue Commissioners, assistance in the design and enforcement of regulation and an increase in standards within the motor industry.  I am confident that the use of suitably experienced independent-acting professional motor engineer assessors, combined with an independent body or individual, will allow the correct enhancements necessary in the industry both cost-effectively and in a timely manner.</p></speech>

It is committed to tackling the issues affecting it head on.  It seeks to build the future of the Irish road transport industry by developing and promoting industry standards, facilitating road transport operator education and training, educating end-users and securing an equitable business environment, as well as helping them to operate in the safest possible manner.<br/><br/>The IRHA suggests that while developing strategies countrywide to meet needs and prepare a coherent, relevant road safety plan, we must start with the basics. <br/><br/><b></b>As a child I learnt the safe cross code.  It was part of the school curriculum.  It is an essential part of any academic education that children learn to obey the rules of the road.  It should be here that cycling safety awareness is taught.  In the UK, &ldquo;Bikeability&rdquo; is a Government-funded training initiative for schoolchildren with the expressed hope that this type of programme would incorporate messages about how to be safe around HGVs.  They learn about existence of a &ldquo;danger zone&rdquo; on trucks and to never ride along the kerbside of a truck especially as it may turn left but yet this is what we see adult cyclists do on a daily basis in our cities.  The wearing of headphones while cycling, walking or driving is another frequent flyer in the face of road safety and must be stopped.  The proposed new cycling Bill is a totally unworkable solution to a safety problem.  If a cyclist is on the left-hand side of a vehicle in a 50 km/h or less zone, they cannot possibly stay the proposed distance of 1 m, because the cycle lane was added to an already undersized carriageway.  We are squeezing in cyclists to show how far we have come environmentally but not in terms of road safety.  It is putting the cart before the horse.  <br/><br/>It should be mandatory for cyclists to wear headgear for their own protection.  As road users, the onus is equally on them to operate in as safe a manner as possible.  For the driver of a mechanically-propelled vehicle, MPV, particularly in dense traffic, visibility is key.  All road users should be compelled by legislation to wear high-visibility vests where they are competing with MPVs for road space.  In my experience, a bicycle will fit where a MPV or HGV will not and that is where they will go to try to beat the traffic.  Such a law would not make for a nanny state but for a safer State. <br/><br/>The law in our sector requires drivers of commercial vehicles weighing 7.5 tonnes and over to complete professional competency courses that include road safety elements such as the benefits of wearing a seat belt.  These courses are crucial to updating best practices and laws.  The view of the IRHA is that a serious, meaningful review of the content of these courses is needed urgently.  As it stands today, these courses are antiquated and top-heavy with information no longer relevant to the profession.  There is no requirement that it be delivered by adequately trained persons in this area of expertise.  We appeal to this committee to order a full review of the driver continuing professional competence programme as a matter of urgency and to encourage the RSA to consult with the sector operatives when compiling a new programme. <br/><br/>Section 70 of the Roads Act 1993 places the responsibility for the maintenance of roadside hedges on the owners or occupiers of the adjoining lands.  The enforcement of this law is virtually non-existent yet paramount to all road users&rsquo; safety.  It is well recognised that the height of the cutting of hedges goes nowhere near taking into account the height of mirrors on HGVs, buses or tractors, which should be 4 m or more.  We are heavily regulated to supply as compulsory the mirror equipment stipulated under DOE testing.  A vehicle will fail if mirrors of the correct standard are not fitted but no regard is giving to the hazard of losing these mirrors at great cost to the operator and to road safety when an overhanging tree branch is responsible for its loss.  Visibility is a key factor in implementing road safety.  <br/><br/>It should be considered that landowners comply with section 70 and provide proof of same before payment can be made of any subsidy due on lands.  We cannot obtain a haulage licence for a vehicle unless its DOE test status and road tax are current and proof of same is required.  It is the mantra of county councils across the country that if overgrown hedgerows are reported by individuals then they will take action.  The county councils&rsquo; roads engineers and maintenance operators should be tasked with this as part of their daily work, rather than waiting for motorists to inform them.  That would be the equivalent of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na waiting for reports of drink-driving before any enforcement would take place.  Pedestrians and cyclists have nowhere to go when hedges are overgrown.  HGVs and buses are forced into the centre of the road to avoid losing mirrors but all the while, the councils have provision within legislation to cut hedges when road safety is an issue.  As they have the power to require the landowner to take action where a tree, shrub, hedge or other vegetation is a potential hazard, they should use it and show a serious effort is being made to effect road safety and that it is not just being talked about. <br/><br/>Ireland is the only country in the EU that allows tractors on its motorways.  They can be driven on motorways in the Republic of Ireland providing that the tractor is capable of reaching a minimum speed of 50 km/h.  Incidentally, in almost all cases that also is its maximum speed and this does not take into account the weight of the load it is towing and it is almost guaranteed that it cannot maintain that speed on an incline.  In fog or inclement weather conditions coming upon a vehicle of this nature while driving a HGV capable of a speed of 80 km/h, not to mention a car allowed to travel at 120 km/h, is one's worst nightmare.</p><p>There have been many incidents of late involving tractors on motorways with near-fatal and, in some cases, fatal consequences.  In Ireland, there is no requirement to undergo formal training to drive such vehicles and the age of the relevant driver leaves a lot to be desired.  This practice must be stopped, with no exceptions, if we are serious about road safety as the practice makes us the laughing stock of Europe and is rarely defined by agricultural need.</p><p> There is no doubt that there are stretches of roads that are particularly hazardous.  The one that sticks out in my mind is the N20.  A motorway is now crucial to service this heavily used route between Cork and Limerick but we believe it has been pushed out to the 2020-2025 period.  Another is the Crusheen road on the N18 between Gort and Galway, which has been flagged by TII as a problem.  There have been many near-fatal incidents but actions to solve the problem have not been forthcoming.  There is no cost attached to saving a life.</p><p> In general, there has been a vast improvement in the road network but rural Ireland is rural Ireland and improvements need to be made.  Roundabouts, in terms of their construction, are often badly cambered and this can be a factor in contributing to the overturning of vehicles.  Incorrect bridge height signage due to road resurfacing and insufficient bridge height signing are factors in accidents involving bridge strikes, which are not just down to driver error as Irish Rail would like us to think.  There are numerous factors to be considered under the heading of road safety, such as insurance.  The percentage of uninsured drivers now on our roads has not been helped by the huge hikes in insurance premiums.  There is active enforcement of this but garda&iacute; are hard pressed to keep up.</p><p> There have been improvements in drug and drink-driving laws and the levels were reduced in 2011.  The proposed mandatory loss of a driving licence for an offence of this nature from the Minister, Deputy Ross, is something that must be further analysed.  As professional drivers, we are in the designated driver category and the IRHA at all times encourages zero tolerance on the consumption of intoxicants where work is to be undertaken within a 24-hour period.</p><p> In the context of the road haulage sector, the IRHA strives to advise where legislation fails us.  Best practice is observed where load restraint and load securing are required but the approach to this must become uniform, regardless of whether the operator is licensed.  However, it is licensed hauliers that are at all times most in jeopardy due to the consequential loss if they do not comply by attaining a haulage licence.</p><p> Our pool of professional drivers is dwindling because no young drivers are entering the profession.  A major factor in this is the penalty points system, as losing a licence is too high a price to pay and other employment options mean they are less at risk than being on the road.  EU tachograph Regulation No. 561/2006 means that we are already heavily regulated and it dictates rest breaks and daily driving hours.  It does not dictate where the safe parking and rest stops are available to comply with the regulations, however.  The Minister's proposal to ban any driver caught with alcohol in his or her system and the proposed cycling Bill are levelled at their chosen profession.  It is paramount that persons involved in roadside checks on carriageways of over 100 km should be stopped as this practice is not in line with road safety.  The authorities should be advised that this is a jeopardy to everybody's life.</p><p> The IRHA is committed to reinforce and monitor driver training and has developed a new driver apprenticeship programme which is awaiting certification from Quality &amp;amp; Qualifications Ireland, QQI.  We encourage our members to implement stringent fleet safety programmes, with zero tolerance for impaired driving, lack of seat belt use and mobile phone use and with monitoring of driver behaviours where possible through telematics, educating employees and drivers to the highest standards and enforcing all safety, road and other regulations as company policy uniformly throughout their organisations, all of which can go a long way to improving road safety.</p><p> The IRHA and I wish to thank members for this opportunity to present our view on this very important matter.  I would welcome any questions from the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.644" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017032200002#G00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for giving us the opportunity to address them today and to present our proposal regarding changing driver behaviour to improve road safety.</p> <p>  My name is John Farrell and I have been involved in the transport industry since 1990 as a driver and transport manager in both bus and truck operations.  I am here with my colleague, Yvonne Kinnarney, ADI, chartered member of the Institute of Logistics and Transport and lecturer in the areas of transport management, ADR, ADI and driver CPC.</p> <p>  We have put together a proposal that will both enhance road safety and contribute to reducing road fatalities.  The penalty points system for driving offences was introduced in Ireland on 31 October 2002 to improve driver behaviour in Ireland using penalty points as a deterrent and as a means to reduce the levels of death and serious injury on our roads.  While this system has had a major impact on driving behaviour, drivers themselves continue to offend and our proposal is aimed at developing further the idea of having re-education, together with prosecution, as a deterrent for driving offences.  With the increase in road deaths of 16% from 2015 to 2016, we feel that further development is required to reduce and reverse this trend.</p> <p>  From the age of 17 and after acquiring a full driver's licence, a driver is not obliged to undergo any further training or certification on their licence unless it is for professional development or for medical reasons.  Technically, a driver can continue to drive through a 53-year period without being reviewed or monitored on their traits and behaviour.  Our proposal operates on two levels.  As of 31 January last, there were 61,572 drivers with six or more penalty points on their licences and we would like to focus on them initially.  Level 1 is classroom-based training and re-education of drivers who have acquired penalty points on their licence.  The classroom-based training will examine salient points on road safety such as the impact of speeding, mobile phone usage, driver fatigue, intoxicants and the duty of care to other road users.  We will show how the offences contribute towards road traffic collisions and the potential impact on other road users.  It is an important reminder that, when we speak about road safety, we are not talking about faceless statistics but real people.  Every day we read about people who have died on our roads.  There are also those who survive these collisions and who have to live with life-changing injuries.  These people have to learn to cope with their injuries.  Their families, friends and loved ones are also learning how to support them every day.</p> <p>  We will also use audiovisual examples and a participants' manual in training.  There will be a written examination with multiple choice questions to show the level of participation and understanding of the modules covered.  We envisage, on completion of training, that participants' attendance will be uploaded via a secure portal to the RSA where, after a monitoring period, they will be permitted to reduce their endorsements by two penalty points.</p> <p>  This brings me to level 2- the monitoring.  Driver's behaviour will be monitored through a smartphone application that will generate reports for the driver and the monitoring centre.  This report produces analysis of acceleration, braking, cornering and speed, ABCS for short.  During the class the application will be downloaded and presented to the participant, all details of the report will be explored and explained and participants will be shown how driver behaviour can contribute towards improved road safety.  International studies have shown that in-vehicle monitoring can help employers and at-work drivers to reduce their crash rates when driving for work.  Some studies have found that accident rates for vehicles fitted with a monitoring device reduced by 20%, while others found a reduction of 38% in collisions and the rate of specific unsafe driving behaviours was reduced by up to 82% in one case.</p> <p>  The most prominent issue that emerges from the research is the importance of feedback about the driving behaviour monitored by the technology.  Feedback is designed to raise awareness of the real way someone is driving and to highlight particular types of driving behaviour that may increase risk.  Many of the research studies that examine the role of feedback have found that simply providing access to feedback about a driver's behaviour is not enough to ensure that the driver views and considers it.  In order to obtain the best safety benefits from in-vehicle monitoring technology, it is important to deliver feedback mechanisms that encourage drivers and other relevant people to view and use the feedback and, in so doing, improve their behaviour.</p> <p>  To summarise, it is a classroom-based refresher course for fully licensed drivers with penalty points.  The application is downloaded to a smartphone.  There is regular feedback for the driver to show quality of driving and to reward improvement.  There is a penalty point credit for completion and proof of behavioural changes.  Finally, there is monitoring by the RSA.</p> <p>  The statistics of the cohort should be also made available for monitoring and research.  By monitoring we can show that we can modify, in a positive way, the behaviour of the driver to reduce the frequency and severity of collisions.</p> <p>  Again, we would like to thank the committee for the opportunity to present this proposal and will be happy to answer any questions members may wish to pose.</p></speech>

Also, I extend my sympathy to the family, friends and workmates of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick.  This has been the darkest day for Ireland's emergency services and I hope the missing crew members from the Coast Guard helicopter R116 are found soon.  Thank you, Chairman, for giving me the opportunity to say that.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses to the meeting.  I agree with some of the comments of Verona Murphy of the Irish Road Haulage Association.  In particular, the wearing of headphones by cyclists should be stopped as a matter of urgency.  I travel from Dundalk to the D&aacute;il regularly and I see the dangers that cyclists cause not only for themselves but also for other road users.  I also agree with Ms Murphy's statement that we must educate children from an early age about the rules of the road and, in particular, safe cycling practice.  Does the Irish Road Haulage Association have any data or statistics to highlight the dangers that poor cycling behaviour has caused for its members?</p></speech>

The new cycling Bill that is proposed is quite ridiculous legislation, not to mind the fact that it should be an Act as opposed to an amendment.  There is no comparison between cycling in rural Ireland and cycling in an urban area.  That law is impossible to enforce in an urban area and we will look even sillier than we are as it stands.  The provisions relating to cycling should remain around the safety of the cyclists from the perspective of protecting themselves with helmets, high-visibility jackets and so forth.  We understand that environmentally there is a need for increased cycling as opposed to use of the MPV but equally cyclists will take risks that we do not encourage and about which we can do nothing.  The visibility from a truck is restricted.  As Mr. Michael Moroney suggested, perhaps cyclists should undergo a course, be obliged to pass that course and be equally susceptible to penalty points for bad practices.</p></speech>

What would be the benefits of such a change?</p></speech>

Each module is different, but many of the modules are outdated and antiquated.  The content of the booklets that are provided to drivers is such that many of them spend most of the time ridiculing them because much of the mechanical emphasis is outdated and even no longer in existence.  They have difficulty with the fact that many of the trainers have no experience in the area in which they are delivering the course.  That is not in all cases but if the drivers want a question answered in respect of some of the courses in the modules, the person delivering the course must have either experience of driving a truck or experience in some shape or form in the commercial area.  If the driver cannot have a question answered, the deliverer is undermined straight away and interest is lost.  These courses are about updating the drivers, but there is not much updating if the content is antiquated.  I sat my CPC course in 1989 and the content being delivered today is still the same.</p> <p>  We have been seeking to have this overhauled for a long time.  In fairness, we had a meeting recently with Moyagh Murdock of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and she is quite interested.  In the UK, for example, this course can be constructed for any individual type of transport.  If one is a car carrier, one can devise one's own course pertinent to the profession for a person who is tying down and loading cars.  That can be passed by the Department for Transport and delivered specifically to meet the needs of the drivers.  That does not exist in Ireland.  The delivery is the same in that it is seven hours, but it is pertinent to the driver's practice.  That is very important.  At present, the Scania truck manufacturer offers a driver training course which costs &euro;350.  This is beneficial to the company, of course, in that the drivers will get the most from its vehicles, but it is also beneficial to the environment if the truck is being driven correctly in terms of carbon emissions and so forth.  Everybody benefits.  That should be regarded as a module.  It is about improvements in safety.  Other manufacturers are entitled to deliver the same courses.  There is no reason that something of that nature cannot be regarded as a module in the CPC.  It is professional competence.</p></speech>

I ask everybody to turn off their telephones because they interfere and make broadcasting difficult.  It makes repeat broadcasts of the meeting less likely.  It is in everybody's interest to ensure every telephone is turned off, as distinct from being in silent mode.</p></speech>

It is paramount and fundamentally important to road safety that a slower moving vehicle should not be permitted on the motorway.  That is the case all over Europe.  Michael Moroney referred to the UK.  The UK does not allow tractors on its motorways in any instance.  We are dictated to under regulation.  We cannot legally overtake on a motorway except at the discretion of a garda.  What is a HGV driver to do when driving at 80 km/h minimum or maximum speed if he arrives up behind a tractor that is supposed to be doing 50 km/h?  Our experience is that this is the maximum speed for these tractors in many cases.  There are exceptions, but they are not really agricultural vehicles.  Many of the agricultural tractors have a maximum speed of 50 km/h but that is without towing a trailer.  If the tractor is towing a trailer and comes to an incline, it cannot maintain that speed.  It is a highly dangerous practice.  Many incidents have been reported, some fatal and some near fatal.  The practice should stop.  I referred to arriving up behind one of them in fog or inclement weather conditions.  They are all supposed to have flashing lights.  What they are supposed to do and what the practice is are very different.  It is a huge road safety risk and it should be stopped.</p></speech>

If a driver spends nine hours of his day driving, the likelihood is that there are many instances in which he can incur penalty points.  Whether it is a camera or a roadside check for any type of infringement, he possibly can lose his licence on a trip from Cork to Dublin.  We do not advocate that this should be the case or that there should be bad practices but they are far more heavily regulated.  When young people get 12 points they will lose their licence.  That does not mean that they lose their job.  For many of them it means they cannot drive a car for social purposes.  They will get another job and somebody can drive them to work but the issue is what they do after work.  We have already requested that it might be possible to have the number of penalty points increased for the professional sector, but we have been told that this makes no sense as the professional driver should be more professional.  There are arguments for it in both spheres.  Unfortunately for us, the average age of our drivers is 55 years.  We have an apprenticeship programme developed and ready to go for the last 12 months but we have not received certification.  If we are going to put three years of effort into training drivers, we should at least be encouraged to get it under way when we are under this pressure.</p></speech>

What is the timeline for the introduction of the programme and will Ms Murphy elaborate further on the course?</p><p>I wish I could give the Deputy a timeline.  Unfortunately our programme is a very intense programme.  It is three years long.  It is provided and developed by the sectoral needs.  It covers every form of transport.  We have engaged with the RSA and the HSA.  The RSA through the NDLS has asked us to incorporate emergency response driving, which we are in the throes of doing.  This programme encompasses everything one could think of regarding haulage, including hauling cattle, milk, petroleum and meat.  Every form of haulage is incorporated in our programme and it will certainly make for safer, more professional drivers.</p><p> The current standard of driver undergoes probably 20 weeks training.  A person entering one of the current F&Aacute;S courses can have a professional HGV within 16 weeks.  However, that same driver in a truck that caries carcass beef - a swinging moveable load - knows nothing about keeping that load stable while going around a roundabout.  Our experience is that these courses do not provide HGV drivers.  We are being told that 174,000 people are on the dole, but none of them appears to have HGV licences.  It is very frustrating for us that we are under such pressure with our employment sector but cannot get the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to give us non-EU HGV driver permits.  There are drivers in other jurisdictions who drive on the same side of the road with the same language skill and yet we have a driver apprenticeship programme that we know will not turn out a driver until 2020 if it gets under way in September.  However, it is essential to the survival of the industry that that apprenticeship programme starts sooner rather than later.</p></speech>

Obviously, what they have done is presented the matters that are issues for them from a road safety point of view.  Having listened to them, there seems to be conflict between the various groups.  I might provoke a little bit of that.  The representatives of the agricultural contractors have stated that there was no consultation on many of the changes that have been introduced, which is unfair.</p><p>Have the agricultural contractors had any engagement with the RSA or the bodies since?  Did they get a good hearing or are the changes a <i>fait accompli</i>?  I refer back to the tractors on the motorways and the Garda interpretation for the contractors.  Is it illegal for drive on the hard shoulder to allow traffic to go by?  That is absolutely crazy if that is how the law is being implemented.  I have heard conflicting reports on whether it is acceptable to drive on the hard shoulder to allow traffic to pass.  It is important for us to clarify that because it seems like a solution.</p><p>What do the agricultural contractors think of the road hauliers saying that they should be banned from motorways?  I can see both points of view.  We need to arrive at a consensus that would be safe.</p><p>Mr. Harry Lee made an interesting presentation.  A &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme in the past year highlighted the issue of cars that were death traps being put back on the road.  Would his proposals eliminate that?  Is the issue solvable?  One would imagine that there would be a paper trail to show this, but obviously that is not the case.</p></speech>

We only became aware of it a number of weeks ago.  It is due to be transposed into Irish law by 20 May, which is less than ten weeks away.  In that period there has been no consultation with any organisation involved in agriculture.  We have requested a meeting but we have not had a meeting so far.  We feel it is unfair that we did not have an opportunity to have the same level of discussion as we had with the RSA and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport over a lengthy period on the review of the agricultural specifications with regard to tractors and trailers, which was a really useful process.  It took a bit of time, but the end result was a document that has been very useful to our members and has been very useful in enforcing proper and sensible legislation as it would apply to our industry.  That has been missing in this case and that is why we made that point.  It is only ten weeks until it is to be transposed into Irish law under the regulation.</p> <p>  We do not have an issue with slow-speed vehicles such as tractors not being allowed on a motorway.  We are aware that there have been some incidents involving tractors and trailers.  However, in some cases it was not a tractor responsibility; there were other issues attached to that.</p> <p>  The use of hard shoulders is a thorny issue.  In one case a contractor was driving a butterfly mower - quite a big mower - front and back kit.  In order to allow proper movement of traffic, the driver pulled into the hard shoulder.  He continued to drive slowly for a period.  However, in that queue of cars was a squad car and he was given two penalty points as a result.  The converse of it was a man in another county who did not move in to the hard shoulder and caused a significant tailback.  This incident happened in Senator O'Mahony's county.  That person received penalty points for careless driving.  Those are the contradictions with regard to the hard shoulders.  We would like to get clarification on the matter.</p></speech>

There is no proper history for the majority of vehicles on our roads where there are issues.  We need to take the first step towards the end goal of having a central database where all work carried out on all vehicles is documented.  The first step should be write-offs, because some legislation and building blocks are already there.  At the moment only As and Bs are recommended to be sent to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, but that is not necessarily where the majority of the problems are.  They are also in Cs and Ds.  In addition we must also consider the number of vehicles that do not go through insurance or through the self-insured.  There are no guidelines or legislation outlining the process of what should happen when these cars are in this situation.</p> <p>  At the moment if a vehicle is written off by an insurance company and I am requested to go out and ensure it is roadworthy, I do not know the reason the vehicle was written off in the first place.  Sometimes vehicles from outside the industry can pass through many hands without any ownership paper trail whatsoever.  When someone like me comes along, we do not know what has happened.  That applies to the majority of vehicles across the board, but especially with second-hand imports.  Some figures suggest 10% of vehicles from the UK alone are write-offs.</p><p>Again, there is no paper trail.  There is an expectation on the owner to be an expert in these things, but that is not possible given the way the vehicles are moving from a technological and a design point of view.  It is not possible, even for some of us within the industry, to be an expert on everything.  I believe the building blocks are there to put something in place.  This would be a first step.  I suggest that if we take the first step, that can lead on to something proper.</p></speech>

In the case of the M3 near Kells, drivers who are not allowed on motorways can go only half way around the town on the bypass.  The council handed over a section of the Kells bypass to the motorway authorities so that it would not have to maintain it.  As a result, those of us who drive combines or wide vehicles have to go through the town.  We should be able to use the bypass, which is two miles longer, to go around the town.  I believe the bypasses in Kells and some other areas should be retained for use by wide vehicles.  If there is a bypass around a town, in the interests of safety it should be available to all drivers to keep certain vehicles out of the town centre.</p></speech>

I suggest that if the sugar beet industry was still in operation, we would see a bit more blood and bandage between the tractor operators and the lorry drivers.  Issues like road safety and hedge cutting have been mentioned.  Cyclists are becoming more common on our roads.  There has been an increase in paperwork.  We have heard from the Irish Road Haulage Association about CPC courses, etc.  A person who decides to become a lorry driver is out of pocket by almost &euro;5,000 by the time he or she has the full qualifications to drive a lorry.  I welcome the EU directive that has ensured that road driving qualifications from other countries are now recognised in this country.  I am concerned about the language barriers in some cases.  When our enforcement officers pull over a haulier who is a foreign national and there is a language barrier, how do they go about ensuring he or she is fully qualified?  Will Ms Murphy tell us whether there are mechanisms in place to deal with such problems if they arise on site?</p> <p>  I have concerns about good manners on the roads.  I might have to contact the farm operators about this issue.  Outside the motorways, our roads are not big enough to carry heavy goods vehicles.  This often causes frustration among drivers.  It has been suggested that the drivers of heavy goods vehicles should pull inside the yellow line, but there are roads that do not have a yellow line for them to do this.  I mentioned the sugar beet industry because I remember that when I was a county councillor, we were unable to get a dual carriageway so we asked the council to provide lay-bys at regular intervals along the N72 and N73 so that heavy goods vehicles could pull in to allow faster moving traffic to pass by.  I am trying to say that drivers should show goodwill by pulling in where that is possible.  It is understandable that there are places where drivers cannot pull in, but they should do so where that is possible.  It is up to the Minister to provide good roads and to ensure good surfaces are in place.</p> <p>  I do not intend to ask too many questions, but I would like to raise an unrelated matter.  A new regulation that was introduced last year to specify the tonnage that a lorry can carry was based on the number of axles on each lorry.  Perhaps Ms Murphy would like to elaborate on this issue.  Who determines how safe a vehicle is when it is on the road?  Who makes a determination with regard to factors like tonnage and laden weight when loads are being carried?  The day of a Fordson Major pulling a small single-axle silage trailer is well gone.  We are on the same roads.  I am talking about road safety.  Maybe Mr. Farrell and Mr. Lee should be asking questions of the other witnesses who are here today.  They are making a case for a way to improve road safety.  I ask them to comment on the submissions we have received from the contractors and the road hauliers.  Have they found any flaws in those submissions?</p></speech>

I welcome all our visitors and thank them for their excellent presentations.  I put it to Mr. Lee that I do not understand the definition of a "write-off".  Two of my vehicles have been written off through no fault of my own.  Am I wrong in my understanding that if a car is written off, it is chopped up for spare parts and never gets on the road again?  Is a write-off just some actuarial term?  I ask Mr. Lee to respond to that question.  I was struck by the statistic that 10% of cars imported from the UK are problematic from an insurance point of view.  I might not have the right terminology, but I think Mr. Lee knows what I mean.  I would like him to expand on this striking statistic.  I also understand that large numbers of damaged and repaired vehicles are returning to the road without documentation to confirm the status of those vehicles.  Mr. Lee might elaborate on that when he gets a chance.</p> <p>  I agree with most of the points made by Ms Murphy in her excellent presentation.  I think her proposal regarding the use of headphones by cyclists is a no-brainer.  I would like to mention one of two bugbears of my own in relation to the drivers of trucks, lorries and articulated vehicles.  I do a lot of driving around the country.  If I am driving on the inside lane of a two-lane carriageway in an urban environment, the driver of a big articulated vehicle on my outside might need to turn left.  I understand his problem because he has to stay in the outside lane to get traction to make the turn.  Has the cyclist or the driver on the inside any rights at all in such circumstances?  Is it a case of might is right?  I have witnessed some pretty scary situations when the drivers of big articulated vehicles assumed there was nobody inside them as they turned left.  I would also like to mention that big lorries on motorways tend to hog the crown of the road, especially in bad weather.  This means that a car overtaking such a vehicle has a very small avenue for the manoeuvre.  It can be very intimidating for a driver in such circumstances to have a lorry to the left, probably throwing up every kind of spray, and more often than not a concrete carriageway divider to the right.  Why do big articulated vehicles tend to hog the crown of the road?  It seems to me that the carriageway is wide enough.  Ms Murphy might explain that.</p> <p>  I would like to hear the views of the FCI on what Ms Murphy said about tractors on motorways.  Would the farm contractors share her opinion?  I am not trying to get a row going here or anything.  I am just wondering what they think.  The FCI is seeking an exemption from the proposed NCT for tractors.  I would like to hear the logic behind that.  We are all buying into high standards of road safety.  I do not really understand the FCI's argument in this respect.</p></speech>

He will be followed by Ms Murphy and the representatives of the FCI.  I am not sure if there were any questions for Mr. Farrell or Ms Kinnarney.</p></speech>

It is a financial term.  In my opinion, it has nothing to do with the motor industry.  It gives no indication of the damage caused to a vehicle and therefore no indication of the repairs needed to return the vehicle to the road.</p><p>When I began working on this four years ago, I asked people both inside and outside the industry their understanding of the term "write-off" and the majority of them, including, sadly, many within the industry, believed that the term "write-off" meant that it was very badly damaged in regard to structure and chassis damage and therefore should not go back on the road, but it has nothing to do with the damage.  It only has to do with cost.  There are cases where vehicles are write-offs and they are still roadworthy.  That is in contrast to the belief that they are not, and it is one of the reasons I believe we need to change our terminology and our categories so that we have categories that reflect the damage and therefore reflect the repairs that are necessary to make these cars safe again.  Just because a vehicle is badly damaged does not mean it cannot be repaired.  Vehicles are designed to be repaired in many cases.  We just need an infrastructure in place that allows them to be repaired correctly and the correct documentation stating that the vehicle has been repaired correctly and is safe to go back on the road.</p><p> On the 10%, which is one of the figures for the imports from the United Kingdom, which are write-offs, that is not necessarily an issue but because there is no paper trail in terms of documentation, I believe it is open for the vehicles that are not safe to come into the country.  They should not be brought in and we need some mechanism in place that stops that happening.  I believe all vehicles that are imported should be tested.  Ms Verona Murphy has just informed me that all commercial vehicles that are imported are tested.  We should be looking at that for non-commercial vehicles.  I believe the Road Safety Authority, RSA, through the national car test, NCT, would have a big part to play in that regard.</p><p> Regarding documentation for write-offs, there is some documentation but there are no set rules.  When there is documentation on vehicles being repaired, much of it is private.  It is my opinion, based on my experience, that should be public.  If an engineer goes out and inspects a vehicle, there should be a report that follows that vehicle, especially when it is a write-off.  Even if it is still an economic repair but there are safety and structural repairs, there should be a vehicle report that goes with that vehicle.  When it is ready to go back on the road, therefore, the person who will sign off on that, whether it is someone like myself as an assessor or somebody in the garage, the insurance company, the fleet company, will have something to refer back to, but there is no paper trail.  There are issues with data protection.  What I am talking about is just a report on the vehicle and the damage.  I believe if one of them is designed and brought in as the rule for everything, it sets a high standard in terms of repairing vehicles and getting them back on the road.  That would go a long way to ensuring that our cars are safe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.673" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Verona Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017032200002#L00200"><p>To answer Senator O'Sullivan's questions on cyclists, it is not about the right of either the cyclist or the truck driver.  It is about a mutual understanding and respect of road use.  That is the conundrum.  Cyclists undergo no formal training.  They learn to ride a bike and that is more or less it for the rest of their lives.  A truck driver will be shown how to take that manoeuvre to the left from day one.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport reduced our carrying capacity from 42 tonnes to 40 tonnes on a five axle vehicle.  The hope was that would put six axle vehicles on the road carrying six tonnes.  In terms of the manoeuvrability of a six axle vehicle in comparison to a five axle vehicle, they would be miles apart.  We do not have the possibility of doing it any other way but if the cyclist had undergone any type of formal training, he or she would understand the manoeuvre in the same way that the truck driver only has the traffic light system to complete the manoeuvre.  The cyclist can stay back and let him complete his manoeuvre.  They should have respect for one another.  Alternatively, what would happen is that the cyclist may be knocked down because of poor visibility.</p> <p>  There is a huge disparity in terms of what can be seen, but we cannot dictate which are which with regard to left hand drive and right hand drive trucks.  If a left hand drive truck comes into the country, it is normally of foreign registration.  All my trucks are left hand drive because I predominantly work on the Continent and it was for easy access to toll booths when they were in being.  The manoeuvre is taken in proper fashion but it is generally the cyclist who does not understand the manoeuvre.  It is about safety and respect for one another.  We have nothing against cyclists.  We want all cyclists to be highly visible.  It is not just cyclists that we do not want to wear headphones.  We do not believe any road user should wear a headphone, whether they are a pedestrian on a leisurely walk or whatever.  In France and the rest of Europe, one will receive a &euro;1,000 fine for the use of headphones while operating a mechanically propelled vehicle.  That should not be any different from operating one on the general roadway</p> <p>  With regard to overtaking in inclement weather conditions, it is very frustrating.  I have had experience of that and it is more about one's own judgment.  I do not believe drivers hog the white line on dual carriageways.  The problem is the size of their wheels versus what we are used to but in inclement conditions that does not matter.  If there is heavy rain, it is always safer to err on the side of caution.  The driver is probably maintaining his proper speed.  He is not doing anything wrong but the size of his wheel in comparison to the amount of water that is being thrown up makes it highly dangerous, and it takes great experience to overtake a truck of that size while driving in inclement weather conditions.  It is better to arrive alive.  I have often sat behind a truck for 40 km or 50 km in inclement weather conditions for the sake of not being able to overtake and see where I am going.  Again, it is about mutual respect for all road users.  Environmentally, cyclists are encouraged in cities throughout the world.  We have no difficulty with that but there needs to be an understanding of the manoeuvre that driver is making and, equally, that the cyclist is the smaller of the two road users.  There is nothing we can do.  We have all the requirements of DOE testing, which is to a very high standard.  We are held to account.  There is no longer any slippage in this area whereby one might get away with this or that.  Our standards are extremely high.  They are set down by the RSA and the CVRT DOE centres and if one does not have the requirement, one does not pass the test.</p> <p>  I had a gentleman with an 03 registration truck complain to me the other day.  The manufacturer's mirror that was fitted in 2003 was still on that truck but the standard has since changed, and it is on the basis of vision regarding pedestrians and cyclists.  He was aggrieved that he had to change and update the standard of the mirror because it was a manufactured mirror but that is how we evolve.  This is how road safety works.  Standards change, and it is costly to comply.  I do not see that costly updated vehicles are any different.  They are all subject to wear and tear.  They are all in need of maintenance and roadside checks but as Deputy O'Keeffe said, those roadside checks should not take place on roadways with speed limits of 100 km or more.  I have spoken to the RSA and have been diligently told that it is An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na which dictates where a roadside check takes place.  In no country in Europe will we see a roadside check on a motorway.  One will be diverted off the motorway but one will not see a check carried out on the M1, the N9, the M9 or any of those motorways.  Equally, one will not see tractors on motorways but one will see them in Ireland.  That amuses our European counterparts when it comes to road safety and road standards.</p></speech>

We are clear about that in terms of road safety issues.  We have a positive, supportive attitude towards road safety and we encourage our drivers to be alert to all the other road users.</p> <p>  On the tractor NCT issue, we have bought into road safety but in this situation there is no transparency or consultation whatsoever on it, and no information.  We do not even know at this stage the tractors to which this applies.</p><p>On that basis, if we cannot get that information, we have to seek an exemption so we can make a decision when we have the information.  No information has been flowing from the Road Safety Authority, RSA, as to the detail of this, despite numerous requests.</p><p> This impacts on our members to a great extent.  On average, our contractor fleet is more modern than the typical tractor fleet.  We have in the region of 68,000 tractors registered annually.  They pay road tax annually.  Of that number, close to 20,000 are in contractor fleets and they are predominantly more modern, better serviced tractors.  Contractors will typically carry out their own servicing in the off season at this time of the year.  If we get a wet day like today, there is very little activity on the land so most of the guys who work for contractors are in the workshops servicing machines to make sure that, when the weather is good, they do not have any downtime.  There is a huge level of self-assessment in regard to safety, which is a huge priority.  Contractors are employers and they have requirements under the terms of the employment Acts and health and safety regulations.  They make a huge effort to ensure their staff and drivers operate equipment that is safe and roadworthy at all times.</p><p> The reason we are looking for the exemption is that, without information, it is difficult for us to say we should go forward because we do not know what we are going forward with.</p></speech>

Many of our people are trained and training is available.  Most staff have lorry licences, but the biggest problem a contractor has is that when he gets a driver a lorry licence, the driver is gone to the hauliers.  We are no different from the hauliers.  There is a big scarcity of help.  No young lad wants to come contracting due to the unsocial hours.  We need something to try to keep these people in rural Ireland and to get them working.  There should be no reason for unemployment for young lads in rural Ireland because there is plenty of work in the agri sector.</p> <p>  Tractor tickets are available and it is probably costing &euro;2,000 per man each year to get those tickets for driving and doing the work.  We are not much different from the hauliers.  We have tickets and we have training facilities.  There is a lot of expense and it is more the case that people do not know the training is available.  We signed up last year for a training course for our tractor drivers and it was launched at our conference last year.  This means that operators know they are not just sitting up on a tractor and driving it.  Drivers need to be trained because our tractors and machines are so costly.  We would like support from the Government to try to get a training programme and apprenticeships going so that, when people have three years done on a machine, they have a ticket to show they are competent drivers.</p></speech>

He said the tractors need to be in top condition and, therefore, need to be exempt from an NCT.  Is this a self-assessment process and what checks and tests are carried out?  Why does Mr. Moroney think it would be justified for contractor-owned tractors to be exempt from an NCT on the basis of road safety?</p> <p>  Mr. Moroney raised the issue of cyclists and the 1.5 m overtaking limit.  Why does he feel this would not be enforceable for tractors?  While he has outlined the problems, does he believe it could be enforceable for tractors?</p> <p>  Mr. Lee referred to automotive assessors.  As he is aware, under the new road traffic legislation that has been brought in to cover write-offs, motor insurers are compelled to notify about all domestic write-offs so the records can be locked down and further circulation of the vehicle prevented.  Is Mr. Lee suggesting the legislation is insufficient?  He said the term "write-off" was a financial term and does not define what most people would term a write-off.  Based on what Mr. Lee said, this legislation is not fit for purpose in regard to domestic write-offs.  I would like clarity on that point.</p> <p>  Were there consultations with the Minister or the Department in the run-up to the new legislation coming in?  Did the Minister take on board the concerns and what was the outcome?</p> <p>  The training and re-education programme was raised by Mr. Farrelly.  What is the proposed length of time for the monitoring period and have the proposals been costed?  Reference was made to a smartphone.  Is the onus on the person to have the smartphone, and if they do not have one, what happens?  Has there been any feedback from the National Transport Authority, NTA, the RSA or the Department on the proposals and has the association been in contact with them?  Would it be compulsory or voluntary for drivers with six penalty points?  Is the carrot the fact two penalty points will be dropped?  In particular, I would like to know what consultation the association has had and whether this has been costed.</p></speech>

We do not have the necessary information, we do not know what is coming down the line and there has been no consultation on the matter with bodies like ours which have a high proportion of tractors that could be liable to be tested because they are on the road to a greater extent.  That is predominantly the reason.</p> <p>  We are very much in favour of road safety.  The Deputy asked what tests are carried out.  Tests will be carried out daily by contractors on their tractors to make sure they achieve the maximum efficiency.  In typical silage-making operations, a silage contractor wants to achieve somewhere in the region of 100 acres of silage harvested per day.  The weakest link in that is the machine.  Everything has to be running perfectly to achieve that level of output, which is necessary to achieve a proper level of turnover and the minimum level of profitability.  It is a very price-conscious sector and legitimate organised contractors need to achieve a high level of throughput.  That can only be achieved if machines are in top order.  Their priority every single day the tractor goes out is that it must be able to perform to its best.  During any downtime that is available due to weather and so on, the equipment is constantly maintained and kept up to date if the opportunity presents.</p> <p>  If we look at the number of non-road related accidents that take place on farms, we see that 50% of fatalities are related to tractors and machinery, but a very small percentage of those are contractor machinery and most are related to non-contractor operated equipment.  We are delighted to say that.  It is a justification for saying that the equipment is safe and there is no specific requirement for an NCT for tractors, particularly when we have not been made aware of the details of such an NCT.  We do not know what is involved and there has been no consultation, which we consider very unfair to the people it has a significant impact on.</p> <p>  On the issue of overtaking-----</p></speech>

The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  If one looks at European or Irish statistics, the number of tractors involved in road collisions is 1% or less in both Europe and Ireland.  Generally speaking, rather than looking at a paper trail, the real proof is what happens on the ground.  That is that tractors are involved in such a small number of road collisions and are responsible for such a small number of casualties that it is a reflection-----</p></speech>

Speed is a major contributor to accidents and tractors are low speed vehicles.  That would lower the percentage automatically.  I am not arguing that point, I am just asking Mr. Moroney why contractor-owned tractors and other tractors should be exempt from an NCT when all other motorised vehicles have to comply with it, particularly given that tractor owners self-assess their tractors and there is no basis for monitoring that?</p></speech>

We do not know what the NCT for a tractor will be because the RSA has not told us.  It has not been agreed what a roadworthiness test for a tractor will be in Europe.  I do not want to go into technical matters in too much detail but some of these need to be addressed, such as the brake testing of an agricultural tractor compared to a truck.  If the technical matters are not addressed, we are looking at a Bill being passed into law without knowing what its impact is going to be.  We know that the impact in terms of accidents is quite small.  This is within the group that does not require a roadworthiness test at the moment.</p></speech>

By doing this we are not improving road safety.  According to the statistics, contractors' tractors are not the ones in the accidents.  It is the older, poorer condition tractors that are in accidents.  Bringing in a road test for 40 kph plus tractors does not make sense when statistics show probably 90% of accidents involve the other tractors.  The contractors' tractors' involvement is very limited.  If insurance companies are asked what tractors are in accidents, they will say it is slower-moving tractors.</p> <p>  Most of these crashes happen when a tractor is coming out of a junction or coming out of a gateway from a field.   To improve safety we need to address the causes of these 99 % of accidents.  Safety can simply be improved by cutting the hedges so the driver can see.  Hedges within 180 m of exits are supposed to be cut.  Tractor drivers are limited because they cannot cut them to see out.  If the Deputy looks at statistics or goes to insurance companies she will see that coming out of entrances where the driver cannot see down the road is where most tractor accidents take place.  The NCT is not going to improve our road safety.  Our issue is that we should improve road safety in whatever way we can improve it and that is visibility.  It does not matter whether it is a lorry or a car.  If a lorry goes down the road and the tractor driver can see round the corners and see the vehicle coming, that is the easiest and most cost-effective way of improving our roads.  </p> <p>  These proposals are hitting tractors that are not in the accident system at the moment.</p></speech>

The term "write-off" covers all write-offs.  From an engineering point of view, the titles usually used are end of life vehicle, now commonly known as the category As or Bs, which are vehicles that are not to go back on the road under any circumstances.  Then there are the Cs and Ds, which are beyond economic repair.  No vehicle in category A or B goes back on the road.  As far as I understand, the Department has been told to lock these down.  Within the C and D categories there are a lot of structurally-damaged and unsafe vehicles that need to be repaired.  That is where the problems happen.  Those vehicles go back out in the market or into the trade and there is nothing to ensure that the person who repairs them knows they have to get it back to a certain standard.  It is just not there.  The current idea of sending As and Bs to be checked to see if they are fit for purpose is not sufficient.  The first step, which can be taken straight away, is to have the insurance companies forward the Cs and Ds and we can deal with them.  That could be expanded in the future until it just comes down to the ones that need to be inspected afterwards to receive a report to say it can go back on the road.  Not all of them need a full engineer's report.</p> <p>  As I said earlier, many vehicles do not go through the insurance process.  There are a lot of benefits to a vehicle going through the insurance process.  It changes the attitude of people repairing them because they know there may be somebody coming behind and checking their work.  However, when it just goes out on its own there is nothing there to ensure that it is properly maintained.  There are a lot of garages and repairers who are doing a great job and doing it properly.  They are not where the problems are.  The problems are elsewhere.  Some of these people do not realise what they should be doing and some, I am sorry to say, do not care.  We need a structure in place to ensure that when these vehicles go back on the road, which happens quite often, they are in a safe and roadworthy condition.</p> <p>  I have not consulted with anyone else.  In previous years I was in contact with the Road Safety Authority and such agencies.  I have been working on today's issues for the past couple of years and I have not directly consulted with anyone.</p></speech>

I will let Ms Kinnarney deal with a couple of parts and I will deal with the rest of them.</p> <p>  Deputy Munster asked about the monitoring.  It has to be a reasonable period of time to make it attractive to people.  If a person has accumulated points over, say, three years, and the accumulation is six or eight points, two or three or four of which are due to run out within 12 months, one could see a position where a person would decide just to let it run out.  There is no attraction there.  We see it as somewhere between three to six months.  Around three months would be the monitoring period.</p> <p>  There are two parts to the costing question.  Because the RSA has protocols in place for dealing with certificates of professional competence and professional drivers' accreditation and reportage they have the systems in place to handle the reports and to send out the penalty points.  From our point of view there will be minimum cost.  </p> <p>  We are currently speaking to a number of people about the big imponderable, which is the app and its cost.  This includes the reporting structure and all the stuff tied in to that.  While it is a simple concept, it involves how the app feeds back to one's phone and reports back to the phone.  That is a bit of a grey area at the moment and is being discussed with a number of people.  </p> <p>  We know the RSA has been given our initial proposal and more recent, updated one.  It has written back through a Deputy to say it is very interested.  We have not yet met with its representatives but we would love to do so.  </p> <p>  I will leave Ms Kinnarney to talk about the smartphone and compulsory or voluntary part of the-----</p></speech>

In some parts of the UK there is compulsory training whereby drivers are requested, on foot of continuous infringements, to retrain.  We would envisage that training here would be compulsory so drivers would have an opt-in choice in the context of whether they want to do it.  If drivers want points to remain on their licences, they can do so and then allow them to run out after a three-year period.  As stated, it would be an opt-in and drivers would take ownership and responsibility for what they have done and, therefore, they would choose to undergo training to improve their driving.</p> <p>  To reiterate what Mr. Farrell stated, as with the current essential driver training, EDT, syllabus, the ADI unit has facilities.  The driver details are logged on the RSA portal.  That means each individual lesson is logged, individual drivers can access the portal and they are also given feedback on their reports.  The training provider can also access the portal to see what areas have been covered.  In the context of it being compulsory, the onus would be on a driver to take responsibility for what he or she has done and re-educate himself or herself.  From the ages of 17 to 70, unless it is in a professional capacity, there is no retraining for drivers.</p> <p>  Our training would also complement what is being discussed here today.  At present, the RSA approvers ADI instructors to train young trained drivers to attain category B licences.  ADI instructors only holds category B licences.  We propose that our trainers would hold category B licences plus licences to drive trucks or buses in order that they might become educated as to the capabilities of work vehicles and HGVs on the road.  In my opinion, and from what I have learned from delivering training for the driver certificate of professional competence, CPC, the trainer also needs to have that experience.  As Ms Murphy said earlier, some trainers do not have the qualification.  I am of the view that training needs to be put in place to re-educate car drivers and educate them on what happens on roads and on how work vehicles and HGVs work and their capabilities.  A car driver will not understand what happens when a large vehicle turns left because he or she may not have been told about it when he or she was taught to drive.  The voluntary aspect would be that the onus should be on the driver to undergo training in order to re-educated.</p></speech>

There is an issue with defining what constitutes agricultural use and commercial use.  Farm contractors operate in the agricultural sector for commercial reasons hence the definition will have an impact.  If, for example, a farmer has a tractor that is exempt from testing because it is being used for agricultural purposes or if one is a contractor that does some non-agricultural work, the vehicle does not suddenly change.  It is still a tractor but because it is on a farm it may be exempt but a tractor in a contractor's fleet will not be exempt.  That situation is completely unfair in terms of competition law.</p></speech>

I have looked into this matter a small bit.  The first point I would make relates to the laws that are coming in.  I have a major problem with some of the stuff that the RSA is trying to introduce and with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport due to a lack of clarity about certain matters.  I agree with what has just been proposed.</p> <p>  What activity does the RSA define as being commercial in nature, as opposed to an activity carried out by a farmer?  A silage contractor on hire can deliver silage to a farmer and does not need to have had a roadworthiness test carried out on his vehicle.  If he hitches a trailer to his tractor and brings cattle to the mart for the same farmer, then he will need a roadworthiness certificate.  This is despite the fact that he is using the same tractor.  The law, as it stands, is an ass.  The directive was transposed into law in 2011 and it must be enforced from next year.</p> <p>  If I rip the seat out of a tractor and ask my 16 year old young fella to drive it, then he can drive it on the road.  If I have a seat in the tractor, I must pay another person to drive it if my young fella only holds a provisional licence.  This shows the stupidity of what is being put in place.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on these issues.</p> <p>  Hedges are a major problem.  I wish to refer to another law that has been introduced.  I live 31 miles from Tuam.  If I want to bring cattle to the mart in Tuam, I am obliged to install a tachograph on my tractor when I am 30 miles from the town.  This is just because I am 1 mile way from the 50 km limit.  I have to do this just to bring my cattle to a mart.  I spoke to the former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, about this matter and he said that it would be considered by his Department.  I do not wish to criticise him but the Department has not considered the matter.  If I want to haul a few bales and I travel 61 or 62 miles - and in the west one might need to travel that distance to collect a load of bales - one needs to install a tachograph after 100 km.  There was scope to extend the distance to 250 km and to 150 km in respect of cattle.  If that was done, we could have complied with EU law but, unfortunately, we did not listen to the proposal.</p> <p>  My next question is for the FCI and Ms Murphy.  I have a major problem with the fact that money has been thrown at the RSA.  Do the witnesses think that instruction on how to ride a motorbike or drive a car or tractor should be introduced for transition year students in second-level education?  Some Oireachtas committee should make the proposal.  I am not a member of this committee and I thank the Chairman for affording me an opportunity to speak.  Should we have a scheme whereby a person could get 20 points or whatever if he or she does X amount driver training during transition year  Such an initiative would ensure people learned what happens to a person cycling a bicycle on the inside lane when a lorry turns left.  Lord God, it is terrible to think about what happens on the roads at times.</p> <p>  I worry about Ms Murphy's call for tractors to be banned.  It is fine if people want to ban them but what should be done with 75 year old people who drive their cars at 30 mph and cause long tailbacks?  This would drive a person mad at times but does Ms Murphy want to ban them from driving as well?  Such people are allowed to drive their cars on motorways.</p></speech>

I understood that all English vehicles coming into this country can be checked for A, B, C and D and to see if they were hit.  Am I correct?  I understand that such cases require an NCT and that one cannot register an English vehicle and drive it here if the vehicle does not have a NCT certificate.  I also understand that one can draw insurance on anything that gets hit here.  When one looks for insurance, the insurance companies have all of the data relating to a vehicle.</p><p>I presume the NCT people know their job as they are qualified mechanics.  I would imagine that if they were doing an NCT, they would know.  Is the FCI trying to make more paperwork and more work for its own people?</p><p> I have driven lorries and have done the driver certificate of professional competence, CPC, and, to be frank, I knew more than those who were training me.  There is frustration among lorry drivers when the person testing them as na leabhair.  Always remember that word.  Many people have read the book but to do it in practice is different.  There is a major problem with CPC courses.  I believe France is not doing it and their youth have been told to go where the sun does not shine, as I heard the other day.  The courses here need a revamp.  If a person wants to do five days in a row over the five years, he or she should be allowed to do it that way.  Currently, if a person wants to do that, he or she must call the RSA and give this bullshit story that he or she could not do it the other way and then do two together.  A person should be able to do the five days if he or she wants to do so.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.711" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richard White" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017032200002#P00700"><p>I will reply to Deputy Fitzmaurice's statement about transition year students.  It would be a great idea and we should start as soon as is humanly possible.  In terms of the younger people who work on contractors' outfits, I see that there is a lack of drivers' safety awareness.  To be fair, if they have attended agricultural college, we know that they have had safety beaten into them since the day they went in.  The people who have not gone to agricultural college, however, and who come to a contractor looking for a summer job for six to eight weeks present the biggest problem of all in terms of the lack of safety awareness around agricultural machinery and vehicles.  The problem for the contractor is the high risk because the contractor becomes the trainer as well as being the employer.  The training should have started in school and transition year is a great place to do that.  There should be more connection between rural businesses and the schools and we need to do that going forward to bring up the skills base.</p></speech>

My only argument would be that it should start a lot earlier.  This would be presuming that everybody is going to drive a car or ride a bicycle.  That is not the case in urban areas but in the same vein there is a huge disparity understanding how a mechanically propelled vehicle operates, be it a car or a heavy goods vehicle, in comparison to pedestrian or cyclist safety awareness.  If a driver of a vehicle uses a mobile phone it incurs penalty points because it is a huge safety risk.  If a pedestrian steps off the footpath with a mobile phone in his or her hand while Googling or reading texts it is not an offence.  It should be an offence because the person is in the public area, whether driving or otherwise.  Everybody has to have respect for what he or she does on the roads.</p> <p>  I really want this committee to look at the issue of hedges.  There is no disparity between us and the forestry and agricultural contractors around road safety.  We want the same thing.  NCT, road haulage licences and one versus the other are all competitive issues and we can deal with them outside this arena.  Hedge cutting, however, is a basic fact of road safety.  It is the easiest measure to administer.  The county councils have the power.  Whether or not they have the money or the wherewithal to go after the landowner is another thing.  It is the primary cause of most road accidents in rural Ireland.  It has not been mentioned much today.  The height of a mirror of a truck tractor or a bus is 4 m.  There is no height requirement in the legislation.  It should be best practice and it should be practical in application.  The county manager in Wexford is a very proactive individual.  Last week they cut hedging in Wexford under the special provision of road safety, which was outside the hedge cutting period.  It can be done as it is already regulated for.  The law is there so it should be used.</p></speech>

I would add that it gives far more protection in the winter period because it means dryer roads that are less likely to have frost, etc.  If the hedges are maintained there is less overhang, less shadow and it is safer for every road user.</p></speech>

This is an area on which we need clarification in terms of how we get the definition for what is commercial and what is agricultural.  We are fairly clear about what land-based contractors are, what they do and what our members do, such as providing mechanisation and skilled services, etc. for financial reward.</p></speech>

A man in Mayo received seven penalty points, a man in Tipperary received two points and a man in Mullingar got two points for pulling in to allow traffic to pass by.

That is a big problem.  We hear that the councils can go ahead with cutting if they believe the hedges are unsafe but Longford County Council was in court over it.  The contractor was fined &euro;3,500 as was the council.  I was in court because I cut hedges outside a football pitch to make it safe.  The law is there to allow hedges be cut but the law is not working.  Only 4% of hedges are on roadsides, so there are plenty of other places in the fields for birds to live.  All hedges that need cutting for road safety should be cut.  We would have less of the leaves, debris and hassle that we see with stormy weather.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify this.  Everyone is fond of exams and getting people to press buttons and answer questions.  At the end of the day, there are some people driving, as Ms Verona Murphy mentioned, who are 55 years and over.  Some of those people could be the best drivers in the world and be doing things right.  However, they may not have had the opportunity that the witness or other people might have had of getting an education to be able to read and write very well.  I have put proposals forward for the trailer licence process in order to replace this thing of putting them into the back of a lorry and pressing buttons.  I have put proposals forward that the applicants would be at Mondello Park or somewhere where they can drive, turn and twist a trailer.  This is why the academic side is so much about exams.  There are exams for everything.  They are sat down to write it down and they are made to sweat.  Until the day comes that we have more of an apprentice system with people and work with them that way, we will never achieve road safety.</p></speech>

I wish to focus on Mr. Lee's presentation, which was alarming in showing the headline figures in terms of the 10% of insurance write-offs.  It is good to get clarity on what a write-off is.  I thought the presentation was comprehensive and interesting.  With regard to the presentation of Mr. Farrell and Ms Kinnarney, it was clear that there has been a sharp increase in terms of road fatalities, unfortunately, from 2015 to 2016, as well as the evolution of road safety methods.  We have to get into a situation in which some aspect of lifelong learning is introduced into road safety.  In every other sector nowadays, there is some aspect of lifelong learning coming into it.  The fact that it is non-compulsory can be a huge incentive for people to take an interest in it.  Obviously, if someone has a driver's licence over a 53-year period or got the licence in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s or whatever decade, there have been evolving safety issues over that time.  I wish to ask Mr. Farrell about incentives for people who may do the course.  If there is a headline figure of approximately 61,000 drivers on six or more penalty points, are there any incentives for those in terms of insurance value?  Has the witness been talking to any insurance companies in terms of assessing whether there could be an incentive?  We know that the cost of insurance has gone up largely over the last number of years but is there a benefit in that role?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.752" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017032200002#Q01300"><p>With regard to incentive from an insurance company's point of view, if one has no points on one's licence, one is charged a figure.  With two points, that figure increases.  It increases proportionately for four and six points.  What also happens in insurance is that one will have difficulty getting alternative quotes.  If one is with a particular company and one's insurance is annually renewed with it, the company is quite happy when the driver has no points and other companies are quite happy to quote against it.  It gives the driver the chance of getting a competitive rate, for want of a better word.</p> <p>  If the driver accumulates points, two things happen.  One is that the driver is not as liable to get a quote from a competitor.  The second thing is that the driver's existing insurance company treats the driver as an increased risk.  Obviously, the driver has more offences and is seen as an increased risk on the road.  Therefore, it will increase the premium.  Premiums were increased from last year to this year.  There is a committee in the Oireachtas looking at that at the moment.  Anything that helps to bring that back down is a good thing.  Therefore, if the driver takes our proposal by which he or she undertakes monitoring and a class, at the end of that period, by showing the company that the driver was monitored and has a reduction in points, he or she obviously comes back into a position in which he or she can look for competitive quotes.  Straight away, there is a financial benefit for the driver, as well as getting the number of penalty points down, improving road skills and contributing to road safety.</p></speech>

Penalty points expiring through natural wastage is one thing, but on the other side, drivers are going to get additional upskilling in their driving and will obviously be in a better position to use the road than they would have been previously, due to the development they have undergone.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.754" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017032200002#Q01500"><p>Yes, we have spoken to a number of insurance companies.  The general feedback is that this is completely welcome.  They see it as making absolute sense.  They cannot see why it should not happen quickly.  They believe in anything that upskills drivers.  Again, I go back to the figure of 53 years.  While that is the longest period of having a licence, since then roads have changed, vehicles have changed and the whole world has changed.  The fact that we have a mobile phone in the car now means that the car is an office.  There are the possibilities of using other things.  It is not a computer at home on the desk anymore.  Everything is sitting on our phones in front of us.  All of these thing contribute.  We can help to change driver behaviour.</p> <p>  The big thing for the insurance companies is the monitoring and the feedback.  If we have someone monitored with feedback over a period of time, not over a day or anything like a one-day course, behaviours are changed.  In the same context of insurance, we spoke to the companies about young people and novice drivers getting a licence and an N-plate.  I am using the term "young people", but obviously someone can be 30 or 40 when getting a licence.  Young people are given a novice plate for two years.  The premiums they are being asked for at times are astronomical.  Some companies are already giving reduced rates for monitored drivers.  They see this as very important.  Perhaps this is something that should be looked at from a road safety point of view for the upskilling of drivers.  Maybe drivers should be monitored for a longer time during the novice period.  It would mean that when they become fully qualified drivers, they are actually able to drive and learn good habits over a period of time.</p></speech>

Logistically, in terms of how the app would work, has the witness more detail on how it would connect in the car and what monitoring would take place in the driving session?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.756" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Farrell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017032200002#Q01700"><p>There are a number of different options, but I will explain two options.  One option is that the app is attached to the phone only.  It would be on the phone as an ordinary app would be at the moment.  It is on all of the time.  When one drives or goes above walking speed, it starts to work straight away.  It takes measurements.  It basically works on inertia.  If one goes around a corner, the phone knows that one has gone around the corner very fast.  It knows if a driver brakes very hard or accelerates.  It is location-based, so it knows if the driver is speeding in an area.  What is very relevant is that it knows if the driver has manually used the phone.  If the driver picks up the phone to look at a text, it knows that has been done and it reports on that.</p> <p>  If the driver does any of those negative things, the driver gets minus points.  It is worked on a points basis.  The driver is trying to get his or her points up rather than seeing them go down.  If the driver does not use the phone, leaves it sitting in the glove box of the car for the duration and drives safely within the speed limit with no rapid acceleration away from traffic lights or roundabouts and no rapid braking, it will measure that and the points will increase.  Over a period of time, the driver will get better.  The driver can start off with ten or 20 faults.</p><p>Those faults would be shown in the evening and the following day the driver will think about them and have fewer faults.  Over time the driver will look at this.  Most modern cars have an arrow to tell the driver to change up or down gear.  It is simple but it makes the driver more fuel efficient.  The app is pretty much the same idea.</p><p> The second option is to have a plug-in unit in the car that goes into the socket where the mechanic plugs in his computer.  That links with Bluetooth to the driver's phone.  It does the same thing but is much more expensive and a bit unwieldy.  We believe the simpler we can make it the more attractive it becomes.  Everybody who has a smartphone has some shape or form of app on it.</p></speech>

We suggested that the committee have several sessions on road safety because, unfortunately, in the past 12 months there has been a reversal of the positive trend in road fatalities.  It is very important that the stakeholders come in and give us worthwhile suggestions on what we as a committee can do to feed into any upcoming road safety Bill.  It is unfortunate that the Minister seems to be fixated on one issue as the sole and exclusive way to alleviate road fatalities.  It is up to the committee to try to bring pressure to bear on him to take a wider approach.</p> <p>  Mr. Farrell's proposal is very innovative and worthwhile and needs a bit more clarification.  He talks about monitoring driving patterns and using a carrot rather than a stick because anyone who has penalty points sees an increase in insurance premium, whereas reporting positive driving patterns over a period would result in a reduction in the premium.  Anything that improves driving patterns and road safety is very welcome.  How quickly could this be rolled out?  Who would Mr. Farrell envisage monitoring this?  Who would be the monitoring body?  How would he see that body reporting or using the data that could be extrapolated from the app?</p> <p>  I am worried about the use of mobile phones in a car, lorry or tractor.  Ms Murphy would say we should not use them on the footpath in case we walk off it.  We have to be careful how far we go in policing the use of mobile phones.  If a person is using the phone when driving a vehicle, how would Mr. Farrell ensure that person never has to take up the phone?  Would a requirement for the app be that the phone must be in a permanent cradle in the car or the cabin of the lorry?  I recently sent a text message to someone and received an automatic reply to say the person was driving and would respond on reached the destination.  Is that a new service or in certain cars?</p></speech>

Initially we will monitor and will give feedback as a cohort because there may be freedom and civil liberties issues.  We will bring the details of each individual into a secure location and that cohort can be fed back to the RSA, for example, everybody speeds on a 50 km zone going into a certain town.  The number of people using mobile phones while driving will be measured and fed back.  This is voluntary.  If a driver decides to take this course and to be monitored and does not adhere to best practice or improve, the driver will not get the two points back.  The driver has to take the good with the bad, and if he or she does not abide by the rules of the road or drive according to best practice, he or she will retain penalty points.</p> <p>  There is a facility in each smartphone to show whether a person has pressed a button.  Doing that would be a minus point.  Insurance companies are using smartphone apps with individuals to get reduced premia.  I have not asked but I have not read that the phone must be in a fixed position in the car.  If it is in a pocket, a bag or the glove compartment, it moves with the driver.  If the driver brakes hard, it will move, but I am not sure that it has to be in a fixed place.</p> <p>  What were the first two questions?</p></speech>

For argument's sake, when I was a young driver, Aviva, I think, offered a special discount for anyone under 25 who participated in a day's driving course.  At 20% or 30% off a premium of &euro;3,000 it was worthwhile taking a day off to do the course.  Mr. Farrell is considering doing something similar indefinitely and continually.</p></speech>

From the point of view of training, we see that drivers need to be monitored and given feedback for a period to change their behaviour.  The period must be reasonable, by which I mean three or four months although I am not sure.  We will be told what is best in that regard but we consider three months to be reasonable.  On this basis, drivers would get their penalty points removed.  Insurance companies could ask drivers to be monitored for periods of six, nine or 12 months so that their next premiums be reduced, but the fact that they would already be coming back down by two points would mean they would be in a better place applying for renewal of their premiums for the following year.</p></speech>

Her presentation states that the cycling Bill, as proposed, to her mind, will be totally unworkable.  It has not yet come before the committee.  I find that everyone wants to blame somebody else.  The drivers say the cyclists are irresponsible; the cyclists say the drivers are irresponsible.  In fact, all of us, including cyclists, drivers, etc., bear an element of responsibility on the road to ensure that best practice is adhered to.  I too have concerns about the separation distance and whether it will be feasible at all because of the width of the roads in certain locations.  It simply may not be feasible, but we will have to work on that as the Bill passes through Committee Stage.</p> <p>  I welcome Ms Murphy's suggestion that everybody be compelled through legislation to wear high visibility jackets.  I put forward such a proposal a few weeks ago in our first meeting.  Everybody, including pedestrians and cyclists, should wear high visibility vests.</p> <p>  The IRHA calls for a full review of the CPC programme.  I ask Ms Murphy to expand a little further on this.  A great challenge for her organisation is how to maintain a pool of professional drivers, and it is a profession.  It is important we have people who can capably and competently drive lorries.  It is a highly skilled job and a very important one because if they do not drive correctly, it can cause widespread carnage on our roads.  Is there anything we can do, or is there anything that needs to be done at a departmental level, to try to encourage or put in place a system which would help the IRHA?  In light of the large road haulage movements of the IRHA's members between here, Britain and the rest of Europe, will Brexit have a detrimental impact on the IRHA's drivers, and could that in turn have an impact on road safety in the future?</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice, raised the point about imported cars.  Perhaps I missed it, but I do not think Mr. Lee answered the question and I ask him to come back to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-22a.779" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Verona Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017032200002#S00300"><p>I absolutely agree with Deputy Troy's point about high visibility vests.  We do not want this to sound as if the IRHA has a mantra against other road users.  Many bicycles in the city and in rural areas have flashing lights, but a bulb can blow, just as it can on a car.  However, it is highly unlikely if one is wearing a high visibility vest that it will be ripped off.  There is nothing electrified or mechanical about it.  It is a high-vis vest doing its job.  If a cyclist's bulb goes, there is some hope; if a cyclist's bulb goes and he or she is not wearing a high-vis vest, God help us all.</p> <p>  Much has been said about the CPC.  From our perspective, it is an EU regulation, but in Poland and some of the other eastern European countries, it can be done, as the Deputy said, over a five-day period once every five years.  One does all one's courses and modules and that is it.  There is no requirement here on a foreign national driving a HGV to drive on an Irish licence.  There is a recommendation that if a driver has been here for ten years and wishes to renew his or her licence, it should be renewed in this jurisdiction.  It is only a recommendation.  However, the driver must then carry out his or her CPC in this jurisdiction.  It is delivered in English, full stop.  I would much prefer that a Polish driver driving in Ireland go back to Poland to do his CPC in his own native language and come back to drive in Ireland.  All things being equal, every CPC course is supposed to have the same aim, that is, to update professional competence.  Therefore, the country in which one does one's CPC does not matter.  My drivers go to Italy.  They sit their CPCs in Ireland in their own language and they drive in Italy.  The competence is about driving and updating.  It does not warrant a written examination.  It is a practical application of what we do.  One can pass a written exam - we all know there are academics - but one might not be able to drive.  One might be well capable of passing the exam; it is a matter of obtaining the information in a meaningful manner that assists with road safety and updating.</p> <p>  If I started talking about the pool of drivers and Brexit, we would need a whole committee of its own.  The IRHA, particularly during my term of presidency, has for almost two years consulted with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to try to obtain non-EU work permits.  There is a deficit of 40,000 drivers in the UK.  There is probably now, in Ireland, somewhere in the region of a deficit of 10,000.  This sounds outlandish and ridiculous but it is not.  We are unable to expand business because of the shortage of drivers.  We are heavily regulated.  The chaps in front of me can drive all day and all night with what they do.  There is no regulation.  Our drivers can drive nine hours over a 15-hour period daily - that is it - and the 15 hours do not exist if they get their nine hours' driving done in ten hours.  We are heavily regulated.  If we want to operate a truck beyond a nine or ten hour period twice a week, we must have two drivers.  The drivers are not there.  They are not coming in.  We need the non-EU permits to try to sustain us for what Brexit might bring.  It is about planning and preparation.</p> <p>  I am told by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, DJEI, that 174,000 people are on the dole.  I do not dispute the figure, but how many of them are drivers who have HGV licences and whom we could retrain or do anything else with?  I have never been told this.  I have been virtually ignored in trying to get the non-EU work permits.  It is about planning and it is about our consumers.  If we do not have the drivers to drive the trucks, the trucks do not move and the good do not get to their destinations.  We have several hundred South African drivers asking to come to this country to work.  They speak English, they drive on the same side of the road as we do and they could undertake one of these courses or a proper HGV.  We are prepared to put them through that but we cannot get them here.  To my mind, this is a particular lack of foresight in the planning for Brexit and what it may or may not bring.</p> <p>  All we are asking is something simple.  If we get our driver apprenticeship up and running, it will take three years to turn out fully qualified, competent drivers.  We are asking for interim non-EU work permits for that period so that we may be sustainable.  We are currently not sustainable.  All these laws proposed by the Minister, Deputy Ross, and the cycling Bill are levelled at our profession from the point of view of when it gets enforced.  If there is an accident between a truck and a cyclist, who will measure the road?  There is no spacing between the cycle lane and the carriageway beside it of 1.5 m.  It is nonsensical, unenforceable legislation and we will take more time arguing about it than doing anything else.  It is a waste of everybody's time.  There is enough law in this area for us to deal with.  We can have non-EU work permits - the law is there - but nobody wants to give them to us.  This causes ripple effect problems and people taking on drivers who are not properly trained.  They are probably qualified but they cannot drive.  However, "needs must".  That is my worry.  For some people, needs must, while others have responsible attitudes.  They are not always the same.</p><p>If we are talking about road safety, why not take the drivers who speak English, drive on the same side of the road whom we could bring to Ireland and train them to work safely, instead of allowing somebody who has acquired a HGV licence through army conscription and thinks he or she can drive a truck for commercial purposes?  That is all relevant to road safety.</p></speech>

Again, the RSA is stringent in what it does.  We do not have to be stopped on the side of the road; we are subject to inspections of tachographs on the premises.  An infringement is very costly and the haulage licence is always in jeopardy because of multiple infringements.  A driver working a 45-hour week can have multiple infringements because anything over his or her driving time limit constitutes an infringement, whether it be one minute, five minutes or ten minutes.  We are heavily regulated.  One can have a driver who is keeping to Regulation 561; it does not mean that he or she can drive all the time.  Similar to car drivers, one has good drivers and bad drivers, but we are prepared, if we achieve non-EU work permit status, to bring people in and train them properly.  There are no requirements to be met if someone is European and coming from a country in which they have acquired his or her licence through conscription.  Such persons can come into the country because they are from within the European Union, but, as I said, it does not mean that they can drive.</p></speech>

What really frustrated the Irish Road Hauliers Association is that when we wrote to it in July 2016, its response was that a consultative group had recommended that it would be far more advantageous for the IRHA to set up an apprenticeship programme.  Our programme was actually due to be rolled out the previous May but there had not been certification.  We had a major Department telling us that we should set up such a programme.  In the application for non-EU work permits in 2016, we indicated that we had an apprenticeship programme but that a person would be in training for three years and that we would not have professional drivers until 2019.  It was as if the letter we had written had not been read.  We received a narrative in response in that we were asked to set up a driver apprenticeship programme.  It was indicated that there was no need for permits.</p></speech>

On imports, there is not a full history.  What I am talking about in respect of vehicles being brought into the country and tested does not relate soley to what is tested in the NCT but also repairs.  When imports are brought to the NCT centre, as well as what is tested for routinely, they should be checked to see if there is any indication of repairs having been carried out.  It is the same in England.  A percentage of vehicles do not go through the insurance system; therefore, there is no paper trail.  When a vehicle is brought in from abroad, not just from the United Kingdom but from further afield, there is no paper trail.</p></speech>

People purchase vehicles which are insured and then something happens.  I remember a case I dealt with last year in which an insurance company asked me to look at a vehicle which had been written off by a previous insurance company and involved in an accident.  When it went for repair in a garage, there were issues and I was asked to have a look at it.  When the front part was stripped off, we realised it had been involved in a serious accident.  There was evidence that the chassis leg and sub-frame had been repaired and certain other bits of the chassis were missing.  The vehicle had been insured by an insurance company.  The number of such vehicles may be low, but the fact is that there are a number of them.  If there are certain tests, there is a ripple effect such that when people, especially in the motor trade, bring vehicles to be tested, they will know the tests which have to be passed and that the vehicle will have to be at a certain standard, as otherwise they will be caught.  I do not believe this means more work for me or my colleagues, for whom I do not speak.  It is an issue for NCT and CVRT to carry out tests and if something is spotted or needs further investigation, that is when one should bring somebody else in from outside.  There is a difference between the role of testers which is very important and that of independent motor engineers.  When serious work is being carried out, whether it be repairs, a conversion or modification, the assessor should be involved from the start.  When a vehicle is brought to a test centre, one cannot see everything.  There has to be someone to whom the people doing the work can go when they are not 100% sure about what work needs to be done.</p></speech>

I am really surprised to learn from his opening statement that a driver who holds a learner's permit is required to have a fully qualified driver accompany him or her.  Should there be a second seat in the tractor cab?  It has been mentioned that if there is only one seat in it, a person who holds a learner's permit is okay to drive on his or her own.  That seems to be totally and utterly wrong.  I would like to know what Mr. Moroney's opinion is.  As has been said, if there are two seats in a tractor cab, one could pull one out.  </p> <p>  Mr. Moroney is also opposed to an NCT for tractors.</p></speech>

I had two fatalities from contractors operations.  They were not in the fields, they were out on the roads.  Recently I saw another major crash involving a big tractor and trailer.  The driver lost control.  Years ago we always had courtesy.  I pulled a tractor and trailer myself.  In the countryside a driver would pull in, but nowadays they do not pull in.  They would pull out and keep going by on the road.  I would ask that some mandatory courses be put in place.  I am familiar with contractors at home, and they are going to schools and trying to pull out the drivers because they cannot find drivers any more.  A training course needs to be put in place.</p></speech>

It is a very basic knowledge.  The point is that this is the same all over Europe.  At the height of our building boom we had drivers who did not have a word of English sit safe pass courses that were absolutely irrelevant because they did not understand a word.  I would not like to have the 30% foreign national driver population in Ireland sitting CPC courses because I know that their English would not be good enough.  This is not a problem on the roadside checks for garda&iacute;.  We cannot speak Italian, French or German when we travel the highways and byways of Europe.  If one is wrong they are wrong, and the language does not matter.  Road safety legislation must be met.  Tachograph legislation is the same in all languages, and it is shown on a digital card.

It is similar to the road haulage sector, where there is a huge skill shortage in the farm contractor sector.  One of the difficulties is that most of these farm contractors will not have a single farm payment or a farm number so they are not really farmers.  We have some meetings arranged with Teagasc to try and bring up the fact that we need to get a training programme in place for tractor drivers in contractor fleets, a programme that is sustainable and that will ensure that all the issues of safety and driver alertness and awareness are brought to the fore.  That is high on our list of priorities.</p></speech>

I am conscious that we have been here for three hours.  In terms of the app that was mentioned - technology, in terms of overall road safety, is the way to go - we have a great opportunity now with the various new technologies that are available to make massive progress on the overall issue.  Can the witnesses tell me how fool-proof the system is?  For example, could I give it to my grandmother and could she take my phone and drive for three months if I have ten penalty points and drive at 30 km/h in a kind of 'Driving Miss Daisy' scenario?  Is that something that the witness could address?</p></speech>

When one takes insurance on their vehicle one makes a declaration to say that they do not have penalty points.  It is made in good faith.  In downloading the app there would be a requirement to say that this app will not be used by any other driver.  It also records the driving style, the style of the breaking and acceleration.  If half way through the monitoring period the style changed and the driver was not reaching their parameters the style would show up as a different style of driving.  Questions would have to be raised in the monitoring of the data.  It is similar to reading a tachograph.  If there is a change in the behaviour there are questions to be raised.</p></speech>

This is why there are ramifications for the general travelling public.  This is something that could easily be applied to every single vehicle, as opposed to having speed guns at the side of the road.  What Ms Kinnarney is saying to us is that the technology exists so that every vehicle could have this register of the speed they are travelling in respect of speed limits.</p></speech>

To go back to Ms Kinnarney's point, this is voluntary.  It is not compulsory.  As in all cases one starts out for the right reason.  We envisage that there are roughly 600,000 people with between one and 12 points on the road at the moment.</p><p>We do not envisage all of them deciding on a Monday morning to undertake the course and be monitored, but a percentage will do so.

I am not being ageist when I say that some parents are genuinely concerned about their children who have a novice or full licence driving their cars on the roads.

Can the scheme be made available to such people?</p></speech>

There is no reason not to do so.  Insurance companies have already made it available and what we have outlined is just a different method.  One becomes a learner driver, then a novice driver and, finally, a fully qualified driver.  Insurance companies think it is good idea to monitor novice drivers as a means of instilling good behaviour and complementing road safety.</p></speech>

We have a stipulation in Ireland that one can only be insured between the age of 25 and 70 once one has two years of driving experience.  The insurance coming on board with the HGV driver apprenticeship programme is crucial because we expect that many of the young drivers starting off will be in or around 18 years of age.  This is the process that the insurance sector expects to use to monitor drivers.</p></speech>

The scheme is commonplace.  The only thing is that the UK jurisdiction has raised the speed so HGVs are allowed to travel up to 100 km/h, but we are limited to below that figure here.  There is a disparity whereby a Northern Ireland registered vehicle can do more speed than our members can.  We do not particularly have a difficulty with the scheme.</p></speech>

Plus, HGVs must haul huge amounts of weight.  The speed limit is probably related to the risk factors as well as everything else.  In general, the provision exists to allow traffic to flow.  There is a huge disparity.  HGVs are not allowed to overtake on dual carriageways on which there is loads of room and everyone is travelling in the same direction.  However, we can overtake on a rural road that has an 80 km/h speed limit, which is crazy.  The garda on the roads needs to understand that there should never be a prosecution for labouring in the overtaking lane but not for overtaking on a dual carriageway.</p></speech>

The acceleration of a vehicle is very different in all instances because it depends on the ability of the driver.  The situation is different for trucks because it all depends on the style of driving and the load being carried.  Although HGVs have speed limiters, on the Continent a vehicle could roll down a hill and still reach 100 km/h.  In that instance, the reading on the speed limiter would be 100 km/h because of travelling downhill.  Limiters in cars and trucks work completely differently.  I am not versed enough in this matter to say whether a speed limiter would work for cars.  When it comes to young people-----</p></speech>

Education is key.  We have a come a long way in recent  years.  When I sat my driving licence, I did not have to have driving lessons, but nowadays one must have 12 driving lessons.  My 22 year old daughter has attained a higher standard of driving than I had at the same age.  Speed will always be a factor.  There is always a way around limiters because they can be disconnected.  Therefore, they are probably more dangerous than productive.</p></speech>

All vehicles can produce a huge amount of spray.  One can go above the regulation and have better brushes on the side of the gear and whatever.  Much of the problem has to do with the design of motorways and the way water lies on them.  One must understand that the vehicle and rotation of its wheels are bigger so the spray is bound to be bigger.  Just because one can do 100 km/h does not mean one can always do so.  If the weather is inclement then everyone must err on the side of caution.  That is practical common sense.</p></speech>

Some of our members conduct random testing or all testing, especially on drivers who have spent the weekend on their premises or whatever before going to work on a Monday morning.  The reason alco-locks can never be a mandatory application is as follows.  My drivers can be in Italy on a Monday morning and, therefore, I would unable to tell whether they have been drinking.  I cannot be entirely responsible in that regard and I do not think any employer can be.  What if people, like these chaps in front of me, got into a tractor but had a few scoops the night before?

I say that in case the impression was given that tractor drivers are immune; they most certainly are not.  Contractors are very conscious of that aspect of their business.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses understand the concerns of other motorists in terms of the need for regulation and an NCT?  Reference was made to the percentage of accidents involving tractors but what percentage of overall journeys made, in kilometre terms, involve tractors?</p></speech>

The law, irrespective of any roadworthiness testing, requires that any vehicle that is on the road after lighting up time must have appropriate lighting, indicators and so forth.  From January 2016, it became mandatory for every tractor to have a hazard warning light on it when it is being used on public roads, irrespective of its age or size.  Everybody who uses a tractor is aware of that.  It is important that the legislation is enforced and FCI members would encourage that enforcement.  We continue to be concerned about some operators who are using what are called ploughing lights, which are rear facing white lights.  That is a major concern and there should be more awareness raised about that issue because such lights distort the road for other road users-----</p></speech>

We would urge people in the strongest possible terms not to use rear facing white lights on the public road.  On the issue of agricultural accidents, the only research that has been conducted in the area was done in Germany.  We would concur with the view that there should be a Europe-wide database of tractor and agricultural vehicle accidents on the road.  That has been called for by many bodies, including our own.  We ask that this committee would encourage the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to be part of that reporting system so that it is standardised across Europe.  Due to the numbers involved, the risk of an on-road accident involving a tractor is lower compared with other vehicles.  However, due to the size and mass of the vehicle, any accident involving a tractor is more likely to be more serious or significant.  That is the only point I can add in that regard.</p></speech>

Feedback from people in the trade is that there a need for regulation, licensing, rules and guidance in this area.  We have too many people doing work from their homes, like changing brakes for their neighbours and so forth.  In my opinion, the only way that this can be done correctly for all vehicles, to ensure that they are safe, is to have a record of everything.  In that way, there is accountability and a paper trail for any work done-----</p></speech>

What about the motoring enthusiast who wants to change his oil himself?  Is Mr. Lee saying that such work would need to be registered centrally or that it must be done by a regulated operator?  Where does one draw the line?</p></speech>

As we go forward with such research, the line will become more visible.  If one takes the gentleman who is replacing the oil in his car, the question arises as to where the old oil goes.  There are certain regulations in place for garages for changing oil, brake pads and so forth.  There are garages that are doing good work and adhering to very high standards but they are up against others who are not.  The introduction of a centralised logging system will raise standards for everyone.  It needs to be centralised because if people are going to do work on their own vehicle, they should have somewhere to go to check if they are doing it correctly, according to protocols and processes.</p></speech>

It calls on the Minister to implement the actions of the motion put to the D&aacute;il on 2 February.  It is now almost two months or six weeks from that decision and the situation in Bus &Eacute;ireann has got progressively worse.</p><p>We know there is a board meeting this morning in Bus &Eacute;ireann with the possibility of implementing unilateral cuts without the agreement of the unions.  The consequences of such action will see a nationwide strike.  A strike has the potential to cause losses of up to &euro;500,000 per day and is not going to benefit anyone, whether the company, the workers or the tens of thousands of people who rely on Bus &Eacute;ireann on a daily basis to get to work, college, medical appointments or whatever.</p><p>To date the Minister has been slow to provide leadership and guidance.  I accept that we have an arm of the State, the Workplace Relations Commission, to negotiate between unions and management in respect of the terms and conditions of the workers.  However, what the Minister does not seem to accept is that the losses that have built up or accumulated at Bus &Eacute;ireann during recent years are not as a consequence of the actions of the workers.  The unions have agreed to implement cost efficiencies to help to address the deficit, but the &euro;30 million deficit that needs to be addressed cannot be dealt with, nor should the Minister expect it to be dealt with, through the Workplace Relations Commission.</p><p>I will outline what needs to happen.  As stipulated and clearly outlined in the motion of 2 February of this year, we need to look at how the social protection contract is paid.  We need to look at the subvention that is being paid.  Moreover, there needs to be a full review into how licences are issued to private contractors.  That has not happened to date.</p><p>The Minister has said that he has no problem talking to the people after an agreement has taken place at the Workplace Relations Commission.  Now, we are looking at a situation whereby, within the coming weeks, if a solution is not agreed then Bus &Eacute;ireann could be insolvent.  People talk about trying to bolt the door when the horse has gone.  That is what this Minister is doing.  We need to send a clear message from this committee that the Minister needs to engage with the key stakeholders on this issue.  The key stakeholders are the National Transport Authority, the management of Bus &Eacute;ireann, the unions representing the workers and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  These parties need to engage to ensure that the structural changes being put forward are agreed and can be implemented without delay.  One thing is sure: any plan that emanates from the management without the agreement of the unions is not going to work.  If a plan does not work, then all we are doing is pushing the problem further down the line.</p><p>I call on the members of the committee to support this motion.  We should write to the Minister and make the case that this committee reaffirms the decision taken by the majority of the D&aacute;il on 2 February 2017 and that the Minister should establish a forum without delay and engage all the key stakeholders to ensure that a resolution is brought to bear quickly.</p><p>It was remiss of me not to point out before now that this is not something that has taken place over night or over recent weeks.  The precarious financial situation that Bus &Eacute;ireann finds itself in has been known to this Minister and was known to the previous Minister for in excess of 12 months, but no action has been taken.  The Minister continues to take little or no action.  Now is the time for the Minister to bring the key stakeholders together and come up with a holistic approach rather than try to say the deficit facing Bus &Eacute;ireann can be resolved through the WRC.  It cannot.</p></speech>

However, in large measure the motion is being overtaken by events.  As we speak, an emergency board meeting of Bus &Eacute;ireann has been under way for a little under an hour.  It seems increasingly clear that the Minister, the Government and the board of Bus &Eacute;ireann are preparing an almighty gamble in their determined attempts to boost an agenda that includes privatisation.</p></speech>

However, I wish to make clear that if the Minister, the Government and the board carry on the way they are carrying on, we are headed for a bus strike.

The motion passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas at the start of February.  It included a call to increase in the travel pass subsidy and all of that.  I have no problem with any of that.  However, the two additional parts of the motion are not specific enough.  Given the stage we are at now, those in Bus &Eacute;ireann management are back to being their provocative selves and that the Minister is missing in action again, I believe the motion does not go far enough.  We have all repeatedly called on the Minister to get involved.  The fact is that the motion does not detail exactly what we want to do in respect of getting down to coming out with carrying out a review relating to the over-saturation of routes and the identification of those routes.</p><p>The motion is not specific enough in identifying where those licences were issued, when they were issued and the figures as to how they resulted in a loss-making position.  All of that needs to be out in the open and to be clear.  As the committee will be aware, for the past few months neither the NTA nor the Minister, nor the Department, has been transparent in giving members those figures.  If we are to get to the bottom of it and separate it from the reasons for the financial crisis as opposed to focusing on, blaming and targeting the workers who did not create this crisis, we need to be more specific.</p></speech>

It is clear that the workers have been targeted.  It is clear that they did not create this crisis.  It is clear the Minister has adopted a hands-off approach.  An opportunity to get involved was afforded to him repeatedly.  The Minister was asked repeatedly - even if he did not want to get involved - to get his Department involved along with the NTA, Bus &Eacute;ireann management and the unions and he repeatedly refused.  We are now back to square one, as in potential strike action and still nothing is being done.  In order to get to the crux of identifying what exactly is the financial crisis, we must commit to carrying out a review of all of the routes that have contributed - because of the licences operated on them and the over-saturation - to that financial crisis.  In addition to all the other aspects of the motion passed on 2 February, given the provocative nature of Bus &Eacute;ireann management and the stand-off approach of the Minister, we need to pin them down exactly to find out because we will not get clarity or transparency unless we are specific.  Being vague is merely letting them off the hook.</p></speech>

That is included in the motion that was passed by the D&aacute;il on 2 February already and that is why my party did not specify it again.  It was included and has been voted on and passed by the D&aacute;il on 2 February 2017.</p> <p>  It is the Minister's responsibility to bring a forum together to deal with all policy-related issues, which include how the NTA issues licences and how the licences have been awarded in the past.  Much of Deputy Munster's amendment is included in the original motion that has been put before the Oireachtas committee today.  We are far better off to be at one as a committee in sending a clear message to the Minister, rather than being pedantic and splitting hairs over certain wordings.</p> <p>  I put forward the motion in good faith three weeks ago, as the clerk to the committee can confirm, because of the ongoing difficulties in Bus &Eacute;ireann and to give all members of the Oireachtas committee an opportunity to support the motion and to send a clear unambiguous message to the Minister, Deputy Ross.  It has to be said that this committee has sent messages to Deputy Ross, both in writing and in person when he has been here before us talking about the difficulties facing Bus &Eacute;ireann and unfortunately they have fallen on deaf years thus far.  The Minister cannot abdicate his responsibility any longer.  This is becoming a serious issue.  We are now looking at the possibility of Bus &Eacute;ireann, the semi-State company that has been providing public transport across the country, being insolvent in a matter of weeks, if not months.  It is the Minister's responsibility, as the main shareholder in this company, to intervene without delay.</p></speech>

I would have had no problem supporting Deputy Troy's motion if I did not feel it was vague.  The reason, as I said, we need to be more specific is because the Minister, Bus &Eacute;ireann management and the NTA are all being so provocative in their approach and blaming the workers.  There is a need, at this stage, to be specific in what we request of the Minister and Bus &Eacute;ireann, including the details in the latter part of my amendment.</p></speech>
