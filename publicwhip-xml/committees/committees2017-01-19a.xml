Apologies have been received from Deputy Marc MacSharry.  </p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 14 December 2016.  Are the minutes agreed to?  Agreed.</p> <p>  As there are no matters arising from the minutes, we will proceed to correspondence received since the previous meeting.  We have a considerable amount of correspondence with which to deal as the committee has not met since before Christmas.  </p> <p>  The first item is No. 258A, a briefing document from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in connection with today's meeting.  We will note and publish the document.  The next item is the opening statement of Dr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General, Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which we will also note and publish.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence received from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up documents on issues discussed at previous meetings.  The first is No. 229B, correspondence dated 14 December 2016 from Mr. Tom Rice, chief legal officer of PIMCO.  We have received a number of other items of correspondence in connection with Project Eagle which we will note and publish.  As they will form part of the committee's work in drafting its report, we will not discuss them.  If members wish to respond to any of the documents, they should speak to the secretariat.  We will note and publish Nos. 229B, 230B, 235B-----</p></speech>

The issue is becoming more complex as more material is received.</p></speech>

The first two items we have deal with are the opening statements for this morning.</p></speech>

The correspondence has come in.  Some people might only get to look at them today or tomorrow.  We have received two items of correspondence from NAMA in the past week.  They are detailed letters.  Today, we are noting them and publishing them.  We are making no comment on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B00400"><p>I understand that.  Perhaps later in our session on Project Eagle we might look at how we are dealing with that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B00500"><p>I will explain the position for the benefit of people here.  We will deal with correspondence reports in our work programme.  Before we start the session dealing with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs we will go into private session briefly to discuss the progress report and so on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B00600"><p>We might look at that correspondence and decide what we are doing.</p></speech>

For now, we will note and publish them.  We can discuss them later.</p> <p>  Items Nos. 230B, 235B, 236B, 237B, 255B and 260B are next.  We have received these six detailed letters from NAMA since our last meeting.  They have not been published previously.  Some people will want to see them published and therefore they are being published today.</p> <p>  Items Nos. 233B(i) and 233B(ii) are next.  These are e-mails from NAMA dealing with statements by a member of a committee and the right of NAMA to fair procedure.  The remark relates to Deputy McDonald.  Have you had an opportunity to look at it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B00800"><p>No.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B00900"><p>Seemingly, after the original PIMCO letter, which I have before me, you issued a press release in a personal capacity challenging the previous NAMA evidence base.  NAMA has written to the committee calling for fair procedure.  The document is coming up on the screen.  If you want to take a moment and come back to us, Deputy McDonald, that is fine.  It is a comment.  It is a response to a press release you issued.  NAMA has sent a response to the committee with comments.  The NAMA officials want to ensure they will get fair procedure.  Obviously, they were not fully happy with your personal comments.  Do you want to come back to it, Deputy?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B01000"><p>For what purpose?  They did not like my press statement.  Is that it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B01100"><p>There is no purpose.  The only reason is that NAMA sent an e-mail arising from your press release.  This is correspondence from NAMA and we have to record it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B01200"><p>That is fine.  In fact, the remarks I made were simply to clear an inaccuracy.  I will have to look again at the transcript of the meeting.  NAMA officials had posited a scenario as to where this had originated and we had established that it was not true.  To me, that much is duly noted.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B01300"><p>It is there for the record because NAMA has sent us an e-mail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B01400"><p>There is no question of NAMA not receiving fair procedure.  The agency got a perfectly fair hearing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B01500"><p>We will ensure that before the completion of our work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B01600"><p>That is appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B01700"><p>Items Nos. 239B(i) and 239B(ii) are correspondence from the Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection with follow-up information after an appearance before the committee to discuss debts owed by companies or business to the Social Insurance Fund.  Essentially, the correspondence outlines that we asked detailed questions, the Department is preparing a report and we will have it shortly.  That is the essence of the letter.</p> <p>  Next we have items Nos. 245B(i) and 245B(ii).  This is correspondence dated 29 December 2016 from the HSE in reply to the request of the committee for information on the patient private property account.  We will note and publish that.  I think we will be putting that on our work programme shortly.</p> <p>  Items Nos. 246B(i) and 246B(ii) are correspondence dated 29 December 2016 from the HSE regarding the discrepancies in the fair deal scheme fees.  We will send that to the original correspondent and bear it in mind for the work programme.  No doubt we will be discussing the matter.  We will note and publish it.</p> <p>  Items Nos. 249B (i) to 249B(vii) are correspondence dated 4 January 2017 from the Department of Finance relating to meetings held between the Department and bidders on Project Eagle.  We will note and publish it.</p> <p>  Category C is correspondence relating to private individuals who have written to us or any other correspondence.  Item No. 225C is correspondence from Deputy Mattie McGrath relating to the expenditure incurred in the refurbishment of Our Lady's County and Surgical Hospital, Cashel, County Tipperary.  The correspondence states that the project is &euro;7 million over budget already.  I propose that we write to the HSE, enclosing a copy of the correspondence and seek a full explanation of the overspend and any other issues raised.  When we get a reply, we can discuss it in further detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B01800"><p>This is a unique moment since I agree with Deputy McGrath from County Tipperary.  It is probably a first.  We have been well aware of health issues in recent months, especially with regard to emergency departments.</p> <p>  This is an incredible story.  It goes back 20 years to agreements on a new role for this hospital.  I visited the hospital with the Minister for Health.  The committee should know that there was not one patient in the building.  It is not simply a question of where the &euro;7 million went.  It is a case of what it is being used for and what it will be used for.  All the while South Tipperary General Hospital remains one of the most over-crowded hospitals.  We should write to the HSE on the matter.  I would be surprised if we do not bring them in to explain not only the capital differential but the question of value for money with regard to what the hospital is being used for.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B01900"><p>The &euro;7 million is not the cost of the project.  It is the over-spend.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B02000"><p>The cost of the project is a little under &euro;27 million.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B02100"><p>The amount in question is the over-spend.  Is that correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B02200"><p>They said it would cost a little under &euro;15 million.  It is either not being used or there is minimal use.  It is incredible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B02300"><p>I agree.  There is a strong argument for calling in the HSE in promptly either on this issue alone to discuss related issues as well.  The correspondence from Deputy McGrath suggests not only that there is no one in the hospital but that it will never have patients on beds.  That is his assertion.  Whether it is correct is another matter.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B02400"><p>I support Deputy McDonald.  Basically, in the discussions relating to South Tipperary General Hospital, many of us have argued that the facility has been left as it has.  Not alone has it been left in that manner, but the HSE is refusing to use it as a step-down facility for people who are going to emergency theatre and into South Tipperary General Hospital to have procedures.  If it is not going to be used as a step-down facility, then what, in the name of God, will it be used for?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B02500"><p>Deputy Cullinane is next.  Then we will move on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B02600"><p>I agree we should bring in the HSE.  However, it is not simply a question of this project.  A number of over-spend projects arise.  It might be useful if we ask the HSE to supply us with detail on capital projects going back three or four years and establish the estimated and actual spend.  In other words, we should not only examine this project but the complete picture.  This might or might not be an outlier.  If we get that information it could frame our discussion in a national context.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B02700"><p>When we are writing to the HSE, as well as the letter from Deputy McGrath we will give the executive the transcript of this meeting.  It will accompany the letter to the HSE.  We will come back to this topic.</p> <p>  Next we have items Nos. 226C, 256C and 259C.  They are from an individual and relate to previous correspondence to the committee alleging corruption and illegality in the trade unions as well as censorship in the Arts Council and other publicly funded bodies.  The individual has also asked to appear before the committee.</p> <p>  I propose we advise the individual that any illegality or corruption should be brought to the attention of the Garda or police.  The issue of the alleged censorship is a policy matter for the Arts Council and is not for the Committee of Public Accounts.  I propose that the clerk should write to the individual informing him of this.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We are not dealing with allegations of corruption here.  That is not our department.</p> <p>  Next we have items Nos. 227C(i) and 227C(ii).  This correspondence has been received from Mr Sean Quigley of the Courts Service.  It includes a Courts Service report entitled Independent Review of The Wards of Courts Growth Fund.  This has been a long-running matter and I welcome the report.  We should consider this when we are looking at our work programme.  I know certain individuals have been in contact with members of the committee.  Does anyone wish to comment?</p></speech>

You are right, Chairman.  We have all been contacted by people.  Some people are tired and have been campaigning for a long time.  If we could timetable this as one of the earlier parts of the programme, it would be beneficial.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.36" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#B02900"><p>We will come back to the work programme in a few minutes.  We can deal with it at the work programme stage.</p> <p>  Next is item No. 231C, correspondence from an individual based in Australia relating to alleged Government corruption.  A number of allegations have been made but there is no specific detail.  I propose that we write to the individual and explain that if he has evidence of corruption or other illegal practices, he should report them to the Garda.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next item is No. 232, correspondence received from an individual at a company called Sager Management Limited who alleges failure by NAMA to provide for transparency in the sale of a property in Dublin 8.  I propose that we write to NAMA forwarding a copy of the letter and requesting a response.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p><p> The next items are Nos. 242C and 254C, e-mails received from an individual who has been in contact previously about an investigation into practices at the University of Limerick.  The person is requesting permission to appear before the committee in hearings with the university and also states others wish to have an input into the hearings.  I propose that we write to the individual to explain that the committee's work begins with the Accounting Officer of the relevant Department or body.  We have already said we will add the University of Limerick to our work programme when we are engaging with third level institutions.  We will hold and consider the correspondence, but as regards individuals making presentations, we will explain how we start the process and see what happens after that.  There is no commitment to invite the person in question.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next items are No. 238C (i) and (ii), correspondence received from an individual working in a translation company who is raising issues about the response of the Office of Government Procurement regarding a tender for translation services for immigrants.  In October the committee agreed, following the last response on the matter and given the fact that there was an ongoing legal case, to consider the matter closed from its point of view.  I do not believe we can take it further and we have responded fully.  As there is a legal case ongoing, we have to leave it to the court.  As we cannot take it any further at this point, I propose that we close and note the correspondence accordingly.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The next item is No. 240C, correspondence received from the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, regarding the North Meath Communities Development Association.  The correspondence states the Department is examining the matter which has to do with a lease in north Meath.  When the two gentlemen involved in the organisation came to my constituency office last week to discuss the matter further, I told them that we were writing to the Minister.  We have received a response which states the Department is examining the issue.  It is really only an acknowledgment from the Minister.  The matter came up at the last meeting.  We have written to the Minister and received an acknowledgment.  When we receive the full reply, we can take the matter further at that stage.  There might be a limit to whether we can do anything further, but we will deal with it when we receive a reply from the Minister.  We will note the correspondence.  </p><p> The next items are Nos. 241 and 248C, correspondence received from an individual who has highlighted problems in Caranua.  We will note the correspondence which will be taken into consideration when engaging on the matter once the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the redress system has been laid before the committee.  I understand it has been completed and is with the Minister and due for publication shortly.  The issue concerns the residue in the fund arising from the Redress Board, of which the public might not be fully aware.  In a sentence will Mr. McCarthy tell us what is involved?</p></speech>

We all know the story - "Send your bank account details and we will send you the money."</p> <p>  Item No. 243C is correspondence received from an individual which follows previous correspondence on Caranua and refers to the matters raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  It is separate correspondence which we will include in the conversation we just had.  We will note it. </p> <p>  The next item is No. 244C, correspondence received from an individual with further information on the payment of an Aosd&aacute;na grant.  The correspondent takes issue with a number of things, including the committee forwarding his letter to Aosd&aacute;na and use of his e-mail address, and refers to the committee's obligation in criminal matters and the discourtesy it has shown to him.  The clerk has drafted a reply to the letter addressing the issues raised, a copy of which is on members' screens.  I ask them to take a moment to read it.  If it is agreed, the clerk can issue it on our behalf.  The person in question sent us an e-mail, but he does not want us to respond to him by e-mail but to write letters to him.  We forwarded a copy of his e-mail, as we would normally do, to Aosd&aacute;na for a response, but he is not happy that we sent his details to it.  Separately, he is unhappy that I, as Chairman, did not personally write back to him, but as pointed out in the letter, once correspondence is received, it becomes committee documentation and the response is sent by the clerk.  Can we agree to issue the letter drafted by the clerk?  Agreed.  I hope I have not shown any discourtesy to the correspondent in my summarising of the letter. </p> <p>  The next item is No. 247C, a letter received from TASC, Think-tank for Action on Social Change, enclosing a policy paper which proposes the reform of practices in Government and public bodies.  I thank the organisation for its paper which certainly raises some important issues that need to be addressed, particularly in the area of record keeping by public sector organisations.  It arose from the fact that NAMA had not retained its contemporaneous notes on board decisions.  TASC has a view on the matter and thinks there should be greater record keeping and transparency.  I suggest we note the letter and take it on board.  Members can read it and use the documentation.  It is interesting correspondence.  We thank TASC for sending it to us and we will take it into account.  </p> <p>  The next item is No. 250C, correspondence received from Mr. Philip Lane, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, in reply to correspondence received by the committee on alleged breaches of prudential requirements by significant financial institutions.  The letter states such breaches have to be dealt with by the European Central Bank as the Central Bank can forward such allegations to it.  The correspondence does not state if the Central Bank has actually sent the complaint to the ECB.  I propose that we write to the Central Bank asking if the allegations have been forwarded to the ECB and, if not, to request that the information be referred as quickly as possible.  If it has not been so referred, we should ask why it has not done so.</p></speech>

Without getting into the details, Mr. Lane thinks that because the ECB was providing credit for the banks, they did not fully own the assets transferred to NAMA.  However, I agree with the Deputy.  When I saw the reply, I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister of Finance for a written answer on Tuesday to tease out the role of the Central Bank in investigating complaints before the ECB took over responsibility for prudential supervision.  As his answer was unsatisfactory, this morning I submitted a further question.  I was not happy with the reply to the parliamentary question from the Minister.  We will come back to this correspondence.</p></speech>

It would be useful for us to have a full understanding of what is at the heart of the matter.</p><p>I have tried to get my head around a lot of the documentation that was sent to us but the point being made is substantial in nature.

I was extremely disappointed with the response from the Governor of the Central Bank, which is why I followed it up directly with the Minister by way of parliamentary question.  I am actually not happy with the reply I received from the Minister either.  That letter from the Governor was a brush-off and we will not take it.  That is all I will say.  As such, we will ask the clerk to take on board what has been said and to seek a more detailed response.  The one we received is not satisfactory.  We will come back to that.  We will want a further explanation and to know whether they have sent the thing on.  The essence of this is that some of these complaints pre-date the point at which the European Central Bank became the prudential supervisor of the significant financial institutions.  Who is responsible?  The response from the Central Bank and the reply to the parliamentary question did provide an answer.  We will come back to this correspondence when we get further information.</p></speech>

Is it agreed that we note and deal with this matter in private session shortly?  Agreed.  We will have a discussion on Project Eagle and the drafting of the report in private session.</p> <p>  That is the end of correspondence.  There was a lot to deal with because it has been a few weeks since the previous meeting, which took place before Christmas.  Next, we turn to the reports and accounts received since the previous meeting.  They are going up on the screen and I will try to move quickly through them.  There are about 30.  A lot of them have a clear audit opinion.  I will take a shortcut on this.  We will note all the ones with a clear audit opinion.  I will just call them out.  However, there are a number in respect of which the Comptroller and Auditor General has a clear comment.  Sometimes the comment relates to public sector pensions and a lot of them relate to procurement.  I will pass on a bit of work to the Comptroller and Auditor General and ask him for his 2015 audit schedule, which should have been cleared by about this time.  Perhaps, he will draft and present a report to the committee on all of the organisations in respect of which he has completed an audit where there was not a clear audit opinion.  I think he audits 300 organisations.  There were probably comments in respect of 50 or 60 or some fraction.  We might just get a report on all of those that did not get a clear audit opinion.  They would be collated then because we are getting them bit by bit, meeting by meeting.  It would be good to get a full summary.  The Comptroller might put them into the different categories of comment, such as procurement, pensions, etc.</p></speech>

I do not know if it is a matter for the Committee on Public Accounts, but a recent case was brought to my attention where Irish companies lost out.  I may well bring it in terms of whether it was a fair contract.  They were making the point that 28% of contracts go out of the country where it is 1% to 1.5% in the case of France and Germany.  There was a significant loss of jobs in this particular case.  Is that something that could be looked at?</p></speech>

However, the Deputy is correct.  It is remarkable.  Ours is an island nation but we actually give more Government contracts outside Ireland than the continental countries which have companies operating right around.  It is extraordinary how things are happening.  We will have a quick word on it, but I think it is really a matter for the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach which covers procurement.</p></speech>

As such, there have been briefing and I think the Minister is going to bring forward heads of a Bill in the near future.  Hopefully, that will solve some of those problems.  Non-compliance with public procurement rules has come up with the HSE in some of its audits also.  It seems to be a yearly recurrence.  If we get this breakdown, that could itself be the focus of a stand-alone discussion with the HSE or other agencies that are constantly failing to comply with the guidelines.</p></speech>

Any query anyone has will come back to us when we get the summarised report.</p><p> The following financial statements and accounts have been received since our meeting on Wednesday, 14 December 2016: the Social Insurance Fund; the Irish Sports Council; Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission; Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission - the Loughs Agency; the Commission for Energy Regulation; the National University of Ireland Maynooth; the Digital Hub Development Agency; the Commission for Aviation Regulation; Oifig Choimisin&eacute;ir na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la; State Examinations Commission; the Adoption Authority of Ireland; Special EU Programmes Body; National Standards Authority of Ireland; the Commission for Communications Regulation; the Environmental Protection Agency; University College Dublin; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta; the National Tourism Development Authority; Tourism Ireland Limited; Commission for Railway Regulation; National University of Ireland; the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown; Galway and Roscommon Education and Training Board; City of Dublin Education and Training Board; National Economic and Social Development Office; Institute of Technology Sligo; Ollscoil na h&Eacute;ireann Gaillimh; Fishery Harbour Centres; Marine Casualty Investigation Board; Irish Water Safety; An Bord Iascaigh Mhara; Competition and Consumer Protection Commission; Institute of Technology Tallaght and Dundalk Institute of Technology.  They are all formally noted and we will discuss the ones by exception which had issues that the Comptroller and Auditor General drew to our attention when we get that report.</p><p> The next item on our agenda is the work programme.  We will have a brief discussion on this.  I have noted the following items, based on what members have said: the Health Service Executive, HSE, ongoing work on sections 38 and 39; the patients' fund; nursing homes; and we have just mentioned the capital expenditure issue.  We have also said we want to deal with the third level institutions and with procurement.  Our basic function is the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which he published last autumn.  It has 18 chapters.  We have already dealt with some of them and plan to deal with one or two next week.  The outstanding areas we have to deal with over the coming months will be the Department of Finance, and the three chapters - Exchequer, outturn, Government debt and accounting and budget management.  A meeting has to be held to discuss that because it is in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  We will then have to have a meeting with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government because there is a chapter there about funding for local authorities and progress under the land aggregation schemes.  There will be a meeting on procurement and management of contracts for direct provision, with the Department of Justice and Equality.  There will also be a discussion of EU refunds and levies in the agriculture sector.  There is nothing else for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine specifically.  When the Departments appear before us we will deal with their total Vote and the specific issue that the Comptroller and Auditor General has raised.  We will have to bring the Revenue Commissioners in once or twice to deal with their general revenue activities and there are chapters on trafficking, fuel laundering, the Revenue Commissioners' review of medical consultants' tax affairs, research and development tax credits, taxpayer compliance and deferral of tobacco stamp duty liability.  We would not do all that in one day.</p></speech>

We had a full hearing on Console.  The HSE director appeared came before the committee and we found out that he is not the Accounting Officer but that the Secretary General of the Department of Health was.</p> <p>  The internal HSE audit was devastating and pointed out systemic failures yet there has not been a single change in policy, that I am aware of, since then.  Since then Console problems have arisen in respect of at least three section 38 organisations.  The last time the Secretary General of the Department and the HSE appeared before us they passed the buck back to these organisations.  It is clear that there are issues in respect of financial and governance controls which need to be considered.  When I raised this with the Comptroller and Auditor General he said he does comment on section 38.  Would it be wise for this committee to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to do a special report on the financial and governance controls within these organisations and examine where there have been internal report or audit failures?  It seems to be one organisation after another.  The last time the HSE came before us I feel we were stonewalled.  The officials passed the buck.  There was no acceptance of any failures yet its internal audit pointed out potential systemic failures.  It is such an important issue, involving hundreds of millions of euro of taxpayers' money but we only glanced at it once and then because of all the other work we parked it.

For the past few years we have encouraged it to write more about it in the statement on internal financial control.  There is a fairly comprehensive piece of work that would be a focus every year for the committee to examine.  We are considering our programme for 2017 and going forward and we will consider the health sector as a whole to decide what areas to examine and report on specifically in 2017 and in later years.  If it was an agreed view of the committee that we should examine that I would take that very seriously but I have limited resources.  We have already talked about capital projects and that is one of the things I wanted to consider this year.  There are issues around drug procurement that I want to examine.  I want to look into the fair deal scheme and the collection of debts due and the control of that.  There is no shortage of issues to consider.  I will prioritise, as is my prerogative, but I would certainly take very seriously a view of the committee expressed formally to me.</p><p>That is probably the best way to do that.  </p></speech>

I had already written down the three issues referred to by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I would like to see the issue of capital spending in the HSE dialled up in here as soon as possible across a range of different areas.  Everyone has been talking about the issue of drugs for many years.  It is one we need to go through, along with the fair deal scheme, which everyone accepts needs to change.  These are three very important items.  I suggest to the Chairman that we have a HSE week in respect of a number of these issues if the committee agrees because they are very important issues.</p></speech>

The committee might consider writing to the HSE about the three, four or five items and telling it that it wants a specific section in the annual report on the fair deal scheme, patients' income, capital expenditure and procurement or whatever, rather than just a paragraph.  We want to see the HSE devoting a bit of effort before it produces its next annual report such that when it produces this report, there is something specific on these issues.  We do not have to agree that today but I think we can put the onus on the HSE to be forewarned and have the information for us and tell it that before it produces its annual report, we will be focusing on these areas.</p></speech>

It takes a couple of weeks lead-in for a Department to get ready to come here so we must decide the next one or two straight away and maybe have the full list of everything we mentioned here today next week.  It is up to us then.  The secretariat can give us a draft and we can move something up or down at next week's meeting.  In terms of the February meeting, we want to indicate something fairly promptly.  The simplest thing to do is take one or two of the chapters from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report because they in the system.  We could take funding of local authorities and the land aggregation scheme.  There is a chapter on that.  Alternatively, we could take the procurement and management of contracts for direct provision straight away.  We need to get about two meetings up and running straight away and then we have a little breathing time to put the timetable on the rest of our work.</p></speech>

I am not taking from the importance of the matters mentioned by the Chairman, not least the issue of direct provision.  I endorse what Deputy Cullinane said regarding the HSE and the arm's length organisations.  We talked about this previously.  I am mindful that resources are not unlimited but it is something we need to look at unless we are going to stumble from one crisis to another and say "oh dear, here we go again", which is very debilitating to public confidence.  I am anxious that the committee look at the fair deal scheme and not long-finger it.  I do not know if it is possible to do it in February or early March but it is a very pressing issue.</p></speech>

I want to get agreement for one meeting.  Perhaps we will pick the issue of direct provision.  Will we go with that?  I think two meetings are booked - one on the sale of the Government jet and the other on the change of rostering in the public service.  I will make one change.  The only reason, which is a pragmatic one, is the fact that in two weeks' time, the Department of Justice and Equality will come before us regarding the special report on the change of working arrangements in the Prison Service and suggested savings that were not achieved.  Consequently, we cannot bring the same Department in two weeks later.</p></speech>

We are joined by representatives of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla.  Specifically, from the Department we are joined by Dr. Fergal Lynch, Secretary General; Ms &Eacute;imear Fisher, assistant secretary; Ms Lara Hynes, principal officer; and Ms Doreen Burke, assistant principal.  From Tusla we are joined by Mr. Fred McBride, chief executive officer; Ms Pamela Benson from legal affairs; Mr. Pat Smyth, director of finance; Ms Suzanne O'Flaherty of legal affairs; and Ms Helena Hanna of the finance section.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off all mobile phones.  I advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving the evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such a policy.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>At this stage I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to give a summary of the report for context.  I will then ask Dr. Lynch to give his opening statement.  Deputy Madigan will be first to ask questions todays and she will be followed by Deputy Cassells and others as they indicate.</p></speech>

Chapter 11 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2015 looks at the operation of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service.  In particular, the chapter reviews the process by which a guardian <i>ad litem</i>is appointed, the costs associated with the service and how the operation of the service compares with other jurisdictions.  The figure being displayed for members seeks to summarise the current arrangements for the provision of the service.  As members can see, it is a fairly complex and unusual arrangement.<br/><br/>Apart from the parents and children at the centre of child care cases, these arrangements involve a number of parties, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, which has policy and legislative responsibility; members of the Judiciary; the child and family agency, Tusla; the individuals who act as guardians; and, in many cases, legal representatives hired by the guardians to act on their behalf.  The examination found that no agency was charged with formal oversight of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service.  Although Tusla is usually a party to the child care proceedings, it also has responsibility for directly discharging guardian <i>ad litem</i>costs, which in 2015 totalled around &euro;14 million.<br/><br/>The examination found that insufficient data were being captured to allow for effective monitoring and evaluation of delivery of the service.  Appropriate performance measures are required, including the number of guardians <i>ad litem</i>appointed, the average case load per guardian, the average cost per case and the number of guardians engaging legal representation.  The most recent information on the frequency with which guardians <i>ad</i><i>litem</i>are appointed in child care cases comes from the Child Care Law Reporting Project, a project supported by the Department to examine and report on child care proceedings in the courts.</p><p>Data collated by the project from a sample of District Court child care cases heard in the period from December 2012 to June 2015 show that guardians <i>ad litem</i>were appointed in approximately 53% of the cases.  To get an idea of the average case load per guardian, as part of this examination Tusla contacted the service providers known to it as at 21 April 2016 to ask for details on their current case loads.  The information provided shows that, on average, each guardian <i>ad litem</i>has approximately ten ongoing cases at any given time.  Tusla also provided the examination team with information on the hours billed by 28 guardians <i>ad litem</i>for the period from January to December 2015.  This data shows a high level of variation in the average cost per case from a low of &euro;4,800 to a high of &euro;28,700.  Factors such as the approach taken by a guardian <i>ad litem</i>, the nature and complexity of the issues in the case, the number of children involved and the number of court attendances required can affect the average cost.<br/><br/>The absence of key data means that demand for the service cannot be reliably estimated.  It also makes it difficult to reliably forecast and budget for expected costs and to assess the overall cost-effectiveness of the service.  In this regard, the service in Ireland compares unfavourably with other jurisdictions where such key statistical information is more readily available.  The child care law reporting project found, based on the sample observed, that guardians <i>ad litem</i>secured the services of solicitors in 82% of cases and of barristers in 7% of cases.  The cost of guardian <i>ad litem</i>legal representation in 2015 was approximately &euro;5.9 million.  Approximately 95% of this comprised payments to individuals or firms of more than &euro;25,000, which is the normal minimum level at which open competitive public procurement is required.  These legal costs are not subject to competitive procurement, mainly because no single entity is responsible for procuring these services.<br/><br/>In carrying out our examination, we were careful not to stray into policy matters or encroach on judicial prerogative.  However, the chapter makes a number of recommendations regarding operational matters, including the development of performance measures to monitor and evaluate the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service, the assignment of responsibility for the management and supervision of the service to a single entity and the examination of options for the engagement of guardian <i>ad litem</i>legal representatives by way of a competitive tendering process.  The Department and Tusla have indicated that they accept all the recommendations made.  I understand that some legislative changes in this respect are in train.  The Accounting Officer and the chief executive officer will be able to update the committee in that regard.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to draw the attention of the committee to a transcription error in paragraph 11.34 of this chapter, which is about to be brought up on the screen.  For the record, the total expenditure on professional fees for guardians <i>ad litem</i>in 2015 was &euro;8.2 million.  The comparable figure for 2014 was &euro;9.1 million.  The amounts shown in paragraph 11.34 of this chapter were reversed in error in the version of the report that was initially published.  They are shown correctly in figure 11.1 of the report.  I just want to put that on the record.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleagues from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs: Ms &Eacute;imear Fisher, who is an assistant secretary; Ms Lara Hynes, who is a principal officer; and Ms Doreen Burke, who is an assistant principal officer.  The officials from Tusla have been introduced.<br/><br/>Total expenditure on guardian <i>ad litem</i>services by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, was &euro;16.5 million in 2014, &euro;14.1 million in 2015 and &euro;15.2 million in 2016.  The 2016 figure is Tusla&rsquo;s latest estimate and will be updated as soon as figures for the year have been finalised.  Within these total figures, spending on guardian <i>ad litem</i>costs, including fees and travel, fell from &euro;9.1 million in 2014 to &euro;8.2 million in both 2015 and 2016.  Expenditure by Tusla on legal fees, comprising those of solicitors and barristers, fell from &euro;7.4 million in 2014 to &euro;5.9 million in 2015 before increasing to an estimated &euro;7 million in 2016.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs has acknowledged that the present arrangements for guardian <i>ad litem</i>services are in need of significant reform.  Despite its importance to vulnerable children and young people, this an <i>ad hoc</i>service that lacks an appropriate system of organisation and governance.  Neither the role and functions of guardians <i>ad litem</i>nor the circumstances in which they should be appointed to individual cases is defined.  The service is essentially led by demand and determined by the decision of the courts on whether to assign a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.<br/><br/>From a financial perspective, Tusla has endeavoured to control spending through a series of reasonableness checks and retrospective reviews.  As noted in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, this has produced savings, most notably in relation to legal costs.  An analysis of legal invoices shows that Tusla achieved negotiated savings of between &euro;1.8 million and &euro;1.9 million under this heading in both 2015 and 2016.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla are committed to implementing the recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his recent report.  Specifically, we are focusing on improving the data collection systems from which performance metrics such as average cost per case, average case load per guardian <i>ad litem</i>and average costs per service type can be accurately generated.  These metrics will build on the analyses already carried out by Tusla and will help with the identification of cases with higher than average costs that need to be pursued further.  As these are initial measures, they will be advanced as part of a much wider programme of fundamental reform of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system.<br/><br/>I am pleased to inform the committee that on 17 January last, the Government approved the draft heads and general scheme of a Bill to bring this reform about.  The heads of the Bill will be published shortly by the Minister and will be submitted immediately to the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs for pre-legislative scrutiny.  Subject to the outcome of this process, it is hoped to publish the text of a Bill as soon as possible in the second half of this year.  The proposed legislation provides for a clear structure of accountability through a nationally managed and delivered guardian <i>ad litem</i>service, for a system in which the role, functions, qualifications and appointment criteria of guardians <i>ad litem</i>are specified in law, for the regulation of the assignment of legal representation for guardians <i>ad litem</i>and of the fees payable for legal services and for the monitoring of the performance of guardian <i>ad litem</i>services to ensure quality and cost-effectiveness.  Most importantly, the reformed guardian <i>ad litem</i>service must meet the needs of the children and young people for whom it is intended.  The key functions of guardians <i>ad litem</i>are to ascertain the views of children who are the subject of care proceedings, to advise the court of these views and to give their own considered views on what is in the child's best interests.<br/><br/>The draft legislation provides for a single national provider of guardian <i>ad litem</i>services, separate from Tusla, to be appointed by public procurement.  The national service provider will be responsible for operating a cost-effective, well-managed and high-quality service in the best interests of children and young people and for monitoring and reporting on the performance of the service provided to the courts by guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  The legislation will set minimum qualifications for the appointment of people acting as guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  To ensure the voices of children are heard in court proceedings, there will be a legal presumption in favour of the appointment of guardians <i>ad litem</i>and the court will be required to give reasons for declining to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  The national service provider will have its own inhouse legal support for guardians <i>ad litem</i>, thereby minimising the need to appoint external legal services.  However, there will be provision for a panel of solicitors and a panel of barristers from which the national service provider can draw where external legal services are required.  The legislation provides for the establishment of standardised fees for these legal representatives.<br/><br/>The new legislation is designed to address the acknowledged deficiencies in the current guardian <i>ad litem</i>service.  The Department will work intensively to implement it as soon as the Bill can be finalised and enacted.  The Department will carry out a number of steps in parallel with the work on the Bill, including the preparation of a request for tender documentation for the procurement of a national service provider.  The new service will be evaluated over time.  Other options can then be examined as appropriate, including for example the question of establishing it within the existing family courts system, establishing it as a separate public body or placing it within existing statutory structures.</p><p>It is vital that we put a well-organised national system of guardian <i>ad litem</i>services in place as soon as possible.  The Department is committed to achieving this.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses to the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not think I have seen so many from a Department in a few months.  The role of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service, GALS, is extremely serious.  It is a pivotal role for all of the 6,000 children currently in State care.</p><p>I wish to say at the outset that the Law Society made a submission and from Dr. Lynch's opening statement, it seems he has taken cognisance of it.  The submission was made in November 2015.  I am a member of the Law Society family and child law committee and I note that in the interest of transparency.</p><p>The fact that the witness has taken this matter seriously is very much something the Committee for Public Accounts welcomes.  It defies all logic that this has gone under the radar for such a significant amount of time.  I appreciate that Tusla only took over from the HSE in 2014.  However, we must look at the amount of money involved, for example, for 65 guardians in 2014 - a figure corrected by the Comptroller and Auditor General - it worked out at about &euro;140,000 per annum per guardian for about 1,000 hours.  From my reading of it, it is two and a half times the equivalent in Northern Ireland and the UK in terms of salary.  I know that will be addressed, but in terms of the oversight of the cost, how did this situation arise and why was there no monitoring or regulation of it?  There was nothing in terms of the complaints structure.  How did this happen?</p></speech>

The guardian <i>ad litem</i>service was first put in place and provided for in the Child Care Act 1991 and gradually emerged from that point.  No one would suggest for a moment that it is a satisfactory situation.  As has been identified, it is very much demand-led, there is an insufficient control framework and no comprehensive oversight.  This continued for a lengthy period of time, perhaps because it was part of a much wider budget, though that does not in any way justify it.  For example, when it was under the Department of Health, there would have been a budget of billions upon billions of euro and this was a relatively small proportion of it.  I do not suggest for a moment that is okay, but it would have been one of the reasons.</p></speech>

Back in February 2015, I think it was, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, then chief executive of Tusla, said that the GALS system was outrageous.  That was a year earlier.  Why was nothing done then?  We will talk about the future, but what I am interested in is whether it was the involvement of the Committee of Public Accounts that prompted this sudden reform of the GALS system.  Why was it not done before this?</p></speech>

There was a consciousness that this was a serious problem for some time.  Tusla was established in 2014.  We started conversations with Tusla very early on in 2014 and 2015.  We were committed to addressing the issues as quickly as possible.  In fact, we started a consultation process and produced a consultation paper in October 2015.  That obviously would have taken a number of months to produce.  We were working on it during the course of 2014 and 2015.</p></speech>

That was mentioned in the Law Society submission and by other interested parties.  It seems to me that when Tusla is the payer of the guardian, looking at it from an objective perspective, it is very difficult to see the impartiality there.  Could the witness explain that to us?  It really goes to the core of this issue and we have to ensure that it does not happen in the future.</p></speech>

In 1991, it would have come under the health boards.  It was transferred to the HSE when it was established in 2005.  It was ultimately transferred to Tusla when it was established in 2014.  It was essentially due to administrative convenience because both the HSE and subsequently Tusla would have had the necessary payment arrangements and systems in place to bring this about.</p></speech>

If we look at it from the child's perspective, I have a major issue with it.  It is good that the witness is accepting that today.  We have to be the voice of the child and that is very important.</p></speech>

Just to be clear, there would be two stages.  The first stage would be the establishment of a national service provider, which would be appointed by public procurement.  Ultimately, the intention is to move to a public body of some sort, be that part of the proposed court system or perhaps an existing body, for example, the Legal Aid Board, though I do not want to pre-empt anything there, or indeed it could be decided that it would be a separate public body.</p></speech>

In fact, the Department was one of the first bodies we spoke to, in the context of private law as well as public law cases.  Could I correct myself, Deputy?

In terms of guardians <i>ad litem</i>themselves, Northern Ireland, the UK and Wales pay a set salary, which therefore disincetivises the GALS.  I am not at all casting aspersions on them individually.  There are very tragic and harrowing cases and it would give more transparency.  Would the witness accept that?</p></speech>

When it is appointed, I think the national service provider will have a number of options to pay for its GALS.  One option is to recruit its own staff and to have salaried GALS personnel working within its own system and to perhaps use a combination of that with external GALS if necessary.</p></speech>

Obviously, we are in the committee's hands as to how long it wants to take and what length of time it wants to give the heads of the Bill but we hope to be able to have that process concluded, if possible, including having the committee's report back.  We would then refine the heads of Bill on the basis of the comments and suggestions from the committee and then have a full Bill - obviously, we are in the hands then of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel - as early as possible in the second half of 2017.  That would then go through the Oireachtas in the normal way.  At the same time, the Department would be working on a number of non-legislative components, including preparing the procurement process.</p></speech>

I do not act in the area of child care proceedings but as a solicitor in family law, I will obviously benefit more from going to court than not going to court, and the same applies in this case.  This is the biggest issue in relation to the guardian <i>ad litem</i>system and we must ensure it does not happen in future.  We must examine the reasons the payments range from &euro;40,000 to &euro;240,000.  Is this being monitored?  I am not casting aspersions on individual guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  If there was a set salary, as is the case in other jurisdictions, it would remove this variation and save the taxpayer more in the long run.  Everyone accepts that the children in question are extremely vulnerable.  They come from dysfunctional backgrounds and often want to stay in a dysfunctional family rather than be taken into care.  The guardian <i>ad litem</i>role is extremely serious.  Whether one or two guardians <i>ad litem</i>are being paid more or used more than others, the quality must be looked at.  I am not suggesting there are cosy relationships or anything like that but we need transparency in this area.</p></speech>

We currently have no powers to monitor performance and the quality of that.  That is not within our remit.  Under the new proposals, that would come under the remit of a national provider.  The notion of Tusla bringing proceedings to court, a guardian <i>ad litem</i>being appointed by the court and then somehow Tusla monitoring that performance is not a system that would be sustainable.  It would not make sense, I think.</p></speech>

Dr. Lynch said that the legislation being drafted would provide for a single national provider and he said the Department is going through a tendering process.  Has it been decided to privatise the service or should it be part of the State service if the Department is going for procurement?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.300" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fergal Lynch" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#O01900"><p>It is going for procurement on the basis that it is, I think, the fastest and most expeditious way of putting a national service provider in place.  However, the Government decision also includes scope for establishing a separate public body, giving it to the new family court system when that is established or putting it in the place of an existing one.  This is, if one likes, an interim measure.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.301" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#O02000"><p>That is exactly where I thought this was leading.  If the Department goes through public procurement and contracts it out to one provider, how can it come along the following year and specify in legislation that it will be incorporated in a statutory structure with people paid a salary, like the Probation Service, having just put the other in place?  From the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Department will tie its hands if it appoints a national provider and then it will not have the scope to realistically examine something like the Probation Service with salaried staff.  The Department would be ruling that out because the successful tenderer would have to have the contract for a period of time.</p> <p>  I have one further question that follows on from what Deputy Madigan said.  Given that there is only one major service provider - I have no doubt it does outstanding work because it would not be doing that work otherwise - it will be very hard to have an effective public procurement tender when there is really one body out there.  Will it be open to tendering from outside the State, for example, by people who do it in some nearby states and might open up a Dublin office and get the contract?</p></speech>

It will be a major tender because of the cost involved; so it will be open.  It will be open to existing providers who may wish to come together or structure themselves in whatever appropriate way.  It will also be open to external providers and so on.</p> <p>  To come to the Chairman's first question, which I think is a very important one, a contract would be awarded for a period of time.  That is to be decided.  It may be three years, four years or something like that.  As that contract is being awarded, there would be a specific arrangement for establishing the new system.  This is the first set of arrangements.  Given that it is so important that we reform the system now, we wanted to move to this as quickly as we can.  Then one can reform a significant component of it and keep those reforms.  For example, the appointments, the recruitment system, the structuring of the system and so on can all be improved.  The qualifications of the GALs, the protocols by which they would operate all of that will have be improved and the only thing that needs to be changed then is to move it from a service provider to a public entity when that public entity is ready to take it over.</p></speech>

Deputy Madigan asked why this was not on people's radar and why no one was flagging this.  We flagged this as far back as two years ago in February 2015 when our then spokesperson, Deputy Troy, introduced legislation into the D&aacute;il aimed at tackling these exorbitant fees.  We wanted to legislate for the manner in which the courts appointed GALs and the oversight of them.  It was clear that within the current system scarce resources were being spent on an unregulated and chaotic system, while at the same time it was clear we did not have adequate resources to fund front-line staff in supporting vulnerable children.</p> <p>  As has been outlined this morning, if some GALs could earn as much as &euro;300,000 in a single year, something was seriously wrong.  Spending on legal fees increased from &euro;11.9 million in 2013 to &euro;16 million in 2014.  To put that &euro;16 million into context, when we introduced that child care Bill, which was eventually brought to the floor in July 2015, the previous budget had left Tusla &euro;18 million short in meeting day-to-day running costs resulting in cuts to rape crisis centres and domestic support services in that year.  It is clear that the exorbitant fees for legal representation were a gross waste of public money with Tusla facing many challenges.  I am glad that the opening statements today acknowledged the need for that to be tackled.</p><p>When the Minister was questioned in the D&aacute;il 18 months ago, he could not provide the information on exactly what had been paid out to individual GALs.  The financial system of Tusla did not have the details of the number of individual GALs involved, despite the exorbitant fees being paid out under the scheme.  Given all of this and to inform budgeting, how is demand for the service currently forecast?</p></speech>

It is a demand-led scheme because individual courts and judges make a decision on the circumstances in which they will assign GALs.  The overall level of expenditure has not fluctuated enormously in the past three years and has been between &euro;14 million and &euro;16 million, but that is not to say it is okay.  However, in the current environment it is very difficult to forecast future demand.  Tusla can operate on the overall assumption that expenditure will broadly be the same as in the previous year and this has been the case in the past three years.  The improved data being collected by it will enable us to improve the position to some extent, but for as long as we have a system that is demand led, it will be extremely difficult to forecast accurately what expenditure will be.  The focus has to be on managing and controlling costs as much as possible, both GAL and legal fees.</p></speech>

That feeds into another question.  He also responded to questions about implementation and working in parallel with the legislation as it proceeds this year.  If the Department forecasts the passing and introduction of legislation in the autumn of this year, will it be ready to move on the introduction of the systems to which the Chairman referred?</p></speech>

The procurement process will take a number of months and cannot kick in until after the legislation has been enacted.  We will have the request for tender documentation and all of the preparatory work done at the same time, but there will be a number of months under the normal procurement rules during which the process will proceed.  If all goes well, implementation is expected to occur during the course of 2018.</p></speech>

Dr. Lynch says the scheme is demand-led and that he is working on previous years' figures.  He said that, at best, there was stagnation in demand for the services, but there has been an increase in some areas.  What dangers are vulnerable children facing in these cases?  Is the Department playing a proactive role in trying to bring down and eliminate the numbers presenting each year and, if so, how?</p></speech>

A critical difference between the existing and new systems is the uncertainty attaching to whether a GAL will be appointed under the current system, while under the new one, the legislation states there will be an assumption that a GAL will be allocated or appointed in all circumstances, unless the court determines otherwise.  If it decides a GAL does not need to be appointed, it will have to give reasons in public for this.  Under the new system, all vulnerable children will have access to GAL services, unless the court makes a specific decision to the contrary.</p></speech>

The GAL system is not the only way we support the most vulnerable children.  The Department puts huge emphasis on prevention and early intervention.  Tusla implements parenting programmes such as the prevention, parenting and family support programme, PPFS, which we support and is hugely important for children.  We also have the Children First legislation which we are working to implement.  One the top priorities for the Department is to put in place all of the mechanisms required to implement the Children First Act 2015 which concerns mandatory reporting and related provisions.  We are also reviewing the Child Care Act 1991.  We are taking a much broader approach than purely the GAL system, important as it is, in order to help all children but specifically those who are most vulnerable.</p></speech>

It has come from nowhere in the past two decades but has come under huge pressure because of the demands of parents and pressure exerted by the Government.  Schemes are being rolled out at a quick rate all over the country, but the required staff cannot be found for these services.  As the Department is also rolling out the second free preschool year, can Dr. Lynch say the staff have been adequately trained to identify potential cases of neglect and abuse?  Other committees have seen the extent of neglect in nursing homes at the other end of the age spectrum, but this is an embryonic system which is going through massive change.</p><p>The Department is putting serious pressure on early years centres to roll out a second year.  I am asking about the quality and training of the staff in terms of identifying potential neglect and abuse.  Is Dr. Lynch satisfied that the Department is giving adequate support to the private and community sectors?  Dr. Lynch referred to prevention and early intervention.  This is one of the greatest fears of staff when it comes to reporting problems.  Mostly, it is young women in their early 20s who work in the sector.  It is a major issue.  There is a fear associated with reporting.  There is a problem with the procedures and training necessary to identify issues.</p></speech>

We lay a major emphasis on child protection and child training throughout the system.  Deputy Cassells is absolutely right.  The early years service is being expanded significantly.  In fact, the budget for these areas has increased by approximately &euro;85 million during the past two years.  The affordable child care scheme is in preparation at the moment.  A critical requirement is to have adequate and appropriate resources for training for child care providers.  That is part of the package we are putting in place.  We lay a major emphasis on that.</p> <p>  As with all other people working with children, they will be subject to the mandatory reporting system, the Children First system and so on.  Fortunately, we are able to look at implementing Children First and the expansion of services now that resources have started to flow to those areas.  One critical point is to ensure appropriate training for providers of services.  It is not only a matter of training as support is vital as well.  Those involved need to be able to deal with difficult cases.  People may be unsure of the threshold of the reportability of a particular case, what steps or action they need to take and whether they should be concerned in a particular case.</p></speech>

Specifically, they have been protesting about the pressures they are under and the fact that the sector is especially subject to extremely low pay.  This is clear when one examines what these young professionals are being paid and the demands, in terms of the attainment of qualifications to work in the sector, now being placed on them by the Department.  Something has to give.  The question I am asking is whether enough support is being provided to these young professionals to get the training and go on to work in a high-stress job.  The Department expects them to identify potential neglect and abuse for young children.  What are they getting in return?</p></speech>

The first is training relating specifically to child protection and supports.  The second, in respect of which we are unashamedly applying pressure, relates to training to be child care specialists.  I make no apology for the latter because of the importance of having appropriately qualified and trained people to work with our youngest children.</p> <p>  We are supporting both.  In the case of child care providers, for example, we have a learner fund which we have funded in recent years as well as other supports.  We have laid great emphasis on training of that kind to be given to children.  This expands well beyond child protection.  This is the training we need to give and should give to early years providers across the board.  We have a major project in place to implement the various provisions from the budget.  Specifically, these include the affordable child care scheme and the amalgamation of the existing early years payments into an affordable child care scheme.  The extension of what was known as the free preschool year into effectively two years is another measure.  We are not simply providing money purely for the cost of providing the service.  We are also supporting other key components, including training and support.  I am conscious that those in the sector see themselves as low paid, and they are low paid.  A challenge for us in that context is that we are not the direct employers.</p></speech>

While it is not best practice in the sense of seeing a potential conflict of interest between the payer, Tusla, and the providers of the service, namely, the guardians <i>ad litem</i>, I do not think there has been any suggestion that Tusla has acted inappropriately or has deliberately restricted payments from guardians <i>ad litem</i>when it did not like what they were doing.</p></speech>

I welcome the response of Dr. Lynch.</p><p>Mr. McBride referred to the range of payments made to guardians in his response to questions.  For 2015, we use figure 11.1.  Is that the correct breakdown?  We got clarification earlier.  Under that figure, professional fees were &euro;8.2 million in 2015.  Is that correct?  We have 65 guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  My calculator tells me that the average is &euro;126,000.</p><p>Mr. McBride then said that the range was from &euro;40,000 to &euro;240,000.  That is extraordinary.  Any time I see a range of that amount, alarm bells go off.  The amount of &euro;240,000 is seven times the average industrial wage.

As we have seen, the range is very high.  Why only 60?  I am also looking at the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which states Ireland does not compare favourably with the UK and has the lowest numbers of guardians <i>ad litem</i>per 10,000 children at 0.54.  Is it a closed shop?  It is extraordinary that it is so small in number, given the volume of children who need to be represented.  Then we look at the scale of money being made.  Will Mr. McBride enlighten me on why this is the case?</p></speech>

Given that there has been no regulation of the system and there has been no regulation of qualifications, experience and the type of people who might be suitable to be guardians <i>ad litem</i>, I would say perhaps the Deputy is right that the group is a closed shop.  It is certainly self-selecting.  They select themselves and put themselves forward to be guardians <i>ad litem</i>and this is simply the number who have done so.  Without a proper system to determine whether they are qualified, experienced or suitable we have what we have.  I agree with the Deputy's point; it is a point of major reform.</p></speech>

Obviously we welcome these changes, but it is very difficult to accept anything other than an absolute failure on behalf of the Department to ensure there were any sufficient levels of checks and balances in place.  It is quite extraordinary when we look at the range of criticisms, from the small number of people involved, the range of money they received, the volume of money they received, the problems relating to legal costs and the lack of appropriate tendering processes.  With respect, Dr. Lynch would have to accept this was a massive monumental failure on behalf of the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.369" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fergal Lynch" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#R01900"><p>The best way to describe this is it has been an extremely difficult situation which we inherited and of which we were acutely aware from the time the Department was established.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established in 2011.  Tusla was established in 2014.  We were faced with a range of other priorities, and I do not say this by way of justification but by way of fact.  When the Department was established, our first obligation was our establishment and to ensure we were properly functioning.  We spent the early years putting in place the child and family agency, established in 2014.  We then dealt with a wide range of other significant and costly priorities, for example, a Deputy mentioned funding for Tusla in its early years and the challenges it faced.  We were looking at &euro;600 million or &euro;650 million worth of expenditure.  Deputy Cassells mentioned the early years payments and the extent to which they have expanded.  These payments are now worth more than &euro;400 million.  When we combine these two elements and the expenditure on them, we were obliged, in my view, to focus on getting those right.  We were acutely aware of the unsatisfactory nature of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service, but to be honest I do not feel we could have done everything at once.  We started this process in 2013 and 2014, and work was being done on this throughout this period.</p></speech>

We cannot stray into policy.  It is not our role to stray into what possible future changes will be made.  It is a matter for the Department and the Minister.  Dr. Lynch offered some possibilities of change, with regard to making this a more professional and good quality service.  I fully support this.  This is a vital step forward in children's rights and ensuring children have legal representation, and I fully support this.  I would favour a professional good quality service that is properly regulated, whatever form it takes.  I would favour having people who are salaried.  I will not get into this because it is a matter of policy.  The process completely lacks sanctions and having coercive mechanisms in place to deal with failures.  Absolutely no sanction was in place.  The Department was not even able to establish whether there was any wrongdoing.  Whatever changes are put in place, will Dr. Lynch talk me through potential sanctions and oversight?  It cannot just be a slap on the wrist.  We have had far too much of this in the past.  It must be robust.  Has this element been examined?</p></speech>

There will have to be a substantial, significant well worked out service level agreement between the Minister, the Department and the national service provider.  This would provide for a range of issues, including the basis on which the service is provided, payments, the requirement for the service provider to provide all necessary information relating to the quality of the service, the type of service and the volume of the service.  Training will be absolutely vital to the process.</p><p>There will also be a quality element built into it in terms of enabling us and requiring the service level provider itself to review its own work and to ensure that both the quality and the cost-effectiveness of it is appropriate.  We will also consult with the courts.  We have been talking to the Department of Justice and Equality and we have been speaking informally to the Courts Service.  When one has a proper framework of legislation, the type of concerns that the Deputy has rightly described can be addressed.</p></speech>

With respect, we have had issues with service level agreements, SLAs, with the HSE in the past.  The problem then was a lack of sanctions that could be put in place.  What penalties or punitive action can be taken in the event of non-compliance?  Dr. Lynch might not have a response but I just ask that the issue would be given due consideration.  Otherwise, we will be back here again asking the same questions.  I urge Dr. Lynch to bear that in mind.</p></speech>

We examined it in the context of the 2014 statements of Tusla, which were its first financial statements or rather the financial statements of its first year in operation.

It was distributed throughout the country.  When we started to look at Tusla, we identified this line of expenditure and then we wanted to look at the controls that were in place around the expenditure.  We did make recommendations in 2015 but they were in the form of points in a letter to the management of Tusla, which it acted on.</p></speech>

The witnesses are all very welcome.  It is a very positive service at its best.  It is a wonderful service.  It is a sign of a civilised society that we are prepared to appoint guardians <i>ad litem</i>to children who are in very vulnerable positions.  The best and most positive change is the fact that there will be a presumption on which judges will have to act.  That is a huge change.</p><p>Having said those positive things I must continue in another vein.  I read that we have the lowest number of guardians <i>ad litem</i>with the least regulation of any country.  The system is <i>ad hoc</i>and unregulated and neither the role nor the service is defined.  All the negative things have been said.  The witnesses have come in here today, put their hands up and they accept the recommendations from the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is great.  That is a good start.</p><p>Having said that, it beggars belief that there is no internal mechanism within the Department&rsquo;s system to signal a problem.  I fully understand that Tusla has no legal right whatsoever in regard to the service.  It is simply the paymaster.  What about the service's own internal system?  Ultimately, we are completely reliant on the Comptroller and Auditor General to go in, identify a problem and come before us.  That is a good system but where is the local responsibility and internal control mechanisms?</p></speech>

As the Comptroller and Auditor General said, however, the service tended to operate under the radar in terms of identifying it as a separate item of expenditure.  It really came to the surface more sharply when we carved out the expenditure for children and youth affairs into a separate Vote.  I accept everything Deputy Connolly said.  It was extremely unsatisfactory.  All I can say now is that we are working to address the issue as rapidly as possible.  It is a complex system and it will take some time but we are working our way through it.</p></speech>

We might come back to that issue.  It is also a very sad situation because on the basic figures we have, as has already been pointed out, Dublin gets the best representation.  We are utterly dependent on child care law reports.  Dublin got 70% of the guardians appointed, Cork got 17% and Galway city got 13%.  We have a large proportion of children without representation in court or without a guardian <i>ad litem</i>.  That is the first point.  Second, that has saved the bacon of Tusla and the HSE because if judges had appointed more guardians <i>ad litem</i>, they would be in serious trouble because the cost would be off the chart.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

The demand-led nature of the scheme is such that this is what influences the costs.  Under the current system, if the service had been assigned to the entire country at the same rate as in Dublin, the overall cost would no doubt have been more expensive.  I stress that is under the current payment mechanism.  We are now talking pretty much about having a GAL for all children whose case is the subject of a court care order hearing, which will mean far more GALs will be required, but under a different payment system.</p></speech>

We must have them but it is a reflection of a breakdown in society.  It is also a reflection of money going in at the end rather than the beginning.  Dr. Lynch stated that the service is committed to prevention.  That certainly has not been my experience.  I do not blame those involved in the service in the sense that it is Government policy.  For example, people in Galway are struggling at every level to provide a preventative service.  We will have to put more money in at the end of the process, in court, which is very difficult while the money is not being put into the preventative sector.  Perhaps Dr. Lynch would like to comment on that.</p></speech>

I do not say that the total cost of the new GAL service under a service provider will be exactly the same as it currently is, but our aim is to rebalance the expenditure so that the total does not go up substantially in order to meet the additional GAL numbers.  What we want to do is rebalance between legal and GAL costs in order that the overall cost is more manageable.  I do not say it will be precisely the same figure but we will have to budget for it.</p></speech>

I would have the most serious concerns about that policy.  I think that Dr. Lynch is caught in a crisis and that he is reacting.  There was the most serious publicity in yesterday's paper, the Committee of Public Accounts today, the report from the Comptroller and Auditor General, and his own internal analysis.  I think that he is reacting in a crisis, and he is rushing in to privatise a service.  From my experience on this committee, I do not think that is the right way to proceed.  He is doing it in the absence of enough data.</p> <p>  I have a specific question about the Courts Service.  Why can the judges in the court system not give Dr. Lynch the figures of how many guardians have been appointed?</p></speech>

For instance, with the crisis, the Government directed the county registers that in each case of possession that came before them, they were to identify whether it was the family home.  That policy direction was issued very quickly.  Why has a policy direction not gone to the courts system requesting it to advise exactly how many guardians have been appointed?</p></speech>

Dr. Lynch has no sense of something, which tells me that either he is under-resourced or under pressure and reacting to a very serious situation where we have an unregulated guardian <i>ad litem</i>service.

We had a major consultation process with all of the major stakeholders.  We had 26 written, detailed submissions from all the stakeholders, ranging from the Judiciary to the courts system to people like the Children's Rights Alliance, to Empowering People in Care, EPIC, to a range of other providers, all involved in the service.  We set out for them a range of options under each of these headings, asking what they thought we should do.  We analysed the views and the submissions put forward on that basis.  I do not think we are flying solo in the sense of just seeking an alternative and hoping that it will work.  This has been the result of a good deal of analysis over the last while.  I accept that there will be debate along the way as to what constitutes the best type of service provider, if there should always be a guardian<i>ad litem</i>, and if there should always be legal support.  Despite everything that has been said this morning about legal support and the cost of it, some will still argue that every guardian<i>ad litem</i>should have legal support.  We are not accepting that, and we are offering a different approach.</p></speech>

We, at Tusla, have not done that specific analysis, and as we have already acknowledged, the actual numbers of guardians <i>ad litem</i>are quite small.  We have done analysis, of course, of our general turnover of staff, and the rate at which we need to replace them.  We are conscious within that, that working at the coal-face of child protection is exceptionally stressful.  In recent times, we have been looking at not just recruitment measures, but retention measures and how we can support staff to stay in practice, to stay in front-line services, particularly in child protection.  However, if the Deputy's question is how many child protection workers we are losing to guardian<i>s ad litem, </i>we have not done that specific analysis, but as we have already acknowledged, the numbers of guardians<i>ad litem</i>is very small in any event.</p></speech>

I think that we are going to have to.  If we - I have a slightly different view about this - are going to move towards a presumption of every child in court proceedings having a guardian<i>ad litem</i>, then clearly there are going to be more of them.  Yet if it is proposed that they must have a qualification in social work, then there are only so many social workers available and only so many social workers graduate every year in Ireland.  Therefore there is a real danger that we will lose these.  The stipulation in the new legislation will be that they will have to be five years qualified.  We will not lose them to new graduates.  Eventually there is a risk that we will lose front-line child protection social workers to what is perhaps seen as an easier business.</p></speech>

My predecessor, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, negotiated a rate with GALs of &euro;125 per hour.  I do not want to be pejorative about that, but previously I think GALs were charging a whole variation of fees.  Under the HSE system, as far as I know, these fees were negotiated locally with health boards and social work teams and departments.  It was very <i>ad hoc</i>.</p></speech>

It was very <i>ad hoc</i>.  At least we have tried since Tusla came into being to standardise that rate.  One could argue that it is too high but we have a rationale for how it was arrived at.  We were not able to set it, however, but had to negotiate it.  The GALs got around a table with Tusla and negotiated and accepted a rate.  We took away the hourly payment they had previously received for the time they were travelling.  We negotiated a stop to that.</p></speech>

Certainly, it is one of my major concerns as is the presumption of appointing a GAL in every case.  It may not be necessary.  Some young people can speak for themselves perfectly well and perfectly articulately.  If we can arrive at a decision without adding to the process, we should do that.  My main concern and that of Tusla is that there is a child in the midst of this process who may be very uncertain about his or her future.  He or she may not know whether he or she is coming or going.  That is extremely damaging, potentially, to children.  Therefore, our starting point from a service-provider point of view is that delays should be minimised where possible.  Quite how the new proposals are going to address that, I am not sure.  We need to get into some of the detail of that.</p></speech>

I was not involved in it but I could not honestly say it was designed and thought through.  All that happened was that section 26 was included to provide for the appointment of a GAL where a child was not party to proceedings and where the court was satisfied that it was necessary in the interests of the child to have one.  The section also provided that the costs incurred by the GAL would be paid by the then-health boards, which role has been taken over by Tusla.  That, as I understand it, was the extent of the thinking that went into the legislation at the time.  It was very basic.</p></speech>

The absence, according to the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, of access to key data means the demand for the service cannot be estimated.  We are talking about extending it to a wider group as part of the legislation.  We compare unfavourably to other jurisdictions.  If one looks at new institutional arrangements which we introduce in this country, one sees that we are very poor at it.  We do not take the evidence-based approach, which is the way things work in other countries.  In terms of the points Deputy Catherine Connolly has been making about pre-empting institutional design, the Department is behind the curve in terms of scenario-testing and what might be good institutional arrangements into the future given the experience of the past.</p> <p>  The Secretary General in his statement said the new service would be established over time and that other options can be examined as appropriate including, for example, establishing it within a proposed family court system or as a separate public body or placing it within an existing statutory structure.  I would have thought at this point that the Department would have looked at those scenarios and determined a favoured approach.  It appears that the Department is going to approach it in a way that is not ideal by virtue of the fact that it is not clear about the system it is designing.  We could be back here in five years' time talking about the very same issue at the Committee of Public Accounts of value for money in respect of what is a very small amount of money that has to be spent.  The money we spend on children is not a lot anyway but we could be back talking about the same thing if this design is not right from the word go or if there is not at least a lead in towards something that is the ideal.  It does not strike me that the Department is ahead of the curve on that.</p></speech>

There is no absolute agreement among the stakeholders about what the best way to go is under a number of headings.  We have had to make judgment calls including in relation to the legal situation and supports, when GALs should or should not be appointed and also in respect of the type of body that should function.  Our concern was to address the areas most requiring immediate reform, to put in place a nationally organised system, ensure professional practice, establish an in-house legal facility and to clarify the formal role and function in the legislation of a GAL, which last matter we have not said too much about.  All the things can be put in place and need to be as quickly as possible.  We will not simply rest on our laurels when that is done but will be looking at what the most appropriate body for the future should be.</p> <p>  We have got to this stage and I do not claim for a moment that the legislation is perfect and finalised and absolutely ready to go.  However, it is a substantial step forward from where we have been.  It offers a very good basis for improving the current service and allows us to move forward in relation to looking at alternative permanent structures, including a public body.  There is scope to put that body within the family court system albeit the Government has not made a decision on that.  The family court system is at a certain stage of development and needs further work.  Rather than waiting to see if that is going to be the solution, we are anxious to move forward with everything else.  This is a means to move forward with as much as we can of the reform programme.  I assure the Deputy that we will be looking at the public body component as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It does look a bit like a cartel, however, and it is very hard then to design an institutional framework coming from that scenario.  Has this been looked at in relation to the challenge that will pose?</p></speech>

There are only about 65 guardians <i>ad litem</i>, GALs, which is a relatively small number, but I think that with a national service provider and the fact that we will be providing GAL services for more children means that we will need more GALs, and that reduces the danger of a cartel or a closed shop.  The fact that a service provider will be responsible for identifying each appropriate GAL, for making sure that they are properly trained, and the fact that they have to have certain qualifications and experience, will be helpful in this regard.  The last thing we want is some form of closed shop, but we do want expertise and quality.  The danger at the moment is almost from the opposite direction.  I am not casting aspersions on any GALs, but the danger is that given the looseness with which it is possible to appoint a GAL, it is conceivable, although I am not saying that it happens, that a GAL would not have the qualifications and experience that one would like.  In the new system, they will.  It is also important to say that the service provider will have to report to the Department in terms of its overall offerings, and in terms of the quality and the type of service that it offers.</p></speech>

I could envisage a situation where there would be very large operations from outside the State that have experience of this kind of thing.  The Chairman alluded to this earlier, but if we are going to encourage a group of people to tender, establish an office and employ people, it then almost becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy in terms of the institutional arrangement that we will have, and we are talking about an overhead cost of something like 38%, according to Barnardos.  We will end up on the reverse side of it where we will be talking about people losing their jobs, and pressure is applied.  The formulation of the terms of preference for the procurement will be very important.  What work has been done on that?  Some of this will happen quite quickly.</p></speech>

We have started some work.  The points that the Deputy made are very important, particularly in terms of when we move to a transition from a service provider to a public body.  There will be implications for everybody involved, including those employed.  Whatever system we have there will always be care orders and there will always be need for a GAL service.  Whether they are employed by a service provider or through some other mechanism, I do not envisage that this would involve substantial job losses for a large number of people.  The expertise that the GALs have will be required in whatever structure that we use.</p></speech>

I heard about this meeting two weeks ago.  The timing was maybe fortuitous.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.459" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#V01100"><p>We are pleased with that, in any event.  Having listened to you, I am not clear on the thinking behind this.  I will take two examples of what you just said and we will deal with them one by one.  You said that with more GALs in the system the service could be increased and there would be no closed shop, and there will not be a cartel.  You said something like that just a moment ago.  However, the essence of what you are doing is creating a monopoly service by having one national service provider.  It was said that there will be no cartel, but when what is being done is examined you are specifically creating a monopoly, because only one public service provider will be in charge.  How can those two statements be reconciled?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.460" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Fergal Lynch" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017011900002#V01200"><p>I do not think that they conflict, with respect, Chairman.  It was described as a monopoly, but one of the big concerns we have is a complete absence of regulation of the current system.  Whether it is a monopoly in terms of a single provider, which is a private provider, or whether we were in a position to set up a public provider, the same charge could perhaps be levelled, that the only GAL service that will be available in the future is under this body.  I am not sure I accept the idea that it is a monopoly.  Yes, it is a provider, but with good reason, and unless people strongly disagree, I think there is a strong argument for a single provider of this service, rather than allowing the current situation to continue, or rather than allowing, for example, five or six different firms or providers to provide this.  The big value of this is economies of scale.</p></speech>

You gave a flavour of what will be in the legislation.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report refers to section 1 of the Children's Act, advisory board guidelines, giving advice to children's wishes, feelings and interests, of May 2009.  That group was abolished in 2011.  It talks about the qualifications and training for GALs.  It looks as though the legislation is substantially a transcription of the document that was abolished five years ago.  I find it strange in that there is a proposal from your office to your Minister to agree to the heads of a Bill when you say you have not worked out the question of whether it will be operating within the family courts, whether it will be established as a separate body, or whether it will be placed within an existing statutory structure.  It is not known where this is going to go, and yet the heads of a Bill were out yesterday.  I am saying that this sounds like more of an <i>ad hoc</i>approach in that you know the details of what a GAL should do, but we do not know the structure.  That means that you will be back here.  It does not look as if there is a comprehensive picture of where this is going.  I would ask you to consider that.  It is a slight criticism of the report.</p></speech>

Rather than saying that we do not know where we want to go, we are very clear that the fastest, most efficient way of addressing the situation at the moment is through a national service provider, and the second stage would be a public body.  I believe it would take longer if we wait for a public body to be set up, and if we are waiting for that, then all the other reforms that we are concerned about, such as the regulation, the selection and the quality of service, cannot be addressed either.  This is a two-stage way of doing as much as we can early on.</p></speech>

The first stage is the procurement, the second stage is the new legislation and the third stage is the further legislation required in relation to the structure and where it is going to be placed, be that in the Courts Service or somewhere else.  That has not even been decided yet by the Government in the heads of the Bill.  You are going ahead with the guidelines for recruitment and training for GALs.  The big questions are unanswered.  Will that be in this Bill?  Will it be a two-stage process or will we be back for further legislation in relation to the statutory placing of this?</p></speech>

I ask the Department to do a favour, not for me, but for the children.  Dr. Lynch mentioned the possibility that this service could end up within the courts system.  That is no place for a structure for vulnerable children to be.  It is not acceptable that before they even start the process, they are part of the courts structure.  It is not child-friendly.  We have talked about administrative convenience and why we are where we are regarding the payment.  If the Department is here in the interests of the children, I ask it not to lob the administrative convenience system in as part of the Courts Service.  It is the wrong place to tell children in a vulnerable situation where they will be going.  Of course there will be interaction, but they should not be placed in the Courts Service.</p><p>I ask the Department to do us all a second favour.  I ask it to give in the new legislation what it calls a guardian <i>ad litem</i>an English name that people can understand.  I do not want to see the term &quot;guardian <i>ad litem</i>&quot; in legislation.  We had a debate yesterday about guardians <i>ad litem</i>and guardians <i>ad</i>whatever.  We are semi-educated people in this committee.  That phrase should not be used with children.  The Department should at least speak to them in their language and use an English term.  It is only a small point-----</p></speech>

The only part of it I did not like was that part in which he talked about the need for significant reform, which he mentioned at the beginning of his statement.  He said that one of the issues is that the service is essentially demand led and determined by decision of the courts, as if that is in some way a disadvantage.  It should be demand led.  The Department should not restrict the demand for services that are required for vulnerable children.  Dr. Lynch has referred to this demand-led nature as one of the negatives.  I thank God the service is demand led.  If the Accounting Officer had control over it and it were not demand led, I would be afraid that children would just be put on a waiting list as in everything else.  It must be a demand-led service.  It cannot be the case, as happens in the HSE, that a person is placed on a waiting list for two years.  I will come back to this in a moment.  The witnesses understand my point.  The demand-led nature of the service is a positive, but Dr. Lynch seems to think in his Department that because of the cost, it is a negative.</p><p>I want to ask Dr. Lynch a few basic questions about the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service to get the basics right, even though they might be slightly legalistic.  Who appoints the individual guardian <i>ad litem</i>in a court in Limerick or Thurles or Galway?</p></speech>

The opening paragraph of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report refers to the fact that the views of the child are held in public family law proceedings.  Are guardians <i>ad litem</i>appointed in private family law cases in the family law courts?</p></speech>

Will Dr. Lynch explain this to the public?  I will speak as a layperson.  When we hear about vulnerable children, custody battles and so on, we assume that family law courts are generally <i>in camera</i>and that much of the proceedings in question are held <i>in camera</i>.  Dr. Lynch now seems to be saying this guardian <i>ad litem</i>service is only for the public courts service.  Surely, however, there are many cases in family law courts, like those I have just mentioned, that are being held <i>in camera</i>and in which the child's voice should be heard as well.  What happens in such cases?  I ask Dr. Lynch to explain this to me.</p></speech>

In the public law system, guardian <i>ad litem</i>is applied.  In the private law system, however, the cases are of a different type and generally involve custody, access and so on, and there is no provision in the legislation for guardians <i>ad litem</i>to be appointed.  There is, however, provision in the Children and Family Relationships Act to appoint what I think are described as child views experts.  They are appointed, in a not dissimilar manner to the idea of a guardian <i>ad litem</i>in a public system, to listen to the views of the child.</p></speech>

There is a provision for them to be in place, but they will have to be paid for by the families themselves.  There is no public provision at the moment, unless perhaps legal aid is involved.</p></speech>

I am hearing that we are only talking about a segment of cases involving vulnerable children that are heard in public.

We are only now hearing the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service does not cover juvenile courts or family law courts, that these experts will be established, that families who possibly cannot afford to pay for their legal costs in the family law courts are being told to pay for these experts, and the only cases we have been talking about are the vulnerable children - Dr. Lynch used the phrase - in public.  These are only the cases we know about.  What about all the hidden cases?  The Department is only dealing with part of the problem.</p></speech>

I am referring to public law, that is, cases in which the State is involved, as opposed to private law, or cases in which the State has no direct involvement.  I would like to clarify that from a policy perspective, the 1991 Act is all about public law, in other words, the State's involvement with children.  That is why the guardian <i>ad litem </i>system which emerged from the legislation deals only with public cases, that is, public law, as opposed to private law cases.  I can give the Chairman note on this.  I should say the private law issue is one for the Department of Justice and Equality and I am not trying to pawn it off on that Department.  We are in discussion with the Department about it.  One of the observations that I think was given to us is that we need very much to join up the types of guardian <i>ad litem </i>or child law expert or child views expert or whoever that are put in place in the private system.</p><p>They need to be properly joined up and the regulation of them should be properly joined up.  That is one of the things we are working towards.  We are conscious there are different circumstances, different types of cases and probably different qualifications.  For example, in a private law case involving access, one almost certainly would not need a social worker or a psychologist with five years' postgraduate experience whereas clearly one does in a care order type case.  They are different types of cases and they are treated differently at the moment but I absolutely accept they need to be joined up.  </p></speech>

We are talking about public law proceedings involving the State and vulnerable children who are before the courts.  They are probably some of the most vulnerable children yet Dr. Lynch is telling me that the guardian <i>ad litem</i>service, which exists to speak up for the child, does not even exist in such cases.  How did the Department choose to exclude the juvenile courts?</p></speech>

It is fine to talk to the consultants, professional and representative bodies, trade unions, judges, the Courts Service, Tusla and everybody involved, but how about talking to the people who have been through it?  I suggest that at this stage, before Dr. Lynch does his parliamentary legal scrutiny, or whatever the next phase of this legislation is, he needs to get some honest testimonials from people.

There is a deficiency in the public consultation to date which I hope will be corrected before the legislation proceeds because I would like it to be done.

She directly interviewed children and young people and that informed the Department's thinking on areas of reform.  While we could not at the time consult directly with children, we do a lot of consultation as a Department with children.  We have a participation unit that does that.  We used Carmel Corrigan's work and we were also very conscious of the contacts we had with organisations that deal directly with children.</p></speech>

He might not have thought some of it was directly related but it has followed through everything we have discussed here in public session.  I learned something here today about who is eligible for guardian <i>ad litem</i>, or GAL, as Dr. Lynch refers to it, which is a term I hope I do not see in the new legislation, as I have said.</p><p>Dr. Lynch will send the note to us.  It is a benefit to the public as it presumes that we are dealing with all vulnerable children in the courts.  Pardon my ignorance, but it is a good day when we learn something new.  Are there other questions?</p></speech>

Safeguarders, as they are called in other jurisdictions, are appointed for specific reasons, usually where it is deemed there is a conflict of interest.  Otherwise, they are not.

There was an appalling lack of checks, balances and controls in place for far too long so it is good we have shone a spotlight on that.  There will be opportunities with the new legislation and I welcome much of what has been said.  I would like clarification on one issue.  I have no difficulty with a single service provider in principle and much of the padding around that which has been discussed is good as well.  What is the problem with establishing it as a separate public body?  This may have been asked as I had to step out to a different sectoral committee.  Why is it so problematic and why does this not form part of the legislation?</p></speech>

I will introduce my colleagues - Mr. John Hogan is from our banking division, Mr. John McCarthy, is our chief economist, and Mr. Derek Tierney and Mr. Aidan Murphy are from corporate affairs.</p> <p>  The Department's mission is to manage the Government finances and play a central role in the achievement of the Government's economic and social goals.  To bring the greatest possible focus to the strategy, we have adopted two strategic goals from which flow our detailed business plans, HR strategies and organisational structure.  These goals are a sustainable macroeconomic environment and sound public finances; and a balanced and equitable economy enabled by a restructured, vibrant, secure and well-regulated financial sector.  Everything that we do derives from these strategic goals.</p> <p>  In delivering on them, we provide independent, impartial and well-informed, evidence-based advice to the Minister and the Government.  This will concentrate on the most appropriate fiscal policy to maintain solid economic growth and the policies that will ensure that Ireland's financial system can operate on a stable, sustainable and commercial basis.</p> <p>  I will briefly comment on how we organise the Department and the importance of its people, good governance and openness in our business as the means by which we support our strategic objectives.  Our organisational structure derives directly from the two strategic goals.  Accordingly, the Department is arranged into two directorates.  The economic and fiscal directorate reports on a day-to-day basis to me.  It includes the economic, tax, EU and international divisions along with facilities management, corporate affairs and human resources.  The finance and banking directorate reports on day-to-day business to the second Secretary General.  It includes the banking and financial services divisions, the risk and stability division, the shareholding management unit and the legal and finance units.</p> <p>  The structure is not fixed and evolves according to needs and emerging priorities.  It is key to the proper administration of the functions entrusted to the Department that there is clarity about individual roles and responsibilities.  This clarity is provided by the senior management team.  Indeed, the executive board is currently in the middle of a manpower and organisational review of the finance and banking directorate.</p> <p>  Our success in achieving the goals we set will depend on our people.  They are at the centre of everything we do.  The senior management team is focused on enhancing and developing skills and capability throughout the Department to allow us to perform better not just as individuals, but as teams.  Our strategy, specifically and importantly, acknowledges the need for integration between HR management and business strategy.  The Department has been criticised in the past for deficits in its skill levels.  The orientation of our HR efforts are to ensure that we recruit and equip our staff with the knowledge, skills and expertise appropriate to their current roles while facilitating personal development and career opportunities.</p> <p>  To this end, the Department, through the implementation of our learning and development strategy, has created and offers professional diploma courses as follows: a diploma in tax policy and practice; a diploma in financial services; and a certified diploma in project management.  We are also developing in-house core economics modules for implementation during 2017.  These formal learning courses are or will be available to all staff.  Currently, a staff of just over 300 hold almost 600 accredited qualifications, of which approximately one quarter are at postgraduate level or above.</p> <p>  We also go beyond simply developing "hard skills" by building leadership capability throughout the Department.  In addition to coaching, mentoring and leadership programmes, we have recently introduced a process that aids personal development by helping staff to identify and adapt behaviours in order to achieve their objectives.</p> <p>  Since my appointment as Secretary General, I have sought to promote good corporate governance and compliance in the Department.  This has included the development and publication of our corporate governance framework, which informed the development of a common corporate governance standard for the Civil Service.  The key objective was to bring clarity to how the Department was structured, directed, controlled and managed in addition to the roles of individual senior managers, and saw the evolution of the old management advisory committee into an executive board.  The board operates to the principles of shared participation and personal and corporate responsibility for the operational success of the entire Department.  To ensure that each executive board member has a stake in the corporate and operational success of the Department, members have been assigned corporate-related responsibilities in addition to their normal policy areas to ensure shared responsibility across the board.</p> <p>  The Department is committed to delivering information and policy in as open a way as possible, consistent with the law, and to the regular and timely publication of internal technical studies, policy reviews and other relevant statements, papers, reports and action plans.  Extensive engagement with stakeholders, think tanks and other experts inevitably helps to improve the quality of our policy advice.</p> <p>  We have sought to improve the evidence base available on macroeconomic and tax policy changes with a view to improving the quality of policy advice.  To this end, a joint research programme was agreed with the ESRI in early 2015.  Specifically, joint research was commissioned through the programme well in advance of the UK's referendum on EU membership.  Identified as a major strategic risk, it was important that an economic framework be developed and widely and publicly disseminated.</p> <p>  The Department conducts a wide range of public consultations to ensure that stakeholders are taken into account in policy development.  We actively respond to consultations from other Departments and public bodies, such as the Central Bank review of the macro-prudential residential mortgage lending measures.  As part of normal business, we processed 405 freedom of information requests, 2,500 parliamentary questions and 4,500 ministerial representations from stakeholders in 2016.</p> <p>  To enhance openness and transparency, the Department publishes the Minister's appointment diary, my appointment diary and the minutes of all executive board meetings.  We also publish and intend to publish minutes arising from our interinstitutional arrangements, such as the Revenue liaison group, which is a quarterly meeting between me, the second Secretary General and the Revenue Commissioners, and the newly formed financial stability group, formerly the principals group, which involves senior persons in the Central Bank and the National Treasury Management Agency.</p> <p>  We will continue to adapt and improve our operating model so that our organisational structure, accountabilities and responsibilities, along with the right people, processes and technology, work together to support strategic priorities over the next three years.  I would be happy to discuss any of these matters and welcome questions from the committee.</p></speech>

As far back as late 2014, we were preparing for the risk - it was only that back then - of Brexit.  We engaged with the ESRI to examine what the macroeconomic implications might be so that we would have a framework in the event of Brexit.  Building on that work, we published a joint paper on the impact of various types of Brexit.  With the budget, we published information on where the greatest sectoral impacts would lie.  Flowing from that work, the ESRI has examined the possible impacts of a WTO tariffs regime.</p><p>Institutionally, a Brexit unit has been set up within the Department, headed by a principal officer.  Staffing of that unit will evolve as the business evolves, although there are already a couple of staff assigned to it.  We have also increased the number of staff we have in Brussels.  We transferred one person from the European Parliament into the Permanent Representation office in Brussels to support the efforts there.  There is no doubt but that once Article 50 is triggered, there will be a significant demand in terms of the granular detail around Brexit preparations.  As I said, a dedicated unit has been set up in the Department and we expect to increase the number of staff in that unit and in Brussels as this issue develops.</p></speech>

I was looking for more specific detail and comfort arising from the fact that the Prime Minister of the UK has now indicated that Brexit will possibly be a hard exit, resulting in a very hard Brexit for Ireland.  Small businesses and many others affected by Brexit want each Department to spell out a response to the Prime Minister's recent speech outlining the UK's position.  People are anxious to know how they fit into Department's plans.  Perhaps in the course of the meeting Mr. Moran would provide more detail than that a unit has been established and staff numbers in the Department and in Europe have been increased such that those who are interested will know exactly where the Department stands on Brexit.  In this regard, Mr. Moran might outline what skill sets exist, what needs to be done and so on.</p></speech>

The dedicated resources are around having a unit that brings all of that together.  For example, issues of taxation and customs and financial services will be the bread and butter of what people are doing at an EU level.  We are represented on the Economic and Financial Committee, which is the committee that prepares the agenda for ECOFIN.  A huge amount of information flows from that committee.</p> <p>  In regard to the dedicated unit within the Department, its function is to draw together all strands of the work on Brexit.  In other words, it will have a co-ordinating function.  The target is to have five or six people dealing with that work.</p></speech>

Permanent representation staff deal with the dossiers that are on the Department's agenda in a Brussels context anyway.  We will probably need to increase the number of staff in Brussels to seven or eight because there will inevitably be discussions around EU budgets, financial services and so on as the negotiating process gets under way and we will need to support that work.</p></speech>

From an economic point of view, the trade implications, which are central to all of this, are potentially extremely serious for Ireland.  Perhaps Mr. Moran would put in context the resources within Government focused on the economic implications.  Also, are the implications in terms of export and trade with the UK focused within the Department of Finance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.627" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017011900002#H01200"><p>We have done a lot of the economic analysis, which Mr. McCarthy will elaborate on in a few minutes.  Trade promotion is the responsibility of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  However, all Departments have a contribution to make on this area, as has the Cabinet committee.  Senior officials from all Departments are co-ordinating this work but under the aegis of the Department of Finance.  There is a lot of activity but we have to bring focus to it.  I hope I have answered the Chairman's question regarding what the Department of Finance brings to the table in terms of helping address the issue.  The speech earlier in the week by the UK Prime Minister brings focus to the fact that Brexit will be a hard rather than soft exit, which raises a number of issues, some of which are as yet unclear.  The UK proposes to withdraw from the customs union but wants to have an associated customs arrangement.  It is not clear what that will be.  We are working our way through what the WTO will look like if that happens but it is not yet clear that this is what the Prime Minister intends to negotiate.  Turkey has an arrangement with the EU around customs union on goods that go into the EU.  It is expected that the negotiation will be in that type of space.  The effort is centrally co-ordinated but it cuts across all Departments and not only the Department of Finance.</p> <p>  My colleague, Mr. John McCarthy, will elaborate on the economic issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.628" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017011900002#H01300"><p>The Secretary General mentioned that there are three to four staff in the dedicated unit.  However, all other units in the Department also have a Brexit impact and so the economics division, the tax division and the financial services division are all interacting on this issue.  The co-ordinating unit may be relatively small but all other units are feeding into it.</p> <p>  I am head of the economics division.  In 2015, we asked the ESRI to carry out a scoping study, which we funded, of what Brexit might mean.  Following the decision in June, we boosted the skill set within the economic division.  Some of my team were working jointly with the ESRI on the macro impact of three different scenarios, namely, a soft, medium and hard exit.  As stated, a hard exit is becoming increasing likely.  In regard to a hard exit, we estimated, using model simulations, that it would shave about four percentage points off the level of GDP after seven or eight years.  Alongside the budget, we published a sectoral impact which was a study of which sectors would be affected most.  It is not surprising that it is the sectors most affected are the indigenous sectors of the economy.  </p> <p>  The ESRI also looked on a more granular basis at the likely impact in terms of the tariffs on approximately 5,000 products.  For example, meat might have an average tariff of 50%.  The ESRI looked at what this might mean for Irish exports to the UK.  In broad orders of magnitude, it would shave off approximately 30% of our exports to the UK.  This means our exports overall would be reduced by approximately four percentage points.  That is the type of work we are doing in the economics division.  At the time of the budget, the Minister had a Brexit-ready plan which assessed what the Department of Finance could do with the instruments under the control of the Minister of Finance, namely, taxation, financial services and so forth.  The Department of Finance co-ordination unit feeds into the Department of the Taoiseach group handling this matter.</p></speech>

The intention is to move another assistant principal and administrative officer into the unit as the process ratchets up and to also increase staff numbers in the permanent representation in Brussels.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran said that everyone in the Department is making a contribution but they were all busy people before the Brexit referendum result last June.  Almost seven months on from that, there are only four people in the Department of Finance with responsibility for devising our economic policy.</p><p>The world has changed for Ireland.</p></speech>

It is a regular item on the management team's agenda and is dealt with on a whole-of-Department basis.  This is meant to draw the strands of everything that is happening across the Government together in one place.  The Deputy is right, in that this has implications for financial services, taxation, our Border and customs.  Departmentally, people are engaged in it.  The expertise resides within the divisions.  We co-ordinate that into a single piece-----</p></speech>

If people are not sitting within the Brexit unit, are the Department's divisions that are directly affected by Brexit being enhanced in terms of resources?</p></speech>

Let me be honest about that.  We have been beefing up the economic functions for a while.  Two or three years ago, there might have been one functional area, namely, the macroeconomy.  There are now three, including microeconomy, which entails research, analysis and modelling.  With the economy recovering, it has been difficult to expand an organisation when one must compete with outsiders, but we are doing our best to push on that front.  We have a high turnover rate, which is a good thing at one level, in that we are refreshing our staff, improving qualifications and so forth, but we must manage the process within that context.  We have a core staff of approximately 300.  Ideally, I would like to be at 330.  We started out with a manpower plan last year and ended up at ten or 15 below it.  We are continuing to pursue it.</p></speech>

Instead, the Department's overall head count is pretty much static.</p></speech>

We took on a number of high-quality people at the height of the crisis.  After four or five years, however, they have succeeded in winning promotion to other parts of the Civil Service.  We must plan manpower to back-fill that.  It is healthy in one way.  At the start of last year, we estimated a requirement of approximately 40 graduate entrants.  Central supply was sufficient to fill in or around 30 of those posts, so we had a deficit of approximately ten at the start of this year.  It is difficult.  It was only yesterday that we sat down as a management team to discuss our resourcing plans.  There are many vacancies to be filled in Mr. McCarthy's unit, for example, statisticians and economists.  However, the solutions to all of those vacancies will arrive in the short term.  It is an ongoing process.  As the economy recovers, the competition for quality staff increases.</p></speech>

Prime Minister May made her speech on Tuesday.  My question is probably more appropriate to Mr. McCarthy.  Will he translate as best he can what we heard from her and put it in the context of the analysis undertaken by the Department and the ESRI of what Brexit means for the Irish economy?  The UK is definitely leaving the Single Market.  Although there is a degree of uncertainty about the customs union, it is safe to assume that the UK will not remain in it.  The Prime Minister referred to associate membership or leaving the customs union.  In terms of trade and our economy, what is the Department's assessment at this early stage of the emerging position of the British Government?</p></speech>

We have a PhD economist, one who is skilled in macro modelling, working on this matter on my side.  Three scenarios were published last November.  We did not know at the time that a hard exit would become the most likely.  This leads us to believe that the macroeconomic impact will be more severe.  To put some figures on the macro scenarios, after five years, the level of GDP would be three and a half percentage points below a baseline scenario of no Brexit and closer to four percentage points after a decade.  There would be significant front-loading.  This would reduce employment by approximately two percentage points and raise the unemployment rate by one percentage point.

As such, the ballpark figure is 40,000 people.  The impact on the public finances would be to raise the level of the deficit by one percentage point over the medium term.

These are the impacts in the absence of mitigating responses.</p><p>Those mitigants may well be in the form of the modified customs union, whatever that might be.  We do not have an insight into that.  Domestic responses might also be factors.  The exposed sectors include traditional manufacturing, the food sector and agribusiness.  The Government must decide all the time on responses.  Modelled outcomes rarely come true but they are a guide to where one should be looking.</p><p> With regard to the examples of WTO tariffs, they are maxima.  In the absence of a trade agreement, that is what they default to; they are the maximum amounts.  The figures can be substantially below those, including down to zero.</p></speech>

Exports to the UK would be down by one third and they would be down generally by 4%.  This is all in regard to Brexit and it is before one factors in what Mr. Trump might say to us tomorrow.  The Small Firms Association is saying 41% of its members have said they have already experienced a negative impact from Brexit.  Sixty-eight percent say they expect an immediate negative impact over the next few months.  The only way that can be minimised is for the Department to set out its general strategies to give some sort of comfort regarding the figures the Department has given.</p> <p>  On the tariffs issue, Mr. Moran has just scared the daylights out of small firms and businesspeople with the information he has added. Their livelihoods rely on this.</p> <p>  Alongside the stark reality of Brexit, there is a further stark reality to be faced in terms of taxation.  That has to do with Mr. Trump.  Then there is the threat associated with Prime Minister May saying the UK will be competitive with its corporation tax regime.  What financial supports has the Department put through its model in terms of supporting exporters and small firms of one kind or another that are totally exposed because of Brexit?  What taxation model has Mr. Moran put in place on foot of the competition now emerging within the European Union on corporation tax?  Will we go down to 10%?  Will we adjust rapidly to meet the challenges from the markets and political policy in other jurisdictions?</p> <p>  I am shocked that there are only three or four relevant people in the Department of Finance, which is a key Department in this regard.  It is a Department that will outline the taxation strategy for the future.  I have not heard a word about it.  Quite frankly, two sentences in Mr. Moran's opening remarks do not cut it for me.  It is not personal.  I would have expected the Department, in light of all that has been said about Brexit and President-elect Trump and all that was said by the UK Prime Minister, to have produced a far more substantial response to what is now happening.  We do not seem to be prepared.  That is a concern of mine and one that seems to be expressed by the Small Firms Association.  I have heard it from exporters also.  They want to see real measures put in place to give comfort to those in business who simply cannot wait.  They cannot wait; they will be affected overnight.</p></speech>

There is an entire tax division.  The four people in the co-ordination unit do not comprise the Brexit effort on any one subject.</p> <p>  Many of the questions the Chairman wants me to answer are on the Government's policy and what the Government's policy response will be.  It is not appropriate for me to answer that.  There will have to be responses, however.</p> <p>  With regard to the criticism of the statement, I had no sense of what the committee wanted to talk about overall.</p></speech>

I referred to the strategy of the Department of Finance.  The strategy has to take in the immediate risk to the economy posed by Brexit and Mr. Trump.  The Department of Finance is the lead Department on taxation.  I would have loved to hear Mr. Moran say that, within his Department, there is a model that examines the various reductions necessary in corporate taxation and other taxes to keep this economy competitive.  I do not get a sense of that.</p></speech>

We spent some time there in the immediate aftermath of the election.  Certainly, the sense in Washington was that this could be anything from radical reform through to nothing happening.  That is the range referred to by people who work there.</p> <p>  If something is going to happen with taxation in the United States, it will happen in the first six to 12 months.  Generally speaking, US Presidents make advances on taxation policy in the first year of their first term.  It is very rare in the second.  All our strategy on taxation is predicated on being competitive and being part and parcel of the development of global taxation.  We published a strategy, which is updated annually, on where that is going.  That will continue to be the case.  We have always been very adaptable in our approaches to this.  Ultimately, the calls on where we are going to go are policy calls.  This will not be part of the Department's strategy.  The strategy is across the entire gamut of what the Department is doing.  We take Brexit seriously because, when nobody thought Brexit might happen - it was assumed it would not - the Department was out doing the work and asking what it would be like if it did.  None of the statistics that Mr. McCarthy has given members is new.  They are all published well in advance.  The core study was at least 18 months ago.  We asked what would occur if Brexit happened.  Right up to the day of the vote, nobody believed it would happen.  We outlined the challenge Ireland would face it if happened.  We have refined that and so on so a focus can be put on what the policy responses might be.</p> <p>  I take the Chairman's point that people want answers now.  The UK Prime Minister's response with the ten points was only last week.  Personally, I never foresaw a soft Brexit.  The vote was less about economics and more about domestic political considerations within the United Kingdom.  This is not good news economically for Britain, Ireland and the rest of Europe.  We have to address that.</p></speech>

I, too, shared his view that there would never be a soft Brexit and I said very quickly that we needed to figure out what we could and could not control.  Pretending there would be some type of soft Brexit, whatever that means, was just a bit of chat.  The focus of the British was always going to be on trying to secure their borders.</p> <p>  If we look back at different times and assessments of the Department of Finance, particularly in the lead-up to the banking crisis, we note there were serious flaws and serious unpreparedness, indicating that the officials in the Department were not raising concerns loudly enough and in the appropriate way and that there was a skills shortage within the Department.</p><p>I know many of those issues have been rectified in previous times.  Does the witness believe the Department of Finance is ready for the challenges of Brexit?</p></speech>

This is a cross-Government issue in which we play our role.  I return to the point made that, during the crisis, the Department was not modelling those very adverse outcomes.  It is the opposite way here.  When nobody conceived the possibility of Brexit happening, we said that we needed to look at it and make publicly available what the consequences of it might be.  It is a lesson learnt, quite frankly.  After the 2014 British general election, which against all expectations led to a majority Conservative Government, the one thing that was certain was that there would be a referendum on Brexit.  The right thing to do at that stage was to do the analysis well in advance in order to give an insight into what the likely effect would be.  We were the only people to do that.  People did not want to talk about it.</p> <p>  One of the failings in the run-up to the crisis was known as the domestic standing group.  It was supposed to be an advance crisis simulator on the financial side of things.  It did not work.  It was at too low a level, was not given priority and so on.  During the crisis management period, we had what was called the principal swoop, which involved the head of the Department, the NTMA and the bank meeting on a regular basis to manage the agenda.  Going forward, that is not really what we are about.  We changed that into what we called a financial stability group, which can be found around the world.  It is an interaction between the monetary authority, the institutions that work for the Government, the treasury and funding agency to share information, which we have done, but in a much more structured way, to have a much more structure addenda and to try to model those exact sort of crises and challenges that one cannot see, such as the cyber attacks that bring money transmission systems down and all that stuff.  We had our first meeting in that format with defined terms of reference.  The membership of it, unlike further down the organisation, involves those at the top in order to give it authority.  In terms of learning from the crisis and being ready, I believe we have learnt.</p></speech>

I want him to tell the committee now or I want him to say that he is satisfied and, therefore, if things go wrong, we can hold him to account.  I want him to tell this committee that he is satisfied with the staff resources that he has, that he is not looking for anything else and that he believes that the team is robust enough to deal with the challenges.  I commend the work that the Department of Finance did at a time when Brexit was not being talked about as a possibility.  There is no doubt it was outstanding work.  It is now eight months since Brexit was voted for.  We have clear indications that it will be a hard Brexit with a hard Border.  We cannot be harking back to something that happened a year and a half ago.  It is different.  That was a hypothetical scenario.  Now we know it is real.  In the next couple of weeks, it is going to get very intense because we are competing with Britain and other member states and we need to be at our best game.

That goes back to a comment I made earlier.  We are expanding the economic function and some of the financial functions.  However, given the nature of the recovering economy, being the head of an organisation in manpower planning terms is actually more difficult than it was.  At the moment, we have about 300 or 310 staff.  I would far prefer to be in the territory of 330 or 340 existing staff.</p></speech>

We were only able to get 30.  There was a saving of ten salaries for a year just in that example, as well as the savings in not taking all of the staff at the start of the year.  We are running to standstill.  We have around a 14% turnover rate at present, which is very high by Civil Service standards.</p></speech>

There is a co-ordinating group that the divisions feed into.  With regard to the job descriptions of individuals working within the divisions, how many of them have been assigned Brexit-particular parts to their job description?  That would not have been the case heretofore.  People with specific responsibilities have now been tasked with Brexit-related responsibilities.</p></speech>

In the process we are currently going through at the moment of driving down the strategy through the business plans to the individuals, Brexit will feature for a very large cohort.  Do not ask me how many that will be.  With the speech Ms Theresa May gave in the last week, it has become a much more focused and clearer responsibility.  That will be driven down through the business plans and into the individual tasks.  When we complete that, we would like to do a statistical piece and send it to the committee.  We are going through that at the moment.</p></speech>

The witness's own view was that it was never going to be a soft Brexit.  For people like myself and the witness who share that view, there was nothing really major announced in the speech of Ms Theresa May.  Her major announcement, in my view, was that she was going to put the vote to the House of Commons at a later stage.  Most people would have seen that it will be a hard Brexit and that she has tried to cherrypick everything else.  I would be concerned that that part of the work has not been done so far.</p></speech>

If one goes back over them, one will find Brexit cropping up as a discussion among the management team on a very regular basis.  It is a case of then integrating that down through the business plans.  I take the Deputy's point that it is one thing to say that we see it a problem and do a piece of work on it 18 months out.  However, we have followed that up.  On budget day only a couple of months ago, we published the sector-by-sector exposures and where the concentration might be.  Some small measures were taken in the context of the budget.  They were not major, but some measures were taken.  In addition, there are the more disaggregated impacts.  We have continued to do that.  I take the Deputy's point.  We need to drive that down through the organisation.  The Deputy's core question is whether I am comfortable that what I have at the moment is at a good level.  No, our manpower plan is for higher than what we have.  However, there is the reality of trying to get people through the door.  We have had a very high turnover of staff.  A 14% turnover in the course of a 12-month period in an organisation the scale of ours is quite significant.  Some of it is as a result of our success during the crisis of getting very good, highly-qualified people in who are now doing well within the civil service.  Most of those people did not leave the public service, but moved within it.  That is the benefit of it, but it creates a problem and stretches us.</p></speech>

I mean that the Minister said that we did not know the type of Brexit because we did not know the outcome of the elections.</p> <p>  Earlier President-elect Trump was mentioned.  Last week I visited Washington to discuss his intentions with a number of Congressmen and senior officials.  Trying to read his mind is a difficult job.  On my visit there was a consensus to have a change in tax.  There will be a compromise between what the Republicans and the President want, resulting in a change.  That is just what they think and there is no guarantee that it will happen, but that is the consensus that I detected in Capitol Hill last week.</p> <p>  I raise this point because we are exposed.  How ready are we for the responses?  Some of this matter is outside our control.  We can pretend that we have a significant influence and can shape what Britain and the EU will do.  While we need to influence them as much as possible, is it not the case that, given Mr. McCarthy's point on the impact that a hard Brexit will have on the economy, employment and the available fiscal space, we have been left with little wriggle room to respond to some of the major challenges facing us on either side of the island of Ireland?</p></speech>

The risks, which are external, are balanced on the negative side.  It is a technical way of describing the same thing.  We have exposures on both sides and a degree of uncertainty.</p> <p>  Not unlike the Deputy's case, although a range of views on what would happen were expressed while I was in Washington, the consensus was that something would happen.  It would be the first time since 1987 that anything substantive in the corporate space happened.</p> <p>  Undoubtedly, there are risks and exposures on both sides, but the Deputy should remember that there are also opportunities.  Britain will be outside the EU, but FDI will still want access to the Single Market and Ireland remains an attractive place in that regard.  The nature of tax reforms in the US will be interesting to see.  The devil is in the detail.  There has been talk of taxing anything sold by companies that do not come home, but a great deal of FDI is selling into Europe, the Middle East and Asia, not the US.  We have always highlighted that our exposures are more on the international side, be they to Brexit or changes in the US.  Does Mr. McCarthy wish to discuss the risks?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.723" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017011900002#M02600"><p>We included a new innovation in the budget documentation.  We produced a risk assessment matrix for the economy and the public finances.  It might be worth examining.  It is a nice piece of work, even if I say so myself.</p> <p>  We are very small and the world is globalised.  From a treasury or finance ministry perspective, that puts an additional premium on policy caution.  I do not want to delve into the policy space, but the Deputy will be aware that the Minister announced a rainy day fund and that debt would go to 45% of GDP by the middle of the next decade.  All of these measures - I am only repeating what he said - are concerned with building up fiscal safety buffers so that, if the situation goes wrong and the risks materialise, we do not have to be pro-cyclical and can instead allow the automatic stabilisers to operate.</p> <p>  In every document that the Department of Finance publishes, we refer to the need to remain competitive.</p><p>So many of these factors, including the exchange rate, oil prices and world demand, are beyond our control.  We cannot influence them, but we need to be able to be flexible and to be able to respond so that, if shocks materialise, we are in a healthy position and do not have massive peaks and falls in GDP.</p><p> I agree that there are many risks.  They are not just from the President's side on corporation tax.  Obviously there is a concern about issues such as protectionism.  For an economy such as ours, where trade and FDI is our lifeblood, protectionism would not be good.  On the upside, or perhaps on the downside, there is the overall fiscal package that appears to be likely from the new regime in the US.  It would appear that there will be some form of fiscal stimulus, possibly on the infrastructural side.  There may be some form of tax cuts, although their economic impact may not be great if they are at the upper end of the income distribution.  There are some issues there.  We may see some form of short-term fiscal stimulus in the US which could easily be transmitted globally.  That should be borne in mind as well.  I hope I have not gone off on too much of a tangent.</p></speech>

I wish to raise another point.  There has been much talk about Ireland's gain from financial services locating here.  Figures have been thrown out in terms of the amount of jobs it would create and dramatic numbers such as 20,000 have appeared in the media, etc.  Industry sources have told me that the potential for Ireland's gain from financial services is quite less than that.  That is their view and it is only a view.  I have picked it up from a number of individuals, however, who said it in terms of jobs particularly.</p> <p>  In the context of Brexit, do the delegates believe that the financial services division has the capacity to deal with the relocation of firms from London to Dublin?  Going back to resources, is it adequately resourced to deal with the risk and issues such as stability and compliance?  Do they believe that the resources are there to deal with what could potentially be a large influx of financial services coming to our capital?</p></speech>

Both the Governor and the regular have said that they are open for business and have the capacity to do it.  As did Deputy Doherty, I have heard the possible range involved.  There is opportunity, but how big will it be?  More generally, if we were to look at it in the round, there is talk about financial services going to Frankfurt, Paris and so on but the risk for Europe and Britain is that a global financial centre such as that in London would go to New York.  Strategically, that is the biggest challenge for everyone that moves outside of Europe, but that is a different issue.  The bank has indicated that it will deal with these and that it has and should have the capacity to do it.</p></speech>

It is the change in the environment in both the US and Europe over the next number of years.  It evolves and changes very quickly.  This time next year we could have much greater clarity about the US and it will be either less of a problem or a very big one.  It is that external domestic uncertainty.  It is a sluggish European economy overall in terms of a potential GDP shock.  Europe is not growing as fast as it should be and a Europe without Britain will grow slower.  Those external factors are the biggest-----</p></speech>

The European Commission spoke of a fiscal stimulus of approximately 0.5% of GDP.  There was a loosening of the budgetary stances of those European economies that can afford to do it.  These would include Germany and other such countries.  However, there is no policy willingness within the German context to do that, although it is the country best positioned to do it.  Many other countries are still in a corrective phase and trying to get their budgets in order and so on.  Therefore, we have this prolonged period of very slow growth within the EU combined with the uncertainty of Britain, which is the most dynamic of the bigger economies, moving out of the EU along with all the issues going on in Europe.</p></speech>

Given what has been announced by Prime Minister May in terms of Brexit and the outcome of the elections in America and President-elect Trump, do the figures for budget 2017 stand up?  Do the assumptions that were made in the budget still stand up?</p></speech>

We did factor it in.  For example, in the absence of Brexit we would have assumed a growth rate that was higher by 0.5%.  We have taken that out and have buffered against it in our assumptions.  I will let Mr. McCarthy pick up on this further, but at this point I do not think we will be changing our assumption.  It does not mean that if tax revenues  and activities soften during the course of the year it will not change but at the moment they still look sound on the basis of that, if one likes, pre-emptive reduction or assumption of an impact of Brexit.</p></speech>

A lot of water has gone under the bridge between now and October 2015.  We projected a GDP growth rate of 4.2% for last year, slowing moderately to 3.5% this year which, as Mr. Moran stated, took into account a Brexit related impact of 0.5% in the short-term.  Given the strong figure for the third quarter, the indications are that the figure for last year might come in somewhere in excess of the 4.2% projected and it is fair to say that high frequency data in the fourth quarter will support a reasonably strong figure for that quarter as well.  For the year as a whole, it may come in slightly ahead of the 4.2% that we had assumed.</p> <p>  We had assumed a deficit last year of 0.9%.  Taxes came in about &euro;250 million shy of where we thought they would be but expenditure kind of offset it by coming in below what was estimated.  We are very much on line for our headline deficit of 0.9% for last year.  More important is going forward.</p></speech>

This figure was endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, as now required under European legislation.  At the time, we described it in the budget as the baseline scenario.  We did, however, say that the confidence bands around the central scenario were wide and that risks were skewed to the downside.  The risks were, as we all know, the world economy, the European economy, Brexit, etc.  At the time, we did not know President-elect Trump-----</p></speech>

We did identify the risks as being tilted to the downside.  I still think that to be the case.  I think that is the case for Ireland and most advanced economies.

Mr. McCarthy made reference to many different changes.  The ordinary person will want to know certain things.  We have spoken about jobs and 40,000 fewer jobs was mentioned.  Increasing the terms of the national debt by &euro;20 billion was mentioned.  A reduction in exports to the UK by one third was also mentioned, something which will have an exponential impact on the SME sector because they are exporting to the UK.  Many of those in the sector are constituents of mine in Limerick that employ a lot of local people.  This is my question: What impact will Brexit have on the overall tax intake and, by implication, the money available for spending on public services?</p><p>Is it true to say that Mr. McCarthy sees no requirement to adjust the current budget?</p></speech>

Cyclical variations in tax and expenditure are removed from the calculation.  Our requirement, and Government policy, is to balance the books in structural terms by 2018 and our arithmetic takes that into account.  If there is a cyclical shock to the economy it should not affect the structural number.  It will affect the headline number-----</p></speech>

That would mean tax revenue of just north of &euro;50 billion, its highest level ever.  There is a lot of uncertainty but we assumed a euro-sterling exchange rate of 0.85 and it was 0.86 as of yesterday.  We have a bit of depreciation <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the dollar, which will help.

Early last year we did one for a global gross domestic product, GDP, shock to the Irish economy.  One goes for the modest one, what happens if 1% falls off and that is the modelling.  We considered what a 3% GDP shock would look like.  That would mean all the major economies were in recession and gives a much better fix.  The challenge always is to get the balance right.  Modelling mild shocks gives only mild answers.  We do need to look beyond that.  That is why we have tried to do things like the 3% global shock and some of the advanced work around what these would look like on the tariff front and so on.  Models give an answer based on what is put into the model.  The world often turns out to be quite different when mitigants come into play and things evolve but the point is well made.</p></speech>

One of the biggest medium-term risks to Ireland because it is a global issue is the potential for a negative feedback loop between protectionism leading to low growth and hence to calls for more protectionism, which is essentially what I think the Deputy is talking about in terms of a trade war and greater protectionism and so forth.  The priority at the moment is Brexit, as the Deputy can understand.</p></speech>

There is a worse case than a bad deal which is no arrangement falling on the WTO.  The witnesses did not model a trade war, which could happen and could have a really catastrophic impact on the agricultural sector in this country.  The modelling is based on 50% WTO targets for agriculture but if there is a trade war that could be 75% or 100%.</p></speech>

Trade war is certainly a possibility but I do not think it is a possibility for this year or next or the next couple of years.  It could certainly be seen in later years if there is still this secular stagnation, weak world growth and so forth.  We have to prioritise the issues we see, the most important of which is Brexit.  That is what we have done.  We can of course attempt to simulate the impact of a trade war but for the moment we are focusing our modelling on WTO type arrangements.</p></speech>

Looking at it from the outside, I am not sure that it is running Brexit.  It has to draw in all the inputs from everybody else but the call is with the Prime Minister, Theresa May.  The seminal speech that clarified this was by the Prime Minister.  On balance, the way we are going about it with the lead being taken in the Taoiseach's office to bring together all the strands across Government is the best.  This is a policy call.  In the UK it all goes back to the Prime Minister's office to bring together all its strands.  It is a half answer.</p></speech>

We were acutely aware of the situation where a loan was being transferred from a regulated institution to an unregulated institution.  We were conscious that the protections the borrower had in place under Central Bank rules, such as the code of conduct on mortgage arrears and the SME regulations, would travel with that loan.  We took quite a bit of time to decide on the proper approach to the development of the legislation in question.  We targeted the front-facing element - the credit-servicing firms - when we introduced the new category of regulated institution which is now under the supervision of the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has been putting regulations in place to deal with that.  The legislation was introduced 18 months ago.  The Central Bank has been dealing with many credit-servicing firms on an ongoing basis.  According to the most recent information provided to me, 15 or 16 credit-servicing firms have been authorised on a transitional basis by the Central Bank as they move into the more regularised and formalised structure.  As the Secretary General has said, we are conscious that this area is evolving.  We want to keep a close watch on what is happening in it.  We expect the Central Bank to be an active regulator.  If there are particular issues which require us to look again at enhancing the legislation by introducing new elements to it, we ask the Central Bank to bring them to our attention.  The Central Bank has not yet raised any such issues with us.</p></speech>

I think we would have to look at the impact of such an increase on the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman, which has a strong role to play within the financial services architecture.  It was part and parcel of the legislation that the Financial Services Ombudsman would be involved as an option for borrowers to turn to in the event of difficulties.</p></speech>

The Deputy's point is very well made.  The role of the group is to look at things that we almost cannot conceive of happening.  It is a question of the extent to which we can look through crisis simulations.

There is no suggestion in what we are looking at that it is going to happen.  When we look at what would happen if there was a 3% global GDP shock, we are not saying that it is going to happen.  We are looking at what it would look like and what responses might be necessary.

It will have a fluid mandate and it will adapt to the circumstances it faces.  Its principal objectives are to monitor and share assessments of risk to the Irish financial system and the Irish economy; to co-ordinate systemic crisis management, including contingency planning and implementation of financial sector crisis management measures; and to discuss economic or financial policies which have repercussions for financial stability in order to achieve optimal policy outcomes.

The principals group was very much a group of the crisis.  We are still dealing with the legacy issues from that time.  The previous group focused on that.  We want the new group to be much more forward-looking.  It will take us time to bed this down.  There is a need to acknowledge that we are getting these people in a room once every month to share what they know.  We have committed to publishing the minutes.

In briefing this week, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform stated this must be met within the existing allocation.  One asks how this can be done without reducing services and Mr. McCarthy referenced that at the end of the year, a tranche of money is always handed back but we are eating this up fairly quickly.  The committee would expect me as Secretary General to state that when we settle a budget we should settle it so there are not progressive add-ons.  As Mr. McCarthy alluded to, the real difficulty is we are still in the preventative arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  We are obliged to get out of it over a specified time and we must get out of it within a certain set of financial constraints.  The constraints within which we work are statutory in nature and even constitutional under the fiscal treaty.  There is only so much room for manoeuvre.  Something positive this week was the reaffirmation that the way forward is the Lansdowne Road agreement and keeping it intact.  There will be a normal process of negotiation.</p></speech>

We could have a situation where if cyclical taxes fell away we would not have to adjust as rapidly because it was a temporary blip and we would be allowed to continue to spend.  It is not a kick and hope situation.  At this stage these costs can be absorbed.  Our absolute obligation beyond the trajectory is to have a balanced budget in cyclical terms for next year, which would allow us greater freedoms once we are outside the preventative arm.</p></speech>

The Brexit debate has been very important and essential.  The Department is much more than Brexit and has a huge amount of bodies under its remit, with 18 listed in the statement.  I want to touch on some other relevant points.  I did not see a date in the statement of strategy.  Other than the reference to knowing Brexit has happened I do not know when it was published, and whether it was just after Brexit or in the past two weeks.</p></speech>

I could work out it was post-Brexit from the fairly minimal amount of references to Brexit.</p> <p>  Two separate sentences, that the Department will continue to work at international level to help influence debate on corporate taxation and the Department will be at the forefront of the legal challenge to the European Commission state aid ruling with respect to Apple, flow into each other in the statement, but they are two huge topics which cover the CCCTB, BEPS, the OECD, everything relating to global tax planning and Apple, and how dependent we are as a State on a very small number, perhaps seven, eight or ten, of large multinationals which contribute almost half our corporation tax.  We have touched on Brexit and mentioned Trump, but how exposed are our tax revenues and our economy to the revenues generated by these enormous multinationals, and what is the Department doing and looking at in this regard?  Enormous figures are generated by a very small number of companies.  How volatile could these figures be?  We looked at the debt-to-GDP ratio.  This is falling, but a portion of this is because GDP is rising as much as because debt is actually falling.  It is a fair comment, but if it is not the witnesses might tell me so.  I ask the witnesses to discuss the CCCTB and Apple.</p></speech>

This may well be its third or fourth iteration.  When I look back, the first reference I can find to the European Commission harmonising corporate taxation is 1972, in our White Paper on accession to the EU.  This is not a new issue.  The most recent proposal separates the base from consolidation.  Consolidation is the part where this breaks down, because what we are discussing is redistributing on a forwarding basis from one country to another.  VAT is for when something is sold in a country, I would say.  The fact that profit is generated is not relevant as the VAT part of it is already picked up.  The Oireachtas, along with six or seven Parliaments in Europe, has rejected the CCCTB, not enough to give it a yellow card and go back to the drawing board but it shows a level of concern and unhappiness.</p></speech>

In previous iterations of this proposal, parliaments were not given a role.  This is relatively new.  It is important and it is a signal.  We found in the past a very large quantum of member states have many concerns about this.  It would probably significantly narrow our tax base and cost us money on this basis.  There is an appetite in some member states to harmonise the base throughout Europe, but this will be agreed as a total package and there is a degree of parliamentary opposition to it.  I am not saying it will not happen, and we will engage throughout because not to engage with it would be-----</p></speech>

They could be statutorily independent such as the Central Bank, the Revenue Commissioners and the NTMA.  They are independent.  In the document we have gone through the process to ask how does one define what is a body under the aegis.  We had a set of tests and if the body met any one of the tests then we had to do something about it.  It is partly about having bespoke, appropriate interactions to make sure that what is being done is what should be done without interfering with the independence of those entities.  For example, as was described earlier, at my level we meet the NTMA and the bank each month and keep an eye on that.  I am on the boards of both of them..</p></speech>

From my point of view, the unit that deals with NAMA would liaise with NAMA.  Similarly the Revenue Commissioners are independent and we should not be accessing individual tax information.  The second Secretary General and I and the head of taxes unit sit down with the three commissioners.  We meet with them once per quarter or thereabouts and run through the agenda of issues we want some assurance on and the things they want to raise with us.  At the end of the day, if issues arise for them that require policy adjustment there has to be feedback loop for that also.  We have tried to feed that down through the organisation by reference to scale.  From a governance point of view it is really important that we do this.  To make sure the arrangements we have are embedded properly, we have asked the internal audit unit to audit how this is being implemented across the Department as part of the work flow for this.  It is important stuff that can get overlooked.  I believe we had more than 20 organisations but the recent consolidation of the NTMA family meant it reduced to 18.  They were all individual companies and that simplified it a bit, but with a core staff of 300, 18 organisations is a lot to monitor.  We are using all the leverage that we can.</p></speech>

Two years ago we set about understanding what were the criteria that defined each of the 18 bodies and we are starting to put in bespoke arrangements to monitor and provide an element of oversight - which is probably a strong word - but an overview of how each body is performing within the various sections and around the business so there is a strong link between the policy section and the body in question.</p></speech>

In the context of year one, has the Department - Mr. Moran and his team - been asking whether these have been achieved or how far they are getting?  For example, the programme states:</p><blockquote>It is not ethically acceptable for Irish banks to charge excessive interest rates on standard variable rate customers.  We will take all necessary action to tackle high variable interest rates; including through establishing a new code of conduct for switching mortgage provider, administered by the Central Bank and the development of a new, easy-to-use standardised and dedicated switching form.  We will also request the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission to work with the Central Bank to set out the options for the Government in terms of market structure.</blockquote> <p>I am not sure I have seen too many of the commitments implemented yet.  I admit that we are not at the end of year one but I wonder where the Department is on some of these commitments.</p></speech>

With the management advisory committee, one issue within the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 and the legislation generally is that management essentially is the Secretary General and the committee was advisory to that.  One cannot have collective responsibility.  Ultimately the person responsible for the accounts and the disbursement of moneys is myself but with the executive board, we have tried to give people responsibility for both their slice of policy and for corporate responsibility for the success of the Department as a whole.</p><p>That is a fairly substantial change on what went heretofore.  For example, my colleague, Mr. John McCarthy, is the chief economist but he also sits on the audit committee and is the chairman of the oversight committee on freedom of information.  My colleague, Mr. John Hogan, in addition to being in the banking division also deals with all the financial aspects of the Department.  What we have tried to do is make it much more of a collective entity, albeit that it cannot legally be a collective entity.

I understand it has been talking to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to see if there is some role it can play in providing funding for social housing.  In recent times it also spoke to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, about what sort of possibilities it could provide to work with the credit union movement, but it comes back to what Mr. Moran said about finding the appropriate model that can work alongside it.  The credit unions are investing and they want a particular rate of return and there are a number of other competing providers of finance that are involved in providing funding to those types of sectors.  In the social housing area the European Investment Bank, EIB, for example, has been quite active at providing low cost funding through the Housing Finance Agency.  The EIB and KfW have been involved at early stages with the SBCI in providing funding.  The work is ongoing but it is very much around trying to find the correct model that matches the risk and rewards that can come to a productive outcome.</p></speech>

One must go back to when the second home tax was introduced and where we were and whether raising money from second homes and then making it deductible was a sensible fiscal measure at that time.  The principles of taxation generally are that if one has an investment, the taxable income is the income after the expenses, which include the interest on the mortgage and so on.  What we have seen is the beginning of the reintroduction of 100% interest relief on investment properties in the income tax system, for example.  It is a roadmap out to 100% but it was down to 75%.  I am interested in the case but I am not familiar with that one.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran refers in various publications to the need to be transparent and to encourage the public to have a better understanding of how Departments work.  I received an e-mail from a business person I know in which an issue was raised.  I was told that since raising the issue relative to the proper management by a Department in the location in which the man is based, it has put the knife in at every opportunity.  He said the Department takes a personal interest in the company because of the matters it raised.  He said the Department ignores e-mails from him to the relevant section.  An individual on the site said she was terrorised by being told she would be prosecuted if she did not take appropriate action.  It was also said the Department was vindictive at a cost to the taxpayer.  That is the reality of how somebody thinks of the Department and its administration in terms of governance.</p> <p>  Separate to that, I wish to refer Mr. Moran to a court case, which I accept is from some years ago.  A citizen was taken to court by a Department and eventually the judge stood down the jury and declared that the Department did not put forward a credible case.  The judge had some extremely harsh words for the Department concerned.  Taxpayers' money was used to beat down an individual.  In spite of winning the case and walking away with his integrity intact, the individual still has not been paid for the loss he had in terms of his business, in which the Department had a hand.  I have come across such cases over the years, and I am not the only one to whom people write, and those cases still remain unresolved.</p> <p>  What concerns me is the use of taxpayers' money in the beating up, so to speak, of the citizen and then the stonewalling to see just how far the individual will go to have his or her rights vindicated.  What does the Department of Finance say to Departments where something as obvious as that happens?

We sat down in the second half of 2014 and into 2015 and looked at our governance framework because, as an organisation, the Department was subject to a lot of turmoil and change over a period.  We wanted to bed down a view of our culture and how we should behave.  It was an interesting discussion.  The sort of behaviours that the Chairman described are not acceptable.  I do not know the cases and, even though they are historically helpful within the Department of Finance, those examples are just not acceptable.  We work for the taxpayer.  Sometimes there will be litigation against a taxpayer for whatever reasons, but it should always be in the most courteous and understanding way possible.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that much of it featured in the template, including things that Departments probably have not been good about in the past such as looking at the standards of behaviour, how to deal with people and so on.  Through the Civil Service management board and that process, we brought that to the table.  Surprisingly, we receive a fair number of calls from the public about issues.  Take the budget.  A lot of calls will be received by the Minister's office or the taxation unit in respect of the changes being introduced.  Our job is to explain to people, in a civil and polite way, what has happened.  I will not embarrass colleagues by asking them about the discussion, but that half page on what are our behaviour, values and cultures was the result of a really in-depth conversation.  I also think that we have influenced the governance standards for the rest of the Civil Service by making the template available.  In terms of telling other Departments what to do or intervening, I do not have a role in that regard.</p></speech>

Revenue, under the Department of Finance, is the collector of taxes.  Could the Department not have a role where it sees taxes being inappropriately spent by, for instance, chasing and beating down a citizen, with a judge having to side with the citizen.  Not only did the judge say that the Department was wrong, the judge said that the integrity of the prosecution was under question.  That case still remains unresolved.  Should there not be some sort of section within the Department that could examine the case?  It is not just that case; there are others.  When we speak to the Department, it will say that the Director of Public Prosecutions or someone else decided to take the case.  We do not get an answer and, therefore, we cannot address the rights of the citizen.  Someone has to take this on.  As someone who pays his taxes, I have questions, as I am sure would anyone who pays taxes in the country, about how those taxes are spent.  Where issues such as this arise, there is an obligation on Government to protect the people it represents.  Protecting them against the State is something we need to take far more seriously.</p></speech>

Now that we have expressed unhappiness, can we address the matter?  It is not fair that the State should use its muscle and taxpayers' money to come after a citizen in such a manner.  A judge has ruled not just in that case but in other cases, yet there is no redress for the citizen and the money that is due to the citizen from the State has not been paid.  As Chairman of this committee, I want to know how we can address the situation.  As I said, the Department collects the taxes.  It deeply upsets me to see those people in distress and to see such letters written.  Many other letters are written for other reasons.  However, given what was described, there is an onus on us to address it.  How can the committee or Mr. Moran, as a member of the group of Secretaries General, address it?</p></speech>

The Chairman is speaking about the behaviour across the board.  It is certainly something that could be taken back to that sort of forum and acted on.  As the Accounting Officer of the Department of Finance, I would not be happy if that e-mail was about the Department.</p></speech>

If I was collecting the money and I saw someone else spending it as recklessly as that, I would challenge them.  That is how a business is run.  One does not just walk away; otherwise one goes bust.  I would love to see those who collect the money reprimanding those that are spending it recklessly.  In this and other cases I have mentioned, that aspect was publicly spoken about by a judge.

Before Christmas, a draft statutory instrument on the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund and the allocation of the money came before the D&aacute;il.  Reports continue to come in about that fund and how it spends taxpayers' money.  Such reports have been coming in for years.  Earlier, Mr. Moran referred to governance.  Where is the governance in the context of that fund?  Who polices the provision of proper governance in the context of the taxpayers' money that is being spent?  This issue is ongoing.  There are vast amounts of money involved.  I am asking that the Department of Finance would examine how the money is spent in terms of governance.</p></speech>

It has to look at how it manages the bodies under its aegis.  I do not know anything about the Horse and Greyhound Fund.  If there are issues there, they will have to be addressed within that context.  In terms of the bodies under our aegis, while respecting their independence if they have legal independence, we are trying to ensure to the extent that we can that they are being operated appropriately and that we can have assurance that these sorts of principles are being met.</p></speech>

I am flagging this for the witnesses because I am not going to stand by and be unhappy about a situation.  The State must do something.</p> <p>  Regarding the Central Bank and vulture funds, the witnesses are aware that we wrote to the vulture funds.  Two responded - Blackstone and Cerberus - to say that they would not attend.  Most of these funds are playing a significant role in the economy and their tactics in buying and recouping debt leaves much to be desired.  They are unregulated, they will not appear before us and they affect the lives of people in their businesses and homes.  According to the banks that appeared before us, we will probably see a large number of houses being repossessed in 2017.  Those loans that have been sold on and are now within the grasp of vulture funds have no chance.  I want to address the issue of the vulture funds, how they are regulated and the role of the Central Bank.</p> <p>  When the Central Bank appeared before us, its role in and attitude towards consumer protection were shocking.  One hundred people lost their homes because of the tracker mortgage issue.  It is being dealt with now, but where was the Central Bank beforehand?  What happened down through the years?  Where was the Department of Finance in terms of ensuring that the Central Bank did what it was supposed to do, namely, protect the consumer and deal with the banks?</p></speech>

Is there proactive engagement with the Central Bank to establish for the Department's own interest whether the Central Bank is on top of its game, protecting consumers and dealing with the banks?  Is it a two-way street or does the Department just ask for information as it wants it?</p></speech>

There is constant interaction between the teams within the Central Bank and my division that deals with the consumer protection mandate.  We and the Central Bank worked together on the credit servicing legislation and changes were introduced on foot of its suggestions.  As the authorisation process in that regard becomes embedded and more information begins to emerge, our teams work constantly with the Central Bank's teams to understand the approaches that it is taking and monitor activity by servicing firms.  It is not the case that the Department sits idly by, but there is a need to respect the independence of the Central Bank, which is core to its mandate and the legislation underpinning it.</p></speech>

What is the nature of the Department's proactive engagement with the Central Bank?  Are vulture funds and how they purchase individual debt from the main banks discussed?  Will there be protection for the consumer in 2017 to stop the evictions?  NAMA was established to handle commercial debt.  While it is a policy matter, is there now a need for a NAMA for residential and small business debt so that people can be given an opportunity to work out their indebtedness and stop evictions?</p></speech>

The number of people in mortgage arrears has declined steadily.  According to the latest Central Bank report, that decline is now in its twelfth or thirteenth consecutive quarter.  Within that number, there have been 121,000 restructures, that is, people who have had their mortgages restructured by engaging with their financial institutions.  Of those people, 90% are sticking with their restructures.</p> <p>  Breaking down the numbers, the 0% to 90% category has eased considerably from what we saw at the height of the crisis, there is a group in the middle and then there is the longer term category, namely, those who are in two-year plus arrangements.  By virtue of interaction or whatever, many of these people are beginning to find themselves in the court system.</p> <p>  The Government has substantially reformed the personal insolvency legislation to give people access, either by formal or informal procedures, to debt resolution mechanisms.  The personal insolvency rules have been augmented and changed with the passage of time and experience gained.</p></speech>

Those people end up on council housing lists, so the whole thing goes around in a circle.  Is there a section in the Department that is examining the possibility of a new agency or new legislation or of allowing the Housing Finance Agency and the voluntary housing sector to take over some of this debt?  We own the banks.  Can we influence how they deal with the substantial debt that exists at that level and keep people in their homes?</p></speech>

It provides a solution whereby people in private housing hand over control of their homes to the local authority and move into the social housing structure.  The problem is that the nature of its implementation has been complicated.  The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and the Housing Agency, which has administrative responsibility for the scheme, are examining how it can be streamlined.  The Chairman is right in that there is an issue.  There is a great deal of pressure on social housing and there are initiatives to extend and enhance the number of homes being built in that regard, but no more than the general housing supply issue, that takes time to feed through.</p></speech>

What happened that we were not able to attract those jobs to Ireland as it was said that would happen?</p></speech>

Our colleagues in the IDA talk to companies all the time.  Some of the financial services jobs will undoubtedly come to Dublin and some of them will go to other locations.  We have to ask ourselves what is the biggest risk.  I believe the biggest risk is that we will not have a substantial global financial services centre in UK after all this is over.  In terms of HSBC making those choices, I have no doubt it made commercial choices on the basis of its own needs and perspectives.  I have no insight into why it did not choose Dublin over the locations it chose.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran spoke about upskilling people and their different qualifications, the courses that are offer and the difficulty in a growing economy, regardless of how slow the growth is, in that there is competition for those who are skilled.  What are the salary brackets in the Department?  How many people are on a top level of salary and so on down the grades?  Will Mr. Moran give us those figures?</p></speech>

I do not have them with me.  Under the public service reform programme, we have opened recruitment at every level and at all grades from clerical officer up to Secretary General.  The Civil Service is competitive.  We found that we needed to take on people during the crisis when the labour market was soft and we were able to recruit very good quality people, but three, four and five years on from that, as opportunities have opened up for people in terms of their career development, we are starting to lose those people.  We have a different set of circumstances.</p> <p>  I know from talking to colleagues in the system that their turnover rates are tiny and people leave due to retirements, the ending of career breaks and so on.  Our strategy is that we recruit people with the skills but we also develop skills in-house.  We have had many discussions during the past eight to ten years on specialisation.  My view is that in the Department people will probably specialise three or four times during the course of their career.  We must have the wherewithal to develop the economic expertise.  In terms of career development, we offer a diploma in financial services, which will start next month, in order that people can get the necessary skills and they can also do the banking courses.  It is a question of both buying and making, if that makes sense.</p></speech>

The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has welcomed the launch of the country&rsquo;s first national maternity strategy, Creating a Better Future Together for the period 2016 to 2026.  Our midwives section has particularly welcomed the recognition within the strategy of the need to give pregnant women appropriate and informed choices supported by access to the correct level of care and support for their individual needs.  Our midwife membership also welcomes the recognition within the strategy of the role of midwives in the natural childbirth experience.  In particular, we welcome the recognition of midwives leading and delivering care within the multidisciplinary framework for delivering the care pathway intended for normal-risk mothers and babies.  In that regard, we advise the committee that all audits of existing midwifery-led units, MLUs, confirm high-quality performance and high levels of satisfaction felt by mothers.  My colleague, Mary Gorman, has experience of such a midwifery-led unit as she works in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  Ms Gorman can provide further details with regard to the effectiveness and potential of this service model.</p> <p>  In this regard, the publication of the strategy and, more importantly, its implementation should herald a move away from the current overly-medicalised models of care in existence across the country.  It has long been the view of the INMO that current maternity services underutilise the potential of the registered midwife, thus minimising the choices for the woman.  It is imperative, through the implementation of this strategy, that our maternity services utilise the expertise and autonomous practice of all health care professionals within the service in the interests of optimising the quality of the service and the supports to the mother and newborn baby.  In that context, the organisation also fully endorses the recommendations within the strategy for the development of a community midwifery service.  This development, which will see hospital midwives coming out into the community to provide ante and postnatal care, will represent a hugely positive development for mothers and babies, bringing the service to them rather than requiring them to come into a hospital for care and support.</p> <p>  The reality is that our current services are severely understaffed and the experience of the INMO is that there is a complete absence of workforce and manpower planning to address this critical staffing shortfall and to ensure a supply of midwives wishing to work within the Irish public health service into the future.  This committee must understand that the implementation of the strategy, which everyone supports, is dependent upon an acceptance that as we remodel pathways of care and provide choice for mothers, there will be staffing resource implications, particularly in midwifery, which must be planned for, addressed and supplied.</p> <p>  A fundamental requirement with regard to workforce planning to realise and maintain the best-practice ratio is to increase the number of direct-entry undergraduate midwifery places by at least 25% or 125 midwives and, in addition, to expand the number of postgraduate midwifery places available across the country.  The INMO believes this is self-evident but we are not aware of any plans to provide for this increase in supply.  However, it must be noted that in recent years, a number of these postgraduate places have not been filled due to lack of applicants.  This is yet another example of the service-wide issue of recruitment and retention which must be addressed if we are to establish and maintain safe practice levels.</p> <p>  On the more positive side, the committee should note that arising from a recommendation in the report on maternity services in the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise, directors of midwifery have been, or are being, appointed to all maternity units and hospitals, numbering 19 in total.  One important point to note about these appointments is that the post of director of midwifery will, in the context of implementing the maternity strategy, have a remit which spans both the maternity hospital and the adjoining community services.  This is most welcome and is indicative of what should happen as the strategy is implemented and will provide governance to the enhanced community midwifery services referred to earlier.</p> <p>  We wish to acknowledge the dedicated work of the steering group leading to this forward-looking strategy.  The INMO, and particularly our midwives section, commits itself to work with all concerned to deliver upon the strategy&rsquo;s recommendations.  The collective goal must be to ensure excellent standards of care in the environment chosen by the mother based upon her needs and preferences.</p></speech>

The Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists fully endorses everything Ms Leahy has said in respect of the role of midwives.  We are fully supportive of what she has said.  The institute also welcomes the national maternity strategy and hopes it will be implemented.  There are three areas which the institute is particularly keen to see implemented without further delay.  First, we wish to see the mastership model of governance applied nationwide, with each unit having its own separate budget and governance structure.  This model has been in operation in the three Dublin maternity hospitals for more than 200 years.  It is a tried and tested model that works.  A clinician is effectively the chief executive officer, CEO, and is assisted by a director of midwifery and a general manager who has the appropriate financial and clerical support.  The master is ultimately responsible for the quality and safety of the service and is therefore accountable.  With that accountability goes authority to operate the service in the best interests of patients, that is, women and children.  There is an identifiable person who is answerable for the quality of the service.  Experience in the UK has shown that the further away from the patient the governance structure is, the more there is emphasis on financial outcomes and less on clinical outcomes.  The current governance model, whereby maternity units around the country are integrated into the general hospitals, is a failure and recent problems in Cork and Portlaoise are good examples of this.  This failure has been demonstrated repeatedly over the past several years by well-documented tragedies.  There is no budgetary protection for maternity services, including gynaecology, and so they are the first to suffer cutbacks in our hospitals.</p> <p>  Second, we wish to see all units have access to expert ultrasonography services for all pregnant women.  At the moment there is a huge variation in availability of ultrasound for pregnant women around the country.  This has serious implications for the quality of care which can be given to women in pregnancy.</p> <p>  Third, we wish to see an increase in consultant numbers to bring us up to internationally accepted norms.</p><p>It is well recognised and accepted that the number of specialist obstetrician-gynaecologists in Ireland is the lowest in the developed world.  There is a need for an additional 100 consultants to bring us to an acceptable level.  </p><p> There are other elements of the strategy which the institute would like to see developed, such as more community-delivered antenatal care closer to women&rsquo;s homes.  Learning from experience in the UK, it is essential that obstetricians and midwives work together as a team and not separately.  Finally, there is no mention of gynaecological services in the national maternity strategy.  This is a serious deficiency.  A national gynaecology strategy needs to be developed.</p></speech>

I ask Professor Louise Kenny, professor of obstetrics at University College Cork and consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist at Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I echo what my colleagues have said.  We must accept the fact that the woman is at the heart of everything we are addressing today.  We must not lose sight of that.  Notwithstanding that, my colleagues and I at the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists welcome the national maternity strategy and sincerely hope it will be adequately resourced and fully implemented without further delay.</p> <p>  There are fundamental inequities in the provision of women&rsquo;s health care in Ireland in 2017.  First, Ireland has the lowest number of obstetricians and gynaecologists among the OECD countries, at a rate of just 3.95 per 1,000 live births.  This is just over half the comparative number in the UK for the same number of births.  Despite this, clinical outcomes for mothers and infants are comparable with the best internationally.  We urgently need to recruit a minimum of 100 extra consultants.  This will require remedial steps to retain our senior trainee specialists who are currently discouraged from remaining in Ireland by poor working conditions, the perception of a hostile media and gross inequality of remuneration and contracted hours that has been brought about by the introduction of the divisive 2012 consultant contract. </p> <p>  Second, we reiterate the need for equal access for all women to standardised ultrasound services.  Neither specialist ultrasound nor foetal medicine services are available to all pregnant women in the Republic of Ireland.  Even in CUMH, where I work, a tertiary level referral unit where more than 8,000 infants are born every year, we cannot provide second-trimester foetal anomaly scanning for the majority of pregnant women attending for antenatal care.  This issue remains unresolved in 2017 and exposes pregnant women attending CUMH, and their health care providers, to an unacceptable level of risk.  </p> <p>  Finally, the single most important step to safeguard the success of the national maternity strategy is to ensure the governance of women&rsquo;s health services is robust, independent and secure.  International experience demonstrates that women&rsquo;s health services are always the first to be cut when they are not protected by independent governance and a ring-fenced budget.  Closer to home, the well-documented issues with the provision of gynaecology services in CUMH, which have led to unprecedented and dangerously long waiting times for outpatient and surgical treatment, further illustrate this point.   We believe that in keeping with the national maternity strategy, maternity services within the Irish hospital system need to be led by a single accountable individual with both clinical and executive authority.</p> <p>  I thank the committee again for the opportunity to be here today.</p></speech>

I have a number of questions.  The first is for Ms Leahy.  She mentioned community midwifery services in her presentation.  I am specifically interested in knowing how geared up are the primary care centres at present.  I suspect I know the answer to this question but will ask it anyway.  How geared up are they to lead on those community-based maternity services?  Second, what will we need to do to ensure they are geared up and can meet those demands?  Ms Leahy also mentioned the issues of recruitment and retention and the need for, at a minimum, an additional 100 midwifery posts.  Will Ms Leahy elaborate for the committee on what will be needed?  Recruitment is important but is no use without retention.  Ms Leahy should address those two elements.</p> <p>  Dr. Boylan spoke about the need to have a master in the maternity units.  Some of those units are much bigger than others.  Does Dr. Boylan envisage any scenario whereby they would be amalgamated to get the critical mass that would necessitate a master or is he specifically talking about the need to ring-fence budgets with some person who has ultimate financial responsibility and ultimately the capacity to hold on to that money?  As Professor Kenny said, when things get a little bit rough, it is very often the first place that gets cut.  </p> <p>  Dr. Boylan and Professor Kenny spoke about the need for ultrasound services and scans.  I asked the HSE about the availability of the 20-week scan and it advised me initially that 20-week to 22-week scans are available to patients and it listed a number of hospitals.  It initially advised me they were routinely offered and provided.  This is not the case.  I know it is not the case because the HSE revised its response to me and told me then that they are available.  I would like to hear from both Dr. Boylan and Professor Kenny on what exactly is meant by "available".  I do not believe they are available.  I certainly do not believe they are offered as a matter of routine but perhaps the witnesses could enlighten the committee as to how women can access these services.  A person in my family was told that if a woman is medically indicated for it, she will get it.  That is anecdotal but I thought that one would need it to know.  The witnesses' expertise on this is vital.  </p> <p>  There are no gynaecological services mentioned in the maternity strategy.  I speak as a lay person, albeit one who has availed of the maternity services.  I would have thought the two must be connected and that if they are not, somehow we are missing a big chunk of the picture.  Are the witnesses aware of plans to develop a similar strategy?  Perhaps they might be able to tell us why the HSE or the Department of Health left out this very vital service.  </p> <p>  Ms Leahy spoke about the need for ratios.  It is in the strategy and that is to be welcomed but perhaps we are far from having the personnel to populate the ratios.  Does Ms Leahy see a need for those ratios to have some sort of legislative underpinning?  Does she believe a guideline would be enough?  Can we trust the workforce planners, the HSE and the Department of Health to put in place the necessary numbers or do we need something stronger in terms of legislation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1027" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#H00600"><p>I thank the witnesses for their detailed presentations.  I will touch on a number of issues.  The witnesses have referred to an additional number of midwives and I am not sure whether that takes into account the number of people who retire every year.  One major concern I have is lack of support for nursing staff, consultants and junior doctors when there is an adverse event.  It is not clear whether in all of the 19 units there is adequate support for the nursing staff when that occurs.  The witnesses might be able to give us some information on the level of nursing staff who are dropping out of the system because of the pressures and stress they are under in trying to do their job.  Professor Kenny referred to the adverse media reporting on some incidents, which is not helpful to staff.</p><p> Can the witnesses give us some indication of the number of people who are moving away from the service into other areas of nursing?  What recruitment numbers should we be targeting every year, taking into account retirements and the reasons people are leaving?  Is there adequate support for nursing staff where adverse events occur?</p><p> The report into Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise recommended the appointment of directors of midwifery.  My understanding is that eight positions remained unfilled.  That may have changed in the past two or three months, but I understand eight out of 19 positions have not been fully filled or people are only in place in a temporary capacity.  The bar may have been set extremely high.  It might be difficult to get candidates in some of the units because the qualifying criteria have been set so high.  I am keen to hear the views of the witnesses.</p><p> Professor Boylan discussed the recruitment of consultants.  A report was published in 2003 - I keep referring to it - setting out how by 2012 we should have 180 consultants.  At the time we had approximately 100 consultants.  I understand that at the moment we have a whole time equivalent of 130 staff.  I may be wrong about the figure but that is the most recent information I have.  When I raised the question with the HSE recently, I got the impression the executive was only planning to recruit an extra six or eight consultants in the coming 12 months.  Should we set a clear timeframe for the recruitment of the additional consultants?  In 2003, we set a timeframe such that by 2012 we would have 180 recruited.  We are nowhere near the 180 figure.  I am unsure what the birth rate was in 2003 but it had gone up dramatically by 2008 without a significant increase in staffing levels of nursing and medical people.  Yet, they were required to provide the same level of service.  In fairness, they did a good job despite all the pressures.  Let us suppose we were to set a timeline for 100 new consultants.  What timeframe should set to get the candidates in place and to ensure the necessary back-up support for them?  These are relevant issues in the development of maternity services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1029" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#J00200"><p>I thank all the witnesses for their presentations.  It is worth noting that despite a ratio of live births to consultants of 1,000:3.95 our outcomes are comparable with the best in the world.  I am mindful, however, that there is always the straw that breaks the camel's back.  A large number of people have put a great deal of work into this strategy and it is excellent.  One could possibly be excited by this strategy.  I am possibly as excited as I will ever be about a strategy having spending a good deal of time in the maternity services in recent years.</p> <p>  All of us are born at some stage so we all have skin in the game.  When we refer to good outcomes in births, we want a 100% success rate because a catastrophic event at a birth can change the course of the lives of those affected forever.  It is probably the most tragic thing that can happen in the life of any family.</p> <p>  I will repeat Deputy O'Reilly's question.  I cannot understand how gynaecology was not included in this report.  Can someone identify why that is the case?  Is there any historical reason for leaving gynaecology out of the strategy?  I cannot see how the two could be separated.</p> <p>  The master model seems to be a no-brainer.  It seems to have worked for the past 200 years, as one of the witnesses has said already.</p> <p>  One commendable point from the strategy is the lean team structure.  This is something other areas of the health service could examine.  The key is to have an identifiable accountable clinician at the top and there should be a clear chain of command.  The master model is something we have to develop.  It is great that we have the appointment of 19 midwives in train, but it seems the master model is the only way forward.</p> <p>  It was interesting to hear that the first maternity services to be cut are those not protected by independent governance.  We all need to work to ensure that they are ring-fenced or protected.</p> <p>  Without going too much into the detail, will whoever is best placed outline for the committee the impacts of poor gynaecological services on the every day lives of women?  One example relates to having to wait for two years for a procedure.  What effect can that have on quality of life of those affected?  Perhaps it is something people are not comfortable talking about.  My experience is that this would have a serious impact on the day-to-day life of any woman who has to wait for a long time for such a procedure.</p> <p>  Professor Kenny referred to fundamental inequity within our service.  Can she offer a personal view on why it exists?  Why have we ended up in a situation whereby our maternity services or the associated plans are simply not up to scratch, notwithstanding the outcomes?</p> <p>  Can the deputation outline the position on sonography?  Reference was made to an unacceptable level of risk because of deficiencies in sonography services.  Can the deputation provide some detail on this to the committee not only regarding the unborn child, but the issues that might materialise if there is no 22 week scan?  What effect does this risk have on the outcomes?  I assume that following a 22 week scan those involved know what they are dealing with and can plan to mitigate any adverse event.  Let us take this to its natural conclusion.  If there is no 20, 21 or 22 week scan, what is the domino effect?  At the end point, the birth, could we end up with outcomes that are not ideal?  Does it put the clinician in a position that is far from ideal if she does not know what she is dealing with at birth?  Is there any barrier other than resources?  Is it a question of buying machines and getting people to operate them?</p> <p>  Is there any ethical or political barrier to the roll out of detailed scans at 20 weeks?  I am simply putting the question out there.  Is there any such reason?  Perhaps there might be some historical reason that the maximum amount of information might not be made available to the mother of an unborn child.  Is there anecdotal evidence on this point?  What is the proportion of women who are pregnant and who do not get the 22 week scan as a matter of routine?  How many of these people go and pay for a scan?  What I am getting at is whether this is a class issue.  If people cannot afford to pay, is there a reason?  The cost was &euro;160 the last time I had a scan, but perhaps it is &euro;200 now.  Are poorer people not getting a 22 week scan?  Let us take this to its natural conclusion.  Are such women disadvantaged because of their social circumstances?  Will the deputation give me some indication of whether their experience in practice?</p></speech>

They relate to recruitment and retention, ultrasound deficits, the mastership model and leaving gynaecological services out of the strategy.  They are the four common themes of the questions.  Professor Boylan, will you comment on those first, please?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1031" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Boylan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#J00400"><p>Yes.  I can offer two anecdotes with regard to recruitment.  Two jobs came up recently.  One was a consultant job between the Rotunda Hospital and the hospital in Drogheda.  It would normally be seen as a rather attractive job, but no one applied for it.  Another job came up between the National Maternity Hospital and the hospital in Mullingar.  There was one applicant, who was from Lithuania.  She withdrew her application before the interview and that post was not filled either.</p> <p>  I have just retired from clinical practice in the National Maternity Hospital.  My job was exclusively in the National Maternity Hospital and there was no trouble recruiting an excellent candidate to replace me.  She started recently.  This brings us back to the governance issue and it ties in with what we have said about the mastership model.</p><p>I will give the committee an idea of the role of the master.  The master is a senior clinician who is responsible for the outcome of all pregnancies in the hospital in a corporate sense.  They are assisted by a manager who runs the administration and financial side of things but who reports to the master.  The director of midwifery runs the midwifery side of things and works together with the master.  It is one identifiable person who is responsible, accountable and has authority.  When there is any budgetary leeway then one person can make a decision, obviously in consultation with colleagues and so on.  The master is, if you like, a team captain.  On a daily basis, for example, the master goes into the hospital in the morning, meets with all the junior staff who have been in on call the night before and the staff who are coming on duty that day.  The master then knows exactly what has happened since he or she left the hospital the previous day if they have not been in during the middle of the night.  The master has a very tight handle on what is happening at a clinical level, on the ground, which is very important in identifying risk or deficiencies and knowing who is really sick or who might need transfer to a general hospital.  The master has a lot of administrative duties obviously, including meetings with the Department of Health, the HSE, in-hospital meetings, the risk committees and maintaining clinical standards.  The master has a clinical practice also.  He or she does ward rounds at the hospital and knows exactly what is going on.</p><p> Deputy O'Reilly raised the question as to what would happen in smaller units.  The group structure is a way of dealing with that.  For example, the Portlaoise hospital has come under the governance of the Coombe hospital.  They are part of the group that the Coombe and Portlaoise hospitals are in.  In Cork or in the National Maternity Hospital, which is part of the Ireland east hospital group, there is a master responsible primarily for the National Maternity Hospital but one would also have directors of obstetrics and maternity services, including gynaecology in the smaller units but reporting in to the main unit.  In Cork it would include Tralee and Clonmel and so on.  That is the way it works.  The term master can sometimes get up peoples' noses but we think of it as the master mariner, the master of a ship as the captain of the ship, the team captain and so on.  That is the way to look at it.  Part of the whole mastership model, the really important element, is that the master has control of the budget and that there is a protected budget for maternity services and for women's health services.  Cork is a prime example of what goes wrong when they do not have a separate budget that they control.  Professor Kenny will address that issue in a bit more detail.  I believe she has personal knowledge of it.</p><p> With regard to ultrasound services being available, the service availability is very sketchy around the State.  The three Dublin maternity hospitals offer 20 week scans to everybody.  They get them as a matter of routine.  The advantage of knowing if there is a problem is that we can alert the parents to it and we can involve the paediatricians in planning for the outcome.  For example, if a congenital heart defect is detected then the paediatric cardiologist will come to the hospital to meet with the parents.  This would also happen if there are neurological problems such as spina bifida.  A neurosurgeon would come to the meetings and discuss the management of the case, meet with the parents and plan for the outcome.</p><p> Deputy O'Connell asked about ethical issues.  It is interesting that in the past when amniocentesis was a way of diagnosing problems that the Catholic Church had no problem with amniocentesis and knowledge; it is what is done with that knowledge that causes difficulties for the church.  I imagine that the same holds with the fact of diagnosing problems that a baby might have in the womb.  What the parents do with that information is a matter for them, involving their own doctor and their own backgrounds, belief systems and so on.  Professor Kenny will address the ultrasound issue in a little more detail on what are the implications of the follow on from making the diagnosis and foetal medicine services.  It is also important to realise that problems can arise later on in pregnancy.  For example, where a baby is not growing correctly it needs intensive monitoring with ultrasound also.  Those services are very deficient around the State.</p><p> The last issue related to gynaecology services.  I have no idea why gynaecology was left out of the maternity strategy.  I was not involved in its development in any way.  From the point of view of maternity services it is a very good strategy and we support almost everything in it.  Gynaecology is complementary.  A woman does not stop having an involvement with the services that obstetricians, gynaecologists and midwives provide when she stops having children, or if she is trying to have children.  The services are very closely interlinked and it makes no sense for us not to have the gynaecological service.  Gynaecological services are effectively the Cinderella of our health services and are the first to get cut when there is any type of problem with bed allocation and so on.  The question was asked on how many women pay for a scan.  For us it is hard to say but the member is absolutely correct in saying that the poor are disadvantaged, right across the board and do not have access to the same sort of ultrasound services outside of Dublin that they do have access to in the three Dublin maternity hospitals.  There is no distinction with regard to ability to pay.</p><p> Deputy O'Reilly raised the issue of community midwifery services and there is a very good model of the whole range of services out of the National Maternity Hospital with the home birth service, run by midwives from the hospital, community midwifery services where midwives deliver care in the community close to mothers' homes.  There is also what is known as a domino system where a mother will have her antenatal care at home.  She will come to the hospital for scans, etc., has her care at home, has her baby in the hospital and then goes home within a few hours.  She is visited by the midwives afterwards.  This is whole range of opportunities for care and that model should be implemented across the State.  This is all I have to say in response to those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1033" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Louise Kenny" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#K00200"><p>Taking those issues in turn I will address first the issue of consultant attraction and retention.  Notwithstanding the fact that we need to attract another 100 consultants to bring us up to international norms, even that will still be at the lower number of comparable consultants per 1,000 live births in the OECD countries.  It is going to be a challenge.  In Cork we do not even have the jobs to recruit two, but even if we did it would be a challenge because of the issues I outlined in my statement.  It takes 12 to 14 years to train a subspecialist in obstetrics and gynaecology.  That is not a quick process.  What is perceived as a very hostile media, allied to a very unattractive consultant contract, means that at every stage of training our trainee specialists are now leaving the State in significant numbers.  Ireland is failing to attract trainees in at an early stage upon leaving medical school.  At every stage they are leaving for other countries, for better working conditions, greater parity of pay and better working hours.  That is a significant issue for us.  We know - because we have a very transparent and robust reporting system - that our clinical outcomes for mothers and babies are comparable with the best internationally.  There is some variation in figures and population differences can sometimes mask inequalities of caseloading, but that is despite the fact that our clinical resources are inadequate.  That is reflective of the very high standard of midwifery care and consultant care in this State.  It is not, however, sustainable for much longer.  Senator Burke spoke about the straw that broke the camel's back and we are approaching that point.</p> <p>  On the ultrasound issue, in Cork less than half the women are able to access the 20 week scan.  A few years ago that figure was slightly better but loss of staff and the fact that we have not been able to replace those specialist staff has led to the provision of the 20-22 week scan only being available to that half - or less - of the women attending our unit.  I can give the committee some anecdotal evidence of the impact of this situation.  Women in Cork are two and a half hours by road from Dublin and if a baby is born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome it needs to be assessed immediately after birth and transferred to specialist services.  If that baby has not been identified prior to birth due to lack of the 20-22 week scan that whole process has to take place ex-utero with a very critically ill baby in an ambulance.</p><p>This is the most disadvantaged start that child can have and it will absolutely have an impact on its chances of survival.  It is a devastating event for a family.  Other anecdotes involve significant foetal abnormalities such as anencephaly, a very severe form of spina bifida.  If it is not diagnosed antenatally, the effect it can have on health care providers and the women in question is unacceptable in 2017.</p><p> There is no way we can triage or screen for risks in the case of the 22 week scan.  Because we cannot offer a scan to everybody in Cork, we triage on the basis of age and previous history.  It is a screening test but for it to work, it must be applied across the entire population.  Clinicians who make the decisions about who should and should not have a scan are haunted.  It is both extremely frustrating and unacceptable.</p><p> There are time issues with the 20 to 22 week scan.  The staff in our unit are highly skilled midwives.  It take many years to be trained in midwifery and ultrasound provision.  The staff are involved in post-diagnosis management and counselling.  If we were to roll out the service tomorrow, we would not be able to match it with adequate foetal medicine services because we would detect a significant increase in the number of abnormalities which would require specialist input.  Nothing can be done in isolation.  Our big concern is that if we were to address any one of these inadequacies, it would have to be done in tandem with the rest of the strategy.</p><p> The budget for women's health services is still the first to be cut in 2017.  That is both self-evident and a fact.  Historically, there are a few reasons there are unacceptable waiting lists, which are national disgrace, but it is mainly down to governance.  In obstetrics we often say we fire fight.  We cannot say "No."  We cannot let a waiting list build.  Babies will come at 2 a.m. and 2 p.m. and the obstetric service manages in this fashion.</p><p> Most women who are significantly ill with gynaecological diseases do not lie on hospital trolleys.  Generally, they are young or middle-aged women who do not present at emergency departments.  They do not lie on trolleys and are not part of the trolley initiative.  They are not on anyone's radar.</p><p> With regard to the impact of gynaecological conditions on women's lives, more than 4,000 women are waiting to be seen in outpatient services at Cork University Maternity Hospital.  Many of them are incubating a malignancy, which is an unacceptable level of risk.  Those who present with urogynaecological issues or heavy menstrual bleeding are young women who are trying to raise a family and-or hold down a job, have a haemoglobin level of five and bleed two or three weeks every month.  They cannot leave the house.  They are housebound for the want of an outpatients service treatment investigation and effective management.  From a urogynaecological perspective, we have women who suffer from urinary incontinence.  It has been well demonstrated in a lot of international research that this has the most devastating psychological impact on a woman's health and well-being.  It has a significant impact on the household's economy as women cannot work and are on long-term sick leave.  It has an impact on their children and partners.  It is a devastating conveyor belt towards significant problems.  Frustratingly, many of these issues can be addressed adequately.  We are not speaking about very complex open-heart surgery but about access to relatively low intensity procedures.  If we were resourced adequately, we could offer them.  I come back to the fact that many women who are referred to the outpatients service with what are perceived to be minor problems, because we can only triage on the basis of a referral letter, are incubating a malignancy, which is an unacceptable level of risk.  </p><p> I will be happy to answer supplementary questions or go into any of these issues in further detail.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1036" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Leahy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#L00300"><p>In 2014 we surveyed the number of midwives and the information was provided by employers.  There were 1,849 midwives, which gave a ratio of one midwife to 38 births, based on a total of 70,879 births.  At the time 554 midwives were needed, but two things have happened since.  The birth rate has decreased slightly and a strategy has evolved which recommends a ratio of 1: 29.5.  We have a long way to go to reach that ratio.</p> <p>  The issue of recruitment and retention has been mentioned.  We have significant problems in that regard.  In our opening statement we mentioned that we had a problem with the undergraduate programme.  There is a high attrition rate from the direct entry midwifery programme.  Committee members may not be aware that traditionally people became general nurses first and then went into midwifery; therefore, they got a good introduction to health care in general.  They worked in a hospital and then sought midwifery placements.  As a result, they knew going into it what was ahead of them.  Direct entry to midwifery is somewhat more difficult for students in that they do not necessarily have knowledge of what they are going into.  It is highly pressurised, an area which has been under the microscope in recent years, with many negative reports, including the report on services in Portlaoise.  It involves a high level of litigation and high risk.  The pressure on students is extreme.  This is coupled with the fact that there is a deficit in the number of qualified midwives, with the result that they are not freed to educate or mentor students.  There is an attrition rate of 25% from the direct entry programme, which is extremely worrying.  In some pockets the attrition rate is as high as 40%.  Students are leaving the four-year degree programme in the third or fourth year because the pressure is too much.</p> <p>  Another problem I must highlight in this area affects clinical placement co-ordinators - clinicians who are working with student midwives to educate them in clinical skills.  The recommended ratio is one clinical placement co-ordinator to 15 students, but we are nowhere near this figure in the Irish health care setting.  Student midwives do not receive support and are not being mentored; as a result, they find the area pressurised.  We also have anecdotal information that direct entry students are working in part-time jobs to support their education and are being harvested into areas such as retail, which is worrying.  They are qualifying or coming near to it, but they do not practise.  They are being offered salaries in the retail sector or other non-midwifery areas which exceed that which a midwife earns.  They may also have company cars.  Midwives ask why they should take a position where they would be at risk of litigation on a daily basis, with their licence exposed, in a pressurised and stressful role when they can take something much easier.</p> <p>  In our opening statement we alluded to the difficulty in seeking postgraduate placements.  We have called for an increase in the number, but we must acknowledge that many such placements are not taken up by students.  There are a number of reasons for this, one of which is we are very short of nurses.  To reply to Senator Colm Burke, there is a distinction between nursing and midwifery; they are two separate professions.  Many nurses who wish to move into midwifery are not released to pursue education in midwifery because we are short of nurses and employers will not fund such education because of budgetary constraints.  A postgraduate midwife will qualify after undertaking a four-year undergraduate nursing degree programme and an 18-month postgraduate midwifery programme.  Those who ordinarily undertake this programme have identified that when they complete it, they will not gain experience and will not be recruited.  If they have a lack of experience, they have poor job prospects.  They are asking what is the point of undertaking the midwifery programme when they will not be recruited at the end of it.  Many of those who have come through the postgraduate system have returned to general nursing and do not use their midwifery qualification, which is huge concern.</p> <p>  The answer is we must produce our own midwives.  We have to increase the number of undergraduate and postgraduate placements.  The midwives who complete the undergraduate programme perform very well in the workplace.  They are possibly in pockets in which they receive support and mentoring, but there are also pockets in which there is no support or mentoring.</p><p>Deputy O'Reilly asked what is needed.  We have to grow the strength of our own midwives and we need to attain a critical mass of them in this country.  She asked whether we need legislation to underpin this, but we must grow midwifery and reach a critical mass first.  Legislation will be warranted further down the line, but we have much work to do.  We are greatly concerned that we are a year into the strategy and we do not see any evidence of recruitment.  We would welcome the rolling out of the provision of directors of midwifery in the 19 units.  Heretofore, many units did not have directors of midwifery, and if they did, they were often directors from a nursing background, not a midwifery background.  We have a lot of work to do in recruiting.  We cannot recruit midwives from abroad for a number of reasons.  They are often not there, and if they are, we have a very high standard of education in Ireland so there is often a deficit or a difference in educational standard.</p><p> Deputy O'Reilly also mentioned community midwifery and primary care.  I am a registered midwife but I work as a public health nurse so I am in community and primary care.  I am fortunate enough to be in a world-class purpose-built primary care unit.  The problem with it is that it is so busy that it has only been open for three years and we actually find it hard to get a room within our own building because the level of turnover is massive, although the turnover is great to see.  The antenatal programmes have reached that primary care centre, so mums - this is all about mums - now have their antenatal care in a primary care centre.  Then, as public health nurses, we provide the postnatal care in the exact same centre, which is very close to the mums' residential areas, so the care is delivered in the community, which is to be welcomed.</p><p> What is to be done?  Deputy O'Reilly almost answered the question herself.  We need far more primary care centres and they need to be rolled out very quickly.  Some of my colleagues work in single inappropriate facilities with a lack of IT and care-taking facilities.  This is not appropriate as a clinic for antenatal women.  If we had the infrastructure rolled out in the community - we have been talking about this for far too long - it would help a lot in bringing more antenatal care into the community.  We also have the domino scheme, to which Dr. Boylan alluded.  We had a domino scheme in Galway and it was taken away because of lack of funding.  However, we have an early discharge programme in Galway whereby the midwives take on an average of four to five mums who have delivered their babies home to the community within perhaps 24 hours or at most 48 hours.  The midwives care for them in the community perhaps for the first five days and then hand care over to the public health nurse.  In this regard, it was a very retrograde step that midwifery was taken away as a necessity for public health nursing education because if midwifery were brought back for public health and community midwives came out for the early postnatal period, this would help us to reach our critical mass.</p><p> Deputy Burke, or Senator Burke, rather - I apologise, I have elevated him - mentioned support.  I have gone some way towards answering his question with the points I made about the lack of a clinical co-ordinator for the student.  The supports are not there for the students coming through the system, but they are not there for the midwives on the ground either.  The nature of midwifery practice is that it is quite challenging.  There are many unforeseen and emergency situations.  It is underestimated by our management system, and the staff are not on the ground to take time to process some of the harrowing events being dealt with in the workplace.  The Senator mentioned the 19 directors of midwifery and that eight posts were not filled.  I am not clear on the numbers, so perhaps my colleague will take that question.</p><p> Deputy O'Connell made a comment on why gynaecology was not included in the strategy.  My colleague, Mary Gorman, was a member of the strategy so, again, she might take those questions.  If there are questions I have not answered, I ask members to feel free to come back to me again.</p></speech>

There are quite a number of pockets in different places all over the country - Dublin, Cork, Galway and midwifery-led units, MLUs, in Drogheda and Cavan - where there are quite good services.  However, it was recognised in the strategy that they were only in pockets, and it is a matter of getting the driver to roll them out across the country.  This can be done in an incremental phase, but we need to get a driver or task force to implement and roll out community midwifery services.</p> <p>  The provision of directors of midwifery is certainly very welcome as previous to this, at our highest level, we had an assistant director of midwifery who did not have autonomy.  We now have directors of midwifery who have autonomy and can lead the service.  The jobs were advertised and have now been filled.  However, because these positions were not available, the bar was set high, as it should be, but experience should also be taken into account and these people should be allowed to attain the qualifications along with the experience.</p> <p>  The gynaecology element of the maternity strategy was looked into, and we as a group tried to push for its inclusion in the strategy, but it was excluded from the terms of reference.  The Department of Health said it would certainly look at this when preparing the maternity strategy and that there needed to be a gynaecology strategy and that it should be to the fore.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1040" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#M00400"><p>I welcome all our guests to this session.  In the next session, representatives of the HSE will be before us, so if the witnesses want to prompt anything to me and my colleagues, I am sure we will be able to facilitate that for the second session.  I apologise for being late; I also had to attend a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts.  A number of us have two committees on at the same time.</p> <p>  I am very supportive of the strategy and I was one of the people who asked that the witnesses be brought before the committee.  I accept the criticism regarding gynaecological services but, in principle, the strategy is a very good one.  My issue is not with the strategy rather to get the witnesses' realistic views as to whether it can be implemented.  I am giving them an opportunity to give us their considered views because they are the experts in this area and because we will hear the alternative views of Mr. Liam Woods after the break.</p> <p>  There is a huge capital requirement regarding this strategy and I want to see it happen.  It needs to happen and it needs to be a priority for this and future Governments because it will take that amount of time.  I am open to the suggestion of alternative funding models to ensure we bring this about as quickly as possible.  Do the witnesses support that view?  I note the commentary regarding funding and women's health being first to be cut from a capital point of view with all the competing priorities.  Realistically, given all that is going on, I cannot say with certainty that it will be guaranteed that the capital requirements will be put forward to ensure that the strategy is implemented as swiftly as possible.  We will therefore need to consider alternative models.  Would the witnesses support that?  For instance, in the past few years, my wife and I have used the services in Limerick under the excellent service provided by Dr. Gerry Burke.  The building is falling down but the service is excellent.  I want to see the design phase of the new unit in Limerick happen, but &euro;3 million is envisaged this year just to design it.  I have seen neither sight nor sound of this.  I ask the witnesses' opinions in this regard.</p> <p>  The second issue is one which is sometimes underestimated, namely, mental health issues.  While recognised in the strategy, I am concerned about how much progress is being made in appointing consultant psychiatrists and teams with a particular interest in perinatal mental health.  What funding is being provided in this regard?  Have the witnesses seen any changes?  Is it improving?  Is it disimproving?  From evidence I have heard and seen, and which has been brought to my attention, unfortunately, I understand it is the latter.  I ask the witnesses for their views in this regard.</p> <p>  Ultrasound was mentioned.</p><p>I do not want to go over previous questions because they have been comprehensive in their answers.  I have huge concerns about equal access to ultrasound across the country.  In their reply this time round, they might outline why, and where geographically, there are differentials in the availability of ultrasound for women in the hospital groups.</p><p> I am very much taken by Dr. Boylan's comment on the mastership governance model.  I fully agree it has worked for a couple of hundred years.  More have an issue with the term than with the ideology behind it which  is correct.  The master is the captain of the team and the person leading.  Given Dr. Boylan placed such emphasis on it, has he a concern that there will be a different model put in place?  If so, Dr. Boylan might express his concern so that we can tease it out with others coming in later.</p><p> I am very much taken by the contributions of both Marys, in particular, Ms Leahy, on the midwife-to-staff ratios.  It is clear that where there is good guidance, for want of a better word, there is a greater chance that more students will come through.  Why is this the case?  Are there geographical issues or issues in relation to certain hospital groups which Ms Leahy might outline to us, and is this down to personal good management or are there other issues?  Is it down to the fact that in some areas there is contagion because of the issues in a specific hospital or hospital group?  I want to tease that out more because it is an important issue for us.</p><p> The strategy envisages a doubling of consultant obstetricians over the next ten years.  Have any of the witnesses, in the past year or so, because the strategy is now a year in place, seen locally of any extra funding being provided to implement this?  I presume the answer is, "No".  It points to the fact that this strategy is all very well on paper but it is not being implemented.</p><p> I am sorry for all the questions.  My final one relates to community midwifery and funding in this area.  I have seen evidence in some areas where it is working well and in others where there are gaps in funding which means the service available differentiates.  Could we have a little more information on the areas where the latter is the case where there may be problems rather than where there is a certain standard?  Those are my questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1042" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#N00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  I must be repetitive because all our questions are of equal importance.  I will re-emphasis and maybe get more detail, particularly from Professor Kenny, on the issue of the 20th week scan not available to everybody.  Is it purely a clinical decision as to who gets the scan?  At what stage is the clinical decision primarily bases on whether or not there is funding available?  In other words, if an obstetrician decides that every case is clinically required, will every scan be provided?  Professor Kenny can answer that in the overall context but it is an important issue.  Professor Kenny stated quite clearly that this is putting the lives of both mother and child at risk and I am trying to work out the ethical side of that in terms of making a decision primarily based on the fact that they ration because they are told there is no funding available.  I wonder where that falls in the issue of the efficacy of the decision-making process, not only of the doctors but, primarily, of management.</p> <p>  At what stage is the optimum time for a scan to identify most challenges that could come about in terms of both the fetal development or implications for the woman's health?  Is 20 weeks critically important or could it be at 15 weeks or 14 weeks?  At what stage is it best to do the scan?  The reason I ask is Deputy O'Connell raised issues about whether or not there is resistance to scans and the sharing of that information based on religious ethos.  I ask whether or not that is the case in any of the maternity services.</p> <p>  Recruitment and retention is an issue, both in midwifery services and also in obstetrics and gynaecology.  Let us be honest, we talk about career pathways and the work environment, but I assume the remunerative package is a big issue.  There is no point in us beating about the bush here.  The remunerative package is clearly an issue as well.  There is plenty of evidence that consultants are not even looking at contracts in this country anymore because, although there are other issues, of the remunerative package.  They might elaborate on that as well.</p> <p>  The strategy states that all pregnant women need a certain level of support, but some need more specialised care, and it proposes an integrated care model that encompasses all the necessary safety nets in line with patient safety principles, which delivers care at the lowest level of complexity, yet has the capacity and the ability to provide specialised and complex care, quickly, as required.  It also recommends that dedicated emergency obstetric teams be provided in each maternity unit, and that a maternal retrieval service should be available alongside the existing neonatal retrieval service.  I assume that is an aspiration and it is not happening in practice in every one of the 19 maternity centres.  It goes back to what Dr. Boylan stated about governance and a master-led governance structure.  Dr. Boylan stated in his presentation that he wished to see the mastership model of governance applied in every unit but I assume he means in every hospital group as opposed to every unit.  At what stage are we in terms of assessing whether or not all the maternity units will be able to deliver safe maternity services according to the strategy outlined or are we merely pretending and trying to avoid difficult political decisions about maternity services in the time ahead in some of the maternity units?</p> <p>  The issue of the capital programme follows on from the previous point.  If we are to talk about recruitment and retention and expending the services, we need a lot of capital investment, merely to stand still.  I note there are some amalgamations here in Dublin but across the country many of the facilities are poor.</p> <p>  Women's health and home birthing is an issue that was prevalent and campaigned about for a number of years.  The campaigning element of home birthing has dissipated to a certain extent.  Do we have the capacity to deliver a safe home birthing service for those who want it?  Is there an issue about stating that service is available when deep down we know that we do not have the capacity to deliver it?  There is an ethical question there, and a patient safety question as well.</p> <p>  With regard to the issue of women's health and well-being, a key component of the strategy recommends the health and well-being approach to give babies the best start and improve women's health.  I presume it is referring to women's health in advance of pregnancy, during pregnancy and post-natal.  How far down the road have we got on that because the statistics show us that obesity, diabetes, smoking and poor diet lead to poor health outcomes?  How far down the road have we got in providing proper services and educational programmes for women of conception age?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1043" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Louise Kenny" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#O00100"><p>Perinatal mental health services are patchy at best.  I have not seen any improvement in perinatal mental health provision in recent years.  It is a very specialist area.  All best practice recognises that a woman and a family's best chance of full recovery from an acute perinatal mental crisis is through the provision of specialist services in dedicated mother and baby units, to which we do not have adequate access nationwide.  On a more worrying level, we do not have individual specialists in perinatal mental health at anywhere near what would be regarded as international norms.  This is a fundamental problem and a matter of grave concern in an area that is woefully under-resourced.  I have not seen any improvement in recent years in the provision of perinatal mental health services, a point with which my colleague would agree.</p> <p>  The accepted international norm for care pathways of ultrasound provision in pregnancy is a minimum of two scans, the first of which takes place at the end of the first trimester and the beginning of the second.  The primary function of this scan is to confirm pregnancy, the location of the pregnancy and the number of babies involved.  That is of clinical importance in dating the pregnancy, defining multiple pregnancy, which is a high-risk pregnancy, and also an extra-uterine pregnancy, which can be a life-threatening condition.</p> <p>  Following the first trimester scan, the next recommended minimal scan is a 20-week to 22-week scan, best performed at that time.  That is a scan to screen for foetal development and foetal abnormality.  As it is a screening scan, it cannot, by definition, be given to just selected proportions of the population, yet that is what we are doing.  We are doing it specifically because we cannot give this scan to every one of the 8,000 women who present at Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, for antenatal care every year.  At present, we have adequate resources to provide that scan for approximately half of all women.  Those who are not triaged to receive this scan can, if they are in a position to afford it, pay for a private scan.  Accordingly, we have a two-tier health provision in terms of access to ultrasound and the poor are disadvantaged.</p> <p>  Clinically, we make the decision on the basis of those who are perceived to be at higher risk of having a baby or a pregnancy affected by a complication.  Currently, we screen out those women who are of an older maternal age, those who have had a previous bad obstetric outcome and those who have a significant family history that would delineate them as being at risk.  The majority of babies born with complex foetal abnormalities or significant neonatal conditions resulting from, for example, foetal growth restriction, are not born to women with any risk factors.  In that kind of situation, we will miss the majority of babies born with problems.</p> <p>  If, for example, early foetal onset growth restriction or grave foetal abnormalities, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which would be amenable to surgery, potentially ex-utero, are not picked up, it will increase the mortality from those conditions.  Babies will and do die as a direct result of a lack of access to ultrasounds.</p></speech>

The more significant the abnormality or clinical finding, the greater the probability it is that it would be picked up.

We triage because we have to, not because we want to or not because we should.  In a situation where we can only provide ultrasounds in respect of half of all pregnancies, we have to make a decision as to who will get that scan.  We make very difficult clinical decisions, based on previous history and perceived risk.  It is woefully inadequate and sets us apart from our international neighbours.</p> <p>  I have been in Ireland for ten years, having trained in the UK.  I cannot speak to whether the provision of that scan has been curtailed by a perceived influence of religion versus State or patient choice based on the findings of the scan.  That is not my impression.  At various times in recent years we came close to providing the scan for 70% to 80% of the population.  However, loss of staff, the fact staff are not replaced and increasingly curtailed resources are driving the availability of this scan.</p> <p>  If we are in a position to roll out that scan to every single woman, it will have a knock-on effect on foetal medicine services.  We cannot provide a scan and make a diagnosis but not be in position to follow up with foetal medicine services.  That will certainly have an impact on the care we provide in CUMH.  We will need more foetal medicine sessions to provide ongoing care pathways to those women identified with complex pregnancies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1050" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Boylan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#O00800"><p>A private scanning system was developed at the National Maternity Hospital.  Private patients are sent to that unit for scans.  That has allowed us in the hospital to free up areas for giving every public patient a scan.  There is no lack of availability of ultrasound.  This comes back to the governance issue in that in a hospital with a master, one can do that.  In a maternity unit integrated in a general hospital, it is well-nigh impossible to have that entrepreneurial approach to matters.  One will just get slapped down and will not be able to do it.</p> <p>  It is well recognised that we need an extra 100 consultants but, clearly, they cannot be appointed at the one time.  That would not be good practice in fact.  We need to get ten a year over the next ten years, plus replacements for those who retire.  Those numbers are absolutely predictable.  So far, there has been very little movement on that.  The committee could ask the Health Service Executive, HSE, as to what movement there is to replace consultants and how it will make it more attractive for them.</p> <p>  As to the question on the governance model and whether smaller units would be closed, it ties in a little bit with the question of home births and risk stratification.  Most obstetricians have grave concerns about home birth because a birth is only safe once it is over.  The nature of obstetric practice is that things can happen very fast and unpredictably.  Having said that, I would be personally comfortable with women having their second or subsequent children at home if they are in a low-risk category and if their first baby was a normal birth.  The majority of problems in obstetric care arise in women having their first baby.  That is well documented.  Obviously, there are some women who will try and have their first baby at home.  A home birth service is run out of the National Maternity Hospital.  A substantial proportion of those women are referred into the hospital during the course of their birth, mainly for pain relief because they want an epidural, which can only be given in hospital, or the labour is too slow.  If done within the proper governance structure, home births can work.</p> <p>  Over time, the smaller units will probably deliver women who are very low risk.  This means they will deal with very few women having their first baby and more women having their second and subsequent children, where the first one was normal and the anticipation is that there will be no adverse outcome, although one cannot be sure until the whole thing is over.</p><p>It is something that will probably evolve over time and my impression is that this is how the smaller units will evolve.  It is not a recommendation.  It is just an impression and I think that is probably what is going to happen.  </p><p> Deputy Kelly asked about funding models.  The cancer strategy is a good model.  In this case, one had a protected budget run by a clinician who was able to implement a strategy for the development of cancer services.  The same sort of model could be implemented to develop and implement the maternity strategy in future years.  There has been an appointment to the national women and infants' health programme office.  I am not sure whether that has been made public yet but a very highly qualified person has been appointed who will be superb at doing this job.  The hope for us is that this office, the HSE and the Department will work together to implement the strategy in a phased way because it cannot all be done overnight.  That is not the way things work.  In response to Deputy's Kelly's question about whether it will happen, not all of it will happen.  Nothing ever does but we would hope that some of the things will happen.  The three issues I listed that were elaborated upon by Professor Kenny are things we certainly feel are essential.  The more one talks about maternity services and the maternity strategy, it all comes back to governance, budget and governance models.  The reason there are so many problems in Cork, which is a classic example of a hospital which is the same size as the Dublin maternity hospitals, is because of governance.  It is integrated into the main hospital so it has no control over its budget, staff appointments, midwifery numbers and so on.  It cannot open the operating theatres and has lost millions from its budget from the years because it is integrated into the general hospital.  It is a failure.  It is not working and women are suffering as a consequence with some women developing cancer in the community as we speak because of the failure of that governance model.  That needs to be changed and is the single most important thing.  If we have that governance model with doctors and midwives working together to implement the really important bits of this strategy first, it will allow all the other midwifery elements to be developed.  The critical issues are governance, a protected budget and no integration with the general hospitals because it does not work and women and babies suffer as a consequence.  </p></speech>

When CMH opened in 2006-2007, I was a newly appointed consultant.  My colleagues had argued successfully for a budget that was adequate to run the hospital.  Had we had control over that budget - no increases and no particular incentives - we would not be where we are now.  We are where we are now with 4,000 plus women on our outpatient waiting list and 2,000 plus women waiting for surgery because pregnant women and women with gynaecological issues are on not trolleys, not in the headlines and not on the radar.  They are the first to be cut all the time.  Year on year, we have lost our budget to the main campus.  I am not pretending or suggesting that the money has been misspent in any way.  It has been reallocated to vital clinical care but the past ten years have been ones of fiscal constraint.  It has been very difficult in every hospital and in every form of health care provision across the entire country.  That money has been spent in other areas of clinical care and not on gynaecology or maternity services and, consequently, we are where we are now with waiting lists that are worrying beyond belief.</p> <p>  We were asked directly whether we are advocating a different model from the mastership model because we do not have the mastership model outside Dublin.  I am agnostic as to what we call it - a master or mistress.  All our colleagues nationally agree fundamentally on the need for one single accountable individual with clinical and executive management and oversight.  I can assure the committee that if we had that in the past ten years, we would have no waiting lists and our hospital would be the flagship it was designed to be and could be if we were adequately resourced.  We are not talking about an increased budget.  We are talking about the budget we argued for back in 2006.  If we had that and governance, our waiting lists would not be making headlines nationally.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for coming before us this morning and offering their advice and responses.  In respect of midwifery and nursing in general, obesity in women's health has already been referred to.  I presume the witnesses have a programme in mind to alert young women and young people in general to warnings about their health and obesity, which is an increasing problem.  What is in hand?  Is it being done through the schools, particularly secondary schools?</p> <p>  The issue of recruitment has come up on several occasions.  Sadly, I have put down thousands of questions over the past ten years.  Nobody has adequately answered the question about why we have such a problem with recruitment in the health services at nursing and consultant level and even at GP level.  Is there any advice the witnesses would give us and the Department about the problem because they deal with it at first hand?  What is the problem here?  Does it apply in other jurisdictions.  Does it affect them in the same way and if not, why not?  It is not that I wish to in any way encourage some of the difficulties they have here.  We take the point about gynaecology services and inclusion in the strategy.  Presumably, we will take this up with the Minister to ensure that we have the most comprehensive report possible.  Recruitment comes up again and again.  It has been said that the positions are not attractive.  Why are they not attractive?  Again, it applies to all levels.  An interesting point was made by Dr. Boylan to the effect that only one person applied for a position and subsequently withdrew.</p><p>That has been happening in regard to the appointment of general practitioners to fill spaces at local level.</p><p> I do not want to labour my next point but it is very important.  There is a certain amount of stress in the health services arising from litigation and various other circumstances.  It appears the general public has concluded that if things had been done in a different fashion, some litigation might not have occurred.  Altogether apart from litigation, there is the question of the health of the victims, be they women or children.  Could the delegates give us some indication as to what could or should have been done in this regard bearing in mind the number of cases with which they are very familiar?  What procedures and fail-safe measures could have been put in place to try to prevent some of the events that occurred?  I will not go into individual cases.  I have dealt with a number of them and I am sure every other member of the committee has done so also.  To respect people's privacy, I would not dream of mentioning the cases.  I am concerned, however, about some of the matters that have been brought to my attention that should not have arisen.  I refer in particular to the matter of early diagnosis for newborn babies.  As Professor Boylan has already said, things can and do happen very quickly.  Do the delegates have any advice or information that might be helpful to us in our discussions with the Minister to try to lift the burden of pressure on the health services?  Fear of litigation arises where things do not happen as they should and when they should, with obvious consequences.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for attending and giving up their precious time to be here with us today.  Most of my questions have been asked by my colleagues.</p> <p>  Pre-conception care seems to be very much missing in the whole strategy.  Would it be a good idea to include it?  As Deputy Kelleher was saying, perhaps there should be more advice on weight and the dangers of smoking.</p> <p>  Should there be a fertility section in the strategy?  To me, the concept of maternity covers the time from when one tries to get pregnant to when the baby is born.  Personally, I would like to see more emphasis on that.  What are the delegates' opinions on it?</p> <p>  All the delegates mentioned the lack of workforce planning, recruitment and the lack of staff.  Could these problems prevent the whole plan being implemented?  It could be a major stumbling block.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1065" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1405" speakername="Alice Mary Higgins" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#Q00300"><p>I am replacing Senator John Dolan today.  I thank the speakers very much for their very interesting and comprehensive answers to the questions.  I will not ask again many of the questions, including that on fertility asked by Deputy Murphy O'Mahony.</p> <p>  I wish to highlight a couple of key points and ask the delegates for their thoughts.  In a previous role, I worked with the National Women's Council of Ireland, which was deeply involved in consultation on the maternity strategy and would have welcomed it.  One of the key elements was the question of choice for mothers.  It is strong that there are options on supported care, assisted care, specialised care and the various strands.  There is a vision of parallel facilities that allow dedication in one area but swift movement to another service, if necessary.  Are the practical facilities beginning to be put into place to ensure the choice is practicable and that the movement between the strands, where necessary, is being managed?  I would really appreciate an answer.</p> <p>  One of the key points the National Women's Council of Ireland found women were making was on having the option of midwife-led services, where possible.  There is strong demand for greater midwifery resources.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Leahy.  She outlined some obstacles resulting in people getting lost in the system.  Potential midwives, at postgraduate or undergraduate level, are getting lost.</p> <p>  Could the delegates comment on another aspect in addition to the questions of recruitment, redirection and retention, namely the question of progression?  There seem to be many concerns over how people can progress.  What is the position on incremental recognition and remuneration?  What are the ladders of progression for people entering midwifery, particularly if we want to encourage people to provide services such as out-of-hours care and clinical care?  I refer also to progression separate from management.  It is very strong that there will now be directors of midwifery but it seems that, in many cases, the only progression is into management.  How is progression as a clinician or medical expert in practice in the field being supported?  How could it be?  What difference might it make?</p> <p>  Could the delegates comment on neonatal nursing and neonatal nursing care?  There are concerns over this area.  Postnatal care has been touched on.  Perinatal psychology is very important.  I understand that in the west, there is no perinatal psychologist.  There are three part-time perinatal psychologists available in the country.  My figures may be wrong.  The number available represents a considerable concern and vulnerability.  Could I hear comments on how the gaps in this area and areas such as lactation support put pressure on general nursing if the necessary specialised postnatal services are not available?</p> <p>  Let me cover the question of obstetricians and gynaecologists.  I really welcome the debate we have had on the gynaecological supports.  That has been key.  I imagine a gynaecological strategy will be taken up with the HSE.  Even in advance of that, it would seem there needs to some very clear measure in respect of the support services currently associated with the maternity strategy.  What should be happening in the interim as we move towards having a gynaecological strategy?  What kinds of demands should we be making to the health services in this regard?</p> <p>  On consultants, we are talking about very low numbers so it seems very ambitious to refer to in-house consultants.  We know that when there are complications in pregnancy, they can be very sudden and catastrophic.  As we have said in regard to 24/7 care, having a senior consultant available is the ideal.  What are the delegates' thoughts on having in-house consultancy capacity?  How far are we from that?  Could it be achieved?  Would it be valuable?</p> <p>  We have talked about the idea of dedicated resources, people being in parallel acute adult care in a general hospital and the need for dedicated ring-fenced resource and dedicated accountable management.  If there is dedicated accountable management that is not just minding and guarding the budget but also responsible for ensuring that all the resources in a hospital, such as that in Cork, are made available on a practical level, would this in itself prove an incentive in respect of recruitment?</p> <p>  The fear of litigation has been highlighted.  If there were an accountability structure and resources such as sonography, which allows for better diagnosis and a better-prepared birth experience, would they incentivise higher rates of recruitment and retention?</p> <p>  There are gaps in terms of choice and consent in our national consent policy, and the question of legal uncertainty has been highlighted.  There are circumstances in which, even at birth or during pregnancy, legal advice should be sought.  I wanted to mention this and am not necessarily asking the delegates to comment on it.  I refer to legal advice in respect of the eighth amendment, for example.  That is not necessarily what we are discussing here but this is still an area over which there may be a question mark in the delicate decisions around birth.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1066" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#R00100"><p>I thank the Chairman for his indulgence and the committee for allowing me, as a non-member, to pose some questions.  I will endeavour to be very brief.  </p><p>I refer specifically to the issue of governance, particularly as it relates to Cork University Maternity Hospital which the Minister visited last week.  Following the visit I asked a parliamentary question about the engagement with clinicians at the hospital.  I am particularly delighted that Professor Louise Kenny is here.  I acknowledge publicly the work she has done, particularly as a principal investigator and a Science Foundation Ireland funding awardee.  I also acknowledge the work being done at the infant centre at Cork University Maternity Hospital where the research conducted is world class.</p><p>To get down to brass tacks, my parliamentary question was related specifically to the issue of waiting lists for gynecological services.  We have had an articulation of the pressures and the potential for the presentation of cancer cases in the absence of proper and timely interventions.  When I asked the Minister what his intentions were on waiting lists, he replied:</p><blockquote>I am assured that the 2017 NTPF waiting list initiative will help to alleviate some of the difficulties in Cork.  In 2017, the NTPF will have an allocation of &euro;20 million and, in the first instance, in the region of &euro;5 million will be targeted at day case procedures.  The NTPF anticipate that 2,500 of the longest waiting day case patients, including patients on the CUMH waiting list, will be treated under this initiative.</blockquote> <p>My question is very simple.  Is the National Treatment Purchase Fund the proper mechanism under which women waiting to be seen at Cork University Maternity Hospital should be dealt with?  I have my doubts about whether the National Treatment Purchase Fund is the correct mechanism or the most appropriate solution to this problem and I ask Professor Kenny and her colleagues for their views in that regard.  There are two theatres in Cork University Maternity Hospital, but I understand only one is open and four days a week.  As such, it is operating at a sub-optimal level.  I ask for the perspective of Professor Kenny of how this is impacting on services and whether, if the two theatres were operating at the optimum level, that would be the best use of resources.</p></speech>

While there are elements that relate to gynaecological services, the Deputy is discussing local issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1068" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#R00300"><p>In that case let me couch it in the language of the national maternity strategy.  If we are to have a fully operational national maternity strategy, there is a governance issue, to which the delegates have referred.  It is evident by any objective analysis of the operation of Cork University Maternity Hospital under the umbrella of Cork University Hospital has been to the detriment of health services for women.   There is a very clear, linear connection.  I am trying to ascertain something on the governance issue that has been referred to and relate it to the south/south west hospital group.  We are being told that the HSE's national women and infants health programme and maternity networks will be established across hospital groups, if it has not already been done.  My question is whether, if Cork University Maternity Hospital is part of the south/south west hospital group, it is being represented adequately within the group such that there are transfers of funding and resources from the parent hospital in a manner which ensures services are delivered for women.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1069" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Leahy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#R00400"><p>I will start from the beginning with the questions from Deputy Alan Kelly.  He asked if the strategy was implementable.  It is a ten year strategy and we have grave concerns at this stage, given that a year has passed in which there has been very little progress.  While the strategy can be implemented, the important aspects must be identified, as Dr. Boylan said, and driven first.  A task force has to be established.  It cannot be a shiny strategy which is on a shelf, as other strategies have been.  We need an annual report as each year unfolds because two or three years can pass quite easily and then there is a crisis.  While the strategy can be implemented, doing so will require great dedication and investment.  We have to get the staff in place.</p> <p>  Deputy Alan Kelly mentioned budgeting.  It has been a problem, on which the INMO has made a presentation to the joint committee.  We have made a proposal on multi-annual budgets because when new services are established, funding must be front-loaded.  There is a lot of investment in setting up a service not to have adequate funding to drive it forward.  As such, we need multi-annual budgets.  A ring-fenced budget is needed for implementation of the strategy.  The current HSE service plan refers to the recruitment this year of 100 midwives, but no moves have been made in that regard.  Again, it needs to be driven and pushed by the politicians.</p> <p>  Deputy Alan Kelly referred to mental health service.  I think that question was answered.  The issue of ultrasound services has also been addressed.  The Deputy mentioned students and asked if there were geographical issues.  I am not clear on what was meant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1070" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#R00500"><p>Ms Leahy made the point very clearly that where there was good management or leadership, it was much more likely that trainees would stay within the system.  I was wondering if there were other reasons for this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1071" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Leahy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#R00600"><p>The moratorium of a few years ago was the most destructive instrument ever waved at the health service.  It was unmanaged and crude in that it was financially driven.  Posts were simply eradicated to meet budgetary constraints and no regard was had to the expertise being lost to the health service.  As a result, there are pockets of deficits.  There is no universal service nationally.  Services in one area will excel in a particular way, while in others there will be deficits.  Students may be mentored well in some areas, but in others it will be to their detriment.  There is no uniform approach.  I have mentioned that there is a huge deficit in clinical-educator ratios.  The ratio should be 1:15 for clinical educators in the workplace, but that is not happening.  We are possibly at half of that ratio, with the result that students are not receiving the support they need.  I have also mentioned that staff deficits mean that staff are not freed up.  Staff involved in midwifery care are under pressure from the point of view of the fact that one has direct entry undergraduate midwives entering the workforce and looking for placements and to gain clinical skills, while there are also postgraduate midwives, general nurses who have undertake a maternity service placement and student public health nurses who undertake a maternal and child module.  As such, staff are under a great deal of pressure to provide mentoring, but the numbers are just not available to provide it.</p> <p>  In relation to the strategy, Deputy Alan Kelly asked if there was evidence of money being provided locally.  I can speak for the community and say there is no such evidence.  There has been a move where I work to provide antenatal care in the community, but that was happening pre-strategy and I cannot credit the strategy with it.  My colleague, Ms Gorman, might be able to answer the Deputy's question in greater depth.  </p> <p>  I was asked about community midwifery service differentials.  I think I answered that question.  There is no uniform approach; everything is based on the availability of resources.  </p> <p>  If there is any question I have not answered, the Deputy should feel free to say it.</p> <p>  Deputy Billy Kelleher is not here, but I will address his questions.  He mentioned the issues of recruitment, retention and career pathways, in particular.  Career pathways constitute one of the major issues in recruiting and retaining nurses.  There are no career pathways.  Senator Alice-Mary Higgins mentioned the pathway leading to management.  I agree with what she said.</p><p>There is a grade in nursing and midwifery, the advanced nurse practitioner and the advanced midwifery practitioner, and we have suggested a certain number of those be recruited but we do not have near the number we have recommended.  There is no satisfactory pathway, therefore, unless one goes into management and many practitioners do not wish to take that route.  The HSE will tell the committee later that it is recruiting but we are 350 nurses and midwives down on the end of last year, not the end of 2016 but the end of 2015.  Although there might be recruitment there is also a huge attrition rate, because staff are not staying.  The career pathway is definitely an issue and it must be developed.</p><p> On the question about when we will be able to provide a safe maternity programme, I have a simplistic answer to that.  It depends on the resources in staffing.  There is a strategy that recommends a ratio of one midwife to 29.5 births, but we are nowhere near that.  We cannot say we have a safe practice until we reach that level.  There is also a problem with staff midwives not being released for continuing professional development or education, which is vital in a profession such as nursing and midwifery where things are changing all the time.  One must keep abreast of that.  It will be when midwives are released for education and career development, when we reach the ratios required and when we have really good governance, which we are moving towards.  We welcome the directors of midwifery in the 19 units.</p><p> There was reference to women's health and home birthing.  That has been addressed, although Mary Gorman might wish to comment further.</p><p> On education programmes provided for women from the conception stage, that could improve significantly.  It must be brought into the schools.  Many women will encounter unplanned pregnancies and at that stage, without wishing to be crude about it, the horse has bolted.  There is huge room for health promotion.  In fact, health promotion suffered hugely in the last number of years because the service has become reactive rather than proactive in many areas of practice.</p><p> Senator Higgins mentioned concerns about recruitment and retention.  I believe I have responded to that.</p></speech>

Does it put pressure on nursing services when those specialist services are not available?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1074" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Leahy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#S00300"><p>I will give the example of what happened during the moratorium.  In Galway, most of the neonatal intensive care midwives were incentivised to retire.  Once they had left, the HSE realised that their expertise was lost to retirement.  I had to re-recruit them as retirees, which is not ideal.  Mary Gorman can correct me if I am wrong but I believe there are very few places on the neonatal intensive care course.  One might even have to go abroad to study for that course.  It is something that must be harvested.  We have an older maternal population and an increased incidence of early births of low birth weight babies.  An increasing number of babies are going into the neonatal intensive care unit, NICU, so that must be addressed as well.  I do not wish to over-beat up the HSE, but it was dreadful how it let that expertise go.  It was uncontrolled and unmanaged.</p> <p>  There is a huge emphasis on lactation support, in midwifery initially and then in the community from the point of view of the early discharges, the midwives who are coming out and the public health nurse.  Unfortunately, our rates have improved but they are still quite low.  We have an initiation rate in breastfeeding of approximately 48% to 50%.  We carry out a three month development assessment of all neonates and when we bring the mothers back it has dropped to approximately 38% at that stage.  We have examined this and there is a great deal of research on it, but our most recent anecdotal information from speaking to many colleagues and midwives is that it is due to the pressure on mothers to return to work.  A cultural sea change is needed in that area as well.  There are many Polish women in our communities and Polish and eastern European women will automatically breastfeed.  Their rate is approximately 98% and our indigenous population levels are being pushed up because of the eastern European women and women of other nationalities who are now living among us.</p> <p>  Deputy Sherlock mentioned governance.  I will not respond to that question as it is not in my area.  Have I dealt with everything?</p></speech>

Returning to the governance issue and the national maternity strategy, which is the basis of the discussion today, the hospital groups were designed so that there is a major hospital within every group and, within that situation, a single accountable individual.  It can be a clinical director, a master or whatever one wishes to call them.  That governance system will work well.  It is fundamentally important that they must have both clinical and executive authority with a ring-fenced budget.  It is what the maternity strategy calls for and it is what best evidence, both nationally and internationally, proves works.  Sadly, it has been lacking from CMH.</p> <p>  There is a final matter I wish to flag.  We have not mentioned it today, but I am a clinical academic and the general move towards an academic health science model would be welcome.  It will increase innovation in both clinical care and care provision.  International best practice demonstrates that.  Ireland has been slow and very much behind the curve to adopt an academic health science model.  In the South South-West Hospital Group we like to think we are ahead of the curve in delivering on that vision.  We should welcome it.</p> <p>  I will let Dr. Boylan conclude in the limited time left.</p></speech>

It is important with regard to the waiting lists.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is the right model.  The NTPF does not build long-term sustainability.  We have outlined clearly in three specific areas what is required both to address the waiting lists and prevent them from building up again, and it is not the use of the NTPF.</p></speech>

Take away the integrated model which has failed our women and children over the years.</p> <p>  There was a question about litigation and so forth.  One of the problems with litigation in this country is that there are many locum and agency staff who staff our hospitals over weekends, bank holidays and so forth, and a disproportionate number of cases arise from that unsatisfactory arrangement.  Mediation would be a way of dealing with some of the cases.  What often happens is that the plaintiff's solicitor intervenes and that breaks off all possibility of contact with the treating clinicians where things have gone wrong.  That is not helpful either for the grieving parent or couple or for the system.  It is not healthy for society to have that type of adversarial arrangement in place.</p> <p>  The NTPF is a bad idea.  That money should be invested in the health services immediately.  What happens is that somebody who is on a waiting list for years is sent to a doctor they have never seen before for a pre-planned procedure that might not be appropriate.  They get the procedure and never see the person again.  It is grossly unsatisfactory.  It is just bad clinical practice and it should be abandoned.  That money should be put into the health service.  If &euro;5 million was given to Cork, it would be a start.</p></speech>

It is beyond poor in terms of clinical practice.</p></speech>

I wish to raise a final point with Dr. Boylan.  With regard to litigation, in the past few months we have had meetings dealing with open disclosure.  What are your views on open disclosure regarding maternity litigation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-19a.1084" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Boylan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017011900002#S01300"><p>All of the international evidence is that it reduces litigation.  If something goes wrong, one puts one's hand up and says: "I am terribly sorry.  We made a mistake."  The outcome might well be disastrous and tragic and will affect that family for the rest of their lives, but at least one gets on with it.  The current system is bad.  If something goes wrong, it will be two or three years down the line when the parents might initiate a legal action.  Then it takes another three or four years.  One is facing five, ten or 15 years for a case to reach either settlement or a court.  If there was a system of open disclosure and a proper system of audit, which again comes back to governance, it would be possible to spot and fix problems early.</p><p>For example, if a particular clinician has many cases against him or her and they are all in a particular area, it may take five, ten or 15 years for the cases to come through.  With a proper system of open disclosure and audit, they can be spotted early and the problems can be addressed and fixed, which is what patients need in the future.<br/><br/>The current adversarial litigation system is not helpful to anybody.  It is incredibly stressful for the parents going through this.  Very often parents of a child with a severe disability, which they feel may be associated with the birth, sue because they do not get State support and are left on their own.  There have been tragic and very moving descriptions in newspapers of carers, including one in <i>The Irish Times</i>a few months before Christmas.  It can have a devastating effect on a couple's life looking after a child who may be in his or her 20s and who needs constant 24-hour care in terms of changing nappies, feeding, etc.<br/><br/>The State needs to step in.  Sometimes parents sue because they do not get State support.  State support should be the first thing and then if there is a problem, it should be analysed by an independent expert who will make recommendations about changing practice, which would help other parents and hopefully reduce the risk of the same thing happening.  We can never eliminate risk; it will happen.  People make mistakes; that is the nature of us as humans.  We can minimise these things, but the current system is not working in anybody's interest.</p></speech>

Coming from a unit that has that care programme, the supported care pathway has been recognised as being as safe as consultant-led care.  Research indicates that there is no statistical difference between the seven outcomes and there are fewer interventions.  It is a clear pathway that women are looking for.  It can be delivered quite easily within our current system.  It is under the governance system to which Dr. Boylan referred.  It could be rolled out relatively quickly with the proper governance structure.</p></speech>

As it was on the strategy, the feeling was that it could be easily implemented within a year, even with an alongside birth centre within the current delivery suite, but it does not appear to have rolled out across the country.  That might be an area in which we could have an easy win in the interim.</p></speech>

We heard some very good presentations earlier from the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.  I would go as far as to say they were some of the best I have heard during my time in public office.  I hope that our current witnesses were listening in or that they will at least have a copy of them.  I accept that there are variations of views on stories etc. but I took an awful lot from our earlier session and I would encourage the witnesses to reflect on the transcript of it.</p> <p>  My questions for the witnesses are based on similar questions I put earlier to the representatives of the INMO and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, because I think it is good to hear both sets of views, and a few additional questions.  While there are questions around a gynaecology strategy etc., I am a huge supporter of this strategy.  By and large, it is a very good strategy but I do not believe it will be implemented because I do not think the necessary funding is available.  I am also not convinced the will to implement it exists.  It is a ten year strategy and we are now one year into it.  What has happened, aside from the few jobs which I understand were advertised in the not too distant past?  There are four politicians here today.  We know the areas that have to be prioritised in terms of the funding streams.  Has there been any thinking outside of the box in regard to funding this strategy?  I am not convinced that it will be funded directly from the Exchequer over the next nine years.  Is there an alternative strategy in place in regard to funding?  For example, has consideration been given to how funding could be raised through other mechanisms?  I am concerned that this strategy will not be implemented within ten years.</p> <p>  I was born in the maternity hospital in Limerick, as were my children.  The service there, under the guidance of Dr. Gerry Burke, who has since moved on, was and is still the best I have ever seen but the building on the Ennis Road in Limerick is falling down.  I understand that service is to be moved on campus at University Hospital Limerick, in respect of which &euro;3 million is required for the design phase, but that this project is already behind schedule.  That is just one example.  In terms of capital funding of the strategy, from where will that funding come?  Are alternative mechanisms of funding being sought because we cannot wait for it?  What progress is being made on the strategy?  For example, is it being positively received by consultants, psychiatrists and teams with special interest in peri-natal mental health?  The evidence we heard earlier in terms of the statistics in regard to these areas was shocking.</p> <p>  We also had a discussion earlier on the services being provided to women, including ultrasound services and the requirement for a clinical decision to be made in regard to the provision of a second scan.  Worryingly, we heard from Professor Louise Kenny that this is not safe and that because second scans are only carried out at 20 22 weeks in a low percentage of cases critical issues are missed.  What is being done to address this issue and, more important, are sufficient numbers of people being trained in this area to ensure an increase in that percentage?  We also heard from Ms Mary Leahy of the INMO that a number of years ago the percentage in this regard was 70% but that it is 50% now.  In regard to governance plans, Dr. Peter Boylan made a comprehensive case for the mastership governance model, with which I agree.  Unfortunately, this does not apply across the country.  Why can it not be standardised?  Will it be standardised?  We heard earlier from Professor Louise Kenny that the budget for the maternity unit at CUH is being transferred to other clinical areas?  Why can this budget not be ring-fenced?  What is the plan in terms of governance going forward?</p> <p>  In regard to obstetricians and gynaecologists, it is proposed in the strategy to double the number of consultant obstetricians over the next ten years.  Is this possible?</p><p>Obviously, this cannot be done in one go and must be planned.  One year into the plan, I presume funding is in place for the recruitment of these staff.  I ask the witnesses to set out for each budgetary area what is being done and provide evidence of same.</p><p> On the recruitment of midwifery personnel, the committee heard clear evidence on staff to patient ratios.  The safe ratio is 29.5:1.  Are plans in place to reach this ratio and, if so, when will it be achieved?  The current figures are causing grave concerns, as we heard from previous witnesses.</p><p> On the implementation of the maternity plan, while I am aware that people are working on the plan, I have not seen its impact or any evidence to suggest a dedicated funding model is in place or a dedicated task force has been set up to oversee its implementation by the Health Service Executive and Department.  Will the witnesses alleviate my concerns in this regard because all the evidence suggests none of this is happening?  In many cases, the ratios are moving in the wrong direction.</p></speech>

We have been given a comprehensive overview of the reality as it is experienced by those working in the maternity services.  There are probably people present who could give the perspective of those who have availed of the maternity services.  The only conclusion I can draw from this is that the HSE is not in any way, shape or form serious about implementing the maternity strategy or prioritising women's health.  It gives me no pleasure to say that.</p> <p>  My first question relates to the provision of an anomaly scan at between 20 and 22 weeks of pregnancy.  When I asked the Minister about this issue in October 2016, he referred my question to the HSE which subsequently advised me that this scan is routinely offered and available to patients.  In December, it revised the reply it provided in October, which is relatively quick for the HSE, and informed me that the scan is available.  The truth is that a postcode lottery applies.  If a woman is lucky enough to live in Dublin and is attending one of the three maternity hospitals in the capital, she will be offered the scan as a matter of routine.</p> <p>  The need for this scan was brought home to me when I met a young mother from County Kerry.  While I will not mention the woman's name, I have no doubt the HSE witnesses will be familiar with her case.  She gave birth to a beautiful baby girl suffering from hypoplastic left heart syndrome.  I hope I pronounced the condition correctly.  If the mother had undergone the scan, she would have known what was coming, could have made plans and would have been able to travel to Dublin and have her family around her.  Instead, her child travelled to Dublin in an a ambulance while she stayed in hospital in Kerry.  I spoke to her and it is clear that her suffering was made immeasurably worse by the fact she was not prepared for what happened.</p> <p>  According to Professor Kenny, women are exposed to an unacceptable level of risk by not having these scans available.  The woman to whom I referred wrote to the Minister in September 2016 seeking a meeting.  She received an acknowledgement of her letter and when I followed up the matter, I was advised that the Minister was open to meeting individuals but was very busy and had asked the newly appointed director of the HSE's national women and infants health programme to meet the woman to discuss the issue.  When I contacted her this morning, she informed me she had not had any communication from the HSE.  While I understand the director's appointment is recent, it cannot be beyond the HSE to arrange a meeting with a woman who has suffered greatly and is seeking a meeting.  I expect it to do so as a matter of priority.</p> <p>  This case highlights the issue of the anomaly scan at 20 weeks.  Does the HSE have plans to roll out this scan throughout the country for all pregnant women, including those who may be watching proceedings or may read the transcript of the meeting?  Women want to know whether they will be able to access the types of services that would be considered basic in many other jurisdictions.  In this jurisdiction, this service appears to be something of a luxury and the subject of a postcode lottery, which is not right.  If the HSE has a strategy, will its representatives set out how the staff who will carry out these scans will be recruited and retained?</p> <p>  Recruitment is one thing, and we all know the HSE has a problem in this area, but it also has a problem with retention, one which is caused by working conditions, wages and poor access to educational opportunities.  As we heard from Mary Leahy of the INMO and Professor Boylan and Professor Kenny, there is a shortage of trained health care professionals in the system.  Midwives are graduating and entering private sector industries that have nothing to do with health care.</p> <p>  This brings me to the issue of clinical placement co-ordinators, CPCs.  During the moratorium, which was introduced in the health service two years earlier than everywhere else in the public service, as I know only too well, many CPCs were redeployed in the system or back on to their tools, as one might say.  This has left us with an unacceptable ratio of student midwives to clinical placement co-ordinators.  Does Mr. Woods have a plan for recruiting more clinical placement co-ordinators?  Has the HSE set a target for their recruitment?  It must be remembered that midwives are central to the implementation of the maternity strategy because one cannot have a maternity strategy without the trained personnel to implement it.  Without staff, a strategy is nothing more than words on a page, which is all the strategy is at the moment.  We discussed recruitment and retention at length with those working at the coalface before the HSE representatives arrived.  Does the HSE have a comprehensive plan in this area?  We are short of midwives and we have problems with recruitment and retention.  I would like the HSE witnesses to comment on those issues.</p> <p>  The National Treatment Purchase Fund was referred to.  Professor Kenny, who we all agree knows what she is talking about, described the NTPF as not building long-term stability.  We have experience with the NTPF and we know it will not work in the long term, even if it may have a short-term impact.  I appreciate, however, that this will not prevent the HSE from utilising the fund again.  Professor Kenny was asked about the &euro;5 million being spent on the NTPF.  She estimated that if the public health service had this money, it could open up theatres and operate on patients in public hospitals, which is where this work should be done.  Does the HSE have a strategy to wean itself off the NTPF and begin the process of investing in hospitals and working towards implementing the maternity strategy?</p></speech>

My problem with reports is that in 2003, when there were between 90 and 100 consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology, the plan was that to have 180 by 2012.  The report published last year showed that in 2014 there were 121 consultants.  My understanding is that is that there are now approximately 130.  The report states that over 100 additional consultants should be recruited.  Can we make a time frame for the implementation of that recommendation?  I know there is a difficulty in recruiting and retaining people but of the 130 some will retire in the next five years.  Apart from additional recruitment, are we forward planning for these retirements?  How many consultants will be recruited per annum during the next five years to implement that?</p><p> I understand that 13 director of midwifery positions were filled.  Are those permanent appointments?  I understood that there were to be 19 directors of midwifery appointed.</p><p> Has the bar been set too high for small units, thus making it difficult to get candidates?  Has that been reviewed?  The candidate has to have a certain level of experience and have worked in that area.  People with a lot of maternity experience may have gone into other parts of a hospital for a period and now do not fit those criteria.</p><p> Deputy Sherlock mentioned the unit in Cork.  When it opened, there were two theatres - one has never been opened and the other is open only 3.5 days a week.  In order to open it for longer, more nurses would have to be recruited and that would take time.  To open the second theatre would also require more nurses and beds.  It has been proposed that the HSE rent space in another location, rather than using the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  The consultants are willing to go off site to carry out procedures - many of them are day procedures - where there is another location available.  This might be a far cheaper way to deal with the problem.  The patient would remain under the care of her own consultant who knows her history.  Is that being considered?</p><p> In some units there is a lack of support for staff where there is an adverse outcome.  While there is a huge trauma for a family there is also a trauma for staff which we sometimes forget.  When there is an inquest or court case there is a lack of support for them.  What new procedures will be put in place to ensure that?  Where an adverse outcome arises there should be an independent review.  I know of two cases where everyone agreed that there should be independent reviews.  There was a decision about who should carry out the review but someone in administration decided that the person was not suitable - although the individual in question was very competent and had done previous reviews - and, 18 months later, that review has not been completed.  Therefore, the people who have suffered as a result of the adverse outcome suspect that something is being hidden.  When it is decided to hold an independent review, why can a timescale not be set down?  That would help greatly in reducing concerns.</p></speech>

The National Women's Council worked with the HSE around some of the consultation on this.  One of the strong desires among women was for choice and options.  That is set out to an extent in respect of the supported care options as well as assisted and specialised care.  The strategy seems to envisage side-by-side facilities, such as birthing centres, which would allow people access their preferred option but also to move smoothly to another option.  Are those birthing centres in place?  Has there been progress in the 19 centres towards having those side by side facilities?  What is the witnesses' estimated timeline for those options being available?  Other resources might be put in place to support how people make those choices and how decisions are made on people moving between them.  It is a different approach but it is not enough that it be theoretical.  It needs resources.  What is happening to ensure that is happening and working smoothly?</p> <p>  One of the key points that came from the witnesses' consultations for the strategy was that one of the key desires was for midwife-led procedures where there was a low risk.  We have heard in great detail about the problems in midwife recruitment.  The witnesses spoke - with regard to the strategy and its implementation - about some of the problems they have encountered in recruiting people at the highest level.  It is clear, however, that those problems exist throughout the system, although their impact around the country is uneven in nature.  The moratorium has been mentioned.  Has anything been learned from that because it seemed to create pockets of great deficiency in certain areas of care?  Have the gaps in care that came about been analysed?</p> <p>  Recruitment and retention of midwives has been mentioned but there is also a concern about those involved in midwifery or who want to move into the area being released to pursue professional development opportunities.  There is also a question of mentorship and progression.  Directors of midwifery are now being recruited and there are student and entry levels but there is a large gap in the middle.  There is also a problem of reward.  The wages are very low.  The only option for progression is to move into management.  What is being done to ensure a pathway for progression for practising midwives to allow them to become advanced midwifery professionals?  Will such a pathway be put in place?  If it is, that might help resolve the problem relating to mentorship.  There is a great shortage of mentors.  There need to be increments and incentives for people to climb the ladder and remain involved in midwifery.</p><p>I imagine what we would like to hear is what the timelines on recruitment are in terms of the medium-term timeline.  We do not want to simply hear that each year, depending on what comes through in the budget, the recruitment list will be drawn up.  We want to know about the five and ten year plans for recruitment, in particular in terms of replacement.  We have heard that 350 nurses and midwives are leaving the system annually and if we are looking to recruit approximately 100 nurses per year then we will not even be standing still.  I know the question has been asked so I will not elaborate further about how it will be done.</p><p> Another area of key concern is neonatal care.  I understand we do not have adequate training facilities and courses in this country and that in many cases people are going abroad to study neonatal care.  There is a question of the gap in neonatal care, which is one that suffered from the moratorium.  Could the witnesses discuss what is happening in that particular area which is important?  That relates to the wider area of postnatal care.  In the plan we discuss a lot about women's health and well-being but currently there are only three part-time perinatal psychologists in the country.  Reference is made in the plan to the Coombe hospital but I understand there is a huge shortfall in the west, despite this being an extremely high-risk time in terms of mental health.</p><p> In terms of breastfeeding within the strategy, it was mentioned that all 19 units participated in the World Health Organization's baby friendly health initiative but only nine units were designated, which meant less than half of the units met the standards for the WHO.</p><p> The main point that came across in the earlier discussion was the lack of gynaecology.  Why was that area left out of the terms of reference?  What is happening in terms of a gynaecology strategy, and what will happen in the interim, in particular in postnatal care to ensure gynaecological services are provided?  That is a crucial point which has come through.  I agree with those who said the National Treatment Purchase Fund is not an adequate response to what is a predictable and should be a manageable issue.</p><p> We have heard about the mastership model in terms of governance structures but the key thing we have consistently heard is the importance of dedicated specific resources.  It is important, for example, that we are not seeing it merged with acute adult care but that dedicated resources, dedicated theatre access and dedicated budgets are provided, including the capacity to strategise and think for the long term.  We would like to see what models are being considered in terms of leadership and dedicated, separate resources.  One of the key things in that regard is sonography and scanning.  That is something on which we really need to see action this year.  It is noticeable that where there is a different governance structure such as the mastership structure it has been prioritised.  I would appreciate the thoughts of witnesses on the following: if we do intensify and improve governance structures, have clearer structures and resources, do they believe it would assist in dealing with the gaps and problems that have been experienced with recruitment?</p><p> This is a ten-year strategy.  Care, consent and choice were crucial points in the strategy.  Over the course of the ten-year strategy, however, we are likely to see legislative change on areas such as the eight amendment.  I know that is key, and that it has been highlighted by groups such as AIMS Ireland, which has worked on and welcomed the strategy, while accepting there are gaps in terms of choice and consent.  Do the witnesses consider the strategy is capable of responding to such changes as may arise because if there is legislative change that would require different resourcing and measures which means it will have to be flexible in that regard?</p></speech>

I do not wish to repeat anything that has been said already.  Following on from Deputy Louise O'Reilly's point about the scanning rate in Cork University Hospital and the incorrect data she received originally.  To my mind that signifies something a lot more serious in that if one does not know what the rate of scanning is, that shows it is not high on the HSE's list of priorities.  As was made very clear to us earlier by Professor Kenny, the knock-on effect of increasing sonography services has an effect on pre-natal care and neonatal care because the more one finds the more one has to fix.  I find it exceptionally concerning that those responsible were not sure what was going on and therefore they could not say that it was on their radar if the facts and figures were not known and they had not anticipated what might be the knock-on effects of increasing the services.  Perhaps I am wrong.</p> <p>  I do not wish to misquote Professor Kenny but I was shocked to hear that babies will die due to a lack of sonography in Ireland.  I wrote it down as she said it so I think I am correct about what she said.  In a civilised society and what is essentially a first world country it is difficult to believe that the lack of non-invasive procedures could have an impact on the live birth rate.  How does she feel about that as an employee of the HSE?  Does she think the women of this country have been failed?</p> <p>  It was stated that there was a failure of the governance structure at Cork University Hospital.  Does Professor Kenny accept that?  The year 2006 was mentioned.  We cannot blame history for the problem as the structure is recent.  The obstetrics and gynaecological services did not have a ring-fenced budget and, therefore, as we heard in great detail, the money was relocated to different areas.  Does Professor Kenny accept that the governance structure in Cork University Hospital is a failure and that the mastership model is the way forward?</p> <p>  When it comes to the strategy itself, could the witnesses explain why nothing has been done for almost a year and could they outline the HSE's key priorities when it comes to the strategy?  What I am trying to get at is whether they align with the clinicians and midwives we spoke to earlier on?  With regard to the 13 of the 19 directors of midwifery who have been appointed, while that is a good thing I am a little concerned about a little bit being done in several places but nothing being done completely right.  I am more of the opinion that one would fix A and then move on to B as opposed to doing a little bit here and there as I feel the value is lost.  Perhaps I am wrong.  Is that just the way it has ended up or is that what the HSE set out to do?</p> <p>  I cannot remember which of my colleagues referred to the appointment of a person to lead the national women and infants health programme.  Is it the case that a lead has been appointed?  If that has happened, have there been discussions on how the strategy will be implemented?  We constantly hear about the success of the cancer strategy under Professor Keane and the late Professor Donal Hollywood.  Is the HSE going about the maternity strategy in the same way or is it reinventing the wheel?</p> <p>  Other speakers have raised the issue, but I do not understand why the gynaecological strategy was omitted from the terms of reference.  Even though we cannot turn back time it is really important that the committee is enlightened as to how that came about so perhaps if something arose in the future we might be able to mitigate against such omissions.</p></speech>

It is following a model that is analogous to the national cancer control programme, NCCP, approach, which I will speak more about in due course.  We are in the process of appointing an obstetric clinical lead and we are also recruiting a director of midwifery.  They will be the three key posts.  That is rather similar to the kind of collection of skills one would have had at the core of the delivery of the cancer programme.</p> <p>  I will address some of the common themes and then I will go back through the individual points.  Gynaecology came up a couple of times and perhaps I should deal with that.  From our perspective it seems a natural fit to have the gynaecology service within the deliberations of the overall strategy, so it is our intention to do that.</p><p>We see it as part of the overall dialogue with women in the service.  The plan is to progress is on the same basis as the overall strategy.</p></speech>

I will address them by making reference to the actions already taken and intended actions, both in respect of recruitment, training, support and retention strategies.  Prior to the creation of the office, the HSE had undertaken the Birthrate Plus study which was a review of the number of midwives in each of the 19 facilities across the country.  It has invested in 100 midwives to deal with identified deficiencies by site.  That was done in the past 12 months and if it is helpful, we can provide lists indicating where they were allocated.  It was done with a view to having the total numbers of midwives required for the safe delivery of clinical services.  The latest information I have is that 88 of the 100 midwives are in place.</p> <p>  There was a wider point about recruitment and the approach of the HSE to dealing with the impact of the moratorium, retirements and replacements.  There is no moratorium or set rules operating within the HSE.  I take the point about the effect of the moratorium and removing posts during the time of austerity which had an unbalancing effect within the overall system.  The Birthrate Plus midwife numbers reviews sought to address it.  A midwife who leaves service can now be replaced within the current complement.</p></speech>

It will bring us to a ratio of 29.5.  Staff can be recruited as there is replacement capacity within the system which was not available at the time of the moratorium.  </p> <p>  A number of questions were put about directors of midwifery.  Thirteen of the 19 are in place.  Senator Colm Burke asked whether there was an issue with the particular requirements to be a director of midwifery.  The answer is "Yes".  We have reviewed them and slightly amended them, while staying faithful to the overall needs.  We are trying to recognise experience, as well as qualifications.  We are working with our partners to address the matter in the units where they have been a difficulty.  They are key leadership posts across the 19 units.  It was our deliberate intention to have the posts filled within a close timeframe because they are key building blocks in the maternity networks.  I will discuss these under the governance heading which was referred to by a number of members.</p></speech>

There is no evidence that we are losing them as quickly as we were.  We can provide a report by site.  In his former role Mr. McGrane exercised the requirement in Wexford and Kilkenny to bring staff numbers up to minimum levels.  Each site is required to operate within a ratio of 1:29.  There is no impediment in replacing somebody when they leave.  I am not sure what reference point was used by the INMO for the gap, whether there is a vacancy factor or whether it relates to the ratio of 1:29, but we are happy to share the detail with members.  The intent is to recruit.  The gap is 200.  We received funding in 2016 to recuit 100, of whom 88 have now been recruited.  A further 100 are to be recruited and the expectation is we will move to do this.  The question of whether we are just running to stand still is fair, but it is a challenge we are meeting.</p></speech>

We are putting an office in place specifically for the purpose of implementing a plan that has been set out nationally that we have both a duty to implement and which we are mindful to see fully implemented.  Issues will arise with that, and I will come back to some of the issues referred to by the Deputy, particularly in the capital area that may be worth speaking about.  From our point of view, set out nationally there is already an indicative funding level on an annual basis in revenue, not capital, funding terms for the development of this programme.  I believe the figure is-----</p></speech>

That intention is a multi-annual expression and it is subject to the Estimates process annually through which the HSE is funded.</p> <p>  On the revenue side, there is a funding intention behind this plan that recognises there is a real cost.  The other staff category referred to in terms of the queries was numbers of obstetricians.  The need to recruit obstetricians was referenced by previous presenters.  The clinical programme in obstetrics within the HSE has identified the need to, in effect, approximately double the number of obstetricians.  Our obstetric colleagues advise us that will not happen all at one time; it is a phased recruitment process.  It has commenced with some approvals for obstetric appointments in both 2015 and 2016.  The numbers are relatively low.  From memory there were about six posts nationally in each of those years.  Clearly, the requirement is much higher than that but it is a start.</p> <p>  On the further question of capital funding, the Deputy will be aware of a number of projects.  There was a reference to the need to move Limerick maternity hospital onto a single site in Dooradoyle and the National Maternity Hospital moving onto the site at St. Vincent's Hospital.  In terms of maintaining existing facilities and either improving or developing new facilities, both those projects, and others in the maternity service, and a question was raised about adjacent facilities, are all subject to the capital plan of the HSE, which is currently in a mid-term review as part of the national mid-term review of the capital programme.  In terms of what is in the capital plan of the HSE currently, there is provision relating to the movement of Holles Street hospital to the site at St. Vincent's Hospital.  I will not say at what level as it is subject to tender, but there will be a provision for that.</p></speech>

I will have to leave soon but on the capital plan, it is a huge budget.  What Mr. Woods referred to earlier will be a huge outlay, whatever it will be.  I was chancing my arm on that but it will be huge.  I am not convinced.  We are from the mid-west and we are thinking about Limerick.  A total of &euro;3 million is required just for the design.  I have not seen sight nor sound of it.  If they are struggling with providing &euro;3 million, where will they get the volume of funding required in the next eight and a half years to finish it, with the openings done and so on?</p></speech>

His suggestion, which I believe he made at the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, to examine other streams of funding becomes relevant here.  While, traditionally, the HSE has been funded for capital purposes through a capital allocation in the Vote, it is open to examining other delivery models, if we can move in that direction, which would, in effect, have the impact of moving from capital funding to a revenue stream over the lifetime of an asset.  We are open to that.  We would have to explore it in detail.  We have done that in some----</p></speech>

We will have to step outside the box, make some recommendations as a committee and examine alternative funding mechanisms to deliver the scale of the budget required, whether through a national bond or some other mechanism, because we cannot wait any longer.  This is a very good strategy, which has received broad political support, but we must make sure we can deliver it.  On the current side, it will be difficult to deliver but, on the capital side, it will be virtually impossible.  I believe the four people sitting across from me believe that also.  This is an issue we should come back to and on which this committee should make a recommendation.</p></speech>

In real terms it is a case of developing services in a piecemeal way because not enough moneys have been put into capital funding.  To take the example of the three maternity units in Dublin, they are all more than 150 years old and we are now talking about dealing with those over a short timeframe.  It is not only a matter of maternity services when we talk about capital budgets; it is the entire area across the HSE.  The director general referred to a figure of &euro;9 billion.  I would probably agree with him.  It has not been an issue for the past five years but over a period of 25 years.</p></speech>

The service plan and the capital programme for the HSE, which are the amounts determined by the Oireachtas, are expended.  We are in dialogue with colleagues in the Department of Health and in other Departments relating to future needs, which would include maternity services but also the wider agenda to which the Senator referred.  In the planning of the implementation of this strategy there is a strong capital element that has to become visible.  There is a significant challenge with that, and we understand that.  Mr. McGrane and his colleagues will be working with our finance units around the country, and centrally, on that.</p><p>The idea will have to come on the table in terms of looking at that.  It has already because if one looks at the funding of primary care centres, it is done through a third-party support with private capital partners.  Therefore, we will have to examine creative ways of ensuring that we get access to the right capital resource as quickly as we can to proceed with the policy.  There is no question about that.  Some resources are already available, which are helpful.  The moving of Holles Street is a significant one.  There are already planning deliberations under way around other parts of the Rotunda going to Connolly, which is under discussion right now and in phase 2 of planning.  These projects will need to continue through to a point of funding and there will be a big challenge with that.  The Exchequer will have to examine that when the plan is complete, looking at what the feasible timings are and the implications.  The Senator is right to say that it is a wider reality for the HSE's capital programme.</p></speech>

Mr. Woods was mentioning the side-by-side services and it seems that they are now going through capital funding, even though they are described in some cases as new units.  However, the low-risk birthing centres are potentially relatively low-cost and I am concerned that they may well fall by the wayside if we are talking about these major projects that are under way.  I wonder what Mr. Woods' vision is on that.  What is the timeline for the 19 centres we are talking about?  Does Mr. Woods see all of them being included and developed with side-by-side facilities coming in in the next three years?  Where does that fit in?  When one has grand-scale projects a core change happens.  One of the core demands was for these parallel services and options.  I would like to hear a lot more about where they are coming from and fitting in, rather than just being on an application list for capital funding.</p> <p>  This is a question on funding from our colleague, Deputy O'Connell, who had to leave but she hopes to come back later.  The question concerns the sum of &euro;52 million and the front-loading of &euro;12 million a year over the next three years.  From what we are hearing it does not seem to be adequate.  Mr. Woods is talking about improving a service, yet he is also talking about a great deficit.  Does Mr. McGrane think the funding is adequate?  Let us signal early on if we feel it may not be adequate so that we can identify it.  Perhaps the witnesses could deal with those points before we move on from funding and the question of capital.</p></speech>

The strategy refers to the fact that for some of the existing units, where there are small centres with a relatively low number of births, some of the existing facilities can be modified to facilitate that.  In larger units it is about looking creatively at what physical space is there.  Obviously we do not have enough people in the office yet to have a robust discussion about it, which we need to do, but we plan to look at taking one or two sites - maybe one of the larger ones and one of the smaller ones - and putting something in place on a trial basis to see what works best.</p> <p>  Putting the three care pathways in place is of critical importance.  We need to ensure that the model for those is well described, and that takes a little bit of time, but there is no reason we cannot use the existing facilities in a more creative way.  As the Senator has seen, the alongside birthing centres are about taking the complexity away and normalising the birth, which is central to the approach.</p> <p>  On the funding issue we have to develop an implementation plan which we have committed to do by mid-year.  At that stage we would be better able to answer the question about funding.  Clearly there is always a big funding component to it.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell asked about the priorities for the programme.  We see them as two-fold at this stage, although that is not to eliminate anything else.  One is the managed clinical networks and the second component, which is related to it, is the quality and patient safety agenda.  There are costs associated with implementing both of those and we would see that as being the No. 1 priority for us.  If we can do that, then all the other things that are so important in the strategy can flow from it.  </p> <p>  We definitely intend to make progress on the alongside birthing centres this year, but will probably do it in a phased way so we can make sure the model works.  It will be different depending on the nature of a tertiary or secondary centre.</p></speech>

From the Cork experience we have seen that being part of a hospital group, and not having autonomous structures in place, is leading to a less than optimal service.  Perhaps Mr. Woods could comment on that.</p></speech>

The intention in the strategy, which has just commenced in the south-south west group, is to put in place networks with clinical leadership that are specifically focused on services for women and infants, in accordance with the strategy.  The first appointment in that area has been in the south-south west region where an obstetrician has been appointed to such a role.  It is intended that there will be similar networks in the other six adult services and that work is currently under way.</p> <p>  I will come to the mastership piece in a moment.  The governance within the HSE moving forward, based on the strategy, is that there are groups and specific networks within groups.  There is also a national office, which Mr. McGrane is leading, that is doing both planning and resourcing, as well as evaluation and standard setting, to support those four networks.</p> <p>  There was a further point concerning the role of hospitals and the place of obstetrics and gynaecology services within hospitals.  There is nothing in the strategy which intends to put in place a different governance arrangement for those services outside that which is group and hospital-based.  Strong leadership is being invested within those.  It is akin to taking the clinical leadership dimensions of the mastership role and embedding that in a network leadership role within the groups.</p> <p>  The mastership structure has a history dating back as far as 1720 in Dublin and has served both the city and the country well.  I do not intend any critique of the mastership system, but the governance arrangement that is in place here is about having strong clinical and managerial leadership.  On the point about ring-fencing and identifying resources, I agree entirely that the programme needs to be able to ring-fence the resource that is within the service at the widest level, support investment from there and avoid any risk of resource seepage into other services.  That issue works across a number of specialties.  All specialties want to have a ring-fenced resource.  </p> <p>  The HSE has already invested in the identification of resource, and activity associated with resource, under the activity-based funding process.  It helps us to identify what the resource is in each of those sites and the associated activity in each of those sites that is subject to that dialogue.  We would see a leadership model where one has a group, a clinical network within a group, and that network is supporting all the sites.  All, bar one group, have multiple sites.</p></speech>

Mr. Woods talks about the appointment of strong clinical leadership.  Where all the clinicians in a particular facility agree there should be an independent review, however, someone in administration - who has neither hand, act nor part in the facility - can overrule their decision and 18 months later no review report has been completed.  If that is the structure Mr. Woods is talking about, it is not going to work.</p></speech>

A decision was taken that a clinical review would be carried out by an independent person outside the particular facility.  All the clinicians agreed on who should be appointed.  They were overruled, however, by someone in administration who had no physical contact with the unit, but who just drew a line across the person who was appointed.  Some 18 months later, there is still no review completed.</p></speech>

Such a structure works in the major maternity hospitals in Dublin.  Why would that not be adopted rather than be set aside?</p></speech>

We did so with the very intention of providing direct clinical leadership and support to all of the hospitals within the group.</p> <p>  In terms of the individual hospital, when the reports were in the media some days ago I looked at what happened the head count for the services in CUH over the past number of years and discovered that the figures have grown.  Since 2013 there has been an increase of 40 in the number of midwives and about an increase of 14 in the number of medical staff.  There were reports that showed reductions in finances.  The overall position showed me a growth in resource based on the human factor, which is the main cost in the system.</p> <p>  In terms of the question of governance, the strategy clearly shows that there will be networks.  We have taken a first step in Cork to support the south-south west network by appointing a lead for that.  It is not called a master.  The post is a clinical lead for obstetrics and gynaecology services in that group.  </p></speech>

A concern has been expressed about accountability in the networks.  Is there an accountability structure?  Is somebody responsible for the structure?  It is important to know this information both in terms of recruitment and giving confidence to people down the line.  How does the delegation see this matter impact on accountability?  Is there a danger in the model outlined?  Can responsive clinical expertise be called on rather than the strategic leadership, response to trends and setting of a vision that we have seen?</p> <p>  It is clear to people that the structure did not need to be called a master model.  People have called for a structure that would operate in parallel with the strategic structure that has been outlined.  I mean a three pronged approach of a captain or leader of some form, a director of midwifery and an administrative need that exists at the core of each of the 19 units within the section.  How does the delegation see the three strands reflected?  Where is the accountability?  Where is the input for a strategic vision?  Is there a danger of the vision becoming so diffused in the network structure that it is lost or mixed up in something like acute adult services?  While there may be a network, in terms of a key hospital, which is part of that network, a whole separate set of decisions are being made and the network does not have a strong grip on the service.  I had another question but that is all for now.   </p></speech>

It is through that connection that we would look for the strategy to be implemented.  The network sits at a group level and reaches into each of the sites.  Reference was made earlier to the cancer control programme.  Part of this model is analogous to the cancer control programme.  One has a central office that is influential in the hospital environment in terms of decisions about resources and the direction of travel in terms of clinical service provision and safe standards of care.  The office will play a key role nationally and will have a direct link with the network.  It will also work with the groups within which each network sits.</p> <p>  I shall come back to the Senator's question on clinical placement co-ordinators, CPCs.  A director of midwifery is being recruited into each unit and they will work as part of the network.  We see the recruitment as part of the network in terms of delivery.  The wider points made by the Senator about training, support and placement are relevant to the role.  Perhaps my colleague, Mr. McGrane, wishes to comment. </p></speech>

It had cancer networks and protected at network level both the existing resource and all new development money.   The latter was held by the cancer control programme and then allocated to resources.</p> <p>  The model that we seek to establish at group level is equivalent to a clinical directorate in a hospital.  Most hospitals have clinical directorate models.  Ms Fitzgerald, from her days working in St. James's Hospital, and myself from my days working in St. Vincent's Hospital, have experienced how the model operates.  One has a dedicated individual who is the clinical director and he or she is accountable for everything that happens within that service.  He or she is supported exactly as has been said usually in a hospital context by an assistant director of nursing and a business manager.  We are replicating this process at group level.  One will have a named clinician who becomes the clinical director or clinical lead; I am not sure if we have clear titles yet.  One would also have a director of midwifery, somebody at administrative level who can provide business intelligence and support and, also, a quality and patient safety person because that is central to how this model works.  All of that will ensure there is clear governance and accountability.  It does not mean that there will not be robust discussions on whether obstetrics and gynaecology get investment over general surgery, cancer services or anything else.  Robust discussion will still happen but the voice of the obstetrics and gynaecology will be clearly heard, well identified and supported at national level by the programme office and, indeed, by the political commitment that has been given in the Department and by the Minister.  We see this model as taking something that works well in the acute hospital sector at the moment.  I appreciate that the strategy goes much beyond the acute hospital.  This model will allow us to put a governance structure in place at group level that supports the direction of travel for the acute hospitals system.  </p></speech>

The processes in place allow us, in terms of financial and services analysis, to identify current activity and the associated resources.  Part of the role of the office will be to become aware of that and to protect that within the national network.  It will consider the relative resourcing, which is what the national cancer control programme or NCCP does.  Normally, it would be known through service provision.</p> <p>  I should have touched on the references to the NTPF and, maybe more fundamentally, they dealt with providing adequate volumes of service to meet the service need.  Clearly, we understand the point that says to build sufficient services to deliver over time in a structured way.  That is where we want to be.  The NTPF can help in the short-term to deliver services if there is a difficulty in doing so within the public space.  The NTPF is not the HSE and I ask members to be aware that I do not speak for the NTPF.  </p> <p>  Reference has been made to the possible use of other facilities.  During the past two years, specifically last year, we have considered optimising investment within the HSE in whatever facilities are available to undertake or work off the waiting lists and put that resource into public hospitals.  My brief would be to optimise that because one has the continuity of care, which was the point that was made, and it also tends to be good value and a good use of public funds.</p></speech>

The consultants have suggested that they could get space in another facility, and get the beds, and backup support staff thus taking many people off the list in a faster time.  Let us remember that it will take time to recruit people.  A six-bed day unit has been sought.</p><p>They will also need to have access to a theatre to deal with people who are using the six-bed day care unit.  That will take some time.  It might take anything up to six months.  They are saying that in the meantime, they are prepared to move to other facilities outside Cork University Hospital where there is space available to carry out the procedures and get people off the list.  There are over 4,000 people on the waiting list at present.  Dr. John Coulter, who is one of the consultants, is concerned because it is not known how many of the 4,000 people on the waiting list might have early-stage cancer.  That is why there is so much concern about the delays in seeing people and why this issue needs to be prioritised.</p></speech>

Ms Fitzgerald has told me that we have adopted this approach in the orthopaedic sector since mid-2016.  Orthopaedic services have been provided in one of the Dublin hospitals where such an opportunity arose.  We would be very open to the south-south west group bringing such proposals to us.  I understand such a proposal is being prepared and we will get to look at it.  I expect that there will be a strong clinical input into that and that it will cover Kerry, Clonmel and Waterford.  I am looking for the group to give us a group response to what it can do.  We would be well disposed to ideas that make the best use of the resources we currently have and provide continuity of care and a safe service, subject to contractual conditions we may have to work our way through.  The only remaining question would relate to what resources are available to do what this year.</p></speech>

Is it possible that similar, parallel resources will be allocated to increase capacity?  There is a concern that when money is put into the NTPF, we are told that funding has been allocated to deal with a health crisis or problem and the issue is taken off the agenda.  I suggest that when allocations are made to the NTPF, matching funding should also come through in support of core resources.</p> <p>  I would also like to ask Mr. Woods about the gynaecological strategy.  He does not have to answer this question now.  I know our time is short.  He will be sending a response to the committee about another issue at a later stage.  Could he also send us a timeline in this regard?  It would be good to get written information.</p></speech>

We recognise that there is a need for ongoing investment in the provision of an increased level of service to deliver on the demands that exist at the moment and the demands that may exist as demographics change.  I am sure the Oireachtas committee that is looking at this matter will make helpful observations.  It has certainly received some strong submissions.  We understand and accept that permanent investment is needed.  I think NTPF-type funding can be of strong support in providing additional capacity in the short term.  As members have mentioned, significant portions of our total waiting lists are day work.  Such work can account for up to 60% of waiting lists, depending on the specialty in question.  That can also lend itself to proposals like those we were discussing a few moments ago, or indeed to NTPF-type proposals.  I ask members to bear in mind that the NTPF can fund services within the HSE.  Our challenges tend to relate to capacity and the compensatory effects of dealing with admissions through emergency departments and other areas.  We have identified a need for a medium-term approach.  I have not responded to a couple of issues that were raised.</p></speech>

I would like to provide clarity in response to the questions that were asked.  Scans are available to all patients at 20 to 22 weeks at six sites: Holles Street, the Coombe, the Rotunda, University Hospital Galway, Cork University Hospital and - with a slight variation - University Hospital Limerick.  In the latter case, a clinical decision is required before a second scan is carried out.  I think that is the point Deputy Kelly was making.</p></speech>

As part of our overall strategy, we will have to look at the need to invest in this and all other areas of the service.  I would expect that the plan will set out our journey from here with regard to the requirement to invest in equipment and personnel.  Deputy O'Connell referred to the need to manage the implications of undertaking this work when she said that clinical and diagnostic supports will be required.  I expect that the plan to be drawn up by Mr. McGrane and his colleague will seek to address that.  We understand that it is a deficiency.  It is something we will have to address in the plan.</p></speech>

It seems that some people are unable to routine scans and screening scans as a matter of course.  One would imagine that such scans are an essential part of obstetric care.  How could the service be so deficient?</p></speech>

As we heard earlier, there is a need to provide training and to ensure the workforce plan that is in effect is a subset of the overall plan here.  Deputy O'Reilly spoke strongly on the need to reflect on how we can attract and retain appropriate personnel.  That will have to be set out in a strategy.  We are doing wider work on workforce planning within the HSE.  We are engaging with our colleagues in the INMO in that regard.  As far as we are concerned, the key deficiencies relate to access to appropriate clinical and diagnostic personnel within the system and, to a lesser extent, equipping.  I do not think equipping is a huge issue in this area.</p></speech>

The Chairman will probably be aware that the primary care service has invested in a range of externally provided ultrasound services along the west coast from Letterkenny to Tralee.  This is giving GPs direct access to ultrasound and is supporting hospitals that are already struggling to deliver in terms of total volume demand.  We see the provision of more ultrasound as a critical component of our wider interaction with the primary care service and as part of this strategy.  I want to make sure I pick up on the thematic point that was made about scans and the NTPF.  I am not sure whether I missed anything specific.  I can look back through my notes if that is helpful.</p></speech>

I am sure the Chairman is aware that it is clearly identified in the Health at a Glance data and in the submissions that were made to the Committee on the Future of Healthcare that the number of doctors in this jurisdiction, by comparison with other jurisdictions, is very low.  The data for obstetrics are visible and available as part of our own background work and the work of the programme on obstetrics.  We can see the data clearly.  We are aware that there is a need to increase the number of obstetricians, as we heard again earlier.  The challenge for us in that regard is to ensure the resources are there to provide for an increase.  There is a timescale issue as well.  I am sure the committee is aware that the timescale for the recruitment of a consultant is approximately 12 months.  It is important that we start as soon as we can after the funding is made available to us.  Having spoken to clinical colleagues in obstetrics, I am aware that we will need a phased programme of recruitment over a number of years to build those numbers up.  There is no doubt that it is one of the key tenets of the strategy.</p></speech>

It is vital for us to overcome any difficulties that exist in that regard as part of the work on workforce planning and retention.  Deputy O'Reilly made the point that there is a need for people to enjoy good training and development opportunities.  This is one of the retention strategies we can adopt.</p><p>With regard to the career path discussion, public sector pay levels are a matter for the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The idea that there would be a career path that provides an attractive career journey at increasingly senior levels of care provision and management is something that the workforce plan within the overall strategy would help.</p></speech>

There are a couple of reasons.  One concerns clinical leadership, with part of that ensuring that people are constantly supported around training and development.  The other concerns clout and being able to sit shoulder to shoulder in the management team with the director of nursing, making sure the voice of midwifery is heard.  HIQA identified that as one of the strengths of the actions taken in the aftermath of the Portlaoise issue.  The intention would be to ensure the voices of nursing and midwifery are equally represented at the management table.  That would address some of the concerns articulated earlier.</p> <p>  There is a separation of midwifery.  We had much discussion with the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, in developing the post, and the role is to ensure we recognise a separate professional pathway.  It is early days but those steps are very important in having a voice and somebody with the expertise to drive out the points that were raised around professional development.</p></speech>

Perhaps I could follow up on that.  It was the question of neonatal nursing and that there may be inadequate training in that.  Parallel with that is postnatal care.  I know there is a question of perinatal psychological resources, which are crucial within the picture.</p></speech>

There is also a requirement in the bereavement area and members have touched on that in some of the mental health observations.  We understand that.  There is a very significant piece of work to be done as a subset of this strategy that needs to include the entire workforce requirement and be clear about it.  We have reasonable clarity in terms of the requirement relating to midwifery and consultants but we must also develop plans for other areas of service.  We understand that.</p></speech>

That means that in the third and fourth years of nursing training, we are losing 25% of potential graduates.  Not only are we failing to recruit and retain but we are failing to educate those who have entered but found the working conditions far too onerous.  How could this be approached?</p></speech>

To change tack slightly, the provision of a strategy and clear direction for the service at a national, group and hospital level will assist people in understanding precisely where the service is heading and a clearer view of the future.  The investment in physical infrastructure will also be important and the nature of some of our physical infrastructure is challenging.  That investment will also be important.</p> <p>  With regard to retention at the training level, we will need very direct interactions within our overall workforce approach as part of our obstetric workforce plan to seek to address issues of loss of students.  There was also reference to loss of qualified midwives to the commercial sector or other environments.  We are fully aware we have a job to do in that regard.  We are looking to the workforce plan to deliver that.</p></speech>
