It is very much appreciated.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 4 May 2017.  Are they agreed to?  We will come to correspondence shortly.  I propose to hold onto the dossier I received from Mr. Barrett until the end.  We will discuss anything related to last week's meeting when we come to it.</p></speech>

We asked specifically that the committee write to the Department of Education and Skills on the issue of rent.  I would like my point to be recorded at this stage.  I might come back to it.</p></speech>

When we hold hearings and listen to witnesses on key issues, there is some level of reporting back.  There was a discussion of issues related to third and fourth level institutions and a lot of documentation and correspondence was sought from a number of institutes and universities.  Some of it has come in but most of it has not.  I propose that we have some structure for it.  We agreed that we would meet to examine all of the documentation received.  Can it be done in a structured way to identify the key, headline issues?  It is an issue on which the committee should report.  There is a lot of work yet to be done and we will need to receive all of the correspondence sought.  I am not sure if the Chairman or the secretariat has the given the matter any thought.</p></speech>

The other half is to follow through with information, recommendations and conclusions.  I am advised by the secretariat that we will deal with the issues related to education on 25 May.  I hope that by that date we will have assembled all of the information we require from the six third level institutions, the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority.  We can review where to take the matters from there.  Some structure will be proposed in advance.</p></speech>

The first items are Nos. 463A and 472A, briefing documents and an opening statement from the Department of Justice and Equality.  Is it agreed that they be noted and published?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  Category B is correspondence received from Accounting Officers as a follow-through on previous meetings.  No. 495B is correspondence, dated 3 May 2017, from the director of finance at the University of Limerick.  It is noted and will be published.  We will include it in our work programme for our meeting on 25 May.  I welcome the news that the Department of Education and Skills is to launch an independent inquiry into a series of allegations of misconduct at the University of Limerick.</p></speech>

At the hearing in question we referred to the need for a fresh inquiry.  I wonder if the Department proposes to provide us with the terms of reference.  It would be appropriate to do so, all things considered.  The Department might also allow us the facility to offer some reflections on the terms of reference.  The issue has been ongoing for some time and the inquiry will only be valuable if it is properly cast, with robust terms of reference.  The Department could furnish us with the terms of reference and take feedback from us on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#C00100"><p>We will ask for the draft terms of reference to be sent to us and we may have an input into them.  I do not know timescale but normally they take a little time and I would be surprised if they were completed at this stage.</p> <p>  Nos. 460B (i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 3 May 2017 from Dr. James Browne, president of National University of Ireland Galway, providing following up issues.  We said that we would deal with that again on 25 May.  It was agreed last week to review all the correspondence received from the third level institutions together.  As we are meeting Bord na gCon again next week, I suggest that we agree 25 May to examine the third level institution documentation.</p> <p>  No. 461B is correspondence dated 3 May 2017 from the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, in reply to a letter from the committee following the appearance of the president of Waterford Institute of Technology before the committee.   Is it agreed to note and publish?  Agreed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#C00300"><p>Nos. 462B (i) to (v) is correspondence dated 3 May 2017 from Dr. Graham Love, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority providing follow-up information.  We will deal with that on 25 May but we will note and publish all that in the meantime.</p> <p>  No. 464B is correspondence dated 8 May 2017 from Bord na gCon in respect to incidents outside this committee room in which there were three situations in which witnesses were intimidated or abused by visitors in the Gallery, despite the fact that Deputy Kelly, who was in the Chair, issued a warning to the visitors.  The clerk to the committee also had to ask visitors he saw surrounding a witness at the end of the meeting outside the committee room to desist.  Members who request passes for visitors are responsible for their conduct.  That is a long-established practice.  I propose to bring this matter to the attention of the Captain of the Guard to make him aware of the incidents.   While I will not suggest that we close the Visitors Gallery, we have to be careful and fair to witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#C00400"><p>There was also a great deal of noise and many comments coming from people in the Visitors Gallery.  I appreciate passions were high and there are many strong opinions but that can disrupt our work.  It can be seen as disrespectful to witnesses, irrespective of the questions put.  We put the questions fairly and robustly.  It was difficult from that perspective and it is something we need to be conscious of.</p></speech>

The note is quite a comprehensive response to issues on the cost of administration in respect of fixed charge notices.  There are ongoing attempts to address the issues, which will be assisted by the commencement of Part 3 of the 2010 Act on 1 June.  Is it agreed to note and publish, and forward a copy to Clare County Council?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 468B(i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 8 May from Mr. John Barrett.  I will hold this over until the end of this business.</p> <p>  Nos. 474B(i) to (vi) is correspondence dated 9 May from Ms Mary Higgins, chief executive officer of Caranua providing follow-up information to our meeting on 13 April.  It includes a note on the Towards Healing organisation, a breakdown of the budget for travel and subsistence, a note on agency staff employed, a list of the internal and external audit reports and costs associated with each, a note on the rent to be paid for the forthcoming move of premises, a note on liaison officers and a note on the board meeting held in April 2016 at which the financial position of the organisation was discussed.  There is considerable information in this.  I propose we note and publish it for the moment but we will come back to it next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#C00600"><p>I do not see the list of liaison officers.  I may have missed it but could that be checked?  There is reference to an appendix to the list.  More important, I need the Chair's assistance regarding the note on rent.  Based on parliamentary questions, etc., tabled by myself and other Members, the Department of Education and Skills and the OPW do not seem to know what is happening.  Caranua says it has to move but I do not know why.  I would like to highlight this because, presumably, the committee has made its views known to the organisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#C00700"><p>We have written to the Department of Education and Skills and we are waiting for a reply.</p></speech>

I acknowledge there are serious issues but this is also a serious issue.  When will we come back to it?  I am concerned that this agreement will be signed.  I have read the D&aacute;il reply but I cannot make head nor tail of the cause for this move.  The Department has to give permission, as far as I understand it, under section 7(7) of the legislation before Caranua enters into any contract.  I raised this in the D&aacute;il yesterday and the Minister said he did not know what the position was and that he would get back to me.  The CEO of Caranua says in this correspondence that from day one, it was made known to them that they would be obliged to leave the premises.  I do not know by whom.  We cannot leave the Caranua accounts without coming back to this.  We should send the message again that no rent agreement should be signed.  It is not a good use of money and there are many buildings that could be used.</p></speech>

We will communicate again within 24 hours and we will insist that a full and complete reply be before the committee before next Thursday and that Caranua and the Department should not proceed with any contractual arrangements in the meantime.</p></speech>

The Minister needs to clarify whether he has given permission for this.  We also need clarification from the OPW as to why Caranua has to move since the organisation is based in one of its buildings.  There should be three letters.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Deputy might assist the secretariat by forwarding the replies to the parliamentary questions in order that the staff can know the reference point.</p></speech>

This is correspondence received from the chairman of NAMA regarding to the committee&rsquo;s report on Project Eagle.It is a short letter and I will read it to members.  We will not have a detailed discussion on it but we have to make some response.  I will read it and I will ask at the conclusion of the meeting that we will note and publish it and forward it to the commission, in regard to which the Government has agreed terms of reference during the week, together with a statement from the committee in response, which will issue later.  The letter is dated 19 April and addressed to me.  It reads:</p><blockquote>Dear Chairman<br /><br />Thank you for forwarding copies of the Committee's report of its examination of the sale of Project Eagle.  Whilst there are a number of opinions in the report with which we strongly disagree, I do not wish to rehearse again the various arguments and counter-arguments which have been well aired at this stage.  I do, however, wish to draw your attention to two material errors in the Committee's report.<br /><br />First, the Committee states as its opinion that the NAMA Board was not explicitly informed of the extent of the financial loss that would be recorded in NAMA's accounts as a result of setting the Project Eagle minimum reserve price at &pound;1.3 billion (Paragraphs C.9 and 144 of the report).  I wish to point out that this was unequivocally refuted by a former member of the Board at the PAC's hearing on 17 November 2016 when Mr John Corrigan stated that &quot;<i>when we decided to set the minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion, we were conscious that there was a probability that there could be a loss of up to &pound;180 million, that is to say, the difference between the reserve price and the carrying value of those assets in the balance sheet</i>&quot;.<br /><br />Second, the Committee is of the opinion (Paragraphs C.26 and 208) that the Board was not informed of the meeting held between NAMA representatives and Cerberus on 31 March 2014.  This is incorrect: a number of Board members recall that they were so informed - this is clear from the testimony of Mr Oliver Ellingham and Mr Willie Soffe to the PAC on 18 October 2016.<br /><br />Yours sincerely<br /><br />Frank Daly</blockquote> <p>I would like to make a brief response and we will not try not to labour this for too long.  It was our opinion that the board members were not explicitly informed of the extent of the financial loss.</p><p>While Mr. Corrigan may have been conscious that there could have been a loss of up to &pound;180 million, he did not say that all board members were explicitly informed of the matter.  Regarding what he said in the conclusion that the size of the loss implied that it would have been made clear to all board members, we were not provided with evidence that this statement had been made, despite several board members being present.  If we accept for a moment that it was the case that they were aware of the probability of a loss of &pound;180 million, why has NAMA argued so vehemently against the Comptroller and Auditor General's conclusion that the decision to sell the loans at a minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion involves a significant probable loss of up to &pound;190 million?  It simply makes no sense.<br/><br/>NAMA's defence was that they were not informed specifically of the extent of the financial loss of setting the price at &pound;1.3 billion, which actually would have reflected a loss of &pound;173 million.  We refer to the loss in our financial statement.  Mr. Daly is now saying that the board was made aware of a probable loss of up to &pound;180 million.  Why, in God's name, did they spend several months attacking the Comptroller and Auditor General for suggesting that there was a probable loss of up to &pound;190 million?  His defence against the PAC is to say that the Comptroller and Auditor General was right.  That is essentially it.<br/><br/>I want to move on to the second matter, which is even more puzzling.  As regards the chairman of NAMA's point about not informing the board about the meeting with Cerberus, we wrote specifically to NAMA at my request on 13 December 2016 on this matter.  We asked NAMA:</p><blockquote>Please give us the details of any and all recorded responses, if available, of each of the NAMA board members when they were informed during the board meeting on 3 April regarding the meetings between the Chairman and the Chief Executive and Cerberus on the day before the bids closed.  If this was not communicated to the board members provide a note for why this was the case.</blockquote><p>That was in our letter to NAMA.  On 22 December 2016, NAMA replied to the committee.  The reply is on our website.  It responded to the committee as follows: &quot;As is evident from the minutes of the NAMA Board meetings, the meeting with Cerberus was not discussed at Board level as Project Eagle was not discussed at the meeting with Cerberus&quot;.  Therefore, his response to the committee to say that the members were informed is 100% contradicted by NAMA's own letter to us on 22 December when it said that the matter was not discussed at board level.  NAMA's response to our letter is a flat contradiction of its written evidence to this committee on 22 December 2016.  We are going to issue a statement to that effect.  We will send both documents off to the commission for whenever it reports.</p></speech>

Does the Deputy want to elaborate?  The Deputy is saying that there is a difference between referring a matter to SIPO and making a formal complaint.</p></speech>

It raised a very serious issue for me in that there is the potential of some boards saying that they complied with the SIPO Act and regulations by simply referring issues on.  However, unless they make a complaint, SIPO is not obliged to carry out an examination.  It seems to me that this was missed for a huge amount of time.  It was only SIPO itself that decided it would carry out an examination.  I am not sure whether the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General was aware of it or had been alerted to it.  My issue is whether there is a difference between informing SIPO and noting issues arose and organisations actually making a complaint.</p></speech>

The origination of it was actually in the audit of the Family Support Agency for 2012.  We discovered that a director of the Family Support Agency had been claiming for attendance at the meetings, but the individual was also employed by a family resource centre in Waterford and was claiming there for attendance at the same meetings.  That created at difficulty.  The audit found that.  We brought it to the attention of the Family Support Agency.  In the audit certificates for 2012 and 2013 for the Family Support Agency, I drew attention to the fact that there was a difficulty there and that the matter was being pursued by the Family Support Agency.<br/><br/>I cannot comment on the individual or on anything to do with the individual, but I think the point raised by the Deputy relates to the agency and the governance of the agency.  The report produced by the commission on the matter does point out that the Family Support Agency reported the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reported back to say that it cannot proceed because it did not receive a complaint.  Similarly, when the matter was brought to the attention of the Standards in Public Office Commission, it was reported that there had been a double claiming but it did not name the individual.  Therefore, it did not constitute a complaint that the commission could act on <i>per se</i>.  The commission did pursue it with the agency, got the details and carried out an investigation subsequently.  I believe it does point up the difference between reporting something to an investigatory body and making a complaint to an investigatory body.  As it stands, the agency's last stated position on the matter was that it was satisfied that the moneys were appropriately paid to the individual.  As auditor of that agency, I do not take the same view.</p></speech>

We suggested to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that claims for travel and subsistence should always be through the employer.  If there was a basis for reclaiming those travel and subsistence expenses, we suggested that it be done agency to agency in order not to have a public servant claiming in two different places unknown to both sides.  The Department issued a letter of instruction.  Across the Civil Service now, that is the expectation.</p></speech>

We will check up on that.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  No. 458C is correspondence dated 2 May from Shannon Protection Alliance requesting the appearance of a report writer before the committee.  We decided at last week's meeting that this is a matter more suitable to the Joint Committee on Planning, Housing, Community and Local Government, as it is about a proposed plan that it has been examining.  Is it agreed to note that?  Agreed.  That is noted.</p><p> No. 465C, dated 28 April 2017, is from an individual who refers to Teagasc.  The correspondence states that if, in his opinion, the grievance procedure had operated correctly in Teagasc there would have been no need for the matter to go to the Rights Commissioner or the Labour Court.  However, the fact is that it did and both of these dismissed the person&rsquo;s claim.  The matter is now ten years old and I understand that this individual has retired from Teagasc.  I accept that he still feels aggrieved but it is not for the committee to deal with such individual cases or reopen a case that has received a hearing through all of the proper mechanisms available.  I propose that we write to the individual informing him that we cannot take his case further.  I ask the secretariat and the Parliamentary Legal Adviser to draft an appropriate letter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p> Nos. 466C(i) and (ii) and 473C are two items of correspondence dated 8 May 2017.  They are from an individual who has contacted the committee many times on a wards of court issue.  She claims, with regard to losses sustained by the wards of court fund, that the State should carry these.  She cites a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts held on March 2001 where the then Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave evidence to that effect to the committee.  She enclosed a copy of the transcript and I propose that we forward a copy of her correspondence to the Department of Justice and Equality for a response.</p><p> A response to the document was submitted by the individual on the Aon Hewitt Report of the Wards of Court Investment Scheme Spectrum Growth Fund, which was forwarded by us to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform some months ago.  The clerk has informed me that the report is expected within the next week.  We will hear back on that and we will also write to the Department of Justice and Equality because the wards of court issue continues. </p><p> No. 469C is further correspondence from a firm of solicitors, dated 8 May, on a client who seeks to address the committee in connection with the Grace issue and the standard of care provided by the HSE.  This item follows on from our discussion at last week's meeting.  We await a response from the HSE on final questions that were submitted following last week's meeting.  What do members propose we should do?  The whistleblower has requested a private meeting with the committee to discuss the issues.  We have already decided that Mr. Tony O'Brien will be invited back here to discuss the issues.  I remember reading the letter and I think her letter dealt with public procurement issues, which fall within our remit.  We will not stray into the care issue because it will be dealt with by the commission.  The person referred to procurement issues that may be part of the commission's terms of reference.</p></speech>

It was stated in court that the Deloitte report was not completed.  We will ask if it has been completed since then.  We were told we would get a copy of it once it was completed.  We will ask the HSE if it has been completed and, if so, to forward a copy to us.</p><p>The next item is correspondence No. 470C, (i) to (iv), from Deputy Thomas Broughan, enclosing copies of figures provided by the group Promoting Awareness Responsibility and Care on the Roads, PARC, in relation to drink-driving offences.  I propose that we send these figures to the Department for a response.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  I thank Deputy Broughan for the work done in that regard.</p><p>The next item is correspondence No. 471C (i) and (ii) from an individual which is dated 9 May relating to Howth Harbour, the management of which is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We also received another item of correspondence from the same individual last week and, as agreed, the clerk contacted the individual and clarified that the matter is being examined by the Ombudsman.  The individual told the clerk that although he was thankful that the previous Committee of Public Accounts took an interest in this matter, he feels that raising matters with the committee did not help in terms of how he has been treated by the relevant authorities.  I propose that we let the Ombudsman conclude his investigation and write to the individual to say that if there are matters outside of that investigation which this committee should examine, to itemise these for our consideration.  We will write back to him on that basis.</p><p>The next item is correspondence No. 468 B, (i) and (ii), a report from Mr. John Barrett.  We will not conduct an analysis of this report now but we have a substantial document in front of us today.  I want to make a number of observations arising from this document, which follows last week's meeting.  The first observation I will make, about which there is no dispute, is that the matters were brought to the attention of the Garda Commissioner in July 2015 and 22 months later, she still has not gotten to the bottom of them.  I would argue that 22 months is long enough to have dealt with an in-house matter in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am not satisfied that the Committee of Public Accounts was told last week that further audit work may not even be completed by the summer.  This committee is not going to wait beyond two years for a follow-through on these matters.  These matters were known in 2015 and were probably known to the Commissioner in 2014 when she was acting Commissioner.  In 2014, repayments to the OPW had started on foot of people being aware of the situation at that stage.  This is not a legacy issue.  It is an issue that is current to the current Commissioner.  It was brought to her notice on her watch and she has known about it for the past 22 months.  The meeting last week was outstanding but was not the conclusion of this matter.  We will want to see a further response sooner rather than later.  </p><p>Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan has two roles.  She is the Garda Commissioner and is answerable to the Minister for Justice and Equality in that respect.  She is also the Accounting Officer for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts for financial matters.  I just want to read something into the record so that everybody is clear on the position of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The 2015 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to the responsibilities of Accounting Officers.  It states: </p><blockquote>In accordance with section 22 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1886, the Accounting Officer is required to prepare the appropriation account.  By law, the account must be submitted to me [the Comptroller and Auditor General] by 31 March following the end of the year of the account.<br /><br />The Accounting officer is also responsible for the safeguarding of public funds and property under her control, for the efficiency and economy of administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the regularity and propriety of all transactions in the appropriation account. </blockquote> <p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published a document which was prepared by the current General Secretary of that Department for this committee.  It states:</p><blockquote>In their Accounting Officer role, which is personal and cannot be delegated, they are responsible for the stewardship of public funds and are required to give evidence on how they discharged this responsibility to the PAC. </blockquote> <p>It goes on:</p><blockquote>The fact that the duties of the Accounting Officer are vested in the most senior official in the organisation, who is personally answerable to the PAC, gives an important focus to managerial accountability for regularity, propriety and value for money in the operations of the Department.. The Accounting Officer cannot be acquainted with the detail of every transaction in the [organisation].  He/she ensures that proper mechanisms are in place to provide appropriate assurance about the regularity, propriety and efficiency of the [organisation's] operations.  These mechanisms are robust internal control systems; sound internal audit and Audit Committee arrangements; and effective risk management</blockquote> <p>The Department of Public Expenditure document elaborates further on the role of the Accounting Officer.</p><p>Ms. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan is the Accounting Officer to this committee.  She is not here solely as Garda Commissioner but has a dual role.  The Accounting Officer's responsibilities are also set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General Act 1993.  I will not go through that now.  The statutory responsibilities of Accounting Officers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the appropriation accounts are very clear.  The accounts, which are submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General, must be accompanied by a statement of internal financial control.  In addition, the Accounting Officer is responsible for safeguarding assets, the financial implications of policy, economy and efficiency, evaluation of effectiveness, internal audit, sanctions and grant procedures.  Those duties are personal to the Accounting Officer.  Our discussions here are in relation to the Accounting Officer.  </p><p>I will invite members to comment on this presently.  As I have said already, these matters were brought to the attention of the Garda Commissioner in July 2015 but 22 months later, we still have not got to the bottom of it all.  This committee - I am sure the members will agree with me on this - is not waiting any longer because 22 months is long enough for her to have gotten to the bottom of this.  The promise of another internal report, possibly after July 2017, is not the issue.  There is enough information in the interim report that was concluded in September 2016.</p><p>I want to move on to one other point about which I am personally concerned.  It might seem like a small point to some but it is significant, in my view.</p><p>We all know about the meeting held in July 2015.  Several months later, in 29 March 2016, the deputy commissioner requested an internal audit report on the Garda College in Templemore.  That is mentioned on page 10 of the report that we saw last week.  In September 2016 the interim audit report was presented to the head of the internal audit unit.  That was the first draft.  The reason I am referring to it is the correspondence received from Mr. Barrett refers to the fact that the head of the internal audit unit did very well to have the matter referred to in the statement of accounting policies and principles signed by the Accounting Officer on the 2015 accounts.  That was all agreed to in the first few days of September.  The Comptroller and Auditor General signed his audit report on 5 September 2016 on the 2015 accounts.  As a result of the internal audit, these matters were coming to a head.  The Comptroller and Auditor General insisted on there being some reference to them.  When I look at the statement of accounting policies and principles on page 318 of the 2015 appropriation accounts, signed by N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan, Accounting Officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, on 31 March 2016, the last paragraph reads as follows:</p><blockquote>Audit of the Garda College<br /><br />A number of issues associated with the provision of ancillary services in the Garda College, Templemore, have been identified which are not in compliance with current public standard corporate governance procedures.  A draft internal audit report has made a number of recommendations to ensure compliance with the public financial procedures which will be incorporated into any action plan to address these issues.</blockquote><p>As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, that paragraph could only have been drafted and agreed to in the first week of September 2016.  The Accounting Officer, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan, signed the document to include that paragraph later than 31 March.  That is the one signed document she has presented here before today.  Essentially, for items agreed to in September 2016, she backdated her signature by over five months.  I do not find it satisfactory that an Accounting Officer presented the appropriation accounts and the statement of accounting policies and principles to deal with matters to be dealt with in September 2016 and signed and dated them 31 March 2016.  I find it unacceptable; it is not accurate or appropriate.  I have to question the honesty of people who sign documents and have them backdated by over five months.  I will be requesting her to come and answer that specific question, the reason being that she would probably have prepared a draft &ndash; I am now trying to help her &ndash; as there is a requirement to produce the accounts for the Comptroller and Auditor General by 31 March, but it would have been far more honest if she had re-dated them in September, the day before the Comptroller and Auditor General issued his report.  I am not going to place any responsibility on the Comptroller and Auditor General who published the document.  His audit report of 5 September is clear.  This is the document signed by N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan as Accounting Officer.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to respond.  It might seem to be a small matter.</p></speech>

The obligation is to present the appropriation account.  This, <i>per se</i>, is on page 7 and effectively the statement of moneys provided and the outturn which is compared with that of the previous year.  The practice we have adopted over the years is that we require the account to be presented to us.  Our audit process is a process of verification of what has been presented.  If we find at any stage that there is a figure in the appropriation account which is incorrect, we will ask the Accounting Officer personally to re-sign the new appropriation account with a current date.  However, in the course of an audit we may find that the explanations of variances are inadequate or the disclosures insufficient.  In that situation we go back to the Department &ndash; in this case An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &ndash; and say it needs to make this adjustment, that it is not explaining it properly or that a figure in a note needs to be amended.  We do not require the Accounting Officer to re-sign in that situation.  Similarly, if there are changes in the statement of internal financial control, we will say to the Department that it must put in something extra because there is a breach of controls not noted in the account and that it is appropriate to bring it to the attention of the committee by disclosing it in the statement of internal financial control.  We have not insisted on the Accounting Officer re-signing.  Physically, the Accounting Officer did not re-sign and backdate it.  It would have been noted by the executive director of finance.</p></speech>

However, the onus is on the Accounting Officer of every Department who has responsibility for the statement of accounting policies and principles.  The Comptroller and Auditor General signs his audit report, while the Accounting Officer signs his or her report.  The clarification is that a document was signed on 31 March 2016.  We are entitled to rely on that document as having been signed on that date, as presented to us.  We now find that a paragraph written five months after that date was inserted into the document and that it was physically impossible to have signed off on it on 31 March.  I would have said the onus was on the Accounting Officer to re-date it because the Templemore College issue was significant.  It might not have changed the financial accounts, but it was an issue of significant concern to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

When I see a statement signed by an Accounting Officer, dated 31 March 2016, I am entitled to believe, as the Deputy is, that the document and its contents were signed on 31 March 2016.  It is in black and white.</p></speech>

My opinion on confidence in the police is on record.  I am here, however, in a different capacity.  I am here as a member of the committee to consider the issue of value for money.  Matters arose on the last occasion on which clarification is certainly needed.  The Garda Commissioner needs to be given an opportunity to come here.  That is the way we should deal with the matter.  If we go down the route of saying &ldquo;misled&rdquo; and &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo;, we are making findings.</p><p>We may well want to do it but it is not our role.  Our role is to look at value for money and examine what is before us.</p><p> On the last occasion, Mr. Barrett produced a document that we just got this week.  We need to look at it and see the context of it.  It was referred to as "minutes" but it is his personal recording.  I advise caution and I say this as somebody on the record questioning the police and having a certain opinion.  I am hearing a different context.  We should put this down for a meeting as quickly as possible and it should not wait until July.</p></speech>

It is as a matter of fact misleading to present the facts in that way, not least as I understood from last week's hearing that it was very late in the day when the Comptroller and Auditor General was alerted to the facts of what was happening in Templemore.

Due process must be gone through.  Very serious issues came up after a very long day.  We need to look at what Mr. Barrett produced, come back and discuss it.  I urge caution and we should do that as quickly as possible in the proper context of our role in this committee, bearing in mind the delays we have seen.  There was a draft of a report in 2006 and reports in 2008, 2010 and 2015.  Various people, including the Comptroller and Auditor General, were not aware of the issue.</p> <p>  I will clarify something before finishing.  Yesterday in the D&aacute;il the Taoiseach stated the Comptroller and Auditor General was still looking at this.  I understand his report has been completed and it is what we are discussing.  He stated there were three inspections or analyses going on, with one of those coming from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Could we have clarification on that?</p></speech>

Clearly there are control matters that arise and we are examining the issue in that context.  I expect I will have a report in September in that regard.  That is the normal business.

The matters raised last week are serious not just for the Committee of Public Accounts but for the State.  I have the transcript of last week's meeting and I have read it a couple of times.  It is incredible to do so in conjunction with the documents that Mr. Barrett has now sent us.  It is like a jigsaw but the problem is the pieces do not fit.  There are contradictions all over the place.  There were contradictions in the evidence last week with the Garda Commissioner and her staff and between the Department personnel and Garda Commissioner, when they basically said opposite things.  The Garda Commissioner stated last week she started a process after the meeting of 27 July but was that process not begun beforehand, on 2 July by Mr. Cyril Dunne, the head of administration?  Did he not commence that process before the Garda Commissioner said she commenced her process?  In evidence, the Garda Commissioner said she started a process and the Department of Justice and Equality - representatives of which are coming before us in a few minutes - was involved straight away.  It is my understanding that may not be the case and it might not have been brought into the process until October.  It is important that the assistant secretary who sat here last week said the Department was not aware of the issues relating to Templemore until October.  If it was involved with the process from July, how was it not aware of the issues until October?  How in the name of God is there a Department of justice that is not aware of these issues in the first place, given the Vote it must manage?  Frankly, it is incredible.</p> <p>  I have another point before moving on.  On 12 April I raised many of these issues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  In evidence last week, the Garda Commissioner and every witness, including those from the Department of Justice and Equality, stated they were not aware of the very specific issues I raised involving dates, times and people mentioned in the D&aacute;il on 12 April.  How is that possible?  There was a motion of no confidence in the Garda Commissioner but the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda Commissioner and all the staff were not aware these issues were raised.  It is incredible.</p> <p>  This is incredibly serious and I agree with the previous speaker and the comments of the Chairman on the national airwaves.  We must deal with this quickly.  I do not believe we will deal with it in one meeting and if we need special sittings, we should have them.  We should do that very soon, possibly starting the process in a fortnight.  How far are we going to go with this?  This goes very deep and there are layers of issues.  There is a gold, silver and bronze amount of issues here.  There is the matter of what happened with the Garda Commissioner over the past couple of years.  There is the matter of how the internal auditor was not made aware of reports in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2015.  There are also the issues relating to Templemore.  Mr. Cyril Dunne has left the organisation and Mr. Michael Howard is the external auditor.  Ms Anne-Marie McMahon has certain knowledge about Templemore.  Will we look into these matters by bringing in everybody who was here last week?  Will former Garda Commissioners be invited in?  Will we bring in the individuals who were here last week, those who have left the organisation or those who are currently in the organisation and who have critical knowledge?  Assistant Garda Commissioner Twomey has been referenced numerous times.  These are critical issues we need to decide now on behalf of this country so we can get to the bottom of what is going on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#H01800"><p>I agree with much of what has been said already and with the Chairman's sentiments on the national airwaves this morning.  I was at most of last week's meeting, except for the end, but there were contradictions before that, particularly in terms of assessment of potential for criminality.  The Garda Commissioner clearly stated there was no question of that but Mr. Barrett was less sure.  I agree very much with Deputy Kelly in his sentiments about how deep we can go.  As Deputy Connolly stated, we are here specifically for value-for-money and accounting issues but we cannot fail to be cognisant of the fact that in parallel there are many other issues facing the Garda.  There is a major morale issue and people are entitled to have confidence in the police force.  Whereas there is no specific relationship, these accounting matters will contribute in a very serious way to undermining that even further.  Whatever we do, we need to do it quickly and to do it properly we will need to go into some level of depth.  That involves seeking to bring in former Garda Commissioners and people who have been involved so we can determine value for money and where money was used.</p> <p>  The second issue is the level of contradiction in last week's meeting.  As the Chairman stated, it is not a legacy issue; it is current.</p><p>To me it is a complexion and culture of delay to facilitate containment, damage limitation and cover up.  This seems to be the sort of autopilot that is allowed to run in Departments and it is wrong.  I do not know how we will manage this in terms of time but it needs to be our top priority given the implications.  I would also like to see Mr. Barrett, Mr. Ruane, Mr. Kelly and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality without the Commissioner in the room if possible.  Whether it is appropriate to do this in private or public session I am agnostic, but I would like the ability to have an engagement with these individuals and put certain questions without, as it were, their boss sitting beside them.  These are my thoughts so far.</p></speech>

The allegations being made against the Commissioner-----</p></speech>

The public will want to know why this culture seems to be at play in the Garda, which Mr. Barrett has raised and Deputy MacSharry has raised, with regard to a cover-up.  Many witnesses are involved, and whether we bring former Commissioners before the committee will be up to the committee.  We must be mindful of Standing Order 186 and we have to look at the public finances above all.  We cannot pre-empt any political attacks for political purposes.  Obviously, having said that, there are serious issues here that need to be looked at and addressed.  If we are going to have credibility in the Garda with regard to internal mechanisms, in my view we need to question the Commissioner further and question any other witnesses whereby we can throw light on this.  We cannot have a situation where contradictory statements are being made and there is no clarity about what is happening.  I would like this dealt with expeditiously with regard to all of the witnesses brought before the committee.  There is also the caveat raised by Deputy Connolly regarding proceeding with caution.  We must be very careful of due process in this and ensure it is done correctly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#J00500"><p>Before we proceed, and before we have more meetings and invite in more witnesses, my view is we need to be very clear as a committee about what it is we are doing.  A committee established by the Commissioner is examining a number of issues.  Internal audit is still doing its work; what we have received is an interim report and it must conclude its work.  Mr. Kelly said this will not be done by July and that it will take some more time, but it is in process.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will do his work on the appropriation accounts.  It is not an actual examination, although that might come following whatever comes from his examination of these issues for the appropriation accounts.</p><p>It is very clear there was a breakdown in process, policies and procedures.  We have to get under the bonnet of all of this.  We have contradictory evidence.  We received a huge amount of information from Mr. Barrett, which is very helpful.  It is documented and contemporaneous.  We do not have the same level of information, by the way, from the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>I would like to see us putting some structure to our work.  First of all, we need to get all of the information we have sought.  We have the incomplete audit report from 2006, which has been referenced, the 2008 report that was ignored pretty much and a 2010 report.  There are documents that were over and back between the director of financial services and the Commissioner.  There are documents the chief administrative officer had.  There was information that should have been given to board meetings which was not given.  We need minutes of those board meetings.  There is a list of documentation and a range of documents we need first.  Then we need to look at who we need to bring in and who are the key witnesses.  There are people who were not in the room last time, for example, the chief administrative officer who, in my view, has questions to answer.  Even if retired, that person needs to be in the room.</p><p>I do not want to go into all of Mr. Barrett's points, but there is a key statement in his documentation which goes to the heart of all of this.  He stated:</p><blockquote>More worryingly it appears that a coordinated effort was made to ensure that Mr Niall Kelly, Head of Internal Audit, was actively delayed, dissuaded, or precluded from becoming involved.  Despite Mr Kelly's best efforts to get a copy of the 2007 report, he was denied access to it by senior Garda management.  This process of exclusion essentially closed down any prospect of the matters going beyond the walls of Garda HQ and becoming a matter visible to your committee [as in the internal audit committee], the C&amp;amp;AG, the Public Accounts Committee and thereby into the public domain.</blockquote> <p>It is quite clear that information was withheld from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, this committee, the Department and Garda internal audit.  These are allegations that are being made and that we need to examine.  They are more than allegations as there are also statements made by internal audit.  The head of internal audit said himself he was frustrated he did not get the information he sought.  We need to put structure to it.  I say, based on my reading of it, that all of this screams cover-up and collusion.  We as a committee need to take it seriously because it goes to the heart of the culture in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>My recommendation to the committee is when we come back the next time we have a report which looks at structure, we get as much information as possible and we have a list of potential witnesses, then we decide when we do it and for how long we do it, and then we look at the internal controls in place within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the failures.  Essentially our job is to do all of this.  I propose this as a way to advance this.  What we do not want to have is a scattergun approach, whereby we end up bringing in witnesses who are in and out with a slap on the wrist and that is it.  I do not think that would be useful for us.  I want a Committee of Public Accounts report at the end of this.</p></speech>

We definitely need to have this dealt with much earlier.  I raised this matter with the T&aacute;naiste on 9 February on Leaders' Questions.  I was looking for a copy of the draft report that had been leaked to a newspaper and there was quite an extensive article in January as to parliamentary questions.  I was told by the T&aacute;naiste at that point that the Committee of Public Accounts and the justice committee had debated this at length.  I went back that same afternoon and I disputed this with the T&aacute;naiste.  I could find no record of it.  I pursued her for six or eight weeks, forwards and backwards, and she corrected the record in April in the D&aacute;il.  That was during the debate on the Charlton commission, at the beginning of February.  It is very important, and it was something that was quite interesting last week, that the Commissioner agreed the interim report came in draft form to her in September 2016.  Last week, on the record before the committee, she said there had been no change to the draft report.  The report on Templemore we debated has an interim report dated February 2017 which was published in late March or early April.  The role of the Department of Justice and Equality in this is important because when something is leaked to a newspaper it screams of frustration that there was something that was required to be publicly available.  There are questions to be asked when we are speaking about this with regard to the Department of Justice and Equality and what its knowledge was.</p><p>Why was this, when there was no change made to it between September and February?  </p><p> It did not take that long to read the report.  It was quite clear that what was included in that report was very significant.  Why did it take that length of time when we are talking about the frustration in bringing this into the public domain with the Garda?  There is an equal question regarding the Department of Justice and Equality bringing it into the public domain.  I want to see that dealt with by the people who come in front of us as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#K00200"><p>I would like to state my full agreement with the remarks of Deputy Cullinane.  It is a rare thing.</p> <p>  The issue that we face is a process issue.  We need to determine what this process is going to be.  More important, we need to determine what it will be from the professional end of the process in terms of investigating what precisely went on and the manner of the investigation. </p> <p>  I would be of the firm view that, given the work the Comptroller and Auditor General is doing with regard to 2016 and the imminent completion of that work, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General should go back and look at Templemore as a specific unit, as well as all of the various processes that took place there and the various transactions involved.</p> <p>  It is very clear from the evidence given by the Commissioner and her staff that the internal audit unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is under-resourced.  I would question how seriously it is taking the matter in terms of its presentation of information, not just to the committee but also the fullness and openness to the State and Department of Justice and Equality.  The fact that it was withheld historically from the Comptroller and Auditor General speaks volumes in its own right.</p> <p>  Another issue comes down to the budget within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be able to get the work of the interim report done quickly.  In order to do that, it occurs to me that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to bring in expertise to complete that work and support the section which currently comprises eight personnel.  I made that point last week, and I am making it again today because it is imperative that the Garda adequately deal with this issue so that we can get the interim report into the public domain in order that the Comptroller and Auditor General has an opportunity to review it at some point.  I appreciate that he has, no doubt, a full list of entities to audit.  It occurred to me and, I am sure, many others, that the only way we can achieve full disclosure in regard to the actions and behaviours in Templemore over a period of decades is for the competent authority of the State to go in and do it, and that competent authority is the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  It was an incredibly damaging revelation for all of us when the report on issues in Templemore was published.  With the greatest of respect to my colleagues, as Deputy Connolly pointed out there is no doubt that we will stray into territory which will effectively turn this committee room into some sort of courtroom.  We are not qualified to do that, nor are we allowed to do that.  Therefore, I am in agreement with Deputy Cullinane.  We need to set a very strict set of terms of reference for ourselves on what it is that we are seeking.</p> <p>  It would amount to an unqualified witch-hunt if we were to start line questioning the Commissioner, the Accounting Officer and other individuals in regard to gaps in the production of information and-or receipts etc. within Templemore over a period of years.  We need to consider a special report from the Comptroller and Auditor General or other competent investigative organisation, whatever that may be.  It may involve an inquiry of some kind from an accounting perspective or some other mechanism.</p> <p>  It would be very easy for all of us to go into a committee structure and quiz the Commissioner, the Accounting Officer, the head of internal audit and all the rest.  It would make great headlines, but would we actually achieve anything?  The scattergun approach to which Deputy Cullinane referred is entirely accurate.  There is a question of competency.  I appreciate we are all very good at what we do because otherwise we would not be here, but the truth of the matter is that there are competent individuals who are capable of getting to the bottom of the accounting practices and trying to come up with information.  If that information is not available, competent individuals need to draw their own conclusions as to that.</p> <p>  My final remark concerns the comments of the Chairman and the Comptroller and Auditor General on the audit process and a correction or clarification &ndash; whatever one wants to call it.  I would like the Comptroller and Auditor General to restate what he said earlier for the purposes of clarity.  What I and the Chairman took from what he said are two totally different things.  I want to make sure that we are all on the same page.  I am not an auditor or an accountant, but what I heard the Comptroller and Auditor General state was that in the course of his verification of the information that was provided an error or a lack of information was identified.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General sought to have that clarification made.  It was made and signed, and the document was changed, as is the norm in an audit process.  I wanted to clarify that so we are all on the same page.</p> <p>  At the moment, I do not see that the Chairman is on the same page.  I appreciate his professionalism------</p></speech>

I will finish with the members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#K00400"><p>I remind the committee that the issues around the public domain and the matters of public concern were unearthed in this committee room.  This is clearly not a court of law, but it clearly is the Committee of Public Accounts of the Oireachtas and is regularly cited as the most influential and powerful committee of the Oireachtas.  Vested in us is the responsibility to follow the money from a value-for-money perspective and to follow the attendant processes and procedures.  That is what we should do.</p> <p>  It falls to us to get to the bottom of these matters.  For the purposes of assisting the committee, let me say that there is a very long historical hinterland to the story.  As a Deputy said it goes back decades.  I do not believe that we are in a position to, nor should we attempt to, examine all of that.  Rather, we should look to the here and now, the duration of the stewardship of the current Commissioner, as Accounting Officer, to examine exactly the turn of events, the audit, its procedures, the quality of the audit and so on.  In other words, the issues that we began to consider and examine in this committee room last week are what we should focus on.</p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane's point is that we need an orderly approach to this and conduct our business in a way that sheds light rather than simply heat.  That point is fairly made.  Any suggestion that holding the Accounting Officer, in this case the Garda Commissioner, to account amounts to a witch-hunt is very inaccurate and very dangerous from the point of view of the work that we do as a committee.</p> <p>  I suggest that we decide we will investigate these matters, and look to set out the parameters of our inquiries and their sequencing.  We need to put the Garda Commissioner, Garda management and all others on notice that we are looking for their full co-operation and active participation in this procedure.</p><p> I want to make a final comment.  Maybe this is a matter of technicality and detail for people from the auditing world.  I have to say I attach very significant importance to dates on documents.  I think most people would be in the same position as myself.  I am shocked to hear not that an alteration was made to a document, but that the alteration was not made explicitly clear.  I do not think that is the correct way to proceed.  I have no interest in a witch-hunt or anything else.  We have to be determined to do our jobs and our work.  I am not looking for a deferral mechanism to push this down the pipe.  These issues are at play now.  They are of huge public concern.  They are relevant.  They fall squarely within our remit.  We should decide precisely how we are going to do this.  I refer to the dates and so on.  Maybe the Garda Commissioner and her staff do not watch Oireachtas TV, but if they happen to tune into this episode of the Committee of Public Accounts, they should be on notice that we will be looking for all of them, individually and collectively, to co-operate fully and honestly with our inquiries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#L00200"><p>I will not repeat what has been said.  I agree with everything the previous speaker said.  This is no witch-hunt.  We have to do a job here.  This is a constitutional committee.  We need to get to the bottom of what is going on here.  I know we cannot go back forever.  We have to concentrate on the current Accounting Officer, who happens to be the Garda Commissioner in this instance.  Even more serious questions have been raised today.  Specific questions have arisen regarding the evidence that was given last week.  I am conscious that there is a huge amount of documentation.  I have gone through the transcript of what was said at last week's meeting.  I went through it twice.  I am conscious that various Deputies asked for specific documents, reports and emails.  For instance, we asked the Commissioner to check whether there was any email traffic during a certain time period which said that the internal auditor was to be kept at bay.  We asked for documentation in relation to certain financial stuff.  Anyone who goes through the transcript will see that many such requests were made.  I think we need to analyse the documents we asked for before we go through the next stage of this.</p> <p>  I will set out my suggestion.  We have some documentation from Mr. Barrett.  Requests have been made for other documentation.  We need that documentation as soon as possible.  I suggest we should write to the Garda Commissioner and the Department of Justice and Equality, as the two main players here.  The OPW is also relevant in this context because questions have been asked about the lands.  The OPW probably did not know for a period of time that it owned the lands.  It certainly did not know about the rent it was not actually getting.  We should write to the Department, the Garda and the OPW to ask for the documents and references that were sought last week.  After a gap period of a week has been allowed to enable us to analyse that information, we should start the process of looking at the issues we all know we need to get to the bottom of.  I agree with what Deputy MacSharry said earlier on.  I believe multiple sittings, including special sittings, will be required.  This will have an effect on our diaries.  If we were to bring in the garda&iacute; and the Department in two different segments, that might be a good process.  We might have to break it up like that.</p> <p>  I suggest that in the next few days or the next week, members of the committee who feel that certain individuals in various roles need to give evidence should write to the clerk to ask for those people to be included and to justify their inclusion by explaining why they think those people are relevant.  This will be necessary so we can make sure we can bring out the fullness of what we need to bring out.  I suggest that we write to the relevant parties to ensure we get the documentation we asked for, in addition to any further documentation my colleagues might wish to get, and that we begin this process the following week by bringing in witnesses as suggested by the Chair.</p></speech>

My personal belief is that the power enjoyed by the members of this committee is accompanied by a great responsibility.  We have a huge responsibility to assess the evidence in a very fair manner.  We have to be very careful to focus on getting to the bottom of the truth here.</p> <p>  I have concerns about some of the comments that have been made, especially those questioning the honesty of the Accounting Officer.  That is not appropriate until we have done a stress test on the evidence of both sides of this debate.  We have to do stress tests on Mr. Kelly's evidence and Mr. Barrett's evidence.  I believe we are putting ourselves in a position where we are prejudging the outcome.  We need to be very careful on this.  I would like the Comptroller and Auditor General to set out the position in respect of the comments that have been made about the signature.  Was the Commissioner and Accounting Officer asked to re-sign the document when the paragraph in question was inserted?  In his view as an auditor, did she do anything wrong in that process?</p></speech>

The interim internal audit report cites all of the documentation anyway.  We may have additional documentation we are seeking.  Maybe we could contact the clerk to make our own requests.  I suggest that at the next meeting, after we have gathered all the information, we have to agree on the scope of whatever examination we are to do and on who will be called as witnesses.  t would be useful if we could get a report that maps or scopes that out.</p></speech>

When we meet next Thursday, we will have a list of the documentation, a proposal - we will call it a plan - for how we are going to do our work and an approximate timescale.

The legal obligation is for the Accounting Officer to submit the account by 31 March.  The account was submitted by 31 March.  There was no change to the account <i>per se</i>.  That process dates back to 1866.  There have been many additions to appropriation accounts since then.  The statement on internal financial control has been around for approximately 20 years.  It is an extremely important document, but it is not one that we completely and wholly audit.  We look at it to see whether there is any information known to us in the course of the audit that would suggest there is anything wrong with the statement.  My understanding is that the internal audit had started by 31 March, or at least that internal audit had been notified of the thing.  We were only told about it on 31 May.</p><p>When the statement on internal financial control came to us, signed by the Accounting Officer with a date of 31 March, there was no reference to the internal audit in it.  We pointed out that there should be such a reference because it was so significant.</p></speech>

Over the summer we engaged with them and told them we needed to know what was going on in order to complete the audit.  My understanding, and something which becomes clear from Mr. Barrett's documentation, is that the interim internal audit was needed before the appropriation account was produced.  We were pushing all summer to get something.  Without having the report itself, but only the summary, we said to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it had to put something into the SIFC.  This is, apparently, a breach of controls and this is the whole point of the SIFC.  We need to ensure that the appropriation account is right and if there is any different treatment of transactions, balances or liabilities, even contingent liabilities, they need to be recognised.  We are looking at the implications for the OPW appropriation account too, because there may be issues there and disclosures may be required.</p> <p>  It is for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to sort this out and to make the changes to structures and controls, etc.  We will be looking to see that An Grada S&iacute;och&aacute;na is addressing the matter and if continuing adjustments to its system of control are needed in respect of the college, it should disclose them to the SIFC for 2016.  We already have it and at the moment, what is in it is not sufficient for the purposes, so there will be an adjustment required-----</p></speech>

From the Department of Justice and Equality, we are joined by Mr. Noel Waters, Secretary General, Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Mr. Jimmy Martin, Mr. John O'Callaghan, Mr. Seamus Clifford, Mr. Ben Ryan, Mr. Eugene Banks and Ms Bernadette Phelan.  We are also joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy.  From the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we are joined by Mr. John Burke.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.</p><p>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Before I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, for the information of members of the public, I will immediately suspend the meeting following the opening statements because there is a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas to hear a statement from Mr. Michel Barnier.  We will resume at 2 p.m.  I will take the opening statements only.</p></speech>

Members can see that programmes A, B, and C account for the bulk of the expenditure.  Expenditure of &euro;152 million on the programme to Maintain a Secure Ireland includes expenditure on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service totalling &euro;47 million and on asylum seekers accommodation of &euro;57 million.  The latter expenditure is the focus of the report being considered this morning on which I will comment shortly.</p> <p>  Spending related to the operations of the Probation Service accounted for &euro;35.5 million of the &euro;51 million of spending under programme B, Work for Safer Communities.</p> <p>  Expenditure on legal aid services accounts for &euro;86 million, or 69%, of the programme on Facilitating the Provision and Administration of Justice.  A further &euro;10 million was spent on the Forensic Science Laboratory and the State Pathology Service.  This programme also provided for expenditure of over &euro;10 million on commissions and inquiries, details of which are set out in note 6.3 to the account.  The committee may also wish to note spending under this programme of &euro;5.45 million in respect of the Magdalen fund, as against a funding provision for the year of &euro;11.5 million.</p> <p>  Across the Vote, salaries accounted for 35% of the expenditure.  At year end 2015, a total of 2,233 full-time equivalent staff were employed in the Department and the other offices funded from the Vote.</p> <p>  On the receipts side, appropriations-in-aid totalled just over &euro;64 million.  Over 70% of this related to a range of fees charged in respect of immigration registration, nationality and citizenship certification, and visa issuance.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the report before the committee.  Since 2000, the State has met its obligation to provide for the material needs of asylum seekers while their applications are being processed by offering accommodation and food at what are known as direct provision centres.  In addition, residents of direct provision centres are entitled to a small weekly allowance paid by the Department of Social Protection and to avail of health and education services funded by the relevant Votes.</p> <p>  The report before the committee this morning examines the procurement and management of contracts for direct provision centres.  As of December 2015, there was a total of 35 direct provision centres in operation - seven State-owned centres and 28 centres provided by 22 commercial suppliers.  Almost 4,700 individuals were being accommodated in the centres at the year end.  The Department also operates two emergency reception and orientation centres to cater for persons who already have refugee status.  The total cost to the Department in 2015 of providing accommodation and related services to asylum seekers and refugees was &euro;57 million.</p> <p>  The level of accommodation required is demand led and difficult to predict.  It is influenced by the number of asylum seekers, their length of stay in direct provision and, because there is no obligation to avail of direct provision, the number who opt to do so.</p> <p>  The report notes that in mid-2016, the average length of stay was 38 months with 450 residents, or 10% of the total, living in direct provision for more than seven years.  Some  23% of residents, or 950 people, continued to reside in direct provision even though their cases had been finalised.  This included 667 people or 16% who had been granted a status permitting them to remain in Ireland, and 283 or 7% who were subject to deportation orders.</p> <p>  Two commercial companies were contracted to provide services such as catering, cleaning and maintenance at the seven State-owned centres.  We found that competitive processes had been used to procure those services.</p> <p>  In contrast, the Department had not used competitive processes as set out in public procurement procedures to procure the 28 commercially-owned and run centres.  Instead, it seeks expressions of interest, evaluates the responses and then agrees contract terms with selected providers.  The Department&rsquo;s view is that this equates to the negotiated procedure provided for in EU procurement rules.  However, use of that procedure is only permitted in certain limited circumstances that we could not see existed in regard to direct provision.  The Department stated that it discussed the matter with the Office of Government Procurement but had not identified a procurement method to replace the current procedure.</p> <p>  The examination also found that effective management of contracts was made more difficult because not all contract deliverables had been expressed in a way that could be quantified or measured.  This increased the risk that standards of accommodation and services would not meet asylum seekers' needs or would be inconsistent between centres.  In addition, contracts did not set performance measures and there was limited provision for penalties for underperformance by suppliers.  The Department agreed to the report's recommendation to review the standard contract, and the Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in that regard.</p> <p>  Service delivery in the centres is monitored by physical inspections of premises, information clinics for residents of centres and reviews of complaints by residents.  However, the findings from this monitoring are not collated and used to assess service delivery performance.  The Department committed to introduce procedures to formally record such inspection findings and complaints, which should inform discussions with centre managers and owners.</p><p>Even though there was a low level of complaints by residents, information from other sources suggests that there is a significant level of dissatisfaction among residents about the quality of the accommodation, the services provided, or both.  A revised complaints procedure introduced in 2015 provided for an appeal to an independent appeals officer where a person was not satisfied with how his or her complaint was dealt with.  However, at the time of the examination, an independent appeals officer had yet to be appointed.</p><p> The report recommended that the Department review the complaints process to identify reasons why residents may not be raising issues.  The Department noted that the revised complaints procedure largely addressed this issue but undertook to examine ways to make the complaints process more open and transparent.  Members may also be aware that, from early April this year, residents of direct provision can now bring a complaint to the Ombudsman, or to the Ombudsman for Children, if they are unhappy with how their original complaint was dealt with.</p></speech>

In all, there are over 60 individual subheads across six expenditure programmes.  These reflect the work of policy areas dealing with everything from crime to land registry, reform of criminal and civil law, and an increasing number of regulatory bodies and front-line services in areas such as the immigration service and Forensic Science Ireland.  From 2016 onwards, the programme approach reflects the high-level goals in the Department&rsquo;s current strategy statement.  Other structural changes since the appropriation account for 2015 relate to the establishment of the Policing Authority as a separate Vote and, following a transfer of functions, the Department has now assumed responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p> <p>  In the briefing provided to members, I outlined that legal proceedings regarding the use of an office premises in Wolfe Tone Street, Dublin 1 by a community-based project funded by the Probation Service had concluded in late 2016.  This will be fully reflected in the appropriation account for 2016 and it was previously the subject of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2012, in the 2011 report.  The central issue in this case was the assurance provided by the vendor about planning permission for the premises.  The Comptroller and Auditor General outlined that it was reasonable for the Department to rely on the legal advice provided about the planning permission.  Following legal advice, a settlement of &euro;1.8 million was agreed and paid by the Department during 2016.  Although we are dealing with 2015 today, I mention this matter because the committee had previously inquired about it.</p> <p>  Turning specifically to the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on contracts for direct provision, I want to outline briefly the reason this system exists.  I also want to give committee members an update on some developments in the system in recent years, in particular since the 2015 report.</p> <p>  Services for all protection applicants, whether living in State-provided accommodation or in commercially-provided accommodation, are delivered under the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal which dates from 2000 when the then health boards, which were responsible for homeless services, found themselves unable to cope with the dramatic increase in the number of people seeking asylum in Ireland.  There are obviously many parallels with the homeless issue that exists now.  By May 2000, some 1,500 applicants were being provided with accommodation and full board by the Government.  Members may recall that, 12 months later, this had increased to 4,200 and by May 2005 it had grown to 7,200.  From 2000 to date, some 60,000 people have been accommodated in direct provision.  Equally, they have been provided with full access to the State&rsquo;s medical and education services.  The system is not perfect by any means and we are continually seeking to improve it.  The reality is that had the State not adopted the direct provision system, there simply would not have been even the most basic shelter available for this group of people who arrived and continue to arrive in our country.</p> <p>  At the start of this year, 4,465 persons were living in this accommodation.  However, I am glad to say - this is a significant change - that, of those, 72% have been there for three years or less since the date of their application.  This compares to 36% who were there for three years or less when the data was compiled for the working group on direct provision and related matters in 2015.  To put it another way, there has been a complete reversal in the length of stay figures since the working group examined the matter.</p> <p>  Full board accommodation in keeping with the policy of nationwide dispersal is offered to residents while their application for protection is being processed.  It is important to note that not every person who seeks international protection in Ireland chooses to accept the offer of full board accommodation and many choose to live with family or friends in communities across the country, as they are entitled to do.  If this system was not in place, already vulnerable people who have sought protection in the State would join the lengthy waiting lists for social housing or enter the private rental market with little hope of finding affordable and secure accommodation.  This is the very situation that obtained which gave rise to the direct provision system being put in place in the first place.  The offer of State-provided accommodation is a guarantee that every person who walks into the international protection office today will, tonight, have a bed, full board and access to medical care.  Moreover, those people's children will have access to our first and second level education system on the same basis as anyone else.</p> <p>  No system is without room for improvement and our challenge is to continually enhance and develop the entire system so that the best possible set of facilities and services can be provided to those in our care.  To that end, we are working to implement the recommendations of the McMahon report.  Some 121 of these recommendations have been implemented, with a further 38 recommendations partially implemented or in progress.  In total, 92% of the 173 recommendations are implemented, partially implemented or in progress.  Recommendations that involve structural changes or improvements will be implemented as quickly as possible, having regard to fire safety, building regulation and planning issues and some others are policy matters for other Departments.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier that good progress is being made in reducing the length of time applicants are in direct provision while having their claims finalised.  What we believe is a further major turning point in addressing the length of time issue is the coming into force of the International Protection Act at the end of last year.  This Act, with its single application procedure at its core, has ended the inefficient sequential Refugee Act 1996 application process with its inherent structural problems.  It brings us into line with the processing arrangements for protection applicants in all other EU member states.  In truth, that process was, by its very nature, a major underlying factor in causing significant delays in deciding cases.  That, in turn, was causing major delays in moving applicants on from direct provision centres, either as recognised refugees or with other forms of permission to live in the State or as applicants which were refused and were no longer permitted to remain in the State.  The clear ambition now with the new Act when it is fully embedded is that we expect cases to be dealt with in finality much sooner.  Indeed, some cases have already been finalised since the beginning of the year.</p> <p>  Arising from the McMahon report and the programme for Government commitments in 2016, a number of physical improvements to accommodation are being implemented, for example, the introduction last January of new home cooking arrangements at the Mosney accommodation centre.  Each family is now able to acquire fresh food so that they can prepare their own meals.  Cooking facilities are being introduced in other centres including the State-owned centres in Killarney, Tralee, Athlone, Knockalisheen in Limerick and Kinsale Road in Cork, and in Ballyhaunis, Millstreet, St. Patrick&rsquo;s in Monaghan and any other centres where families are living.  From 3 April last year, as the Comptroller and Auditor General noted, the remit of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children has been extended to cover those who are living in State-provided accommodation.</p> <p>  The Department has also co-ordinated the preparation of a comprehensive information booklet for persons who have been granted any type of leave to remain in the State.  The booklet contains practical information for residents across housing, finance, health care and education as well as public transport and other related matters and has been prepared with the assistance of the National Adult Literacy Agency to ensure that it is presented in plain English.  The booklet has also been translated into a number of languages.  In addition, a number of NGOs have been awarded grants under the EU asylum, migration and integration fund, specifically to provide assistance to persons who have been granted protection and who are now in a position to move out of State-provided accommodation.  Notwithstanding the current housing crisis, we are working with residents and the NGO community to assist people, when they get permission to remain, to find mainstream housing as soon as possible and ensure that the State-provided accommodation remains available for those in most need.</p> <p>  Direct provision, which has elements common to it in the reception systems in place in other EU member states, has many critics.  Most criticism centres around the inordinate length of time people have remained in it while waiting for their protection claims to be finalised.  As I said, we are addressing that across a number of fronts as we are the other quality of life issues.  There are no cheaper alternatives to direct provision.  We have explored the options in this respect; in fact, they are much more expensive, and in any event, given the critical shortage of housing in the State, they are not realistic.  Nevertheless, we remain open to any workable proposals which would drive down costs while maintaining standards and fulfilling the requirements of public policy of balanced nationwide dispersal, direct provision of accommodation-related services and access to education, health, welfare and so forth on the same basis as the general community.</p></speech>

It has come to my attention since the earlier session that I inadvertently gave incorrect information to the committee about the revision of the statement on internal financial control for Vote 20 - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I said this morning that we raised the requirement for the revision with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that is correct.  That arose from the audit.  I asked that the revision be made when I carried out my detailed review of the audit on 5 September 2016.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provided us with wording for the adjustment on 13 September and at the same time gave us the internal report summary.  We agreed on the wording that should be included in the statement.  The Accounting Officer did sign a revised statement on internal financial control on 16 September.  It was supplied to us and I reviewed it on 23 September 2016.</p><p>We should have changed the date on the statement of internal financial control, as published and also on the audit certificate.  I should have picked up on this myself and I apologise for that oversight.  The circumstances were exceptional and we will be reviewing our finalisation process for appropriation account audits.  I am happy to answer questions in regard to it.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General brought this to my attention at the last moment.  My statement this morning regarding the certificate of internal financial control that is in the published appropriation account was dated 31 March 2016 and that is the date on the document presented to us, signed by N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan.  I took that in good faith as presented, published and printed.  Now the Comptroller and Auditor General has confirmed that it should have picked it up by themselves, and they did; the Garda Accounting Officer did agree a revised statement and did re-sign that statement on 16 September.  That is the date that should have been in the documentation that was presented to us.  I am in an unusual position but what I said this morning based on that date was in good faith on the basis of the dates and the signatures in front of me in the report.  It was not the fault of the Accounting Officer in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but I now realise that the wrong date is in the document and I regret any disturbance or upset caused as a result.  I stress that this was in good faith and on the basis of the document presented to me at that time.  We have clarified a matter which is helpful as a result of this morning's debate.</p></speech>

I accept the unusual circumstances that prevailed that the Comptroller and Auditor General alerted us to.  The difficulty is that this has made national headlines and we may need to go further than correcting the record of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am not sure if statements came from the Chairman in regard to this this morning but that needs to be clarified so that the media organisations also know, not only the ones who are listening here.  All these issues are now tied into the wider matter of the Garda Commissioner and related questions and any of these attract national attention.  That extra step may now be necessary.</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts recognises that there was wrong information before us this morning.  We appreciate the Comptroller and Auditor General's honesty and integrity in coming forward at the first opportunity to correct this morning's record.  He did so very promptly and we acknowledged that he did so at the first available opportunity.  A press statement will go out from his office and our own.</p></speech>

There was some confusion earlier in regard to this.  I appreciate the Chairman's bona fides but one of the reasons I mentioned Standing Order 186 earlier, is that we try not to pre-empt political attacks without having all the facts before us.  There are very serious concerns regarding some aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without adding further, unnecessary attack.</p> <p>  We need to tread carefully in this committee.  I have not seen the headlines to which Deputy Cullinane referred but I accept that there probably are headlines.  There is a lot of attention on this committee.  I am not saying that the Chairman is trying to maximise political capital but in future perhaps there is a way that if there are financial irregularities such as the Chairman mentioned these could be clarified with the Comptroller and Auditor General in advance.  Otherwise we cause unnecessary furore and time wasting when it is not in anybody's interest to do that.</p></speech>

I did issue a cautionary word this morning in regard to this.  These are the most serious issues that have arisen from the report that we discussed last week.  I do not think that we should make statements, as Chairman or otherwise, or even in the media, in regard to this.  There is a process under way and we should give it our full attention.  We do that 99% of the time.  We are here to look at value for money, the history of why it was not picked up sooner, the total mess that was made of it - which we will come back to - and our job is to get the Commissioner and the appropriate witnesses back in here as soon as possible.</p> <p>  The real issue which remains unchanged is that when the report of accounts was produced in March there was no caveat on it.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The reports were produced, they were signed off by the Accounting Officer, who happens to be the Commissioner, and there was no caveat or indication that difficulties had been discovered.  On top of that, the comments in the D&aacute;il from the Taoiseach, do not help.  He referred to this as a legacy issue and he made reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General investigating, neither of which is accurate.  It is difficult and we are trying to avoid that and remain neutral.  We have all made statements but it is different in regard to our job here.  Since his appointment the Chairman has chaired our meetings in an excellent manner.  It would be well for us to learn from what has transpired today because we are heading into troubled waters and we have a serious job to do.</p></speech>

She is completely correct.  I appreciate the correction and clarification and the suggestion of putting it out publicly.  In the terminology I used this morning, this has highlighted how charged this subject matter is and how quickly media outlets and, indeed, ourselves will seize upon issues that are liable to cause headlines.  I know the diligent manner in which members, and also including our witnesses, have approached this up to now, and it is very important to take note of such issues and how quickly the outlets pick up on them.  I saw the article on the RTE website, I did not see it elsewhere but I am sure they were probably there.  Deputy Cullinane's suggestion is welcome given that the media are no longer present because the issues that were of most interest to them have passed.</p> <p>  I want to reiterate one remark by Deputy Connolly about the manner in which the Chairman has chaired these meetings.  He has been excellent and beyond reproach.  I appreciate comments made by other members in this morning's session about the misunderstanding which derived from the particular publication of a document and the statement by the Comptroller and Auditor General that no date change was requested.  We now know where we are and that is the most important thing.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact they have been given a clear audit opinion for 2015, with a number of highlighted items, which I would like to briefly touch upon.</p><p>In one particular instance in Mr. Waters's opening statement, he said the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined that it was unreasonable for the Department to rely on the legal advice provided on the purchase of a property on Wolfe Tone Street, Dublin 1.  I appreciate Mr. Waters's earlier remarks that the matter has been subject to   Comptroller and Auditor General reports in the past and is now broadly settled with the exception of the planning permission issue.  It is mentioned that assurances were provided by the vendor.  In the due diligence, which any person would complete, did Mr. Waters seek in-house or external advice on the purchase of the property?  Will he outline to the committee when the planning permission issues will be resolved or have they have been resolved in terms of the occupation and use of the property?  </p><p> On foot of the response to that question, is there any possibility of come-back on the basis of flawed advice which, effectively, have resulted in a very significant sum of money being paid by the taxpayer to resolve the matter?</p></speech>

As Accounting Officer for the Department, I greatly regret that.  I greatly regret that public funds have been used in that manner.  As I said in my statement, this has a long history.  Ultimately when the Department and the Probation Service engaged on this, they relied on legal advice and the advice of the Chief State Solicitor who indicated it was in order to sign the lease on the basis the planning permission was in order.  At the time, the Comptroller indicated it was in order for us, that we were entitled to rely on that advice and we did.  The process by which advice is given in these cases is that the vendor or leaseholder warrants that the planning is in order which he did in that particular instance.  As far as we were concerned the planning was in order.  We went to refurbish the property and we spent about &euro;1.9 million doing that.  At that point, some of the local people objected as they are entitled to.  They notified the Dublin City Council planning office which in turn served us with an order to say we could not proceed.  The actions followed from that.  Ultimately we found ourselves in a situation in which we had a property with a 25-year lease period with a break period after ten years and an annual rent in the order of &euro;300,000 which we could not use because of what happened.  My predecessor decided at that point we should cease paying the rent because the State was already subject to expenditure which was nugatory.  He also decided on foot of legal advice to seek to bring the leaseholder and the planning architect to account for having made a mis-statement.  That process went ahead and ultimately it led to a situation in which our legal advice was that if it had gone to a full court hearing, we would have lost.  I cannot entirely give our legal strategy here.  We were left with a situation in which we could risk further taxpayer money going to court or get out of it.</p></speech>

Our best estimate was to walk away from it.  It is quite counter-intuitive.  I came into this on my appointment about two and a half or three years ago.  I found it incredible because we had done nothing wrong as a State organisation and the other side had clearly done something.  It is a matter of legal opinion about whether or not it was a mis-statement but we found ourselves on the wrong side of this, which was completely counter-intuitive.  My initial reaction was to ask if we could find an alternative use.  At that point, I looked within the organisation to see if we could find some other body within the organisation that would take up the accommodation.  Ultimately, it did not come to anything.  We had a number of new bodies about to be established but it did not suit for one reason or another.</p></speech>

The arrangements we entered into are allowed for and we were fully compliant in ensuring we were transparent about it.  They related to a number of different areas involving specialist knowledge, urgency or security considerations.  An example that is very much in the news is the commission for the location of victims' remains.  There was quite a significant amount spent in respect of it.  It is very specialised work, which involves people seeking a particular type of equipment or travelling abroad.  It would not be readily available on the open market.  The amount for the year was almost &euro;700,000.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Mr. Waters contended that the Department is compliant with EU guidance on such matters but it is clearly not compliant with the OGP.  Given that the OGP was, I think, established in 2014 - please correct me if I am wrong - I appreciate that there may have been rules that the Department is getting used to adhering to, but in the context of this budgetary year, 2015, and-or any other budgetary year, it has had knowledge of the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment for some time.  Has it put in place measures to comply in so far as possible with procurement rules as applied to those 22 private service providers?</p></speech>

We continue to work with the OGP with a view to having a completely open and transparent procurement arrangement and we have ambitions in that respect.  We hope to be able to make some progress on it this year but our colleagues in the OGP have indicated to us, and we accept, that the particular model we use is such that it is very difficult to devise an open tendering competition that will deliver the service that we need.  That is the nature of direct provision.  It is demand-led.  It can fluctuate dramatically in a matter of months and go down to very low levels.  That is one aspect of it and another, which people generally do not mention in respect of direct provision, is that Government policy is also dispersive, with a balanced dispersal around the country.  From the word go, the Government wanted to ensure that every community in the country got its fair share of asylum seekers balanced in accordance with the medical facilities, general practitioners, education and all the local services available.  Our job at the time was to ensure we gave effect to that while at the same time dealing with a humanitarian crisis.</p></speech>

In terms of the remit of the Committee on Public Accounts, however, does Mr. Waters believe in the long term that continuing to invest in private service providers gives value for taxpayers&rsquo; money or should we provide such facilities directly, given that there was a 130% increase in the number of asylum seekers in 2015?  Over a long period, would that net a reduction in the overall expenditure?</p></speech>

I have some knowledge of this from my time in charge of this area at the start.  The Government decided then that we should have a balanced mix of options, commercial owners such as we have, hotels, hostels, guest houses and State-acquired accommodation.  We were quite successful in acquiring State accommodation at the start of the process but we ran into difficulties almost immediately once we started to move people into provincial Ireland where we had ten properties.  This featured at this committee in the mid-2000s, where it was not possible for us to place asylum seekers because we ran into very serious difficulties with communities.</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point about the numbers of people coming into Europe which impacts on Ireland, but there is no guarantee that they would be needed in ten, 15 or 20 years' time.  Our colleagues in The Netherlands found themselves in that exact situation.  They had acquired significant numbers of properties for the state and found five years ago that they had to offload approximately 15,000 spaces onto the market.  That demonstrates the difficulties.  We are committed as best we can to having an open tendering competition and we remain in close liaison with the OGP with a view to ensuring that.</p></speech>

The daily rate per person is of the order of &euro;30.  Two years ago, it was a little higher at &euro;31 or touching &euro;32.  It varies according to the nature of the services provided in different centres.  I am talking about an overall rate.  It has come back a little.  Conversely, in the State sector, where we have a full procurement exercise and we have gone to the market and have just completed the exercise, the rate has increased from &euro;15 per person per day to &euro;20 per person per day.  The effect of going to an open tendering competition has been to increase the cost to the State.  There are, however, other issues around ensuring that this is a completely transparent process.</p></speech>

There is entitlement to health benefits as if the person had a medical card and certain other things.  These people would be missing out on all those aspects.

I do not need to ask that question.  I know the answer.  I appreciate that there is no intermediate position.  Clearly, that is not satisfactory.  I struggle to see how that is the Department's problem, given that the legislation was drafted by this House.  I served on the committee that wrote it.  At the same time, it is a very difficult position from a compassionate perspective.  It is very troubling that we are talking about another year and a half, at least, before this matter is resolved.

Up to now, we were waiting for the assisted decision-making legislation.  Quite a few private individuals had their relatives made wards of court so that their cases could be processed in that way.  Nearly all the 90 women are in forms of sheltered accommodation like nursing homes.  We are going to approach the authorities in the nursing homes to see whether they might be willing to take on this role by making ward of court applications.  I hope progress can be made in this way by the end of the year.  When the assisted decision-making legislation kicks in, it will take over.</p></speech>

My final question to the Department relates to payroll overpayments, which is a common issue in my experience.  There is clearly a discrepancy between the number of payments that have been made and the number of recovery plans, full repayments or both that have been made.  Can the witnesses highlight to the committee the reason for that?  Given the reduction in the number of personnel in the Department in the period in question, what is being done to minimise the overall number of incorrect payments that are being made?  Could the witnesses outline briefly any particular rationale or reason for those overpayments in the first instance?</p></speech>

The new sick leave scheme for the public service, which began in 2014, halved the amount of sick leave people can take.  It was a considerable reduction.  Every time somebody goes over that limit, every absence thereafter is without pay.  That kicks in earlier.  That is one of the elements of it.  As payrolls across the Civil Service are generally processed in advance, changes cannot be made at short notice.  That means we are automatically in arrears when these limits are exceeded.</p></speech>

Issues arose when this was bedding in at the same time.  That gave rise to the increase in overpayments.  There was a substantial reduction of 16% in overpayments during 2014.  We are still working on it to get it down further.  Various options are available to employees who have overpayment situations.  We have to bear in mind that there are hardship cases.  People have housing and mortgage issues, etc., as a result of the downturn in the economy.  When the hardship option has to be applied, it is applied with sensitivity from the human resources side.</p></speech>

Various options are available to people as they go through the process.  After someone has made a case to PeoplePoint, the matter goes to the human resources side to check whether he or she has a serious illness, for example.  Obviously, a different approach is taken if he or she has a terminal illness.  Differing approaches are taken depending on the person's age and the amount of the overpayment.  In the case of an employee who has 30 years of service ahead of him or her, a certain approach might be taken in the case of a small overpayment.  The actual plan is only deemed to be in place at the end of the process of putting a plan in place.</p></speech>

It is a matter of great frustration for us, as the heads of our organisations, that we are unable to get to the bottom of this to drive it down to the point where the State is not left in this situation.  The work is ongoing.  We are not giving up on it.  It is proving particularly difficult to get to the bottom of it by reaching a point at which the numbers are what we would consider to be acceptable.  I assure the Deputy that there is no lack of energy in our attempts to tackle the problem.</p></speech>

Everything follows on from that.</p> <p>  In a wider sense, if I go back a little bit, the Minister for Justice and Equality of the day is the person responsible person for delivering the resource allocation for the entire justice Vote.  That includes the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Prison Service, the Courts Service, the Department itself and all the agencies of the Department.  That is negotiated in the Estimates process.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is responsible to Parliament.  That is a key issue for the Department in supporting the Minister of the day in negotiating that budget for the Garda and all the other bodies.</p> <p>  The up-to-date position on oversight and accountability is that the Policing Authority was established at the beginning of last year, 1 January 2016.  The Policing Authority is an independent body and its role is to provide oversight of the provision of policing services in Ireland by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is independent of Government and reports to the Minister on its role.  When the legislation to establish a Policing Authority was being considered, the Government and the Department sought legal advice on how far it could go in giving the accountability function for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Policing Authority.  It was deemed at that time that policing was a core function of the State and in those circumstances the Minister continued to remain accountable in the sense of political accountability for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to Parliament.  In respect of financial accountability, the Accounting Officer is clearly delineated to the Commissioner.</p></speech>

I am not asking Mr. Waters to account for that person.  There is a strong possibility it was wrong and there is certainly an allegation it was wrong.

References were made by a Mr. John Barrett, who is the executive director of human resources, that many of the accounts that were signed off were potentially compromised.  If I were sitting in the witness's position, I would be looking at the possibility of compromised accounts that were signed off on, with money transferred from accounts managed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a time when one of Mr. Waters's predecessors was an Accounting Officer.  There is the potential for irregularities so I would be looking at taking some sort of action; I am wondering what sort of action did Mr. Waters take.</p></speech>

It is from a letter sent to Mr. Niall Kelly, who is head of internal audit, dated 12 October 2016.  It states:</p><blockquote>I am particularly concerned about how this matter was deliberately and systematically kept outside the purview of the statutory audit committee?  How it came to pass that reports specifically prepared on the financial arrangements in the Garda college were not shared with either you or the audit committee?  The open and essential question is how the annual returns made to the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Finance, signed off on by the Accounting Officer over all the years since the 2005 Act made no reference to millions of euro held in these unauthorised accounts</blockquote> <p>One could argue it pertained to the time prior to the 2005 Act as well.

If, following the appropriate inquiry, any of this emerges as the true position - I am not doubting anybody's <i>bona fides</i>on this - I would of course be concerned.  That applies if any issues arose giving rise to a completely inappropriate management of public finances and taxpayers' money.  Of course I would be concerned.

He said it should have happened in 2006, if my memory is correct.</p></speech>

Why was that not established?  Why has the Department not asked internal audit for a breakdown on that?  What was the Department doing and what was the look-back exercise seeking to achieve?  What years was it covering?  The witnesses read the report and know many of the issues go back an awful long time.  They involve multiple bank accounts, leasing of land, money shifting from different accounts and, potentially, money that is spent inappropriately.  Some of this goes to a period when Mr. Waters's predecessor was the Accounting Officer.  The 2006 report was one of the first flags and I am asking why the Department did not follow up with internal audit on the period being examined by the report.</p></speech>

It is very important for us to get a sense of where people who have responsible positions in the public service sit on all these issues.  While the Department is no longer the Accounting Officer, obviously there is still a relationship between it and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Given the gravity of the issues raised in the report, the strong inferences from some of the civilians in management positions that information was concealed, that reports were not given to audit committees or to the Comptroller and Auditor General and that information was not acted on or was withheld from interested parties, including the Department, I ask Mr. Waters to give us his views on all that.</p></speech>

I would welcome that.  That is a major development as far as I am concerned.  Whatever needs to be done on foot of that will be done in respect of the Department.  There is one point that I need to make here.  The Department is not a back seat driver of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Department did not run Templemore training centre.  It is important to note that we were not involved in the nitty-gritty details of what was going on in Templemore at that stage, no more than we were in terms of any other part of the Garda estate or apparatus.  We were not involved in that.</p></speech>

I established, at the beginning of my questioning, the relationship between the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We established that prior to 2005 the chief Accounting Officer for the spending of money by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including by the Garda training college, was Mr. Water's predecessor.  That is the issue and my questions were framed in that context.  This is not about the Department micro-managing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is about processes and financial controls which seem to have failed.  They seemed to have failed not only on the watch of the current Garda Commissioner and her predecessors, but also on the watch of the Department.</p></speech>

To carry on with the car analogy, I appreciate that the Department is not a back seat driver but it is our job to make sure that the Department makes sure that the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda management are passing their NCT every year but from what we are reading, they are not.</p> <p>  I am going to ask a series of questions and would appreciate if the witnesses would indicate in their answers whether they are speaking on behalf of the Department or in a personal capacity, that is, on the back of departmental or personal knowledge because there is a difference.  I understand that the witnesses have not been in the Department forever and they cannot know everything.  That is impossible because they have only been in their current roles for a limited period.  However, I ask them to distinguish between departmental knowledge and their own knowledge and to specify when they need to find out more information.  </p> <p>  We had a very long engagement last week and a lot of questions were raised.  Regarding the financial reports from 2006, 2008 and 2010, are the witnesses saying that the Department had no knowledge whatsoever of their existence?  What level of knowledge did the Department have of the existence of all three reports?</p></speech>

In respect of 2008, in the course of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na preparing for the meeting of the committee, it found a document on file that indicated that the then Commissioner, Mr. Fachtna Murphy, spoke briefly to the then Secretary General some time in June 2008 about issues in the Garda training centre.

I have said before that for me and the public it is incredible the Department was not aware of the issues going back further.  The Commissioner, to be fair to her, on numerous occasions stated that she believes the Department was aware.  She said, "To clarify, it is clear that the Department had knowledge going back to 1988, though I am not sure of the exact date."  To be fair to her, I do not think she could be sure.  She continued, "There were indications, prior to the Commissioner becoming Accounting Officer, that the Department had an involvement in the structure put in place for a funding model for the Garda College."  She also makes reference to 2008 and that there was a meeting with the Secretary General.  For me, given that and what we have established through the other questions, it astounds me there was not knowledge in the Department about these issues.  It also astounds me there was no knowledge of this.  It is, frankly, incredible there was no knowledge.  When the Secretary General became aware of these issues in 2015, what did he do?  I presume he acted with great haste.</p></speech>

That committee's main purpose was to try to resolve the legal issues that had arisen in relation to the Sportsfield Company and the ownership or leasehold of the land that the golf club was on, and also to address and resolve a number of other issues that had come to the fore in relation to accounts, including investment accounts.

Since 12 April, what has Mr. Waters done about the issues that have been raised?  What actions has he taken?  I presume, straight after 12 April or even straight after last week the Department went into action mode and made big decisions and went to find out what the hell was going on.

He is subject to quick-fire questioning.  The main focus of my questions today is on direct provision, which is the main item on the committee's agenda today.  Deputy Farrell touched on some issues earlier.</p> <p>  I appreciate where Mr. Waters is coming from when he said the Department is not a back-seat driver.  From the perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts and the public in general I will use the analogy that they do not want to see the Department as the driver of an uninsured vehicle.  When one thinks of it in those terms it is quite a strong metaphor and that is the reason the Committee of Public Accounts is taking this line of questioning today, in particular bearing in mind last week.</p></speech>

The authority has written to the T&aacute;naiste since to say that given that a lot of the recommendations are due to be implemented by the Commissioner by July, the authority's view is that a report by the end of July would be more appropriate and the T&aacute;naiste is satisfied with that.  So we expect the report to come towards the end of July or maybe early August.</p></speech>

I appreciate all the witnesses' bona fides in that regard.  Could the Department do anything further on this matter that is not being done at present to allay the public's concerns?  As the witnesses will appreciate, we are under pressure to represent the public at large who want to have confidence in the Garda.  To use the analogy again, the Department is neither the driver nor the back-seat passenger.  What can we do to ensure this does not arise again?</p></speech>

We need to get that process.  As the Deputy knows, it is under way and we are getting the first report in July.  Listening to the conversations here this morning, if this committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General were to examine this by whatever means that would be a useful exercise as well.</p></speech>

It was agreed back in 2011 or 2012 that it would be a good idea to merge the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority into one body, called Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  That is essentially why we have it.  Given that we have the Property Registration Authority which is the bigger of the organisations and which, as the Deputy knows, is involved in anything to do with property, it was believed by Government that the other two organisations would come to us and that we would effect the merger of the three organisations.

That is the second strand.  We are now working our way through that with bringing people here from Greece to Ireland.</p></speech>

There are two strands to deportation as practised.  The first strand are people who, for example, arrive in Ireland off a flight today at Dublin Airport who do not have the appropriate documentation and who are refused leave to land and returned.  This happens pretty much immediately.  In some cases, depending on the flights, it may be the following day.  Last year, approximately 4,000 people who attempted to enter the State were returned on this basis.  Primarily the great majority of them were on the basis of fraudulent documents.

I raised the issue on the floor of the House on 9 February during Leaders' Questions with the T&aacute;naiste who said, in a very dismissive fashion, that the report had been sent to the Committee on Justice and Equality and the Committee of Public Accounts and that it had received full scrutiny.  I did not challenge the T&aacute;naiste on that but when back in my office I checked and found there was no evidence that this was the case.  I e-mailed the Department of Justice and Equality and drew attention to the fact that the information I had been given was incorrect.  I had written to the Committee of Public Accounts seeking this matter to be timetabled and for the report to be provided to the Committee of Public Accounts at that stage.  This was in early February.  I accept that this was a draft report until February because it was February when it became an interim report and ceased to be a draft.  Was Mr. Waters aware of that?  Somebody must have replied to me because the reply said that there was an error and it was not the Committee on Justice and Equality that dealt with this issue but that it was the Committee on Public Accounts that dealt with it.  I then had to take it up with the T&aacute;naiste because the only reference to the Committee of Public Accounts and this issue was my notification to the Committee of Public Accounts seeking the publication of this report.

I was sent the draft audit report by the head of internal audit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in September 2016.  It was sent to me to fact check and to see if there was any reference to the Department that we might want to question or query.  In his letter to me the head of internal audit requested that I treat the contents of the draft report as confidential and not divulge in any way the extract of the report that had been sent to me.  He said that consent was given for the disclosure of the extract of the report to our legal professional adviser.  Most of this is irrelevant as I was not named in the report, but at that stage the report was in draft and it was my understanding that he had equally sent it to everybody else who was named in the report asking them to check and to make sure they were happy and to consult any advisers that they wanted to consult.  The report was still in that process until it became the completed report in March 2017.  It is not about the fact that the report did not change much between coming to us in September 2016 and what it finally looked like.  During that period it was out with all the parties that were named in it so they could go back to the internal auditor and for him to then finalise his report on the basis of the observations he received.  It was not open to the T&aacute;naiste to publish the report.   It was not her report in the first instance and it was still in process at that point.</p></speech>

I will move on.</p> <p>  With regard to the negotiation of procurement procedures for the commercially owned and run direct provision centres, the Comptroller and Auditor General said in his report this morning that use of that procedure is only permitted in certain limited circumstances which we could not see existed in regard to direct provision.  Why was it presumed that it would be appropriate in that particular context?</p></speech>

We had looked at all the other options.  We started out on the basis that when people arrived into the State, they were given supplementary welfare, accommodation and apartments and that very soon we had reached a crisis situation, which is not dissimilar to what we have at the moment.  More people had been encouraged to come in and we found ourselves in a situation where people who had arrived to Ireland as protection applicants were living homeless in Merrion Square and the Phoenix Park.  The Government decided to introduce a system of direct provision and dispersal.  It also decided that when this happened there would be a mix of accommodation options comprising commercially run centres, State-owned accommodation and what were then known as flotels.  The floating hotels were not sustainable and did not become an option.  We went about giving effect to that Government decision and we managed to acquire some State properties but we ran into serious difficulties with other provision.  The commercial sector, effectively, took up the slack in dealing with that.</p></speech>

We want, if it is feasible, to be able to get to a more open tender situation as quickly as possible.  We want to do that but as I indicated earlier, the irony is that when we did that in respect of the State sector, it ended up actually costing more than in the commercial sector.  However, that is no reason, as far as we are concerned, not to put this out to the market.  We are engaged with the Office of Government Procurement to try to get that done.  It is very difficult because it is not a question of just procuring accommodation, but also of procuring services in local communities all over the country and trying to establish a marking system that will take that into account and not favour one group of people over another.  It is a serious difficulty.</p></speech>

Clinics were then set up as a control measure in terms of seeing what the standards were like.  Very vulnerable people were asked for information which they may well have perceived, rightly or wrongly, that it would not have been to their advantage to give.  Has the Department done anything about the provision of penalties for underperformance by suppliers?  If so, I ask Mr. Waters to provide details.</p></speech>

A centre with 300 people, for example, could end up losing &euro;3,000 if it does not perform to the measures set down which could relate to food, the cleanliness of rooms, the provision of other services and so forth.  There are clear performance measures in place which contractors are obliged to adhere to, which is a new development.</p></speech>

People can make a complaint to the Ombudsman and if that office decides to take up the complaint, the process involved can be quite lengthy and sometimes the office does not take cases on.  Was there a beefing up of the offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to ensure that there would be sufficient capacity to deal with complaints from direct provision centres?</p></speech>

I am assuming, on that basis, that they had their own internal resources to enable them to take on the additional workload that would go with that.</p></speech>

As a country we have been criticised repeatedly about direct provision in the context of human rights.  We can always do things more cheaply.  However, we must look at things in the round.  We must balance the cost of direct provision against meeting our human rights obligations.  Where does that come into the equation?</p></speech>

That is the balance we are trying to strike in respect of the process that we have in place at the moment, the negotiated procedure versus ensuring that we get appropriate value for money for the taxpayer.  We could put a contract out for tender and look for a facility for a few hundred people.  Let us imagine that a facility exists already in Skibbereen but a bidder in Bandon comes back with a lower price who can meet all of the service level requirements.  In that situation, we would be uprooting hundreds of people from their home in one town to bring them to another town.  We must consider all of the trauma and issues that go with that, in terms of access to housing, health services and so forth.  We do not do that and that is why we have found it so difficult to find a tendering process that meets our needs so that we can continue to act in a humanitarian way.  We have no interest whatsoever in uprooting families and people from their homes just for the sake of moving them on to another town up the road.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Mr. Waters makes reference to the sizeable number of people in direct provision who should be moving on but cannot do so because housing and other services are not available to them.  Is the Department dealing with that issue?  Is this coming out of the Department's Vote?  Direct provision was originally intended to be short term and this is prolonging something that is already overly long.  I know that the time spent in direct provision has been reduced but it is still overly long.  Is the Department engaging with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on this issue?  Is the Department of Justice and Equality picking up a cost that should be picked up by another Department?</p></speech>

We have found ourselves in a situation where approximately 640 people are in direct provision centres who are entitled, in law, to be in Ireland.  They have the Minister's permission to be here but they remain in direct provision because they are not in a position to access housing.  Our Department is picking up the costs associated with that.  Again, to go back to the humanitarian point, other European countries might force people to leave State-provided accommodation in those circumstances but we do not do that.  We think that would be completely wrong to put people who have gone through the process and ended up being recognised as refugees or granted leave to remain, out on their ear.  We do not do that to individuals or to children and families.  We are meeting the costs in that regard.</p> <p>  I will  ask my colleagues to give the committee a sense of our engagement with NGOs and other Departments to try to expedite the process of moving people on.</p></speech>

As people in State-provided accommodation get status, they are linked up, as far as possible, with the local authority and any local housing agency to see if they are eligible for the HAP scheme or to receive rent allowance.  The managers in most of our direct provision centres will provide references if necessary.  The NGO community has been given funding under the Asylum, Migration, and Integration Fund, AMIF, programme to assist people to move out of State-provided accommodation into permanent homes.</p><p>All of that happens organically on the ground daily.</p></speech>

The explanation given for that underspend was that fewer new applications were received in 2015 than was expected.  A number of applications could not be processed as further investigation was necessary in order to make a determination in those cases.  In some cases there is a shortage of information.  I am working with one individual who is very dissatisfied that she is not being believed at this point, because there are no records that back up where she was.  She spend four or five years in a Magdalen laundry but she was told that she spent six months there.  She has spent her whole life in institutional care.  Are there many other cases in which there is that kind of dispute about where people were and where people will not accept what they feel is not truthful?  Are there cases where people who have been denied justice for their whole lives feel that the lack of records sides with the institutions rather than with the individual?</p></speech>

When we started off in this, we were concerned that while some of the institutions have good, comprehensive records, some have no records at all.  In practice, we have built up a certain level of expertise within the Department.  We do not rely on institutional records alone.  We check out school records, social welfare records and tax records to see whether somebody was active.  There are very few cases of disputes about whether a person was in an institution.  If a person was in an institution with records, and the record shows that a person went in and went out, we tend to rely on those records, but we double-check that against other evidence.  This would include whether the person was making social payments, which suggest he or she was working, and whether there is a record of the person in another institution - for example, he or she might have been in hospital.  Therefore, it is quite rare that somebody would be concerned about not being paid because of a lack of records.  Normally the dispute centres around a person having been in an institution which that person regards as a Magdalen laundry, but which is not one covered by the scheme.</p></speech>

That is what I read at least - that he said that this money was Templemore's, that it was not getting enough from the Government and that it could invest the money.

Those were the main issues that came to light at that point.  The immediate focus of the steering group - the committee that was set up by the Commissioner - was to address those issues while at the same time causing an internal audit to be conducted that would get to the bottom of all the other issues and identify whether there was any fraud or irregularity.  During the period that that committee was sitting and before the draft internal audit report was produced, the work that that committee was overseeing was around resolving the legal issues with the Sportsfield company, closing down the accounts, and using up or getting rid of the resources that were sitting in the investment accounts.  It was aimed at addressing the issues that still existed at that point in time while awaiting the internal audit report.</p></speech>

It is a very challenging issue, not just for the Department and agencies but in respect of attitudes in society.  We need to have a debate on it because everybody expresses outrage when they see the body of a dead child but, when people look for the provision of services, the outcry is "not here".  People are outraged by images on Facebook but when faced with the reality of helping people there is a different reaction.  A debate is needed, in a committee such as this and in wider society.  These debates have happened in my own county of Meath over many years, with Mosney one of the largest centres.  I have many happy memories of the area as a holiday camp as a child when cousins from Dublin would come out to see the country and breath the country air.</p></speech>

I doubt if the experiences of people there today are as happy.  The Department is faced with a difficult situation with the concept of the facility and the experiences of people within it.  It has been the subject of much commentary nationally and locally, in the Drogheda Independent, the Meath Chronicle or LMFM.  The centre looks well on a sunny day at the height of the holiday season but it is a different place in November and December.  The vastness of the area on a cold day can resemble other types of camps.  It has been described as a prison without the armed guards and the barbed wire.</p> <p>   On the issue of operators, the point has been made that it is a big business and it has also been the subject of a lot of commentary.  In his opening statement, Mr. Waters said there were no cheaper alternatives to direct provision.  He said that, in the open market, tenders came in with higher prices.  I want to explore that.</p><p>Obviously, Mosney is commercially owned.  Mr. McCluskey owns it.  I served on the board of Meath Tourism with him.  However, in terms of the profits being generated, can Mr. Waters explain the terms used when the Department is analysing the prices paid for a facility such as Mosney at the get-go?</p></speech>

It has to take into account the provision of food, light, heat, clothing, rates, water, television licences and the entire range of facilities available in any home.  All the families in Mosney effectively have their own front door, if I can use that phrase.  All the services provided to that home are paid for by the State through the payments to the companies in question.</p></speech>

Is it a fair price in the view of Mr. Banks?  The report from the Department states that - because this is some years later - cooking facilities are now being provided for residents in Mosney.</p></speech>

A 2010 study on value for money was carried out.  It identified that, on the basis of what was being delivered at the time, the services represented good value for money.  It was very difficult from that report to identify another model that would represent the same degree of value for money in delivering the services.</p></speech>

However, the Comptroller and Auditor General makes the point that, because there was no competitive procurement process, the risk of the best price and quality accommodation and services not being obtained was increased.  That point was made in terms of the Department making that adjudication.</p></speech>

We mentioned this earlier.  The rates per person per day are remarkably similar to what they were five or six years ago.  This year, they are a little lower than they were last year.  The rate is approximately &euro;30 per person per day.  Some years ago, the rate was &euro;32 per person per day.  The rate paid in the State-owned sector, that is to say, where accommodation is provided by the State, at the moment is &euro;20 per person per day.  There is no capital cost on the contractors.  It is provided directly by the State.  On foot of a procurement exercise, that increased from approximately &euro;15 to &euro;20 per person per day.  In the round, we are getting good value.</p> <p>  It is difficult to measure this when we do not have direct comparators.  The nearest comparator we have is what is being paid, as we understand it, in respect of emergency accommodation in the Dublin area for homeless people in hotels.  The most recent figures I saw suggested that something of the order of &euro;50 million was paid last year to provide accommodation for approximately 900 families, of which 700 were in hotels and the remaining number were in different, mixed accommodation.  That is the nearest equivalent.  Apparently, that worked out at approximately &euro;55,000 per family per year.  Our metrics show that we pay approximately &euro;12,000 per person per year.</p></speech>

Even though what is being provided by the city council is not still acceptable, the point is that people can walk out their doors and access facilities in the city centre.  People in Mosney are a long way from accessing any type of facilities for their day-to-day lives.  Last year, the State paid &euro;43.5 million to eight direct provision operators.  Mosney was one of the biggest, and received &euro;7 million.  The point is that it is big business.  I note the point made by Mr. Waters in terms of what was spent in Dublin as well.</p> <p>  Another point was touched on in terms of the low level of complaints.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to that as well.  Does Mr. Waters believe there is a problem in this regard?  I know a lady in the camp in Mosney, Ms Khumalo, who is a former sportsperson of the year from Zimbabwe.  She is living with her ten year old daughter, Ivana, in a small house in Mosney.  She said that when she got there, she did not really care where she stayed.  She simply wanted safety and that direct provision did not define who she was.  She also said that it defines the Irish protection system towards asylum seekers and how it perceives the people as economic migrants, of second-class nationality and opportunists.  She did not want to give out.  She had positive energy towards bettering her life, rather than complaining about the direct provision system and possibly transforming and developing her life.  She is beginning a course in legal studies at Drogheda Institute of Further Education.  I know people in the Louth Meath Education and Training Board are dealing with the education facilities.  How much is being invested in the educational facilities aspect?  I know this is of interest to people in my constituency.</p></speech>

That was the subject of the Irish Refugees Council report on children in direct provision relating to decent child care facilities and so forth.  What is the situation?</p></speech>

In particular, there is a child care facility in Mosney.  It is provided through a combination of the centre and charitable institutions.</p> <p>  I wish to make another point in respect of the remoteness of Mosney.  Where a centre is outside an urban area, the contractor is obliged to provide transport to meet the reasonable needs of residents.</p></speech>

I am only teasing it out.  Mosney has become a long-term centre.  Has it been analysed in terms of alternatives?</p> <p>  That leads me onto my next point.  We are all well aware of the difficulties in accessing accommodation.  What is the Department's role in terms of this issue, the Rebuilding Ireland programme and the contribution of the Department to that programme?  Is the Department dealing with this issue as well?</p> <p>  Earlier, Mr. Waters indicated that the Netherlands has purchased a lot of property.  Mr. Waters indicated that the Department is not keen to go down that route on the basis that if it obtained property, it would somehow be a wrong move to commit to that process.</p></speech>

That has actually happened.  Other considerations arise as well.  We tried that at the outset.  We acquired several hotels throughout the country.  We found that local communities were not accepting of it.  Some launched judicial reviews.  In one or two places, they blocked us using the facilities.  We found that this was not going to be a successful outcome so we moved away from it.</p></speech>

Obviously, this transcends to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in terms of the debates with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy English.  How is the Department of Justice and Equality dealing with this?  Is it sharing its strategy?  Is the Department making the point that it does not want to go down that route because of the fear of long-term accommodation in communities?  Is that a philosophy the Department is sharing with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government?</p></speech>

Clearly it would require substantial public expenditure.  The envelope available to the Department is limited.  We also have our own priorities.  For example, a big priority for us in the next couple of years, reflecting the views of Oireachtas Members, is to ensure we will have a new forensic science laboratory.  It will be a very expensive project.  We have to measure it against the available funding from the Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  If anyone can come up with a better model, we are quite open to considering it.</p> <p>  I wish to make one other point.  We expect to be in a position fairly soon where people who apply for asylum will have their applications dealt with within a period of perhaps nine to 12 months.  In the European model, if someone does not have status within nine months in particular cases and he or she has co-operated with the system, he or she will be given limited rights to work.  Whether we would wish to do that will be a decision for the Government at some point, if we get to it, but it is important to demonstrate to the committee that our minds are not closed in examining the options.</p></speech>

I am just trying to get a sense of the real long-term policy.  On the one hand, the Department is ruling out actual integration, but, on the other, it seems to have been scared off the process of acquiring buildings for fear of threats in local communities.  That is why I prefaced my remarks.  As a society, are we not moving into that space?  We saw what happened in Ballaghaderreen and elsewhere.  Is that it?  Are we moving away and saying there are no other options?  On what is happening in the camp in Mosney, obviously improvements have been made, but, knowing the standard of facilities there, was it humane from the get-go?</p></speech>

However, it has been improved and we are working to improve all facilities.  One of the key issues which was referenced in the McMahon report is that people need independence in their lives.  One of the best means of ensuring independence is providing the opportunity to cook for oneself.  We already have this opportunity in Mosney and are working with other centres to ensure it will be implemented as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It cites the opening of a bank account named Garda Student Sport with the Bank of Ireland which opened in 2015, and it was opened without consent.  For the auditor to arrive at that conclusion he or she presumably had to go through a process of verification.  I assume, on the basis of simple reason, that part of that process must have been to check with the Department of Justice and Equality.  Did he check with the Department?</p></speech>

We accept that these are established matters of fact in this report.  I would appreciate if the witness could come back with the facts on this situation.</p> <p>  Section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 obliges the Commissioner to inform the Minister and the Secretary General of the Department in a whole range of different categories.  These are not optional.  One of those is in circumstances where there is evidence that matters might bring the reputation of the force into disrepute.

She specifically raised questions about the opening of bank accounts.  The final paragraph on page 20 of the internal audit report, which is up on the screen, states:</p><blockquote>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Sportsfield Company Ltd continued to operate with Garda College Management as Directors.  The legal standing of the actions of these directors since 2005 is questionable.  Even in the period prior to 2005 it is questionable whether Garda&iacute; as public servants should have been acting as Directors of what was set up as a private company without being appointed by or having the expressed permission of the Minister for Justice ... no evidence was found of any Garda&iacute; having received permission from the Minister to act as a director.</blockquote> <p>To Mr. Waters's knowledge, did the Department receive requests from any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to become a director of these companies?  If so, was permission granted?</p></speech>

Back to 1992 and the late 1980s, there would have been many paper records and there is a registry with Kardex cards and so forth.  We checked the registry to see whether there were any registered files that referenced this kind of matter and there are not.  Audit files are not retained in that form.  Audit up to the noughties was not as professionalised and detailed as it has since developed into.</p></speech>

My understanding is, because there was confusion when he was having an exchange of views with the Deputy, that the Garda Commissioner became aware of the alleged financial irregularities and the issues that arose from the audit report at a meeting with Mr. John Barrett.  There is some disagreement as to whether it was a five-minute meeting or a two-hour meeting but she was certainly briefed.  Following that, she was given legal advice.

Deputy Connolly spoke about the question of how some of these centres were run and the level of curtailment of the rights of some people who were residents in these centres.  In 2009, when I was a local councillor in Waterford, I received correspondence from a residents association which was set up in one of these reception centres.  They asked me to come and meet them in the centre, which I did but I was refused permission to meet them on the campus because I was told that it was a private company and I had to be given permission.  I was not aware of that and I asked for an alternative date but was not given one.  I asked why I was being refused permission and was told because it was a private company and it did not have to give permission.  I was not comfortable with that and the residents wanted the meeting on site in the place they lived.  They had issues in regard to how the centre was managed.  I was then asked to leave and ultimately barred from the premises.  Garda&iacute; were called although they never arrived.  I have heard the description being used a few times that these centres were being run like prisons.  It struck me that was how I was treated as a public representative, if that was my experience when all I wanted to do was to have a meeting with residents, how then were people living in the centre treated when we were not there?  There was a view that some of these centres were being run on the lines of "out of sight, out of mind".  Given my experience as a local councillor and how I was treated, being told by a manager that I was barred simply because I was looking to meet with residents, how does that square with the idea that these centres are being run well and with people being treated well?</p></speech>

If the witnesses are telling me that there were circumstances in which the State allowed electoral material which was posted directly to residents in reception centres not being handed or given over to people who lived in those centres and that was actually policy, that raises constitutional issues for the Department.

Mr. Waters may not agree but that is my view.</p> <p>  I have also given examples of where I was personally told that I was barred from one of these centres, merely because I turned up to interact with the people who lived there at their request.  That might not be an issue for Mr. Waters but it is an issue for me because everyone has a right to be represented, including the people who live in those centres.  I will ask Deputy Connolly to come in.    </p></speech>

Moreover, another politician was allowed to bring a bus to a direct provision centre.  We could provide anecdotes until 10 o'clock tonight but these cases give an indication of how people in direct provision are treated.  There should be complete clarity surrounding the rights of residents of direct provision centres.  That is not the case at present and the Secretary General is not in a position to state whether the example cited reflected policy.  I ask the witness to clarify the policy for the committee in writing.</p> <p>  I have a few practical questions.  On the housing assistance payment, HAP, if someone receives refugee status and cannot find a home, for example, in Galway city where we have a major housing crisis, I understand he or she will be left in limbo, as it were, as it is not possible to access entitlements without an address.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It also has many other issues to look into.  I am familiar with the position in Galway, where there is a major housing crisis.  I cannot see people in direct provision who receive refugee status getting out of direct provision any time soon.  I raise a practical one and ask the Secretary General to check what the position is for me.  Are people who find themselves in the circumstances I described in a double bind?  If they find a house, they will receive the housing assistance payment but if they cannot get a house, they cannot get a housing assistance payment.  Is it the case that in such circumstances, the person is unable to access entitlements?  Can Mr. Waters revert to me on that issue?</p></speech>

It is a Private Member's Bill that was referred to the select committee by order of the D&aacute;il on 6 October 2016.  The joint committee has reported to the D&aacute;il on its detailed scrutiny of the Bill in accordance with Standing Order 141(2).  I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  I understand Deputy Pearse Doherty and the Minister wish to make introductory remarks.  I invite Deputy Pearse Doherty to make his opening remarks first, as sponsor of the Bill.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017051100002#B00200"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Leas-Chathaoirleach agus cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh an Aire agus baill den Roinn fosta.  </p> <p>  As we know, in March 2014 FLAC, Free Legal Advice Centres, published a report entitled, Redressing the Imbalance.  It was a study of legal protections for consumers of credit and other financial services in Ireland.  My office engaged with FLAC to produce the Bill based on its report.  The Bill was introduced in the D&aacute;il in September 2014.  It is appropriate for me to thank FLAC for its engagement with me in the preparation of this legislation.  I also thank the Financial Services Ombudsman for his ongoing engagement and that of his officials in discussing matters that arise in dealing with the legislation.  I thank Members on all sides who supported the passage of the legislation on Second Stage and all members of the committee who unanimously agreed that the Bill should proceed to Committee Stage because of the sense of urgency attached to its core element, the six-year rule.  In October 2016 the Bill was passed on Second Stage.  That timeline tells us how long the issue has been ongoing.  There are many important issues dealt with in the Bill, but the six-year rule for the making of complaints against financial institutions is the most pressing concern for me and many others.</p> <p>  It was a coincidence, I am told, that on the eve of the Bill being passed on Second Stage the Government published the heads of a Bill.  Again, on the eve of the Bill being taken on Committee Stage the Government published its Bill.  Having said that, I welcome publication of its Bill.  It is very comprehensive legislation that will need scrutiny which we will give it when it reaches Second, Committee and Report Stages.  I am glad that some of the core issues I presented in my Bill in 2014 are included in the Government's Bill.  We can discuss them as the day passes.</p> <p>  The issue is one of timing.  The question we have to ask ourselves is should we proceed with Committee Stage of this Bill or should we allow the Government's Bill to proceed to Second Stage?  That question has been discussed and answered by the committee.  Given the urgency of the matter and the recognition that there are countless people who cannot access redress and compensation through the Financial Services Ombudsman from their financial providers because of the six-year rule, the committee recommended that we proceed with this legislation and that its measures be incorporated into the Government's more comprehensive legislation which will provide for the merger of two public bodies.  I hope that is the way we can proceed today.</p> <p>  I look forward to hearing from colleagues about their concerns.  There was valued engagement during the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  I thank the officials of the committee for their work in preparing the report on behalf of the committee that scrutinised my legislation and the heads of the Government-sponsored Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill.</p></speech>

In general terms, it is good and necessary legislation.  There are, however, aspects of the Bill which, from the Government's point of view, require amendment.  I thank the Chairman, committee members and staff for facilitating us this morning.  The best way for me to be helpful is to read the speaking note with which the Department of Finance has provided me.  We can then have a more informal conversation.  The note outlines how we might proceed in dealing with the content of the Bill.</p> <p>  I fully understand the intention behind the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' Bill which seeks to provide for the strengthening of the functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman, the consumer complaints procedure and related matters.  While, in overall terms, I support the intention behind the initiative, the provisions, as set out, do not fully achieve that aim.  I did not oppose the Bill on Second Stage as I agreed in principle with what Deputy Pearse Doherty was trying to achieve - to improve the legislation in place for consumers.  The Government's Bill to amalgamate the Financial Service Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman was published yesterday.  It is more comprehensive and provides for a number of improvements to the existing legislation.  It will also amalgamate the offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman and consolidate and update the existing legislation, including the extension of the time limits for complaints, a singular concern of Deputy Pearse Doherty.  With the agreement of the House, I hope to take Second Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il by the end of the month.  I have been told informally that the Business Committee will facilitate that request.  I do not think we are setting up for a long delay.  I am as interested as the Deputy in having the Bill enacted by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad before the summer recess.</p> <p>  The Government's Bill has the potential to strengthen the functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman under the new body, the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, and to improve the consumer complaints procedure for consumers of both pensions and financial services.  I am requesting Sinn F&eacute;in to work with me and my officials in order that we can focus on the Bill I have proposed which is broadly in line with the principles underpinning Deputy Pearse Doherty&rsquo;s Bill.  I make that formal request, although I know that the Deputy has an alternative view on how we should proceed.  I will not, however, enter a quarrel about it either.  If the Deputy is not open to accepting this offer, I am agreeable, in the interests of achieving the best result for the consumer, to working with him and the committee on the draft Bill, bearing in mind that it will have a more limited impact.  However, in doing so I point out that if the Government's Bill, published yesterday, is enacted, it will repeal Part VIIB of the Central Bank Act 1942, part of which will be amended by the Deputy&rsquo;s Bill.  Therefore, my Bill, if enacted as it stands, will render the Deputy&rsquo;s Bill ineffective by repealing the provisions his Bill is proposing to amend.  This is in accordance with the recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny committee.  In working with the Deputy in incorporating his Bill into mine, the principles of his Bill will be retained in the Government's Bill.  I am sure he will agree that there is a finite number of resources in the public service and that the taxpayer is entitled to their best use.  It is for that reason I urge Deputies to enable us to concentrate fully on progressing the larger and more comprehensive Bill through the Oireachtas to benefit consumers.</p><p>For this reason I urge the Deputies to enable us to concentrate fully on progressing the larger, more comprehensive Bill through the Oireachtas, which will benefit consumers.</p><p> I note that Deputy McGrath has proposed amendments.  As these are stand-alone amendments, they can be dealt with during the debate on their merits in the ordinary way.</p><p> If we are to proceed now, I must highlight that there are some sections in the Bill that I can broadly support: section 1, section 2, as amended, section 3, as amended, and perhaps, after discussion, section 6.  However, there are other sections which I believe require amendment and in respect of which I expect to work with the committee, particularly with Deputy Doherty, to find a solution.  I agree in principle to section 4, which concerns time limits, but I believe it requires amendment to bring it more into line with the proposals in the Government Bill.  I also believe that the appeal from the Ombudsman should continue to lie to the High Court and that it is in the best interest of consumers that it should do so.</p><p> If the Bill proceeds to Report Stage, I will propose amendments on that Stage to the principles in section 4, which concerns time limits, and in sections 7 and 8, which concern appeals, while perhaps flagging that I might need to make some more minor amendments to section 5, which concerns mediation, and other sections.</p><p> I wish to turn my formal speaking note into a conversation.  The programme for Government commits us to amalgamating the offices and functions of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Services Ombudsman, and the more comprehensive Bill published yesterday does that.  Deputy Doherty's Bill, which is very important legislation, amends, strengthens and makes more amenable to public concerns certain sections of the existing legislation.  Apart from the normal differences of opinion one would have about sections in a Committee Stage or Report Stage debate, I do not have a problem with the principles of what Deputy Doherty is advancing.</p><p> One option is to proceed with the Government legislation and incorporate the principles of Deputy Doherty's Bill into that debate, and I can assure him that we will approach it on the basis that we would seek to incorporate the essentials of his legislation.  The alternative is to run two Bills in tandem and have the Government Bill proceed to Second Stage and Deputy Doherty's Bill proceed through Committee Stage, taking into account the caveats I have expressed about some sections that would need to be amended.  The principal difficulty that would arise from running the two Bills in tandem is that while in some areas of Deputy Doherty's Bill the destination he outlines is the same as that at which the Government wishes to arrive, his method of getting there is different.  He bases his amending legislation on the Central Bank Act 1942, while the Government legislation is based on a different legal premise.  If down the road the Government Bill were to replace Deputy Doherty's Bill, if enacted, his Bill would have to be annulled in its entirety because it is built on the Central Bank Act 1942, which we would annul to get to our new legal base for the more comprehensive legislation.  I am prepared to proceed on either basis.  I know it is not easy to produce Private Members' Bills, that an awful lot of time and effort is put into them and that they are one of the elements of being in opposition.  The successful delivery of a Private Members' Bill is a fairly serious piece of work in any parliament, particularly the D&aacute;il.  If we are to go ahead today, I can facilitate Deputy Doherty very quickly with the sections I have outlined with which we do not have an issue.  Then, if I can get a commitment of openness to amendment, either today or on Report Stage, to the sections with which I have difficulty, we can go along that way.</p><p> There is one other difficulty, of which I am sure Deputy Doherty is aware, but I will point it out anyway.  If his Bill passes all Stages in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and becomes the law of the land on these issues, the complaints initiated by persons under Deputy Doherty's legislation would have to proceed to their legal conclusions.  While the base legislation would be overtaken by the more comprehensive Government Bill, the particular complaint, as initiated, would have to proceed under the rules as outlined in Deputy Doherty's Bill.  Therefore, one complainant might proceed on a particular legal basis under the Government legislation while another complainant in parallel proceeds under a different complaints procedure, as outlined in Deputy Doherty's Bill.  It is hard to foresee whether this would have major or minor consequences but it is worth putting on the record.  I will go whichever way Deputy Doherty wants to go.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the issues the Minister raises about some of the sections, and we can see from the legislation published yesterday the differences between the Bills.  Some of the differences are minor and some are major and we can discuss them as we go through the sections of the Bill.  I am very conscious of the Minister's comments to the effect that the passage into law of this legislation, if it passes both Houses of the Oireachtas, and when the Government's merger of both public bodies takes effect, would annul the previous legislation, that is, my legislation.  That is what we talked about in our committee report.  The principle here is that we need to make sure that the principles within this legislation mirror the same sections in the Government's legislation.  This is only about a matter of timing.  I am not precious about the fact that I sponsored this Bill.  I already have another Bill in Committee Stage, which I have discussed with the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, regarding the timing of that legislation because of the pressures within the Department in dealing with other issues.  I am not precious about this at all.  I have left it until this Stage.  The reason I believe it is important to proceed at this point is that there are people locked out of the system.  I am not convinced the Government's legislation will be enacted in law before the summer recess.  I wish to flag to the committee the intention, when we conclude this and if it passes Committee Stage, that it would go to Report and Final Stages in the House before the end of this month.  We have secured space in the Seanad to proceed with this legislation at the start of June, so there is a pathway to allowing it to become law, which would allow for people who are locked out of the system at present.  Yesterday I spoke to a woman who cannot get access to the Financial Services Ombudsman or seek redress from the financial institution because of this rule and is waiting impatiently for this legislation.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's comments.  I believe the issue of how we proceed has already been discussed by the committee, and we had the benefit of a letter from the Minister stating he would publish the legislation.  What we need to do now is make sure that the sections, particularly the likes of sections 4 and 6, are mirrored in the Government's legislation.  For that purpose, I am very open to amendments and want to hear what the Government and indeed other Deputies here who have an opinion on this issue have to say to make sure we proceed.</p></speech>

Following the pre-legislative scrutiny and discussions with stakeholders, I have decided to propose deleting the section.  The original intention -  one I still support - is to make sure that the Financial Services Ombudsman is about protecting the small consumer, individual customers and small businesses.  It should not be swamped by large cases that are more suited to the commercial court.  The issue in my proposal was that the interpretation of it could be to exclude sole traders in charities.  That was raised during the pre-legislative scrutiny.  Sole traders could be excluded from accessing the services of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  That is something that would run counter to my intention.  I am glad that we have started a discussion about possibly looking at a two-tier process at some point in the future.  However, by deleting the section we would be reverting back to what exists in law at this point in time.</p><p>Currently, the definition of a consumer for the purpose of the ombudsman is:</p><blockquote>(<i>a</i>) a natural person when not acting in the course of, or in connection with, carrying on a business, or<br /><br />(<i>b</i>) a person, or group of persons, of a class prescribed by Council regulations;</blockquote> <p>When we look at the council regulations, we see that in 2005 the council used its powers to expand the definition of a consumer to include a person or group of persons but not an incorporate body with an annual turnover in excess of &euro;3 million.  For the avoidance of doubt, a group of persons includes partnerships and other unincorporated bodies, such as clubs, charities and trusts not consisting entirely of bodies corporate.  The definition also includes incorporated bodies with an annual turnover of &euro;3 million or less in the financial year prior to the year in which the complaint is made to the ombudsman, provided that such a body is not a member of a group of companies having a combined turnover greater than the said &euro;3 million.  There was a further clarification in 2014.</p><p>The original section in this Bill arose as a result of FLAC highlighting some court cases that judges suggested should have been directed towards the commercial court instead of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  That said, given the pre-legislative scrutiny, I want to delete the section in the Bill, which would mean reverting back to the existing definition of a consumer as laid down in the original Act and as prescribed by the regulations of the ombudsman's council.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance's point of view was that it would have unintended consequences of narrowing the definition to exclude small businesses such as sole traders and holders such as charities.  The Department has engaged extensively with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the definition of "consumer".  That definition is more comprehensive.  In particular it defines the term "consumer" as meaning in general terms individuals, small businesses, charities, clubs and so on.  On reflection, Deputy Doherty is moving an amendment to delete the section.  I welcome that very much and can agree to it.</p></speech>

The original wording of the Bill sought a large change by deleting the words &quot;in an informal manner&quot; and &quot;without regard to technicality and legal form&quot;.  My amendment today attempts to refine this approach by simply adding the word &quot;undue&quot; in order that the Financial Services Ombudsman will act &quot;without undue regard to technicality and legal form&quot;.  The key here is that while the office must be approachable, it must be correct in its duties.  I am confident that the amendment strikes the right balance.  I note that this proposal is also to be found in the Government's newly-published Bill.  We had quite an extensive discussion on this during the pre-legislative scrutiny.  This amendment arises from that discussion. </p></speech>

He has explained the impact and intent of the amendment in his contribution.  I note the current amendment no longer seeks to delete the words "in an informal manner" from the original Act and introduces the word "undue" to read as "without undue regard to technicality and legal form".  I very much welcome this amendment to section 3 of the Deputy's Bill as it resembles what is included in the Government legislation.  The provisions outlining that the ombudsman needs not have regard to technicality or legal form is considered by the ombudsman to be a very valuable and fundamentally important provision upon which reliance can be placed, while the ombudsman nevertheless complies with the requirements of natural justice.  I recognise that this text, which is also in the Government Bill, allows for informality while also acknowledging that such informality is to be bound by an appreciation for due process and fair procedures.  Therefore, I support this amendment.</p></speech>

The Government has its own piece of legislation to merge the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman and has accepted that this issue of the six-year rule will be part of that legislation.  It is important to try to mirror what is in both pieces of legislation in order that there is a seamless provision of services from the Financial Services Ombudsman and a clarity to how that would operate.  We have looked at the Government's heads of Bill and listened to what came out of the pre-legislative scrutiny.  We have proposed an amendment based on that.</p><p>This is one of the most important sections of the Bill.  It is the core area and the cause of the urgency to have this legislation enshrined into law.  The original proposal based on the FLAC report was to move to a two-year rule, which is two years from the date on which a consumer becomes aware of the act or deed.  As we speak, there are families across the State for whom this is a very real and pressing issue.  As I mentioned, I published this Bill back in September 2014.  We are two and a half years on since the publication of this Bill.  Even now, I am personally engaged with the Central Bank of Ireland on what I believe is another payment protection insurance scandal that has taken place, with thousands of customers of certain different institutions having been mis-sold products who did not originally come under the scope of the Central Bank's investigation.  There are potentially thousands of people who fall into this bracket.  As I mentioned, I had a conversation about this just yesterday and we have had a number of individuals contacting us just this week on this key area.</p><p>I know that there is cross-party support with regard to dealing with this issue.  I also want to note that Deputy McGrath has legislation on this issue that also proposes removing the block of the six-year rule.  The amendment today changes it from two years to three years, which is in line with what was suggested by both Deputy McGrath and the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  The three-year rule would apply to consumers who otherwise would be excluded by the six-year rule.  I have also taken steps in this amendment to address concerns about other aspects of the section.  I have inserted the term &quot;products of duration of greater than 6 years&quot; to make sure that renewable products that have a life but not necessarily a term of six years are eligible for the new time limits.  I have also decided not to use the Government's wording of &quot;ought to have known&quot;.  We discussed this during the pre-legislative scrutiny.  I feel that that terminology included in the legislation would only act in favour of the banks and to the detriment of the consumer.</p><p>I believe that this amendment is in line with what the Government's heads of Bill outlined.  I note that the Government has adopted a different approach because it is coming from a different legal basis.  There are some significant differences, particularly with regard to &quot;ought to have known&quot;, but I see no reason why that needs to be included.  I think that would provide a loophole for financial institutions to take cases against individuals and against the Financial Services Ombudsman by saying that an individual should have known that the tracker mortgage issue was in the public domain and so on, which would therefore continue to see people locked out of the system.</p></speech>

I think I can go some of the road with him.</p> <p>  I note that the Deputy's Bill as published provides for an additional time limit to make complaints up to two years from the date of knowledge.  The heads of the Bill published last September provided for a possible three-year discoverability period for complaints with regard to long-term service.  This is now reflected in section 52 of the Government Bill that was published yesterday.  In that respect, the extension from two to three years for long-term financial services included in Deputy Doherty's amendment is to be welcomed.  The extension from two to three years is in line with what we have published now, and I thank Deputy Doherty for that part of the amendment.  I still have some difficulties with the section and I will explain what those are now.</p> <p>  The Government Bill provides an extra discretion to the ombudsman to extend the time limit that would benefit consumers in cases where it is just and reasonable, similar to the provision that exists for pension complaints.  Furthermore, the Private Members' Bill is silent as to whether the new time limit applies only prospectively - that is into the future and the conduct that occurs in the future - or retrospectively, to conduct that occurred in the past.  It could be that it applies to conduct that occurred in the distant past and these claims may be difficult to defend.</p> <p>  Section 51 of the Government Bill published yesterday provides for all pension products and for long-term financial services where the duration of the service is five years and one month or more and not subject to annual renewal or cancellation unilaterally.  Complaints can be made either six years from the date of the conduct giving rise to the complaint, or three years from the earlier of the following two dates.  The first is the date on which the person making the complaint first becomes aware of the conduct and the second is the date on which that person ought reasonably to have become aware.  The phrase is "ought reasonably to have become aware" of that conduct.</p> <p>  Section 51 also states that complaints can be made within "such longer period as the Ombudsman may allow where it appears to him or her that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just and equitable, in all the circumstances, to so extend the period".  The new time limit for long-term financial services will apply to complaints made to the ombudsman about conduct that occurred during or after 2002 if "the long-term financial service concerned has not expired or otherwise been terminated more than 6 years before the date of the complaint".  Furthermore, it is a common feature of these discoverability tests and in other ombudsman's schemes that the date runs from "the earlier of the date on which the person making the complaint became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, of the conduct giving rise to the complaint".  This is a standard objective test of knowledge and a necessary provision to prevent the possibility of an open-ended time limit.  The respondents would have a right to a reasonable time limit in which they are expected to keep records and defend any complaints.  I am happy to discuss this provision in more detail in the later stages of my Bill.</p> <p>  If this section proceeds to the next Stage, I wish to put the committee on notice that I will bring forward amendments on Report Stage covering the issues such as time limits and other technical drafting changes.  There may be other technical or related issues that the Department of Finance needs to explore further on Report Stage with a view to bringing forward an amendment.  Effectively, I agree the main thrust of the amendment is to extend from two years to three years and I welcome that, but there are other issues which need to be amended.  Rather than trying to patch it up now, we should leave that to Report Stage.  I also indicate that my officials will be available to Deputy Doherty and his support group to discuss Report Stage amendments in advance to see if we can reach agreement on them rather than bouncing them on the committee at Report Stage sight unseen.  If we could proceed on that basis, we could get over this difficulty.</p></speech>

I noted after reading the Government's published legislation some of the areas which the Government had included which I have no issue with, and which would give greater clarity.  For example, the extra discretion for the ombudsman is something that should be included.  The drafting of this would allow for it to be retrospective, but if that needed to be clarified as is in the Government's Bill, then that is not an issue.  The issue of the distance passed is one of debates, but it is not something that I would die in the ditch over.</p> <p>  There are two other areas which are probably areas where there are significant differences and where we need to engage to try to find common ground.  The method used by the Government in its legislation is the long-term financial product or service.  A long-term financial service in the definitions has to not be subject to annual renewal.  This is a core or very important issue on which I gave an example in pre-legislative scrutiny, where if somebody, for example, took out home insurance seven or eight years ago and renewed it every year under the definition, that would not be a long-term financial service, and therefore would not come under the subject of the section which deals with the six-year rules.  There is an issue there that we can tease out with officials.</p> <p>  The other issue is one I have raised before.  I am not convinced at all that "reasonably ought to have become aware" should be included in this.  I am very conscious that financial institutions, with their firepower and resources, turn up to the ombudsman with junior and senior counsel for very minor issues.  This creates an arguing point for them since it is very hard to define as to when somebody "reasonably ought to have become aware" and it can only work to the benefit of the financial institution.  If there was wrongdoing by the financial institution and if that was noted or became known within the six years or three years, then the ombudsman should be able to hear that case and determine that.  I have concern about that issue, but I welcome the Minister's suggestion that we sit down and discuss an amendment on that for Report Stage to make sure that the provisions in this section mirror what the Government intends to do in its Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill 2017.</p></speech>

It follows from this that we cannot have an unlimited time limit.  That would not be reasonable for the financial services firms which are putting a defence in place.  The reason for the form of words that we have included in the Government legislation is that it is the form of words in the UK legislation.  In Australia, which would be a similar common law country, the financial service ombudsman's records are kept for six years under the consumer protection code.  It is hard to go back beyond the legal requirements to preserve records.</p> <p>  We can work on the basis that the amendment proposed by Deputy Doherty is acceptable to me, but there are outstanding issues.  Part of the outstanding issues are matters that I do not think there will be difficulty in reaching agreement on, taking into account the comments made by Deputy Doherty, having read the Bill as published yesterday.  I think we will be able to accommodate those.  There is a real issue around the "might reasonably have known" point.  We need some cut-off, whether it is this form of words or through a different legal form of words.  I will commit to my officials being available to Deputy Doherty and his advisers to see if agreement can be reached.  While we are proceeding very rapidly at this point, this is a potential sticking point.  There are real issues here and we will see what comes from the engagement with officials.</p><p>Otherwise, I am happy to proceed.</p></speech>

Again, this legislation was published in 2014.  Since then, we have seen a change in the way the Financial Services Ombudsman is operating.  There are far more cases of mediation, which is to be welcomed.  There are also far more positive results in the service in recent times.  That process is voluntary at present and this section puts an onus on the financial institutions, where they refuse to mediate, to give a reason for their refusal to engage in the mediation process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1219" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017051100002#F00700"><p>I note that section 5 of the Bill seeks to put greater pressure on the financial service provider to engage in the mediation process.  The Government Bill published yesterday seeks to strengthen the role of the Financial Services Ombudsman in promoting engagement in the mediation process and continues to provide for mediation as a tool for the ombudsman in cases where he sees fit.  In addition to this, I note that the Deputy&rsquo;s Bill was published at a time when mediation in the Financial Services Ombudsman was at a low base.  Deputy Doherty acknowledged that in his contribution and indicated that he is well aware of a change of practice in the ombudsman's office, where recourse to mediation is a more normal option than it was in the past.</p><p>As members are aware, the Financial Services Ombudsman last year introduced a dedicated dispute resolution service to resolve disputes through mediation at an early stage and with the minimum formality necessary.  The recent annual report of the FSO highlights that mediation is now the first and preferred option for resolving complaints.  A total of 2,378 complaints were resolved through mediation between 1 February 2016 and the end of 2016.  There has been a very big change of practice since we considered this initially and since Deputy Doherty drafted his Bill.  There is far greater recourse to mediation, and it is the norm rather than the exception to have recourse to mediation in the first instance.  We have reflected that practice in the new legislation sponsored by the Government and it should be reflected in Deputy Doherty's Bill as well.</p><p>I wish to notify the committee that I will bring forward amendments covering the issues set out in my Bill and discussed here now, as well as other related matters including technical drafting changes, on Report Stage.  However, that is not to subtract from anything proposed by Deputy Doherty in section 5.  It is to add to it and to take account of current practice at the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman.<b></b>Again, we can engage in advance on the detail of the provision.</p></speech>

The section broadens the range of findings the ombudsman can make.  Currently, the Financial Services Ombudsman can only rule a complaint to be substantiated, partially substantiated or not substantiated.  This section would extend the range of findings to upheld, substantially upheld, substantially rejected or rejected.  It might appear minor but it is an important change as it would allow us to better assess the performance and the outcomes of the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  At present, a consumer could have their case effectively lost, but the ombudsman would have to declare it partially substantiated even if no award was made to the consumer.  That is because on the basis of a technicality, a minor issue, the ombudsman felt the consumer was correct in that area but in the major charge that was levelled against the financial institution the ombudsman found against the consumer and it would be recorded as a partially substantiated case.</p> <p>  I am conscious that this change would cut across the name and shame provision which was introduced to allow the Financial Services Ombudsman to name in his report financial services providers who consistently have rulings against them.  I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage to section 57BS of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 to ensure that the broadened range of findings by the Financial Services Ombudsman is reflected in respect of the provision for naming and shaming.  I am happy to engage with officials on the drafting of that amendment.  It was also suggested to me that the ombudsman could be empowered to go further and publish findings, edited to protect identities.  The Minister has talked about looking at some of the provisions in Britain in terms of the drafting, but in Britain the findings are published in the format of Mr. or Mrs. C versus the Bank of England and so forth.  If the committee considers this would be a worthwhile amendment, I would be happy to consider it too.</p></speech>

Currently, the possible findings are limited to a finding that the complaint was substantiated, not substantiated or partially substantiated.  The Bill allows for findings of upheld, substantially upheld, substantially rejected or rejected.  The Government Bill goes further and proposes that decisions will be published, which is more transparent even though the names would be redacted.  Transparency and better reporting are the objective of the Bill and I support the intention behind this provision.  Any change to the determination categories would need to operate harmoniously with the name and shame provision, in order to be effective in increasing transparency.  As currently drafted it could operate to limit the name and shame provisions, and I am aware that is not the Deputy's intention.</p> <p>  Other steps have been taken in the Government Bill published yesterday to improve transparency in reporting, including the introduction of preliminary determinations, more detail and publication of determinations for financial services complaints, and more transparent information in the annual report on all investigations, including those terminated and settled.  If this section proceeds to the next stage I wish to put the committee on notice that I may bring forward amendments covering the issues mentioned, and other technical drafting changes, on Report Stage.  We have a common interest and a common purpose to make the findings at adjudication level more transparent and to enable the provision of additional information to the public at large as well to both sides in the complaints procedure.  The Bill published by the Government goes further and is more refined in the options given.  I wish to amend this section to import many of the provisions in the new legislation published yesterday into this Bill.  Again, it is a matter which the Deputy is amenable to consider.  We can have a preliminary discussion at official level before the draft Report Stage amendments are provided to the committee, if that is agreeable to the Deputy.</p></speech>

The issue was raised by the Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and relates to the maximum compensation ceiling.  The amendment's provisions are designed to reflect the reality that, in some cases, the loss can exceed the maximum compensation ceiling.

This is unnecessary, as the Government's Bill allows for full rectification to be granted in addition to compensation for inconvenience.</p><p>The proposed amendment might be based upon a misunderstanding.  The existing legislation allows for a number of redress tools, including rectification and compensation.  Rectification makes good the loss to consumers and there is no ceiling.  Compensation, which can be additional to the rectification, can be high or low depending on the specific facts of the case.  I understand from the ombudsman that the ceiling of &euro;250,000 has not caused problems in directing compensation.</p><p>Compensation can be high or low depending on the impact on the individual, for example, the inconvenience caused to consumers by the misconduct of the provider.  This is usually determined by the specific facts of the case.  The Financial Services Ombudsman's office has advised that, to date, it has not found that the ceiling of &euro;250,000 causes problems in directing compensation.</p><p>Examples of where rectification could be in excess of &euro;250,000 include a direction by the Financial Services Ombudsman that a financial service provider apply a lower rate of interest to a mortgage loan, pay an insurance claim, pay a life insurance claim and pay a critical illness claim.  Other important directions might include amending credit history information and ordering an insurance company to reinstate cover and-or continue cover over the next number of years.  For example, in the ombudsman's 2016 annual review, there was a direction to a provider to rectify the conduct complained of by immediately buying back an investment that had been mis-sold for the original amount of &euro;250,000, together with a direction for payment of an additional sum of &euro;7,000 in compensation.</p><p>At the pre-legislative scrutiny meeting on 27 October, the ombudsman drew the committee's attention to the fact that he could direct a financial service provider to pay compensation of up to &euro;250,000 and that he could also direct rectification.  He highlighted that such rectification could be significant, as it can involve putting a person back to the position in which he or she was before the complaint arose.  In some instances, such as where a home or life insurance policy has been voided or an income continuance or life insurance claim denied, this is potentially more important for the complainant than compensation.</p><p>In terms of reviewing the maximum compensation ceiling that the Deputy refers to in his proposed amendment, there is provision to enable the increase in compensation amount in the Government Bill, which was published yesterday.  This is a new power given to the Minister, one that is provided to the council under existing legislation, to adjust and update the maximum compensation amount if necessary.  Under section 4 of that Bill, for example, the Minister for Finance may, whether on his or her own initiative or at the request of the ombudsman, make regulations.  Section 4(2)(h) states that such regulation may &quot;specify a maximum amount of compensation that the Ombudsman may award to a complainant under <i>section 60</i>&quot;, which relates to complaints and redress in respect of financial service providers.</p><p>Furthermore, in the existing legislation and in the Bill published yesterday, there are provisions to carry out reviews.  Section 25(3) of my Bill on the publication of other reports states: &quot;The Ombudsman may, from time to time, prepare and submit to the Minister such other reports in relation to the performance of the functions under this Act as he or she considers appropriate.&quot;  Section 25(4) enables the Ombudsman to &quot;publish reports on other matters if he or she considers that it would be in the public interest to do so&quot;.  If this section in Deputy Doherty's Bill proceeds to the next Stage, I wish to put the committee on notice that I may propose Report Stage amendments covering the issues mentioned above and other technical drafting changes or other related issues.</p><p>My key point is that, if someone's complaint relates to serious financial loss and is upheld, it is not the compensation that makes good the loss, but the ombudsman's rectification power.  It is only after making good the loss in full that the compensation issue arises.  Without trying to rewrite law, it seems that the compensation piece is analogous to punitive damages in civil actions.  The case is settled and the compensation due is paid, but because of the bad behaviour of the party against which the complaint is made, an additional sum of money should be paid to allow for the fact of such bad behaviour, which is a loose lay man's description of how punitive damages arise.  It is the same in this context.</p><p>There is nothing in the existing legislation or Deputy Doherty's Bill that would prevent a full rectification to be made to a complainant.  According to the ombudsman, the head room of &euro;250,000 is sufficient for any further compensation provisions along the lines that I have described to be paid.  The legislation published yesterday has gone further again in teasing out certain aspects of the compensation provisions that might be necessary and how they might be kept up to date.  As such, I request that Deputy McGrath reflect on the matter between now and Report Stage.  I will get my officials to dialogue with him on whether we can incorporate the essential request of his amendment in the Government's Report Stage amendments.</p></speech>

I acknowledge his core point that the rectification can be 100% of the loss and that the compensation is in addition to that.  The amendment does not require the council to increase the compensation limit.  Rather, it provides that there would be an annual review.  The Minister has stated that his Bill provides for a possible increase in the compensation limit.  I make the point again that we are not examining the Government Bill.  Rather, we are examining Deputy Doherty's and seeking to improve it as best we can.  It is ahead of the Government Bill in the queue and where everything will end up is unknown.</p> <p>  I take the Minister's key point that the loss can be rectified in full and that the compensation is, in effect, additional to that.  As such, I will withdraw the amendment, but I reserve the right to retable it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

As timing is an issue, we want to find as much common ground as possible before dealing with the issues again in the Government's legislation.  The provisions contained here have started a debate on an independent appeals mechanism that is accessible to the consumer.  Unfortunately, when the Financial Services Ombudsman finds in favour of a financial institution, an appeal to the High Court is beyond the reach of many people.</p> <p>  During the pre-legislative scrutiny stage, we heard about the drawbacks that could be associated with this section.  However, we also heard that the existing mechanism is expensive and intimidating for ordinary customers.  The instinct and motivation behind this section is to make access to the justice system affordable for the greatest possible number of people.  I listened to the debate during pre-legislative scrutiny and recognise some of the arguments as to why, despite the best of intentions, this section could be considered a double-edged sword.  I acknowledge the changes that are taking place within the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  It has been issuing preliminary findings since the start of the year.  It is early days yet but at least it gives people a type of appeals mechanism, although it is not independent.  We left the section in nonetheless.</p> <p>  There are two parts to the section.  The first provides that people would have access to the Circuit Court instead of the High Court.  The second pertains to the timelines that would be laid out for persons seeking to appeal a decision, which would increase to 60 days.  We have included that provision because, if an ordinary consumer is preparing a case for the Circuit Court or High Court and finds that the ombudsman has ruled against him or her, a period of 21 days is very restrictive in terms of getting a legal opinion, lodging an appeal, securing a solicitor and securing junior or senior counsel.  It is a very costly journey for ordinary consumers and families.  That is why we provided for an extension of the period to 60 days.</p> <p>  I am conscious that there is very strong opposition to this provision from Government.  I do not intend to push the provision on moving from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  The debate was worth having and we should continue to discuss having a more accessible, independent appeals mechanism.  Let us look at the changes being made within the ombudsman's office since the start of the year and how they can be strengthened.  I would, however, emphasise that the extension of the period from 21 to 60 days is important.  The courts set out their own timeframe but they are also obliged to respond to the legislation laid down by these Houses.  I hope we can find an area of common ground in respect of this provision as there is serious merit in it.</p></speech>

I welcome that.  The best way to proceed is by reading the formal speaking note.  Then we can chat about it and see if we can narrow the ground further so that we can arrive at agreement on Report Stage.</p><p>The purpose of the ombudsman is to be a free alternative to the courts system for consumers.  The intention of section 7 may have been to improve consumer protection by offering a <i>de novo</i>appeal in the Circuit Court to avoid the expense of the High Court for consumers.  That was a worthy intention.  However, I have some concerns.</p><p>A <i>de novo</i>appeal to the Circuit Court would involve the ombudsman as a notice party only, meaning that if the financial services provider appealed a decision which favoured the complainant, the complainant would have to defend the appeal in the Circuit Court, with all of the attendant expense.  The provider is in a considerably stronger position both to go to the Circuit Court and to succeed, due to the lack of inquisitorial powers of the Circuit Court.  In the existing statutory appeal to the High Court, the complainant is shielded by the high threshold which is applied to the statutory appeal and by the fact that the Financial Services Ombudsman can be a party to the complaint, and thus take the role of defending its own decision.  Neither of these factors operates in a Circuit Court <i>de novo</i>appeal and so the real effect is not only that the provider is in a stronger position on a case-by-case basis, but that the existence of the threat of an appeal by the provider operates as a deterrent to consumers generally.</p><p>In addition, in a High Court appeal, the ombudsman can defend his decision as a party to the statutory appeal.  This has the effect of protecting the consumer from the costs or threat of costs of a High Court appeal made by the provider.  Furthermore, a re-hearing could allow for a situation whereby people use the ombudsman as the first step in litigation before inevitably going before the courts, and taking their case again to the courts if unsuccessful.  This could result in a floodgate scenario for the office, which would have implications for staffing and the effectiveness of the office to process and determine complaints.  Time limits for appeals are currently set within such limits as the relevant court allows.</p><p>Finally, while a Circuit Court appeals process may appear to benefit the consumer as it is cheaper, it should be borne in mind that the Circuit Court can only award in cases up to &euro;75,000, where the ombudsman can award compensation up to &euro;250,000.  In addition, the Circuit Court will not hold an investigation, as the ombudsman can.  Instead, the consumer will be obliged to prove his or her case <i>de novo</i>to the civil standard, without the benefit of the ombudsman who can look into all the codes of practice and regulatory standards in addition to the facts of the case.  On balance, therefore, I do not believe that an appeal to the Circuit Court would provide greater consumer protection.</p><p>If this section proceeds to the next stage I wish to put the committee on notice that I may bring forward amendments covering the issues mentioned above and other technical drafting changes on Report Stage.  I may also look again at the time limit for appeals to court.  I welcome Deputy Doherty's latest intervention.  In a movement towards further agreement between us, I could commit to looking again at the time limit of 21 days versus 60 days between now and Report Stage.  I will examine the matter seriously and will get my officials to have a discussion with the Deputy.  It might be feasible to have an advance on the 21 days while still being short of the 60 days.</p></speech>

I am aware of how financial institutions try to use every possible mechanism to thwart the efforts of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  We need to be very careful about any changes.  This is evident even in respect of the tracker mortgages, where one financial institution is appealing right the way through the system.</p><p> I believe that this debate is worth having and that we need to continue to monitor an accessible and affordable independent appeals mechanism.  I do not intend to push the issue of the Circuit Court and High Court as it would delay the legislation.  I would welcome engagement with the officials on the issue of having a 21 day or 60 day interval.  I understand that if we lay the provision down in legislation then the courts will be obliged to act on that basis.  I have no problem with the section being opposed.  If it were opposed then I reserve the right to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to deal with the timeframe for the Circuit Court as opposed to the High Court.  If the section were opposed it would also delete section 8, which is consequential on section 7.</p></speech>

I can agree it on the basis that the intent of the dialogue would be to move up from the 21 days.  I can go that far.</p> <p>  I shall oppose the section.

The report dealt with the issue of an oral hearing.</p><p>I am conscious that my amendment may have resource implications for the Financial Services Officer, FSO.  My amendment provides that where a complainant makes a request for an oral hearing to be held in respect of his or her case and where, in that circumstance, &quot;there is a discrepancy in the account of events between the parties that is fundamental to arriving at a conclusion, the Financial Services Ombudsman should be obliged to hold an oral hearing&quot;.  My amendment seeks a significant change as it removes, in certain circumstances, the ombudsman's discretion to hold an oral hearing.  FLAC has made a strong case for the change to be made.  I have come across cases where complainants wanted an oral hearing but it did not subsequently happen.  My amendment is worth consideration. </p></speech>

The law states, indeed the High Court and Supreme Court rulings make it clear, that where an oral hearing is warranted then one must take place.  The amendments give clarity and certainty about the issue.  There may be concerns that this provision could be frustrated by financial service providers.  The amendment used the phrase "fundamental to arriving at a conclusion," which somewhat leaves a discretion with the Financial Services Ombudsman to appoint.  The amendment has been carefully worded and I have no problem accepting it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1250" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017051100002#J01100"><p>I understand the intention of Deputy McGrath's amendment, which seeks to oblige the ombudsman to hold oral hearings in certain cases.  Oral hearings are best left best to the discretion of the ombudsman, in my view.  This is common practice in many public bodies.  For examine, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has the discretion to hold a hearing in any case of an appeal, referral or an application for permission or approval of strategic infrastructural development.  In the case of strategic infrastructural development, it will normally direct the holding of an oral hearing unless the application can be readily assessed by way of written submissions.  In appeals and other cases, it will normally grant an oral hearing only where this will assist its understanding of a complex case or where significant national or local issues are involved.</p><p>The reason I referenced An Bord Plean&aacute;la is that many of us who have served on local authorities will be familiar with the oral hearing provisions where the board of Plean&aacute;la has discretion to grant an oral hearing.  What I have put on record are the considerations they take into account.  </p><p>To begin, I am advised that the Financial Services Ombudsman agrees that it is very important to hear complainants.  For this reason the FSO introduced new procedures and entirely reoriented its processes so that complainants can discuss their case at length with a dispute resolution officer who is trained to use mediation techniques to deal with the case.  The new dispute resolution process is considerably more consumer friendly than the earlier more formal adjudication systems.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, the adjudication process is still available to the parties if the case is not resolved in dispute resolution.  During the investigation process, the ombudsman may determine that an oral hearing is required based on the circumstances of the case.  It is the experience of the FSO that providers are usually well represented at oral hearings and, therefore,  it can be a difficult process for the complainant who must undergo cross-examination in an adversarial environment.  As a result, these are exceptions rather than the rule.  The courts have, on a number of occasions, endorsed the ombudsman's decision regarding whether to hold an oral hearing.</p><p>Additionally, it would seem contrary to fair procedures to allow the complainant only to dictate when an oral hearing was held.  There is a risk that the proposed amendment would have to allow the provider to also demand an oral hearing.  If this were the case, it is the FSO view that complainants would be put to a significant disadvantage and potentially discouraged from taking cases in the first place.</p><p>I am advised that there is relevant case law that ruled that &ldquo;The calling of experts on each side is an undesirable feature of a proceeding which is designed by an Act of the Oireachtas to be informal and expeditious.&rdquo;  Another case found the following:</p><blockquote>It cannot be the case that the FSO has an obligation to hold an Oral Hearing merely because there is a conflict of fact.  The requirement to hold an Oral Hearing can only arise where the fact in issue cannot be resolved without such Hearing.  It seems to me that the FSO has a significant discretion in considering this issue to decide whether in fact the holding of an Oral Hearing would be likely to be of any assistance.</blockquote> <p>One of the requirements behind the Financial Services Ombudsman legislation is to provide an out-of-court redress facility.  This helps the consumer to have a low cost and informal forum to have a case heard.</p><p>Deputy McGrath's proposed amendment requires an oral hearing<b></b>where a complainant has made a request to hold an oral hearing, and where there is a discrepancy in the account of events between the parties that is fundamental to arriving at a conclusion.  I appreciate what he is trying to achieve but this may have a negative impact on the consumer as there are always discrepancies at an initial stage when a complaint is made.  I am advised that this could inadvertently impose a requirement for oral hearings in all situations.</p><p>The premise of the Bill is to support informal redress procedures.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that the best way to achieve this is through mediation.  As I referred to earlier, the statistics from the FSO's annual report shows that mediation is now the first and preferred option for resolving complaints and has contributed to successful outcomes in the office.  My Bill, as published yesterday, strengthens the role of the ombudsman in promoting engagement in the mediation process. It continues to provide for mediation as a tool for the ombudsman in cases where he sees fit.  This allows for the ombudsman to take a more proactive approach to encourage participation.</p><p>Additionally, the High Court and Supreme Court have noted on a number of occasions that the FSO must follow fair procedures, that oral hearings may form part of those fair procedures and that the FSO should determine whether an oral hearing is required, taking into account all the circumstances of the case<b>.</b></p><p>The ombudsman does hold oral hearings where necessary and it is more suitable that the power is maintained in a discretionary manner.  While I appreciate the Deputy's desire to achieve a solution in difficult cases, it is clear that mediation should be the primary route.  For that reason I do not support this amendment.  If this section proceeds to the next Stage, I wish to put the committee on notice that I may bring forward amendments covering the issues mentioned and other technical drafting changes.</p><p> The differences are narrow enough.  I favour oral hearings but the power to have an oral hearing should be vested in the ombudsman and should be invoked at his discretion analogous to what the Planning Appeals Board does now.  Oral hearings can serve a very useful purpose but I do not want to make it mandatory on the ombudsman to have oral hearings on every case for the reasons I have outlined.  Also, in terms of where the amendment is silent, it seems to me that if the right to request an oral hearing is vested in the complainant, the company or person against which the complaint is made might be able to invoke analogous rights and also insist that they have the right to go for an oral hearing.  That will then complicate what is intended to be an informal process.  The Deputy might reflect on it, as I will do, between now and Report Stage and we will come back and talk about it again.</p></speech>

That is quite a comprehensive response.  I will not press the amendment.  I would make the point that the amendment is crafted in a way that it does not make it mandatory.  Even where the complainant requests an oral hearing, there is discretion on the part of the ombudsman because it only applies where the difference or discrepancy in the evidence is fundamental to arriving at the conclusion.  It is not in every case that a complainant would want to have an oral hearing but we should not take the human element out of proceedings.  Some people like to have the opportunity to make their case in person, face to face with a human being, and I do not believe we should remove that.  I accept that mediation is the preferred route and can be successful in many cases so I will withdraw the amendment and reserve the right to resubmit it for Report Stage.</p></speech>
