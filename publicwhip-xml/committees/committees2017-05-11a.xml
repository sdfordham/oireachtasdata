It is very much appreciated.</p> <p>  The first item on the agenda is the minutes of the meeting of 4 May 2017.  Are they agreed to?  We will come to correspondence shortly.  I propose to hold onto the dossier I received from Mr. Barrett until the end.  We will discuss anything related to last week's meeting when we come to it.</p></speech>

We asked specifically that the committee write to the Department of Education and Skills on the issue of rent.  I would like my point to be recorded at this stage.  I might come back to it.</p></speech>

When we hold hearings and listen to witnesses on key issues, there is some level of reporting back.  There was a discussion of issues related to third and fourth level institutions and a lot of documentation and correspondence was sought from a number of institutes and universities.  Some of it has come in but most of it has not.  I propose that we have some structure for it.  We agreed that we would meet to examine all of the documentation received.  Can it be done in a structured way to identify the key, headline issues?  It is an issue on which the committee should report.  There is a lot of work yet to be done and we will need to receive all of the correspondence sought.  I am not sure if the Chairman or the secretariat has the given the matter any thought.</p></speech>

The other half is to follow through with information, recommendations and conclusions.  I am advised by the secretariat that we will deal with the issues related to education on 25 May.  I hope that by that date we will have assembled all of the information we require from the six third level institutions, the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority.  We can review where to take the matters from there.  Some structure will be proposed in advance.</p></speech>

The first items are Nos. 463A and 472A, briefing documents and an opening statement from the Department of Justice and Equality.  Is it agreed that they be noted and published?  Agreed.  </p> <p>  Category B is correspondence received from Accounting Officers as a follow-through on previous meetings.  No. 495B is correspondence, dated 3 May 2017, from the director of finance at the University of Limerick.  It is noted and will be published.  We will include it in our work programme for our meeting on 25 May.  I welcome the news that the Department of Education and Skills is to launch an independent inquiry into a series of allegations of misconduct at the University of Limerick.</p></speech>

At the hearing in question we referred to the need for a fresh inquiry.  I wonder if the Department proposes to provide us with the terms of reference.  It would be appropriate to do so, all things considered.  The Department might also allow us the facility to offer some reflections on the terms of reference.  The issue has been ongoing for some time and the inquiry will only be valuable if it is properly cast, with robust terms of reference.  The Department could furnish us with the terms of reference and take feedback from us on them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#C00100"><p>We will ask for the draft terms of reference to be sent to us and we may have an input into them.  I do not know timescale but normally they take a little time and I would be surprised if they were completed at this stage.</p> <p>  Nos. 460B (i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 3 May 2017 from Dr. James Browne, president of National University of Ireland Galway, providing following up issues.  We said that we would deal with that again on 25 May.  It was agreed last week to review all the correspondence received from the third level institutions together.  As we are meeting Bord na gCon again next week, I suggest that we agree 25 May to examine the third level institution documentation.</p> <p>  No. 461B is correspondence dated 3 May 2017 from the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, in reply to a letter from the committee following the appearance of the president of Waterford Institute of Technology before the committee.   Is it agreed to note and publish?  Agreed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#C00300"><p>Nos. 462B (i) to (v) is correspondence dated 3 May 2017 from Dr. Graham Love, chief executive officer of the Higher Education Authority providing follow-up information.  We will deal with that on 25 May but we will note and publish all that in the meantime.</p> <p>  No. 464B is correspondence dated 8 May 2017 from Bord na gCon in respect to incidents outside this committee room in which there were three situations in which witnesses were intimidated or abused by visitors in the Gallery, despite the fact that Deputy Kelly, who was in the Chair, issued a warning to the visitors.  The clerk to the committee also had to ask visitors he saw surrounding a witness at the end of the meeting outside the committee room to desist.  Members who request passes for visitors are responsible for their conduct.  That is a long-established practice.  I propose to bring this matter to the attention of the Captain of the Guard to make him aware of the incidents.   While I will not suggest that we close the Visitors Gallery, we have to be careful and fair to witnesses.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#C00400"><p>There was also a great deal of noise and many comments coming from people in the Visitors Gallery.  I appreciate passions were high and there are many strong opinions but that can disrupt our work.  It can be seen as disrespectful to witnesses, irrespective of the questions put.  We put the questions fairly and robustly.  It was difficult from that perspective and it is something we need to be conscious of.</p></speech>

The note is quite a comprehensive response to issues on the cost of administration in respect of fixed charge notices.  There are ongoing attempts to address the issues, which will be assisted by the commencement of Part 3 of the 2010 Act on 1 June.  Is it agreed to note and publish, and forward a copy to Clare County Council?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 468B(i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 8 May from Mr. John Barrett.  I will hold this over until the end of this business.</p> <p>  Nos. 474B(i) to (vi) is correspondence dated 9 May from Ms Mary Higgins, chief executive officer of Caranua providing follow-up information to our meeting on 13 April.  It includes a note on the Towards Healing organisation, a breakdown of the budget for travel and subsistence, a note on agency staff employed, a list of the internal and external audit reports and costs associated with each, a note on the rent to be paid for the forthcoming move of premises, a note on liaison officers and a note on the board meeting held in April 2016 at which the financial position of the organisation was discussed.  There is considerable information in this.  I propose we note and publish it for the moment but we will come back to it next week.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#C00600"><p>I do not see the list of liaison officers.  I may have missed it but could that be checked?  There is reference to an appendix to the list.  More important, I need the Chair's assistance regarding the note on rent.  Based on parliamentary questions, etc., tabled by myself and other Members, the Department of Education and Skills and the OPW do not seem to know what is happening.  Caranua says it has to move but I do not know why.  I would like to highlight this because, presumably, the committee has made its views known to the organisation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#C00700"><p>We have written to the Department of Education and Skills and we are waiting for a reply.</p></speech>

I acknowledge there are serious issues but this is also a serious issue.  When will we come back to it?  I am concerned that this agreement will be signed.  I have read the D&aacute;il reply but I cannot make head nor tail of the cause for this move.  The Department has to give permission, as far as I understand it, under section 7(7) of the legislation before Caranua enters into any contract.  I raised this in the D&aacute;il yesterday and the Minister said he did not know what the position was and that he would get back to me.  The CEO of Caranua says in this correspondence that from day one, it was made known to them that they would be obliged to leave the premises.  I do not know by whom.  We cannot leave the Caranua accounts without coming back to this.  We should send the message again that no rent agreement should be signed.  It is not a good use of money and there are many buildings that could be used.</p></speech>

We will communicate again within 24 hours and we will insist that a full and complete reply be before the committee before next Thursday and that Caranua and the Department should not proceed with any contractual arrangements in the meantime.</p></speech>

The Minister needs to clarify whether he has given permission for this.  We also need clarification from the OPW as to why Caranua has to move since the organisation is based in one of its buildings.  There should be three letters.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Deputy might assist the secretariat by forwarding the replies to the parliamentary questions in order that the staff can know the reference point.</p></speech>

This is correspondence received from the chairman of NAMA regarding to the committee&rsquo;s report on Project Eagle.It is a short letter and I will read it to members.  We will not have a detailed discussion on it but we have to make some response.  I will read it and I will ask at the conclusion of the meeting that we will note and publish it and forward it to the commission, in regard to which the Government has agreed terms of reference during the week, together with a statement from the committee in response, which will issue later.  The letter is dated 19 April and addressed to me.  It reads:</p><blockquote>Dear Chairman<br /><br />Thank you for forwarding copies of the Committee's report of its examination of the sale of Project Eagle.  Whilst there are a number of opinions in the report with which we strongly disagree, I do not wish to rehearse again the various arguments and counter-arguments which have been well aired at this stage.  I do, however, wish to draw your attention to two material errors in the Committee's report.<br /><br />First, the Committee states as its opinion that the NAMA Board was not explicitly informed of the extent of the financial loss that would be recorded in NAMA's accounts as a result of setting the Project Eagle minimum reserve price at &pound;1.3 billion (Paragraphs C.9 and 144 of the report).  I wish to point out that this was unequivocally refuted by a former member of the Board at the PAC's hearing on 17 November 2016 when Mr John Corrigan stated that &quot;<i>when we decided to set the minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion, we were conscious that there was a probability that there could be a loss of up to &pound;180 million, that is to say, the difference between the reserve price and the carrying value of those assets in the balance sheet</i>&quot;.<br /><br />Second, the Committee is of the opinion (Paragraphs C.26 and 208) that the Board was not informed of the meeting held between NAMA representatives and Cerberus on 31 March 2014.  This is incorrect: a number of Board members recall that they were so informed - this is clear from the testimony of Mr Oliver Ellingham and Mr Willie Soffe to the PAC on 18 October 2016.<br /><br />Yours sincerely<br /><br />Frank Daly</blockquote> <p>I would like to make a brief response and we will not try not to labour this for too long.  It was our opinion that the board members were not explicitly informed of the extent of the financial loss.</p><p>While Mr. Corrigan may have been conscious that there could have been a loss of up to &pound;180 million, he did not say that all board members were explicitly informed of the matter.  Regarding what he said in the conclusion that the size of the loss implied that it would have been made clear to all board members, we were not provided with evidence that this statement had been made, despite several board members being present.  If we accept for a moment that it was the case that they were aware of the probability of a loss of &pound;180 million, why has NAMA argued so vehemently against the Comptroller and Auditor General's conclusion that the decision to sell the loans at a minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion involves a significant probable loss of up to &pound;190 million?  It simply makes no sense.<br/><br/>NAMA's defence was that they were not informed specifically of the extent of the financial loss of setting the price at &pound;1.3 billion, which actually would have reflected a loss of &pound;173 million.  We refer to the loss in our financial statement.  Mr. Daly is now saying that the board was made aware of a probable loss of up to &pound;180 million.  Why, in God's name, did they spend several months attacking the Comptroller and Auditor General for suggesting that there was a probable loss of up to &pound;190 million?  His defence against the PAC is to say that the Comptroller and Auditor General was right.  That is essentially it.<br/><br/>I want to move on to the second matter, which is even more puzzling.  As regards the chairman of NAMA's point about not informing the board about the meeting with Cerberus, we wrote specifically to NAMA at my request on 13 December 2016 on this matter.  We asked NAMA:</p><blockquote>Please give us the details of any and all recorded responses, if available, of each of the NAMA board members when they were informed during the board meeting on 3 April regarding the meetings between the Chairman and the Chief Executive and Cerberus on the day before the bids closed.  If this was not communicated to the board members provide a note for why this was the case.</blockquote><p>That was in our letter to NAMA.  On 22 December 2016, NAMA replied to the committee.  The reply is on our website.  It responded to the committee as follows: &quot;As is evident from the minutes of the NAMA Board meetings, the meeting with Cerberus was not discussed at Board level as Project Eagle was not discussed at the meeting with Cerberus&quot;.  Therefore, his response to the committee to say that the members were informed is 100% contradicted by NAMA's own letter to us on 22 December when it said that the matter was not discussed at board level.  NAMA's response to our letter is a flat contradiction of its written evidence to this committee on 22 December 2016.  We are going to issue a statement to that effect.  We will send both documents off to the commission for whenever it reports.</p></speech>

Does the Deputy want to elaborate?  The Deputy is saying that there is a difference between referring a matter to SIPO and making a formal complaint.</p></speech>

It raised a very serious issue for me in that there is the potential of some boards saying that they complied with the SIPO Act and regulations by simply referring issues on.  However, unless they make a complaint, SIPO is not obliged to carry out an examination.  It seems to me that this was missed for a huge amount of time.  It was only SIPO itself that decided it would carry out an examination.  I am not sure whether the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General was aware of it or had been alerted to it.  My issue is whether there is a difference between informing SIPO and noting issues arose and organisations actually making a complaint.</p></speech>

The origination of it was actually in the audit of the Family Support Agency for 2012.  We discovered that a director of the Family Support Agency had been claiming for attendance at the meetings, but the individual was also employed by a family resource centre in Waterford and was claiming there for attendance at the same meetings.  That created at difficulty.  The audit found that.  We brought it to the attention of the Family Support Agency.  In the audit certificates for 2012 and 2013 for the Family Support Agency, I drew attention to the fact that there was a difficulty there and that the matter was being pursued by the Family Support Agency.<br/><br/>I cannot comment on the individual or on anything to do with the individual, but I think the point raised by the Deputy relates to the agency and the governance of the agency.  The report produced by the commission on the matter does point out that the Family Support Agency reported the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reported back to say that it cannot proceed because it did not receive a complaint.  Similarly, when the matter was brought to the attention of the Standards in Public Office Commission, it was reported that there had been a double claiming but it did not name the individual.  Therefore, it did not constitute a complaint that the commission could act on <i>per se</i>.  The commission did pursue it with the agency, got the details and carried out an investigation subsequently.  I believe it does point up the difference between reporting something to an investigatory body and making a complaint to an investigatory body.  As it stands, the agency's last stated position on the matter was that it was satisfied that the moneys were appropriately paid to the individual.  As auditor of that agency, I do not take the same view.</p></speech>

We suggested to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that claims for travel and subsistence should always be through the employer.  If there was a basis for reclaiming those travel and subsistence expenses, we suggested that it be done agency to agency in order not to have a public servant claiming in two different places unknown to both sides.  The Department issued a letter of instruction.  Across the Civil Service now, that is the expectation.</p></speech>

We will check up on that.  I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  No. 458C is correspondence dated 2 May from Shannon Protection Alliance requesting the appearance of a report writer before the committee.  We decided at last week's meeting that this is a matter more suitable to the Joint Committee on Planning, Housing, Community and Local Government, as it is about a proposed plan that it has been examining.  Is it agreed to note that?  Agreed.  That is noted.</p><p> No. 465C, dated 28 April 2017, is from an individual who refers to Teagasc.  The correspondence states that if, in his opinion, the grievance procedure had operated correctly in Teagasc there would have been no need for the matter to go to the Rights Commissioner or the Labour Court.  However, the fact is that it did and both of these dismissed the person&rsquo;s claim.  The matter is now ten years old and I understand that this individual has retired from Teagasc.  I accept that he still feels aggrieved but it is not for the committee to deal with such individual cases or reopen a case that has received a hearing through all of the proper mechanisms available.  I propose that we write to the individual informing him that we cannot take his case further.  I ask the secretariat and the Parliamentary Legal Adviser to draft an appropriate letter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p> Nos. 466C(i) and (ii) and 473C are two items of correspondence dated 8 May 2017.  They are from an individual who has contacted the committee many times on a wards of court issue.  She claims, with regard to losses sustained by the wards of court fund, that the State should carry these.  She cites a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts held on March 2001 where the then Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform gave evidence to that effect to the committee.  She enclosed a copy of the transcript and I propose that we forward a copy of her correspondence to the Department of Justice and Equality for a response.</p><p> A response to the document was submitted by the individual on the Aon Hewitt Report of the Wards of Court Investment Scheme Spectrum Growth Fund, which was forwarded by us to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform some months ago.  The clerk has informed me that the report is expected within the next week.  We will hear back on that and we will also write to the Department of Justice and Equality because the wards of court issue continues. </p><p> No. 469C is further correspondence from a firm of solicitors, dated 8 May, on a client who seeks to address the committee in connection with the Grace issue and the standard of care provided by the HSE.  This item follows on from our discussion at last week's meeting.  We await a response from the HSE on final questions that were submitted following last week's meeting.  What do members propose we should do?  The whistleblower has requested a private meeting with the committee to discuss the issues.  We have already decided that Mr. Tony O'Brien will be invited back here to discuss the issues.  I remember reading the letter and I think her letter dealt with public procurement issues, which fall within our remit.  We will not stray into the care issue because it will be dealt with by the commission.  The person referred to procurement issues that may be part of the commission's terms of reference.</p></speech>

It was stated in court that the Deloitte report was not completed.  We will ask if it has been completed since then.  We were told we would get a copy of it once it was completed.  We will ask the HSE if it has been completed and, if so, to forward a copy to us.</p><p>The next item is correspondence No. 470C, (i) to (iv), from Deputy Thomas Broughan, enclosing copies of figures provided by the group Promoting Awareness Responsibility and Care on the Roads, PARC, in relation to drink-driving offences.  I propose that we send these figures to the Department for a response.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  I thank Deputy Broughan for the work done in that regard.</p><p>The next item is correspondence No. 471C (i) and (ii) from an individual which is dated 9 May relating to Howth Harbour, the management of which is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We also received another item of correspondence from the same individual last week and, as agreed, the clerk contacted the individual and clarified that the matter is being examined by the Ombudsman.  The individual told the clerk that although he was thankful that the previous Committee of Public Accounts took an interest in this matter, he feels that raising matters with the committee did not help in terms of how he has been treated by the relevant authorities.  I propose that we let the Ombudsman conclude his investigation and write to the individual to say that if there are matters outside of that investigation which this committee should examine, to itemise these for our consideration.  We will write back to him on that basis.</p><p>The next item is correspondence No. 468 B, (i) and (ii), a report from Mr. John Barrett.  We will not conduct an analysis of this report now but we have a substantial document in front of us today.  I want to make a number of observations arising from this document, which follows last week's meeting.  The first observation I will make, about which there is no dispute, is that the matters were brought to the attention of the Garda Commissioner in July 2015 and 22 months later, she still has not gotten to the bottom of them.  I would argue that 22 months is long enough to have dealt with an in-house matter in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am not satisfied that the Committee of Public Accounts was told last week that further audit work may not even be completed by the summer.  This committee is not going to wait beyond two years for a follow-through on these matters.  These matters were known in 2015 and were probably known to the Commissioner in 2014 when she was acting Commissioner.  In 2014, repayments to the OPW had started on foot of people being aware of the situation at that stage.  This is not a legacy issue.  It is an issue that is current to the current Commissioner.  It was brought to her notice on her watch and she has known about it for the past 22 months.  The meeting last week was outstanding but was not the conclusion of this matter.  We will want to see a further response sooner rather than later.  </p><p>Ms N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan has two roles.  She is the Garda Commissioner and is answerable to the Minister for Justice and Equality in that respect.  She is also the Accounting Officer for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts for financial matters.  I just want to read something into the record so that everybody is clear on the position of the Committee of Public Accounts.  The 2015 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to the responsibilities of Accounting Officers.  It states: </p><blockquote>In accordance with section 22 of the Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1886, the Accounting Officer is required to prepare the appropriation account.  By law, the account must be submitted to me [the Comptroller and Auditor General] by 31 March following the end of the year of the account.<br /><br />The Accounting officer is also responsible for the safeguarding of public funds and property under her control, for the efficiency and economy of administration of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and for the regularity and propriety of all transactions in the appropriation account. </blockquote> <p>The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published a document which was prepared by the current General Secretary of that Department for this committee.  It states:</p><blockquote>In their Accounting Officer role, which is personal and cannot be delegated, they are responsible for the stewardship of public funds and are required to give evidence on how they discharged this responsibility to the PAC. </blockquote> <p>It goes on:</p><blockquote>The fact that the duties of the Accounting Officer are vested in the most senior official in the organisation, who is personally answerable to the PAC, gives an important focus to managerial accountability for regularity, propriety and value for money in the operations of the Department.. The Accounting Officer cannot be acquainted with the detail of every transaction in the [organisation].  He/she ensures that proper mechanisms are in place to provide appropriate assurance about the regularity, propriety and efficiency of the [organisation's] operations.  These mechanisms are robust internal control systems; sound internal audit and Audit Committee arrangements; and effective risk management</blockquote> <p>The Department of Public Expenditure document elaborates further on the role of the Accounting Officer.</p><p>Ms. N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan is the Accounting Officer to this committee.  She is not here solely as Garda Commissioner but has a dual role.  The Accounting Officer's responsibilities are also set out in the Comptroller and Auditor General Act 1993.  I will not go through that now.  The statutory responsibilities of Accounting Officers <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the appropriation accounts are very clear.  The accounts, which are submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General, must be accompanied by a statement of internal financial control.  In addition, the Accounting Officer is responsible for safeguarding assets, the financial implications of policy, economy and efficiency, evaluation of effectiveness, internal audit, sanctions and grant procedures.  Those duties are personal to the Accounting Officer.  Our discussions here are in relation to the Accounting Officer.  </p><p>I will invite members to comment on this presently.  As I have said already, these matters were brought to the attention of the Garda Commissioner in July 2015 but 22 months later, we still have not got to the bottom of it all.  This committee - I am sure the members will agree with me on this - is not waiting any longer because 22 months is long enough for her to have gotten to the bottom of this.  The promise of another internal report, possibly after July 2017, is not the issue.  There is enough information in the interim report that was concluded in September 2016.</p><p>I want to move on to one other point about which I am personally concerned.  It might seem like a small point to some but it is significant, in my view.</p><p>We all know about the meeting held in July 2015.  Several months later, in 29 March 2016, the deputy commissioner requested an internal audit report on the Garda College in Templemore.  That is mentioned on page 10 of the report that we saw last week.  In September 2016 the interim audit report was presented to the head of the internal audit unit.  That was the first draft.  The reason I am referring to it is the correspondence received from Mr. Barrett refers to the fact that the head of the internal audit unit did very well to have the matter referred to in the statement of accounting policies and principles signed by the Accounting Officer on the 2015 accounts.  That was all agreed to in the first few days of September.  The Comptroller and Auditor General signed his audit report on 5 September 2016 on the 2015 accounts.  As a result of the internal audit, these matters were coming to a head.  The Comptroller and Auditor General insisted on there being some reference to them.  When I look at the statement of accounting policies and principles on page 318 of the 2015 appropriation accounts, signed by N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan, Accounting Officer of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, on 31 March 2016, the last paragraph reads as follows:</p><blockquote>Audit of the Garda College<br /><br />A number of issues associated with the provision of ancillary services in the Garda College, Templemore, have been identified which are not in compliance with current public standard corporate governance procedures.  A draft internal audit report has made a number of recommendations to ensure compliance with the public financial procedures which will be incorporated into any action plan to address these issues.</blockquote><p>As Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, that paragraph could only have been drafted and agreed to in the first week of September 2016.  The Accounting Officer, N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan, signed the document to include that paragraph later than 31 March.  That is the one signed document she has presented here before today.  Essentially, for items agreed to in September 2016, she backdated her signature by over five months.  I do not find it satisfactory that an Accounting Officer presented the appropriation accounts and the statement of accounting policies and principles to deal with matters to be dealt with in September 2016 and signed and dated them 31 March 2016.  I find it unacceptable; it is not accurate or appropriate.  I have to question the honesty of people who sign documents and have them backdated by over five months.  I will be requesting her to come and answer that specific question, the reason being that she would probably have prepared a draft &ndash; I am now trying to help her &ndash; as there is a requirement to produce the accounts for the Comptroller and Auditor General by 31 March, but it would have been far more honest if she had re-dated them in September, the day before the Comptroller and Auditor General issued his report.  I am not going to place any responsibility on the Comptroller and Auditor General who published the document.  His audit report of 5 September is clear.  This is the document signed by N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O&rsquo;Sullivan as Accounting Officer.  I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to respond.  It might seem to be a small matter.</p></speech>

The obligation is to present the appropriation account.  This, <i>per se</i>, is on page 7 and effectively the statement of moneys provided and the outturn which is compared with that of the previous year.  The practice we have adopted over the years is that we require the account to be presented to us.  Our audit process is a process of verification of what has been presented.  If we find at any stage that there is a figure in the appropriation account which is incorrect, we will ask the Accounting Officer personally to re-sign the new appropriation account with a current date.  However, in the course of an audit we may find that the explanations of variances are inadequate or the disclosures insufficient.  In that situation we go back to the Department &ndash; in this case An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na &ndash; and say it needs to make this adjustment, that it is not explaining it properly or that a figure in a note needs to be amended.  We do not require the Accounting Officer to re-sign in that situation.  Similarly, if there are changes in the statement of internal financial control, we will say to the Department that it must put in something extra because there is a breach of controls not noted in the account and that it is appropriate to bring it to the attention of the committee by disclosing it in the statement of internal financial control.  We have not insisted on the Accounting Officer re-signing.  Physically, the Accounting Officer did not re-sign and backdate it.  It would have been noted by the executive director of finance.</p></speech>

However, the onus is on the Accounting Officer of every Department who has responsibility for the statement of accounting policies and principles.  The Comptroller and Auditor General signs his audit report, while the Accounting Officer signs his or her report.  The clarification is that a document was signed on 31 March 2016.  We are entitled to rely on that document as having been signed on that date, as presented to us.  We now find that a paragraph written five months after that date was inserted into the document and that it was physically impossible to have signed off on it on 31 March.  I would have said the onus was on the Accounting Officer to re-date it because the Templemore College issue was significant.  It might not have changed the financial accounts, but it was an issue of significant concern to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>

When I see a statement signed by an Accounting Officer, dated 31 March 2016, I am entitled to believe, as the Deputy is, that the document and its contents were signed on 31 March 2016.  It is in black and white.</p></speech>

My opinion on confidence in the police is on record.  I am here, however, in a different capacity.  I am here as a member of the committee to consider the issue of value for money.  Matters arose on the last occasion on which clarification is certainly needed.  The Garda Commissioner needs to be given an opportunity to come here.  That is the way we should deal with the matter.  If we go down the route of saying &ldquo;misled&rdquo; and &ldquo;dishonest&rdquo;, we are making findings.</p><p>We may well want to do it but it is not our role.  Our role is to look at value for money and examine what is before us.</p><p> On the last occasion, Mr. Barrett produced a document that we just got this week.  We need to look at it and see the context of it.  It was referred to as "minutes" but it is his personal recording.  I advise caution and I say this as somebody on the record questioning the police and having a certain opinion.  I am hearing a different context.  We should put this down for a meeting as quickly as possible and it should not wait until July.</p></speech>

It is as a matter of fact misleading to present the facts in that way, not least as I understood from last week's hearing that it was very late in the day when the Comptroller and Auditor General was alerted to the facts of what was happening in Templemore.

Due process must be gone through.  Very serious issues came up after a very long day.  We need to look at what Mr. Barrett produced, come back and discuss it.  I urge caution and we should do that as quickly as possible in the proper context of our role in this committee, bearing in mind the delays we have seen.  There was a draft of a report in 2006 and reports in 2008, 2010 and 2015.  Various people, including the Comptroller and Auditor General, were not aware of the issue.</p> <p>  I will clarify something before finishing.  Yesterday in the D&aacute;il the Taoiseach stated the Comptroller and Auditor General was still looking at this.  I understand his report has been completed and it is what we are discussing.  He stated there were three inspections or analyses going on, with one of those coming from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Could we have clarification on that?</p></speech>

Clearly there are control matters that arise and we are examining the issue in that context.  I expect I will have a report in September in that regard.  That is the normal business.

The matters raised last week are serious not just for the Committee of Public Accounts but for the State.  I have the transcript of last week's meeting and I have read it a couple of times.  It is incredible to do so in conjunction with the documents that Mr. Barrett has now sent us.  It is like a jigsaw but the problem is the pieces do not fit.  There are contradictions all over the place.  There were contradictions in the evidence last week with the Garda Commissioner and her staff and between the Department personnel and Garda Commissioner, when they basically said opposite things.  The Garda Commissioner stated last week she started a process after the meeting of 27 July but was that process not begun beforehand, on 2 July by Mr. Cyril Dunne, the head of administration?  Did he not commence that process before the Garda Commissioner said she commenced her process?  In evidence, the Garda Commissioner said she started a process and the Department of Justice and Equality - representatives of which are coming before us in a few minutes - was involved straight away.  It is my understanding that may not be the case and it might not have been brought into the process until October.  It is important that the assistant secretary who sat here last week said the Department was not aware of the issues relating to Templemore until October.  If it was involved with the process from July, how was it not aware of the issues until October?  How in the name of God is there a Department of justice that is not aware of these issues in the first place, given the Vote it must manage?  Frankly, it is incredible.</p> <p>  I have another point before moving on.  On 12 April I raised many of these issues in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  In evidence last week, the Garda Commissioner and every witness, including those from the Department of Justice and Equality, stated they were not aware of the very specific issues I raised involving dates, times and people mentioned in the D&aacute;il on 12 April.  How is that possible?  There was a motion of no confidence in the Garda Commissioner but the Department of Justice and Equality, the Garda Commissioner and all the staff were not aware these issues were raised.  It is incredible.</p> <p>  This is incredibly serious and I agree with the previous speaker and the comments of the Chairman on the national airwaves.  We must deal with this quickly.  I do not believe we will deal with it in one meeting and if we need special sittings, we should have them.  We should do that very soon, possibly starting the process in a fortnight.  How far are we going to go with this?  This goes very deep and there are layers of issues.  There is a gold, silver and bronze amount of issues here.  There is the matter of what happened with the Garda Commissioner over the past couple of years.  There is the matter of how the internal auditor was not made aware of reports in 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2015.  There are also the issues relating to Templemore.  Mr. Cyril Dunne has left the organisation and Mr. Michael Howard is the external auditor.  Ms Anne-Marie McMahon has certain knowledge about Templemore.  Will we look into these matters by bringing in everybody who was here last week?  Will former Garda Commissioners be invited in?  Will we bring in the individuals who were here last week, those who have left the organisation or those who are currently in the organisation and who have critical knowledge?  Assistant Garda Commissioner Twomey has been referenced numerous times.  These are critical issues we need to decide now on behalf of this country so we can get to the bottom of what is going on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.178" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1346" speakername="Marc MacSharry" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#H01800"><p>I agree with much of what has been said already and with the Chairman's sentiments on the national airwaves this morning.  I was at most of last week's meeting, except for the end, but there were contradictions before that, particularly in terms of assessment of potential for criminality.  The Garda Commissioner clearly stated there was no question of that but Mr. Barrett was less sure.  I agree very much with Deputy Kelly in his sentiments about how deep we can go.  As Deputy Connolly stated, we are here specifically for value-for-money and accounting issues but we cannot fail to be cognisant of the fact that in parallel there are many other issues facing the Garda.  There is a major morale issue and people are entitled to have confidence in the police force.  Whereas there is no specific relationship, these accounting matters will contribute in a very serious way to undermining that even further.  Whatever we do, we need to do it quickly and to do it properly we will need to go into some level of depth.  That involves seeking to bring in former Garda Commissioners and people who have been involved so we can determine value for money and where money was used.</p> <p>  The second issue is the level of contradiction in last week's meeting.  As the Chairman stated, it is not a legacy issue; it is current.</p><p>To me it is a complexion and culture of delay to facilitate containment, damage limitation and cover up.  This seems to be the sort of autopilot that is allowed to run in Departments and it is wrong.  I do not know how we will manage this in terms of time but it needs to be our top priority given the implications.  I would also like to see Mr. Barrett, Mr. Ruane, Mr. Kelly and the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality without the Commissioner in the room if possible.  Whether it is appropriate to do this in private or public session I am agnostic, but I would like the ability to have an engagement with these individuals and put certain questions without, as it were, their boss sitting beside them.  These are my thoughts so far.</p></speech>

The allegations being made against the Commissioner-----</p></speech>

The public will want to know why this culture seems to be at play in the Garda, which Mr. Barrett has raised and Deputy MacSharry has raised, with regard to a cover-up.  Many witnesses are involved, and whether we bring former Commissioners before the committee will be up to the committee.  We must be mindful of Standing Order 186 and we have to look at the public finances above all.  We cannot pre-empt any political attacks for political purposes.  Obviously, having said that, there are serious issues here that need to be looked at and addressed.  If we are going to have credibility in the Garda with regard to internal mechanisms, in my view we need to question the Commissioner further and question any other witnesses whereby we can throw light on this.  We cannot have a situation where contradictory statements are being made and there is no clarity about what is happening.  I would like this dealt with expeditiously with regard to all of the witnesses brought before the committee.  There is also the caveat raised by Deputy Connolly regarding proceeding with caution.  We must be very careful of due process in this and ensure it is done correctly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#J00500"><p>Before we proceed, and before we have more meetings and invite in more witnesses, my view is we need to be very clear as a committee about what it is we are doing.  A committee established by the Commissioner is examining a number of issues.  Internal audit is still doing its work; what we have received is an interim report and it must conclude its work.  Mr. Kelly said this will not be done by July and that it will take some more time, but it is in process.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will do his work on the appropriation accounts.  It is not an actual examination, although that might come following whatever comes from his examination of these issues for the appropriation accounts.</p><p>It is very clear there was a breakdown in process, policies and procedures.  We have to get under the bonnet of all of this.  We have contradictory evidence.  We received a huge amount of information from Mr. Barrett, which is very helpful.  It is documented and contemporaneous.  We do not have the same level of information, by the way, from the Garda Commissioner.</p><p>I would like to see us putting some structure to our work.  First of all, we need to get all of the information we have sought.  We have the incomplete audit report from 2006, which has been referenced, the 2008 report that was ignored pretty much and a 2010 report.  There are documents that were over and back between the director of financial services and the Commissioner.  There are documents the chief administrative officer had.  There was information that should have been given to board meetings which was not given.  We need minutes of those board meetings.  There is a list of documentation and a range of documents we need first.  Then we need to look at who we need to bring in and who are the key witnesses.  There are people who were not in the room last time, for example, the chief administrative officer who, in my view, has questions to answer.  Even if retired, that person needs to be in the room.</p><p>I do not want to go into all of Mr. Barrett's points, but there is a key statement in his documentation which goes to the heart of all of this.  He stated:</p><blockquote>More worryingly it appears that a coordinated effort was made to ensure that Mr Niall Kelly, Head of Internal Audit, was actively delayed, dissuaded, or precluded from becoming involved.  Despite Mr Kelly's best efforts to get a copy of the 2007 report, he was denied access to it by senior Garda management.  This process of exclusion essentially closed down any prospect of the matters going beyond the walls of Garda HQ and becoming a matter visible to your committee [as in the internal audit committee], the C&amp;amp;AG, the Public Accounts Committee and thereby into the public domain.</blockquote> <p>It is quite clear that information was withheld from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, this committee, the Department and Garda internal audit.  These are allegations that are being made and that we need to examine.  They are more than allegations as there are also statements made by internal audit.  The head of internal audit said himself he was frustrated he did not get the information he sought.  We need to put structure to it.  I say, based on my reading of it, that all of this screams cover-up and collusion.  We as a committee need to take it seriously because it goes to the heart of the culture in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p>My recommendation to the committee is when we come back the next time we have a report which looks at structure, we get as much information as possible and we have a list of potential witnesses, then we decide when we do it and for how long we do it, and then we look at the internal controls in place within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the failures.  Essentially our job is to do all of this.  I propose this as a way to advance this.  What we do not want to have is a scattergun approach, whereby we end up bringing in witnesses who are in and out with a slap on the wrist and that is it.  I do not think that would be useful for us.  I want a Committee of Public Accounts report at the end of this.</p></speech>

We definitely need to have this dealt with much earlier.  I raised this matter with the T&aacute;naiste on 9 February on Leaders' Questions.  I was looking for a copy of the draft report that had been leaked to a newspaper and there was quite an extensive article in January as to parliamentary questions.  I was told by the T&aacute;naiste at that point that the Committee of Public Accounts and the justice committee had debated this at length.  I went back that same afternoon and I disputed this with the T&aacute;naiste.  I could find no record of it.  I pursued her for six or eight weeks, forwards and backwards, and she corrected the record in April in the D&aacute;il.  That was during the debate on the Charlton commission, at the beginning of February.  It is very important, and it was something that was quite interesting last week, that the Commissioner agreed the interim report came in draft form to her in September 2016.  Last week, on the record before the committee, she said there had been no change to the draft report.  The report on Templemore we debated has an interim report dated February 2017 which was published in late March or early April.  The role of the Department of Justice and Equality in this is important because when something is leaked to a newspaper it screams of frustration that there was something that was required to be publicly available.  There are questions to be asked when we are speaking about this with regard to the Department of Justice and Equality and what its knowledge was.</p><p>Why was this, when there was no change made to it between September and February?  </p><p> It did not take that long to read the report.  It was quite clear that what was included in that report was very significant.  Why did it take that length of time when we are talking about the frustration in bringing this into the public domain with the Garda?  There is an equal question regarding the Department of Justice and Equality bringing it into the public domain.  I want to see that dealt with by the people who come in front of us as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.186" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1300" speakername="Alan Farrell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#K00200"><p>I would like to state my full agreement with the remarks of Deputy Cullinane.  It is a rare thing.</p> <p>  The issue that we face is a process issue.  We need to determine what this process is going to be.  More important, we need to determine what it will be from the professional end of the process in terms of investigating what precisely went on and the manner of the investigation. </p> <p>  I would be of the firm view that, given the work the Comptroller and Auditor General is doing with regard to 2016 and the imminent completion of that work, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General should go back and look at Templemore as a specific unit, as well as all of the various processes that took place there and the various transactions involved.</p> <p>  It is very clear from the evidence given by the Commissioner and her staff that the internal audit unit within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is under-resourced.  I would question how seriously it is taking the matter in terms of its presentation of information, not just to the committee but also the fullness and openness to the State and Department of Justice and Equality.  The fact that it was withheld historically from the Comptroller and Auditor General speaks volumes in its own right.</p> <p>  Another issue comes down to the budget within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be able to get the work of the interim report done quickly.  In order to do that, it occurs to me that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na needs to bring in expertise to complete that work and support the section which currently comprises eight personnel.  I made that point last week, and I am making it again today because it is imperative that the Garda adequately deal with this issue so that we can get the interim report into the public domain in order that the Comptroller and Auditor General has an opportunity to review it at some point.  I appreciate that he has, no doubt, a full list of entities to audit.  It occurred to me and, I am sure, many others, that the only way we can achieve full disclosure in regard to the actions and behaviours in Templemore over a period of decades is for the competent authority of the State to go in and do it, and that competent authority is the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  It was an incredibly damaging revelation for all of us when the report on issues in Templemore was published.  With the greatest of respect to my colleagues, as Deputy Connolly pointed out there is no doubt that we will stray into territory which will effectively turn this committee room into some sort of courtroom.  We are not qualified to do that, nor are we allowed to do that.  Therefore, I am in agreement with Deputy Cullinane.  We need to set a very strict set of terms of reference for ourselves on what it is that we are seeking.</p> <p>  It would amount to an unqualified witch-hunt if we were to start line questioning the Commissioner, the Accounting Officer and other individuals in regard to gaps in the production of information and-or receipts etc. within Templemore over a period of years.  We need to consider a special report from the Comptroller and Auditor General or other competent investigative organisation, whatever that may be.  It may involve an inquiry of some kind from an accounting perspective or some other mechanism.</p> <p>  It would be very easy for all of us to go into a committee structure and quiz the Commissioner, the Accounting Officer, the head of internal audit and all the rest.  It would make great headlines, but would we actually achieve anything?  The scattergun approach to which Deputy Cullinane referred is entirely accurate.  There is a question of competency.  I appreciate we are all very good at what we do because otherwise we would not be here, but the truth of the matter is that there are competent individuals who are capable of getting to the bottom of the accounting practices and trying to come up with information.  If that information is not available, competent individuals need to draw their own conclusions as to that.</p> <p>  My final remark concerns the comments of the Chairman and the Comptroller and Auditor General on the audit process and a correction or clarification &ndash; whatever one wants to call it.  I would like the Comptroller and Auditor General to restate what he said earlier for the purposes of clarity.  What I and the Chairman took from what he said are two totally different things.  I want to make sure that we are all on the same page.  I am not an auditor or an accountant, but what I heard the Comptroller and Auditor General state was that in the course of his verification of the information that was provided an error or a lack of information was identified.  The Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General sought to have that clarification made.  It was made and signed, and the document was changed, as is the norm in an audit process.  I wanted to clarify that so we are all on the same page.</p> <p>  At the moment, I do not see that the Chairman is on the same page.  I appreciate his professionalism------</p></speech>

I will finish with the members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.188" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#K00400"><p>I remind the committee that the issues around the public domain and the matters of public concern were unearthed in this committee room.  This is clearly not a court of law, but it clearly is the Committee of Public Accounts of the Oireachtas and is regularly cited as the most influential and powerful committee of the Oireachtas.  Vested in us is the responsibility to follow the money from a value-for-money perspective and to follow the attendant processes and procedures.  That is what we should do.</p> <p>  It falls to us to get to the bottom of these matters.  For the purposes of assisting the committee, let me say that there is a very long historical hinterland to the story.  As a Deputy said it goes back decades.  I do not believe that we are in a position to, nor should we attempt to, examine all of that.  Rather, we should look to the here and now, the duration of the stewardship of the current Commissioner, as Accounting Officer, to examine exactly the turn of events, the audit, its procedures, the quality of the audit and so on.  In other words, the issues that we began to consider and examine in this committee room last week are what we should focus on.</p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane's point is that we need an orderly approach to this and conduct our business in a way that sheds light rather than simply heat.  That point is fairly made.  Any suggestion that holding the Accounting Officer, in this case the Garda Commissioner, to account amounts to a witch-hunt is very inaccurate and very dangerous from the point of view of the work that we do as a committee.</p> <p>  I suggest that we decide we will investigate these matters, and look to set out the parameters of our inquiries and their sequencing.  We need to put the Garda Commissioner, Garda management and all others on notice that we are looking for their full co-operation and active participation in this procedure.</p><p> I want to make a final comment.  Maybe this is a matter of technicality and detail for people from the auditing world.  I have to say I attach very significant importance to dates on documents.  I think most people would be in the same position as myself.  I am shocked to hear not that an alteration was made to a document, but that the alteration was not made explicitly clear.  I do not think that is the correct way to proceed.  I have no interest in a witch-hunt or anything else.  We have to be determined to do our jobs and our work.  I am not looking for a deferral mechanism to push this down the pipe.  These issues are at play now.  They are of huge public concern.  They are relevant.  They fall squarely within our remit.  We should decide precisely how we are going to do this.  I refer to the dates and so on.  Maybe the Garda Commissioner and her staff do not watch Oireachtas TV, but if they happen to tune into this episode of the Committee of Public Accounts, they should be on notice that we will be looking for all of them, individually and collectively, to co-operate fully and honestly with our inquiries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.190" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1349" speakername="Alan Kelly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051100002#L00200"><p>I will not repeat what has been said.  I agree with everything the previous speaker said.  This is no witch-hunt.  We have to do a job here.  This is a constitutional committee.  We need to get to the bottom of what is going on here.  I know we cannot go back forever.  We have to concentrate on the current Accounting Officer, who happens to be the Garda Commissioner in this instance.  Even more serious questions have been raised today.  Specific questions have arisen regarding the evidence that was given last week.  I am conscious that there is a huge amount of documentation.  I have gone through the transcript of what was said at last week's meeting.  I went through it twice.  I am conscious that various Deputies asked for specific documents, reports and emails.  For instance, we asked the Commissioner to check whether there was any email traffic during a certain time period which said that the internal auditor was to be kept at bay.  We asked for documentation in relation to certain financial stuff.  Anyone who goes through the transcript will see that many such requests were made.  I think we need to analyse the documents we asked for before we go through the next stage of this.</p> <p>  I will set out my suggestion.  We have some documentation from Mr. Barrett.  Requests have been made for other documentation.  We need that documentation as soon as possible.  I suggest we should write to the Garda Commissioner and the Department of Justice and Equality, as the two main players here.  The OPW is also relevant in this context because questions have been asked about the lands.  The OPW probably did not know for a period of time that it owned the lands.  It certainly did not know about the rent it was not actually getting.  We should write to the Department, the Garda and the OPW to ask for the documents and references that were sought last week.  After a gap period of a week has been allowed to enable us to analyse that information, we should start the process of looking at the issues we all know we need to get to the bottom of.  I agree with what Deputy MacSharry said earlier on.  I believe multiple sittings, including special sittings, will be required.  This will have an effect on our diaries.  If we were to bring in the garda&iacute; and the Department in two different segments, that might be a good process.  We might have to break it up like that.</p> <p>  I suggest that in the next few days or the next week, members of the committee who feel that certain individuals in various roles need to give evidence should write to the clerk to ask for those people to be included and to justify their inclusion by explaining why they think those people are relevant.  This will be necessary so we can make sure we can bring out the fullness of what we need to bring out.  I suggest that we write to the relevant parties to ensure we get the documentation we asked for, in addition to any further documentation my colleagues might wish to get, and that we begin this process the following week by bringing in witnesses as suggested by the Chair.</p></speech>

My personal belief is that the power enjoyed by the members of this committee is accompanied by a great responsibility.  We have a huge responsibility to assess the evidence in a very fair manner.  We have to be very careful to focus on getting to the bottom of the truth here.</p> <p>  I have concerns about some of the comments that have been made, especially those questioning the honesty of the Accounting Officer.  That is not appropriate until we have done a stress test on the evidence of both sides of this debate.  We have to do stress tests on Mr. Kelly's evidence and Mr. Barrett's evidence.  I believe we are putting ourselves in a position where we are prejudging the outcome.  We need to be very careful on this.  I would like the Comptroller and Auditor General to set out the position in respect of the comments that have been made about the signature.  Was the Commissioner and Accounting Officer asked to re-sign the document when the paragraph in question was inserted?  In his view as an auditor, did she do anything wrong in that process?</p></speech>

The interim internal audit report cites all of the documentation anyway.  We may have additional documentation we are seeking.  Maybe we could contact the clerk to make our own requests.  I suggest that at the next meeting, after we have gathered all the information, we have to agree on the scope of whatever examination we are to do and on who will be called as witnesses.  t would be useful if we could get a report that maps or scopes that out.</p></speech>

When we meet next Thursday, we will have a list of the documentation, a proposal - we will call it a plan - for how we are going to do our work and an approximate timescale.

The legal obligation is for the Accounting Officer to submit the account by 31 March.  The account was submitted by 31 March.  There was no change to the account <i>per se</i>.  That process dates back to 1866.  There have been many additions to appropriation accounts since then.  The statement on internal financial control has been around for approximately 20 years.  It is an extremely important document, but it is not one that we completely and wholly audit.  We look at it to see whether there is any information known to us in the course of the audit that would suggest there is anything wrong with the statement.  My understanding is that the internal audit had started by 31 March, or at least that internal audit had been notified of the thing.  We were only told about it on 31 May.</p><p>When the statement on internal financial control came to us, signed by the Accounting Officer with a date of 31 March, there was no reference to the internal audit in it.  We pointed out that there should be such a reference because it was so significant.</p></speech>

Over the summer we engaged with them and told them we needed to know what was going on in order to complete the audit.  My understanding, and something which becomes clear from Mr. Barrett's documentation, is that the interim internal audit was needed before the appropriation account was produced.  We were pushing all summer to get something.  Without having the report itself, but only the summary, we said to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that it had to put something into the SIFC.  This is, apparently, a breach of controls and this is the whole point of the SIFC.  We need to ensure that the appropriation account is right and if there is any different treatment of transactions, balances or liabilities, even contingent liabilities, they need to be recognised.  We are looking at the implications for the OPW appropriation account too, because there may be issues there and disclosures may be required.</p> <p>  It is for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to sort this out and to make the changes to structures and controls, etc.  We will be looking to see that An Grada S&iacute;och&aacute;na is addressing the matter and if continuing adjustments to its system of control are needed in respect of the college, it should disclose them to the SIFC for 2016.  We already have it and at the moment, what is in it is not sufficient for the purposes, so there will be an adjustment required-----</p></speech>

From the Department of Justice and Equality, we are joined by Mr. Noel Waters, Secretary General, Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Mr. Jimmy Martin, Mr. John O'Callaghan, Mr. Seamus Clifford, Mr. Ben Ryan, Mr. Eugene Banks and Ms Bernadette Phelan.  We are also joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy.  From the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we are joined by Mr. John Burke.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.</p><p>I wish to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Before I call the Comptroller and Auditor General, for the information of members of the public, I will immediately suspend the meeting following the opening statements because there is a joint sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas to hear a statement from Mr. Michel Barnier.  We will resume at 2 p.m.  I will take the opening statements only.</p></speech>

Members can see that programmes A, B, and C account for the bulk of the expenditure.  Expenditure of &euro;152 million on the programme to Maintain a Secure Ireland includes expenditure on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service totalling &euro;47 million and on asylum seekers accommodation of &euro;57 million.  The latter expenditure is the focus of the report being considered this morning on which I will comment shortly.</p> <p>  Spending related to the operations of the Probation Service accounted for &euro;35.5 million of the &euro;51 million of spending under programme B, Work for Safer Communities.</p> <p>  Expenditure on legal aid services accounts for &euro;86 million, or 69%, of the programme on Facilitating the Provision and Administration of Justice.  A further &euro;10 million was spent on the Forensic Science Laboratory and the State Pathology Service.  This programme also provided for expenditure of over &euro;10 million on commissions and inquiries, details of which are set out in note 6.3 to the account.  The committee may also wish to note spending under this programme of &euro;5.45 million in respect of the Magdalen fund, as against a funding provision for the year of &euro;11.5 million.</p> <p>  Across the Vote, salaries accounted for 35% of the expenditure.  At year end 2015, a total of 2,233 full-time equivalent staff were employed in the Department and the other offices funded from the Vote.</p> <p>  On the receipts side, appropriations-in-aid totalled just over &euro;64 million.  Over 70% of this related to a range of fees charged in respect of immigration registration, nationality and citizenship certification, and visa issuance.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the report before the committee.  Since 2000, the State has met its obligation to provide for the material needs of asylum seekers while their applications are being processed by offering accommodation and food at what are known as direct provision centres.  In addition, residents of direct provision centres are entitled to a small weekly allowance paid by the Department of Social Protection and to avail of health and education services funded by the relevant Votes.</p> <p>  The report before the committee this morning examines the procurement and management of contracts for direct provision centres.  As of December 2015, there was a total of 35 direct provision centres in operation - seven State-owned centres and 28 centres provided by 22 commercial suppliers.  Almost 4,700 individuals were being accommodated in the centres at the year end.  The Department also operates two emergency reception and orientation centres to cater for persons who already have refugee status.  The total cost to the Department in 2015 of providing accommodation and related services to asylum seekers and refugees was &euro;57 million.</p> <p>  The level of accommodation required is demand led and difficult to predict.  It is influenced by the number of asylum seekers, their length of stay in direct provision and, because there is no obligation to avail of direct provision, the number who opt to do so.</p> <p>  The report notes that in mid-2016, the average length of stay was 38 months with 450 residents, or 10% of the total, living in direct provision for more than seven years.  Some  23% of residents, or 950 people, continued to reside in direct provision even though their cases had been finalised.  This included 667 people or 16% who had been granted a status permitting them to remain in Ireland, and 283 or 7% who were subject to deportation orders.</p> <p>  Two commercial companies were contracted to provide services such as catering, cleaning and maintenance at the seven State-owned centres.  We found that competitive processes had been used to procure those services.</p> <p>  In contrast, the Department had not used competitive processes as set out in public procurement procedures to procure the 28 commercially-owned and run centres.  Instead, it seeks expressions of interest, evaluates the responses and then agrees contract terms with selected providers.  The Department&rsquo;s view is that this equates to the negotiated procedure provided for in EU procurement rules.  However, use of that procedure is only permitted in certain limited circumstances that we could not see existed in regard to direct provision.  The Department stated that it discussed the matter with the Office of Government Procurement but had not identified a procurement method to replace the current procedure.</p> <p>  The examination also found that effective management of contracts was made more difficult because not all contract deliverables had been expressed in a way that could be quantified or measured.  This increased the risk that standards of accommodation and services would not meet asylum seekers' needs or would be inconsistent between centres.  In addition, contracts did not set performance measures and there was limited provision for penalties for underperformance by suppliers.  The Department agreed to the report's recommendation to review the standard contract, and the Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee in that regard.</p> <p>  Service delivery in the centres is monitored by physical inspections of premises, information clinics for residents of centres and reviews of complaints by residents.  However, the findings from this monitoring are not collated and used to assess service delivery performance.  The Department committed to introduce procedures to formally record such inspection findings and complaints, which should inform discussions with centre managers and owners.</p><p>Even though there was a low level of complaints by residents, information from other sources suggests that there is a significant level of dissatisfaction among residents about the quality of the accommodation, the services provided, or both.  A revised complaints procedure introduced in 2015 provided for an appeal to an independent appeals officer where a person was not satisfied with how his or her complaint was dealt with.  However, at the time of the examination, an independent appeals officer had yet to be appointed.</p><p> The report recommended that the Department review the complaints process to identify reasons why residents may not be raising issues.  The Department noted that the revised complaints procedure largely addressed this issue but undertook to examine ways to make the complaints process more open and transparent.  Members may also be aware that, from early April this year, residents of direct provision can now bring a complaint to the Ombudsman, or to the Ombudsman for Children, if they are unhappy with how their original complaint was dealt with.</p></speech>

In all, there are over 60 individual subheads across six expenditure programmes.  These reflect the work of policy areas dealing with everything from crime to land registry, reform of criminal and civil law, and an increasing number of regulatory bodies and front-line services in areas such as the immigration service and Forensic Science Ireland.  From 2016 onwards, the programme approach reflects the high-level goals in the Department&rsquo;s current strategy statement.  Other structural changes since the appropriation account for 2015 relate to the establishment of the Policing Authority as a separate Vote and, following a transfer of functions, the Department has now assumed responsibility for Ordnance Survey Ireland from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.</p> <p>  In the briefing provided to members, I outlined that legal proceedings regarding the use of an office premises in Wolfe Tone Street, Dublin 1 by a community-based project funded by the Probation Service had concluded in late 2016.  This will be fully reflected in the appropriation account for 2016 and it was previously the subject of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General in 2012, in the 2011 report.  The central issue in this case was the assurance provided by the vendor about planning permission for the premises.  The Comptroller and Auditor General outlined that it was reasonable for the Department to rely on the legal advice provided about the planning permission.  Following legal advice, a settlement of &euro;1.8 million was agreed and paid by the Department during 2016.  Although we are dealing with 2015 today, I mention this matter because the committee had previously inquired about it.</p> <p>  Turning specifically to the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on contracts for direct provision, I want to outline briefly the reason this system exists.  I also want to give committee members an update on some developments in the system in recent years, in particular since the 2015 report.</p> <p>  Services for all protection applicants, whether living in State-provided accommodation or in commercially-provided accommodation, are delivered under the Government policy of direct provision and dispersal which dates from 2000 when the then health boards, which were responsible for homeless services, found themselves unable to cope with the dramatic increase in the number of people seeking asylum in Ireland.  There are obviously many parallels with the homeless issue that exists now.  By May 2000, some 1,500 applicants were being provided with accommodation and full board by the Government.  Members may recall that, 12 months later, this had increased to 4,200 and by May 2005 it had grown to 7,200.  From 2000 to date, some 60,000 people have been accommodated in direct provision.  Equally, they have been provided with full access to the State&rsquo;s medical and education services.  The system is not perfect by any means and we are continually seeking to improve it.  The reality is that had the State not adopted the direct provision system, there simply would not have been even the most basic shelter available for this group of people who arrived and continue to arrive in our country.</p> <p>  At the start of this year, 4,465 persons were living in this accommodation.  However, I am glad to say - this is a significant change - that, of those, 72% have been there for three years or less since the date of their application.  This compares to 36% who were there for three years or less when the data was compiled for the working group on direct provision and related matters in 2015.  To put it another way, there has been a complete reversal in the length of stay figures since the working group examined the matter.</p> <p>  Full board accommodation in keeping with the policy of nationwide dispersal is offered to residents while their application for protection is being processed.  It is important to note that not every person who seeks international protection in Ireland chooses to accept the offer of full board accommodation and many choose to live with family or friends in communities across the country, as they are entitled to do.  If this system was not in place, already vulnerable people who have sought protection in the State would join the lengthy waiting lists for social housing or enter the private rental market with little hope of finding affordable and secure accommodation.  This is the very situation that obtained which gave rise to the direct provision system being put in place in the first place.  The offer of State-provided accommodation is a guarantee that every person who walks into the international protection office today will, tonight, have a bed, full board and access to medical care.  Moreover, those people's children will have access to our first and second level education system on the same basis as anyone else.</p> <p>  No system is without room for improvement and our challenge is to continually enhance and develop the entire system so that the best possible set of facilities and services can be provided to those in our care.  To that end, we are working to implement the recommendations of the McMahon report.  Some 121 of these recommendations have been implemented, with a further 38 recommendations partially implemented or in progress.  In total, 92% of the 173 recommendations are implemented, partially implemented or in progress.  Recommendations that involve structural changes or improvements will be implemented as quickly as possible, having regard to fire safety, building regulation and planning issues and some others are policy matters for other Departments.</p> <p>  I mentioned earlier that good progress is being made in reducing the length of time applicants are in direct provision while having their claims finalised.  What we believe is a further major turning point in addressing the length of time issue is the coming into force of the International Protection Act at the end of last year.  This Act, with its single application procedure at its core, has ended the inefficient sequential Refugee Act 1996 application process with its inherent structural problems.  It brings us into line with the processing arrangements for protection applicants in all other EU member states.  In truth, that process was, by its very nature, a major underlying factor in causing significant delays in deciding cases.  That, in turn, was causing major delays in moving applicants on from direct provision centres, either as recognised refugees or with other forms of permission to live in the State or as applicants which were refused and were no longer permitted to remain in the State.  The clear ambition now with the new Act when it is fully embedded is that we expect cases to be dealt with in finality much sooner.  Indeed, some cases have already been finalised since the beginning of the year.</p> <p>  Arising from the McMahon report and the programme for Government commitments in 2016, a number of physical improvements to accommodation are being implemented, for example, the introduction last January of new home cooking arrangements at the Mosney accommodation centre.  Each family is now able to acquire fresh food so that they can prepare their own meals.  Cooking facilities are being introduced in other centres including the State-owned centres in Killarney, Tralee, Athlone, Knockalisheen in Limerick and Kinsale Road in Cork, and in Ballyhaunis, Millstreet, St. Patrick&rsquo;s in Monaghan and any other centres where families are living.  From 3 April last year, as the Comptroller and Auditor General noted, the remit of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children has been extended to cover those who are living in State-provided accommodation.</p> <p>  The Department has also co-ordinated the preparation of a comprehensive information booklet for persons who have been granted any type of leave to remain in the State.  The booklet contains practical information for residents across housing, finance, health care and education as well as public transport and other related matters and has been prepared with the assistance of the National Adult Literacy Agency to ensure that it is presented in plain English.  The booklet has also been translated into a number of languages.  In addition, a number of NGOs have been awarded grants under the EU asylum, migration and integration fund, specifically to provide assistance to persons who have been granted protection and who are now in a position to move out of State-provided accommodation.  Notwithstanding the current housing crisis, we are working with residents and the NGO community to assist people, when they get permission to remain, to find mainstream housing as soon as possible and ensure that the State-provided accommodation remains available for those in most need.</p> <p>  Direct provision, which has elements common to it in the reception systems in place in other EU member states, has many critics.  Most criticism centres around the inordinate length of time people have remained in it while waiting for their protection claims to be finalised.  As I said, we are addressing that across a number of fronts as we are the other quality of life issues.  There are no cheaper alternatives to direct provision.  We have explored the options in this respect; in fact, they are much more expensive, and in any event, given the critical shortage of housing in the State, they are not realistic.  Nevertheless, we remain open to any workable proposals which would drive down costs while maintaining standards and fulfilling the requirements of public policy of balanced nationwide dispersal, direct provision of accommodation-related services and access to education, health, welfare and so forth on the same basis as the general community.</p></speech>

It has come to my attention since the earlier session that I inadvertently gave incorrect information to the committee about the revision of the statement on internal financial control for Vote 20 - An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I said this morning that we raised the requirement for the revision with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and that is correct.  That arose from the audit.  I asked that the revision be made when I carried out my detailed review of the audit on 5 September 2016.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provided us with wording for the adjustment on 13 September and at the same time gave us the internal report summary.  We agreed on the wording that should be included in the statement.  The Accounting Officer did sign a revised statement on internal financial control on 16 September.  It was supplied to us and I reviewed it on 23 September 2016.</p><p>We should have changed the date on the statement of internal financial control, as published and also on the audit certificate.  I should have picked up on this myself and I apologise for that oversight.  The circumstances were exceptional and we will be reviewing our finalisation process for appropriation account audits.  I am happy to answer questions in regard to it.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General brought this to my attention at the last moment.  My statement this morning regarding the certificate of internal financial control that is in the published appropriation account was dated 31 March 2016 and that is the date on the document presented to us, signed by N&oacute;ir&iacute;n O'Sullivan.  I took that in good faith as presented, published and printed.  Now the Comptroller and Auditor General has confirmed that it should have picked it up by themselves, and they did; the Garda Accounting Officer did agree a revised statement and did re-sign that statement on 16 September.  That is the date that should have been in the documentation that was presented to us.  I am in an unusual position but what I said this morning based on that date was in good faith on the basis of the dates and the signatures in front of me in the report.  It was not the fault of the Accounting Officer in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but I now realise that the wrong date is in the document and I regret any disturbance or upset caused as a result.  I stress that this was in good faith and on the basis of the document presented to me at that time.  We have clarified a matter which is helpful as a result of this morning's debate.</p></speech>

I accept the unusual circumstances that prevailed that the Comptroller and Auditor General alerted us to.  The difficulty is that this has made national headlines and we may need to go further than correcting the record of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I am not sure if statements came from the Chairman in regard to this this morning but that needs to be clarified so that the media organisations also know, not only the ones who are listening here.  All these issues are now tied into the wider matter of the Garda Commissioner and related questions and any of these attract national attention.  That extra step may now be necessary.</p></speech>

The Committee of Public Accounts recognises that there was wrong information before us this morning.  We appreciate the Comptroller and Auditor General's honesty and integrity in coming forward at the first opportunity to correct this morning's record.  He did so very promptly and we acknowledged that he did so at the first available opportunity.  A press statement will go out from his office and our own.</p></speech>

There was some confusion earlier in regard to this.  I appreciate the Chairman's bona fides but one of the reasons I mentioned Standing Order 186 earlier, is that we try not to pre-empt political attacks without having all the facts before us.  There are very serious concerns regarding some aspects of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na without adding further, unnecessary attack.</p> <p>  We need to tread carefully in this committee.  I have not seen the headlines to which Deputy Cullinane referred but I accept that there probably are headlines.  There is a lot of attention on this committee.  I am not saying that the Chairman is trying to maximise political capital but in future perhaps there is a way that if there are financial irregularities such as the Chairman mentioned these could be clarified with the Comptroller and Auditor General in advance.  Otherwise we cause unnecessary furore and time wasting when it is not in anybody's interest to do that.</p></speech>

I did issue a cautionary word this morning in regard to this.  These are the most serious issues that have arisen from the report that we discussed last week.  I do not think that we should make statements, as Chairman or otherwise, or even in the media, in regard to this.  There is a process under way and we should give it our full attention.  We do that 99% of the time.  We are here to look at value for money, the history of why it was not picked up sooner, the total mess that was made of it - which we will come back to - and our job is to get the Commissioner and the appropriate witnesses back in here as soon as possible.</p> <p>  The real issue which remains unchanged is that when the report of accounts was produced in March there was no caveat on it.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The reports were produced, they were signed off by the Accounting Officer, who happens to be the Commissioner, and there was no caveat or indication that difficulties had been discovered.  On top of that, the comments in the D&aacute;il from the Taoiseach, do not help.  He referred to this as a legacy issue and he made reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General investigating, neither of which is accurate.  It is difficult and we are trying to avoid that and remain neutral.  We have all made statements but it is different in regard to our job here.  Since his appointment the Chairman has chaired our meetings in an excellent manner.  It would be well for us to learn from what has transpired today because we are heading into troubled waters and we have a serious job to do.</p></speech>

She is completely correct.  I appreciate the correction and clarification and the suggestion of putting it out publicly.  In the terminology I used this morning, this has highlighted how charged this subject matter is and how quickly media outlets and, indeed, ourselves will seize upon issues that are liable to cause headlines.  I know the diligent manner in which members, and also including our witnesses, have approached this up to now, and it is very important to take note of such issues and how quickly the outlets pick up on them.  I saw the article on the RTE website, I did not see it elsewhere but I am sure they were probably there.  Deputy Cullinane's suggestion is welcome given that the media are no longer present because the issues that were of most interest to them have passed.</p> <p>  I want to reiterate one remark by Deputy Connolly about the manner in which the Chairman has chaired these meetings.  He has been excellent and beyond reproach.  I appreciate comments made by other members in this morning's session about the misunderstanding which derived from the particular publication of a document and the statement by the Comptroller and Auditor General that no date change was requested.  We now know where we are and that is the most important thing.</p></speech>

I welcome the fact they have been given a clear audit opinion for 2015, with a number of highlighted items, which I would like to briefly touch upon.</p><p>In one particular instance in Mr. Waters's opening statement, he said the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined that it was unreasonable for the Department to rely on the legal advice provided on the purchase of a property on Wolfe Tone Street, Dublin 1.  I appreciate Mr. Waters's earlier remarks that the matter has been subject to   Comptroller and Auditor General reports in the past and is now broadly settled with the exception of the planning permission issue.  It is mentioned that assurances were provided by the vendor.  In the due diligence, which any person would complete, did Mr. Waters seek in-house or external advice on the purchase of the property?  Will he outline to the committee when the planning permission issues will be resolved or have they have been resolved in terms of the occupation and use of the property?  </p><p> On foot of the response to that question, is there any possibility of come-back on the basis of flawed advice which, effectively, have resulted in a very significant sum of money being paid by the taxpayer to resolve the matter?</p></speech>

As Accounting Officer for the Department, I greatly regret that.  I greatly regret that public funds have been used in that manner.  As I said in my statement, this has a long history.  Ultimately when the Department and the Probation Service engaged on this, they relied on legal advice and the advice of the Chief State Solicitor who indicated it was in order to sign the lease on the basis the planning permission was in order.  At the time, the Comptroller indicated it was in order for us, that we were entitled to rely on that advice and we did.  The process by which advice is given in these cases is that the vendor or leaseholder warrants that the planning is in order which he did in that particular instance.  As far as we were concerned the planning was in order.  We went to refurbish the property and we spent about &euro;1.9 million doing that.  At that point, some of the local people objected as they are entitled to.  They notified the Dublin City Council planning office which in turn served us with an order to say we could not proceed.  The actions followed from that.  Ultimately we found ourselves in a situation in which we had a property with a 25-year lease period with a break period after ten years and an annual rent in the order of &euro;300,000 which we could not use because of what happened.  My predecessor decided at that point we should cease paying the rent because the State was already subject to expenditure which was nugatory.  He also decided on foot of legal advice to seek to bring the leaseholder and the planning architect to account for having made a mis-statement.  That process went ahead and ultimately it led to a situation in which our legal advice was that if it had gone to a full court hearing, we would have lost.  I cannot entirely give our legal strategy here.  We were left with a situation in which we could risk further taxpayer money going to court or get out of it.</p></speech>

Our best estimate was to walk away from it.  It is quite counter-intuitive.  I came into this on my appointment about two and a half or three years ago.  I found it incredible because we had done nothing wrong as a State organisation and the other side had clearly done something.  It is a matter of legal opinion about whether or not it was a mis-statement but we found ourselves on the wrong side of this, which was completely counter-intuitive.  My initial reaction was to ask if we could find an alternative use.  At that point, I looked within the organisation to see if we could find some other body within the organisation that would take up the accommodation.  Ultimately, it did not come to anything.  We had a number of new bodies about to be established but it did not suit for one reason or another.</p></speech>

The arrangements we entered into are allowed for and we were fully compliant in ensuring we were transparent about it.  They related to a number of different areas involving specialist knowledge, urgency or security considerations.  An example that is very much in the news is the commission for the location of victims' remains.  There was quite a significant amount spent in respect of it.  It is very specialised work, which involves people seeking a particular type of equipment or travelling abroad.  It would not be readily available on the open market.  The amount for the year was almost &euro;700,000.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Mr. Waters contended that the Department is compliant with EU guidance on such matters but it is clearly not compliant with the OGP.  Given that the OGP was, I think, established in 2014 - please correct me if I am wrong - I appreciate that there may have been rules that the Department is getting used to adhering to, but in the context of this budgetary year, 2015, and-or any other budgetary year, it has had knowledge of the Comptroller and Auditor General's assessment for some time.  Has it put in place measures to comply in so far as possible with procurement rules as applied to those 22 private service providers?</p></speech>

We continue to work with the OGP with a view to having a completely open and transparent procurement arrangement and we have ambitions in that respect.  We hope to be able to make some progress on it this year but our colleagues in the OGP have indicated to us, and we accept, that the particular model we use is such that it is very difficult to devise an open tendering competition that will deliver the service that we need.  That is the nature of direct provision.  It is demand-led.  It can fluctuate dramatically in a matter of months and go down to very low levels.  That is one aspect of it and another, which people generally do not mention in respect of direct provision, is that Government policy is also dispersive, with a balanced dispersal around the country.  From the word go, the Government wanted to ensure that every community in the country got its fair share of asylum seekers balanced in accordance with the medical facilities, general practitioners, education and all the local services available.  Our job at the time was to ensure we gave effect to that while at the same time dealing with a humanitarian crisis.</p></speech>

In terms of the remit of the Committee on Public Accounts, however, does Mr. Waters believe in the long term that continuing to invest in private service providers gives value for taxpayers&rsquo; money or should we provide such facilities directly, given that there was a 130% increase in the number of asylum seekers in 2015?  Over a long period, would that net a reduction in the overall expenditure?</p></speech>

I have some knowledge of this from my time in charge of this area at the start.  The Government decided then that we should have a balanced mix of options, commercial owners such as we have, hotels, hostels, guest houses and State-acquired accommodation.  We were quite successful in acquiring State accommodation at the start of the process but we ran into difficulties almost immediately once we started to move people into provincial Ireland where we had ten properties.  This featured at this committee in the mid-2000s, where it was not possible for us to place asylum seekers because we ran into very serious difficulties with communities.</p></speech>

I take the Deputy's point about the numbers of people coming into Europe which impacts on Ireland, but there is no guarantee that they would be needed in ten, 15 or 20 years' time.  Our colleagues in The Netherlands found themselves in that exact situation.  They had acquired significant numbers of properties for the state and found five years ago that they had to offload approximately 15,000 spaces onto the market.  That demonstrates the difficulties.  We are committed as best we can to having an open tendering competition and we remain in close liaison with the OGP with a view to ensuring that.</p></speech>

The daily rate per person is of the order of &euro;30.  Two years ago, it was a little higher at &euro;31 or touching &euro;32.  It varies according to the nature of the services provided in different centres.  I am talking about an overall rate.  It has come back a little.  Conversely, in the State sector, where we have a full procurement exercise and we have gone to the market and have just completed the exercise, the rate has increased from &euro;15 per person per day to &euro;20 per person per day.  The effect of going to an open tendering competition has been to increase the cost to the State.  There are, however, other issues around ensuring that this is a completely transparent process.</p></speech>

There is entitlement to health benefits as if the person had a medical card and certain other things.  These people would be missing out on all those aspects.

I do not need to ask that question.  I know the answer.  I appreciate that there is no intermediate position.  Clearly, that is not satisfactory.  I struggle to see how that is the Department's problem, given that the legislation was drafted by this House.  I served on the committee that wrote it.  At the same time, it is a very difficult position from a compassionate perspective.  It is very troubling that we are talking about another year and a half, at least, before this matter is resolved.

Up to now, we were waiting for the assisted decision-making legislation.  Quite a few private individuals had their relatives made wards of court so that their cases could be processed in that way.  Nearly all the 90 women are in forms of sheltered accommodation like nursing homes.  We are going to approach the authorities in the nursing homes to see whether they might be willing to take on this role by making ward of court applications.  I hope progress can be made in this way by the end of the year.  When the assisted decision-making legislation kicks in, it will take over.</p></speech>

My final question to the Department relates to payroll overpayments, which is a common issue in my experience.  There is clearly a discrepancy between the number of payments that have been made and the number of recovery plans, full repayments or both that have been made.  Can the witnesses highlight to the committee the reason for that?  Given the reduction in the number of personnel in the Department in the period in question, what is being done to minimise the overall number of incorrect payments that are being made?  Could the witnesses outline briefly any particular rationale or reason for those overpayments in the first instance?</p></speech>

The new sick leave scheme for the public service, which began in 2014, halved the amount of sick leave people can take.  It was a considerable reduction.  Every time somebody goes over that limit, every absence thereafter is without pay.  That kicks in earlier.  That is one of the elements of it.  As payrolls across the Civil Service are generally processed in advance, changes cannot be made at short notice.  That means we are automatically in arrears when these limits are exceeded.</p></speech>

Issues arose when this was bedding in at the same time.  That gave rise to the increase in overpayments.  There was a substantial reduction of 16% in overpayments during 2014.  We are still working on it to get it down further.  Various options are available to employees who have overpayment situations.  We have to bear in mind that there are hardship cases.  People have housing and mortgage issues, etc., as a result of the downturn in the economy.  When the hardship option has to be applied, it is applied with sensitivity from the human resources side.</p></speech>

Various options are available to people as they go through the process.  After someone has made a case to PeoplePoint, the matter goes to the human resources side to check whether he or she has a serious illness, for example.  Obviously, a different approach is taken if he or she has a terminal illness.  Differing approaches are taken depending on the person's age and the amount of the overpayment.  In the case of an employee who has 30 years of service ahead of him or her, a certain approach might be taken in the case of a small overpayment.  The actual plan is only deemed to be in place at the end of the process of putting a plan in place.</p></speech>

It is a matter of great frustration for us, as the heads of our organisations, that we are unable to get to the bottom of this to drive it down to the point where the State is not left in this situation.  The work is ongoing.  We are not giving up on it.  It is proving particularly difficult to get to the bottom of it by reaching a point at which the numbers are what we would consider to be acceptable.  I assure the Deputy that there is no lack of energy in our attempts to tackle the problem.</p></speech>

Everything follows on from that.</p> <p>  In a wider sense, if I go back a little bit, the Minister for Justice and Equality of the day is the person responsible person for delivering the resource allocation for the entire justice Vote.  That includes the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Prison Service, the Courts Service, the Department itself and all the agencies of the Department.  That is negotiated in the Estimates process.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is responsible to Parliament.  That is a key issue for the Department in supporting the Minister of the day in negotiating that budget for the Garda and all the other bodies.</p> <p>  The up-to-date position on oversight and accountability is that the Policing Authority was established at the beginning of last year, 1 January 2016.  The Policing Authority is an independent body and its role is to provide oversight of the provision of policing services in Ireland by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is independent of Government and reports to the Minister on its role.  When the legislation to establish a Policing Authority was being considered, the Government and the Department sought legal advice on how far it could go in giving the accountability function for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to the Policing Authority.  It was deemed at that time that policing was a core function of the State and in those circumstances the Minister continued to remain accountable in the sense of political accountability for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to Parliament.  In respect of financial accountability, the Accounting Officer is clearly delineated to the Commissioner.</p></speech>

I am not asking Mr. Waters to account for that person.  There is a strong possibility it was wrong and there is certainly an allegation it was wrong.

References were made by a Mr. John Barrett, who is the executive director of human resources, that many of the accounts that were signed off were potentially compromised.  If I were sitting in the witness's position, I would be looking at the possibility of compromised accounts that were signed off on, with money transferred from accounts managed by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at a time when one of Mr. Waters's predecessors was an Accounting Officer.  There is the potential for irregularities so I would be looking at taking some sort of action; I am wondering what sort of action did Mr. Waters take.</p></speech>

It is from a letter sent to Mr. Niall Kelly, who is head of internal audit, dated 12 October 2016.  It states:</p><blockquote>I am particularly concerned about how this matter was deliberately and systematically kept outside the purview of the statutory audit committee?  How it came to pass that reports specifically prepared on the financial arrangements in the Garda college were not shared with either you or the audit committee?  The open and essential question is how the annual returns made to the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Finance, signed off on by the Accounting Officer over all the years since the 2005 Act made no reference to millions of euro held in these unauthorised accounts</blockquote> <p>One could argue it pertained to the time prior to the 2005 Act as well.

If, following the appropriate inquiry, any of this emerges as the true position - I am not doubting anybody's <i>bona fides</i>on this - I would of course be concerned.  That applies if any issues arose giving rise to a completely inappropriate management of public finances and taxpayers' money.  Of course I would be concerned.

He said it should have happened in 2006, if my memory is correct.</p></speech>

Why was that not established?  Why has the Department not asked internal audit for a breakdown on that?  What was the Department doing and what was the look-back exercise seeking to achieve?  What years was it covering?  The witnesses read the report and know many of the issues go back an awful long time.  They involve multiple bank accounts, leasing of land, money shifting from different accounts and, potentially, money that is spent inappropriately.  Some of this goes to a period when Mr. Waters's predecessor was the Accounting Officer.  The 2006 report was one of the first flags and I am asking why the Department did not follow up with internal audit on the period being examined by the report.</p></speech>

It is very important for us to get a sense of where people who have responsible positions in the public service sit on all these issues.  While the Department is no longer the Accounting Officer, obviously there is still a relationship between it and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Given the gravity of the issues raised in the report, the strong inferences from some of the civilians in management positions that information was concealed, that reports were not given to audit committees or to the Comptroller and Auditor General and that information was not acted on or was withheld from interested parties, including the Department, I ask Mr. Waters to give us his views on all that.</p></speech>

I would welcome that.  That is a major development as far as I am concerned.  Whatever needs to be done on foot of that will be done in respect of the Department.  There is one point that I need to make here.  The Department is not a back seat driver of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Department did not run Templemore training centre.  It is important to note that we were not involved in the nitty-gritty details of what was going on in Templemore at that stage, no more than we were in terms of any other part of the Garda estate or apparatus.  We were not involved in that.</p></speech>

I established, at the beginning of my questioning, the relationship between the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We established that prior to 2005 the chief Accounting Officer for the spending of money by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including by the Garda training college, was Mr. Water's predecessor.  That is the issue and my questions were framed in that context.  This is not about the Department micro-managing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is about processes and financial controls which seem to have failed.  They seemed to have failed not only on the watch of the current Garda Commissioner and her predecessors, but also on the watch of the Department.</p></speech>

To carry on with the car analogy, I appreciate that the Department is not a back seat driver but it is our job to make sure that the Department makes sure that the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda management are passing their NCT every year but from what we are reading, they are not.</p> <p>  I am going to ask a series of questions and would appreciate if the witnesses would indicate in their answers whether they are speaking on behalf of the Department or in a personal capacity, that is, on the back of departmental or personal knowledge because there is a difference.  I understand that the witnesses have not been in the Department forever and they cannot know everything.  That is impossible because they have only been in their current roles for a limited period.  However, I ask them to distinguish between departmental knowledge and their own knowledge and to specify when they need to find out more information.  </p> <p>  We had a very long engagement last week and a lot of questions were raised.  Regarding the financial reports from 2006, 2008 and 2010, are the witnesses saying that the Department had no knowledge whatsoever of their existence?  What level of knowledge did the Department have of the existence of all three reports?</p></speech>

In respect of 2008, in the course of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na preparing for the meeting of the committee, it found a document on file that indicated that the then Commissioner, Mr. Fachtna Murphy, spoke briefly to the then Secretary General some time in June 2008 about issues in the Garda training centre.

I have said before that for me and the public it is incredible the Department was not aware of the issues going back further.  The Commissioner, to be fair to her, on numerous occasions stated that she believes the Department was aware.  She said, "To clarify, it is clear that the Department had knowledge going back to 1988, though I am not sure of the exact date."  To be fair to her, I do not think she could be sure.  She continued, "There were indications, prior to the Commissioner becoming Accounting Officer, that the Department had an involvement in the structure put in place for a funding model for the Garda College."  She also makes reference to 2008 and that there was a meeting with the Secretary General.  For me, given that and what we have established through the other questions, it astounds me there was not knowledge in the Department about these issues.  It also astounds me there was no knowledge of this.  It is, frankly, incredible there was no knowledge.  When the Secretary General became aware of these issues in 2015, what did he do?  I presume he acted with great haste.</p></speech>

That committee's main purpose was to try to resolve the legal issues that had arisen in relation to the Sportsfield Company and the ownership or leasehold of the land that the golf club was on, and also to address and resolve a number of other issues that had come to the fore in relation to accounts, including investment accounts.

Since 12 April, what has Mr. Waters done about the issues that have been raised?  What actions has he taken?  I presume, straight after 12 April or even straight after last week the Department went into action mode and made big decisions and went to find out what the hell was going on.

He is subject to quick-fire questioning.  The main focus of my questions today is on direct provision, which is the main item on the committee's agenda today.  Deputy Farrell touched on some issues earlier.</p> <p>  I appreciate where Mr. Waters is coming from when he said the Department is not a back-seat driver.  From the perspective of the Committee of Public Accounts and the public in general I will use the analogy that they do not want to see the Department as the driver of an uninsured vehicle.  When one thinks of it in those terms it is quite a strong metaphor and that is the reason the Committee of Public Accounts is taking this line of questioning today, in particular bearing in mind last week.</p></speech>

The authority has written to the T&aacute;naiste since to say that given that a lot of the recommendations are due to be implemented by the Commissioner by July, the authority's view is that a report by the end of July would be more appropriate and the T&aacute;naiste is satisfied with that.  So we expect the report to come towards the end of July or maybe early August.</p></speech>

I appreciate all the witnesses' bona fides in that regard.  Could the Department do anything further on this matter that is not being done at present to allay the public's concerns?  As the witnesses will appreciate, we are under pressure to represent the public at large who want to have confidence in the Garda.  To use the analogy again, the Department is neither the driver nor the back-seat passenger.  What can we do to ensure this does not arise again?</p></speech>

We need to get that process.  As the Deputy knows, it is under way and we are getting the first report in July.  Listening to the conversations here this morning, if this committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General were to examine this by whatever means that would be a useful exercise as well.</p></speech>

It was agreed back in 2011 or 2012 that it would be a good idea to merge the Valuation Office and Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority into one body, called Tailte &Eacute;ireann.  That is essentially why we have it.  Given that we have the Property Registration Authority which is the bigger of the organisations and which, as the Deputy knows, is involved in anything to do with property, it was believed by Government that the other two organisations would come to us and that we would effect the merger of the three organisations.

That is the second strand.  We are now working our way through that with bringing people here from Greece to Ireland.</p></speech>

There are two strands to deportation as practised.  The first strand are people who, for example, arrive in Ireland off a flight today at Dublin Airport who do not have the appropriate documentation and who are refused leave to land and returned.  This happens pretty much immediately.  In some cases, depending on the flights, it may be the following day.  Last year, approximately 4,000 people who attempted to enter the State were returned on this basis.  Primarily the great majority of them were on the basis of fraudulent documents.

I raised the issue on the floor of the House on 9 February during Leaders' Questions with the T&aacute;naiste who said, in a very dismissive fashion, that the report had been sent to the Committee on Justice and Equality and the Committee of Public Accounts and that it had received full scrutiny.  I did not challenge the T&aacute;naiste on that but when back in my office I checked and found there was no evidence that this was the case.  I e-mailed the Department of Justice and Equality and drew attention to the fact that the information I had been given was incorrect.  I had written to the Committee of Public Accounts seeking this matter to be timetabled and for the report to be provided to the Committee of Public Accounts at that stage.  This was in early February.  I accept that this was a draft report until February because it was February when it became an interim report and ceased to be a draft.  Was Mr. Waters aware of that?  Somebody must have replied to me because the reply said that there was an error and it was not the Committee on Justice and Equality that dealt with this issue but that it was the Committee on Public Accounts that dealt with it.  I then had to take it up with the T&aacute;naiste because the only reference to the Committee of Public Accounts and this issue was my notification to the Committee of Public Accounts seeking the publication of this report.

I was sent the draft audit report by the head of internal audit in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in September 2016.  It was sent to me to fact check and to see if there was any reference to the Department that we might want to question or query.  In his letter to me the head of internal audit requested that I treat the contents of the draft report as confidential and not divulge in any way the extract of the report that had been sent to me.  He said that consent was given for the disclosure of the extract of the report to our legal professional adviser.  Most of this is irrelevant as I was not named in the report, but at that stage the report was in draft and it was my understanding that he had equally sent it to everybody else who was named in the report asking them to check and to make sure they were happy and to consult any advisers that they wanted to consult.  The report was still in that process until it became the completed report in March 2017.  It is not about the fact that the report did not change much between coming to us in September 2016 and what it finally looked like.  During that period it was out with all the parties that were named in it so they could go back to the internal auditor and for him to then finalise his report on the basis of the observations he received.  It was not open to the T&aacute;naiste to publish the report.   It was not her report in the first instance and it was still in process at that point.</p></speech>

I will move on.</p> <p>  With regard to the negotiation of procurement procedures for the commercially owned and run direct provision centres, the Comptroller and Auditor General said in his report this morning that use of that procedure is only permitted in certain limited circumstances which we could not see existed in regard to direct provision.  Why was it presumed that it would be appropriate in that particular context?</p></speech>

We had looked at all the other options.  We started out on the basis that when people arrived into the State, they were given supplementary welfare, accommodation and apartments and that very soon we had reached a crisis situation, which is not dissimilar to what we have at the moment.  More people had been encouraged to come in and we found ourselves in a situation where people who had arrived to Ireland as protection applicants were living homeless in Merrion Square and the Phoenix Park.  The Government decided to introduce a system of direct provision and dispersal.  It also decided that when this happened there would be a mix of accommodation options comprising commercially run centres, State-owned accommodation and what were then known as flotels.  The floating hotels were not sustainable and did not become an option.  We went about giving effect to that Government decision and we managed to acquire some State properties but we ran into serious difficulties with other provision.  The commercial sector, effectively, took up the slack in dealing with that.</p></speech>

We want, if it is feasible, to be able to get to a more open tender situation as quickly as possible.  We want to do that but as I indicated earlier, the irony is that when we did that in respect of the State sector, it ended up actually costing more than in the commercial sector.  However, that is no reason, as far as we are concerned, not to put this out to the market.  We are engaged with the Office of Government Procurement to try to get that done.  It is very difficult because it is not a question of just procuring accommodation, but also of procuring services in local communities all over the country and trying to establish a marking system that will take that into account and not favour one group of people over another.  It is a serious difficulty.</p></speech>

Clinics were then set up as a control measure in terms of seeing what the standards were like.  Very vulnerable people were asked for information which they may well have perceived, rightly or wrongly, that it would not have been to their advantage to give.  Has the Department done anything about the provision of penalties for underperformance by suppliers?  If so, I ask Mr. Waters to provide details.</p></speech>

A centre with 300 people, for example, could end up losing &euro;3,000 if it does not perform to the measures set down which could relate to food, the cleanliness of rooms, the provision of other services and so forth.  There are clear performance measures in place which contractors are obliged to adhere to, which is a new development.</p></speech>

People can make a complaint to the Ombudsman and if that office decides to take up the complaint, the process involved can be quite lengthy and sometimes the office does not take cases on.  Was there a beefing up of the offices of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman for Children to ensure that there would be sufficient capacity to deal with complaints from direct provision centres?</p></speech>

I am assuming, on that basis, that they had their own internal resources to enable them to take on the additional workload that would go with that.</p></speech>

As a country we have been criticised repeatedly about direct provision in the context of human rights.  We can always do things more cheaply.  However, we must look at things in the round.  We must balance the cost of direct provision against meeting our human rights obligations.  Where does that come into the equation?</p></speech>

That is the balance we are trying to strike in respect of the process that we have in place at the moment, the negotiated procedure versus ensuring that we get appropriate value for money for the taxpayer.  We could put a contract out for tender and look for a facility for a few hundred people.  Let us imagine that a facility exists already in Skibbereen but a bidder in Bandon comes back with a lower price who can meet all of the service level requirements.  In that situation, we would be uprooting hundreds of people from their home in one town to bring them to another town.  We must consider all of the trauma and issues that go with that, in terms of access to housing, health services and so forth.  We do not do that and that is why we have found it so difficult to find a tendering process that meets our needs so that we can continue to act in a humanitarian way.  We have no interest whatsoever in uprooting families and people from their homes just for the sake of moving them on to another town up the road.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Mr. Waters makes reference to the sizeable number of people in direct provision who should be moving on but cannot do so because housing and other services are not available to them.  Is the Department dealing with that issue?  Is this coming out of the Department's Vote?  Direct provision was originally intended to be short term and this is prolonging something that is already overly long.  I know that the time spent in direct provision has been reduced but it is still overly long.  Is the Department engaging with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government on this issue?  Is the Department of Justice and Equality picking up a cost that should be picked up by another Department?</p></speech>

We have found ourselves in a situation where approximately 640 people are in direct provision centres who are entitled, in law, to be in Ireland.  They have the Minister's permission to be here but they remain in direct provision because they are not in a position to access housing.  Our Department is picking up the costs associated with that.  Again, to go back to the humanitarian point, other European countries might force people to leave State-provided accommodation in those circumstances but we do not do that.  We think that would be completely wrong to put people who have gone through the process and ended up being recognised as refugees or granted leave to remain, out on their ear.  We do not do that to individuals or to children and families.  We are meeting the costs in that regard.</p> <p>  I will  ask my colleagues to give the committee a sense of our engagement with NGOs and other Departments to try to expedite the process of moving people on.</p></speech>

As people in State-provided accommodation get status, they are linked up, as far as possible, with the local authority and any local housing agency to see if they are eligible for the HAP scheme or to receive rent allowance.  The managers in most of our direct provision centres will provide references if necessary.  The NGO community has been given funding under the Asylum, Migration, and Integration Fund, AMIF, programme to assist people to move out of State-provided accommodation into permanent homes.</p><p>All of that happens organically on the ground daily.</p></speech>

The explanation given for that underspend was that fewer new applications were received in 2015 than was expected.  A number of applications could not be processed as further investigation was necessary in order to make a determination in those cases.  In some cases there is a shortage of information.  I am working with one individual who is very dissatisfied that she is not being believed at this point, because there are no records that back up where she was.  She spend four or five years in a Magdalen laundry but she was told that she spent six months there.  She has spent her whole life in institutional care.  Are there many other cases in which there is that kind of dispute about where people were and where people will not accept what they feel is not truthful?  Are there cases where people who have been denied justice for their whole lives feel that the lack of records sides with the institutions rather than with the individual?</p></speech>

When we started off in this, we were concerned that while some of the institutions have good, comprehensive records, some have no records at all.  In practice, we have built up a certain level of expertise within the Department.  We do not rely on institutional records alone.  We check out school records, social welfare records and tax records to see whether somebody was active.  There are very few cases of disputes about whether a person was in an institution.  If a person was in an institution with records, and the record shows that a person went in and went out, we tend to rely on those records, but we double-check that against other evidence.  This would include whether the person was making social payments, which suggest he or she was working, and whether there is a record of the person in another institution - for example, he or she might have been in hospital.  Therefore, it is quite rare that somebody would be concerned about not being paid because of a lack of records.  Normally the dispute centres around a person having been in an institution which that person regards as a Magdalen laundry, but which is not one covered by the scheme.</p></speech>

That is what I read at least - that he said that this money was Templemore's, that it was not getting enough from the Government and that it could invest the money.

Those were the main issues that came to light at that point.  The immediate focus of the steering group - the committee that was set up by the Commissioner - was to address those issues while at the same time causing an internal audit to be conducted that would get to the bottom of all the other issues and identify whether there was any fraud or irregularity.  During the period that that committee was sitting and before the draft internal audit report was produced, the work that that committee was overseeing was around resolving the legal issues with the Sportsfield company, closing down the accounts, and using up or getting rid of the resources that were sitting in the investment accounts.  It was aimed at addressing the issues that still existed at that point in time while awaiting the internal audit report.</p></speech>

It is a very challenging issue, not just for the Department and agencies but in respect of attitudes in society.  We need to have a debate on it because everybody expresses outrage when they see the body of a dead child but, when people look for the provision of services, the outcry is "not here".  People are outraged by images on Facebook but when faced with the reality of helping people there is a different reaction.  A debate is needed, in a committee such as this and in wider society.  These debates have happened in my own county of Meath over many years, with Mosney one of the largest centres.  I have many happy memories of the area as a holiday camp as a child when cousins from Dublin would come out to see the country and breath the country air.</p></speech>

I doubt if the experiences of people there today are as happy.  The Department is faced with a difficult situation with the concept of the facility and the experiences of people within it.  It has been the subject of much commentary nationally and locally, in the Drogheda Independent, the Meath Chronicle or LMFM.  The centre looks well on a sunny day at the height of the holiday season but it is a different place in November and December.  The vastness of the area on a cold day can resemble other types of camps.  It has been described as a prison without the armed guards and the barbed wire.</p> <p>   On the issue of operators, the point has been made that it is a big business and it has also been the subject of a lot of commentary.  In his opening statement, Mr. Waters said there were no cheaper alternatives to direct provision.  He said that, in the open market, tenders came in with higher prices.  I want to explore that.</p><p>Obviously, Mosney is commercially owned.  Mr. McCluskey owns it.  I served on the board of Meath Tourism with him.  However, in terms of the profits being generated, can Mr. Waters explain the terms used when the Department is analysing the prices paid for a facility such as Mosney at the get-go?</p></speech>

It has to take into account the provision of food, light, heat, clothing, rates, water, television licences and the entire range of facilities available in any home.  All the families in Mosney effectively have their own front door, if I can use that phrase.  All the services provided to that home are paid for by the State through the payments to the companies in question.</p></speech>

Is it a fair price in the view of Mr. Banks?  The report from the Department states that - because this is some years later - cooking facilities are now being provided for residents in Mosney.</p></speech>

A 2010 study on value for money was carried out.  It identified that, on the basis of what was being delivered at the time, the services represented good value for money.  It was very difficult from that report to identify another model that would represent the same degree of value for money in delivering the services.</p></speech>

However, the Comptroller and Auditor General makes the point that, because there was no competitive procurement process, the risk of the best price and quality accommodation and services not being obtained was increased.  That point was made in terms of the Department making that adjudication.</p></speech>

We mentioned this earlier.  The rates per person per day are remarkably similar to what they were five or six years ago.  This year, they are a little lower than they were last year.  The rate is approximately &euro;30 per person per day.  Some years ago, the rate was &euro;32 per person per day.  The rate paid in the State-owned sector, that is to say, where accommodation is provided by the State, at the moment is &euro;20 per person per day.  There is no capital cost on the contractors.  It is provided directly by the State.  On foot of a procurement exercise, that increased from approximately &euro;15 to &euro;20 per person per day.  In the round, we are getting good value.</p> <p>  It is difficult to measure this when we do not have direct comparators.  The nearest comparator we have is what is being paid, as we understand it, in respect of emergency accommodation in the Dublin area for homeless people in hotels.  The most recent figures I saw suggested that something of the order of &euro;50 million was paid last year to provide accommodation for approximately 900 families, of which 700 were in hotels and the remaining number were in different, mixed accommodation.  That is the nearest equivalent.  Apparently, that worked out at approximately &euro;55,000 per family per year.  Our metrics show that we pay approximately &euro;12,000 per person per year.</p></speech>

Even though what is being provided by the city council is not still acceptable, the point is that people can walk out their doors and access facilities in the city centre.  People in Mosney are a long way from accessing any type of facilities for their day-to-day lives.  Last year, the State paid &euro;43.5 million to eight direct provision operators.  Mosney was one of the biggest, and received &euro;7 million.  The point is that it is big business.  I note the point made by Mr. Waters in terms of what was spent in Dublin as well.</p> <p>  Another point was touched on in terms of the low level of complaints.  The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to that as well.  Does Mr. Waters believe there is a problem in this regard?  I know a lady in the camp in Mosney, Ms Khumalo, who is a former sportsperson of the year from Zimbabwe.  She is living with her ten year old daughter, Ivana, in a small house in Mosney.  She said that when she got there, she did not really care where she stayed.  She simply wanted safety and that direct provision did not define who she was.  She also said that it defines the Irish protection system towards asylum seekers and how it perceives the people as economic migrants, of second-class nationality and opportunists.  She did not want to give out.  She had positive energy towards bettering her life, rather than complaining about the direct provision system and possibly transforming and developing her life.  She is beginning a course in legal studies at Drogheda Institute of Further Education.  I know people in the Louth Meath Education and Training Board are dealing with the education facilities.  How much is being invested in the educational facilities aspect?  I know this is of interest to people in my constituency.</p></speech>

That was the subject of the Irish Refugees Council report on children in direct provision relating to decent child care facilities and so forth.  What is the situation?</p></speech>

In particular, there is a child care facility in Mosney.  It is provided through a combination of the centre and charitable institutions.</p> <p>  I wish to make another point in respect of the remoteness of Mosney.  Where a centre is outside an urban area, the contractor is obliged to provide transport to meet the reasonable needs of residents.</p></speech>

I am only teasing it out.  Mosney has become a long-term centre.  Has it been analysed in terms of alternatives?</p> <p>  That leads me onto my next point.  We are all well aware of the difficulties in accessing accommodation.  What is the Department's role in terms of this issue, the Rebuilding Ireland programme and the contribution of the Department to that programme?  Is the Department dealing with this issue as well?</p> <p>  Earlier, Mr. Waters indicated that the Netherlands has purchased a lot of property.  Mr. Waters indicated that the Department is not keen to go down that route on the basis that if it obtained property, it would somehow be a wrong move to commit to that process.</p></speech>

That has actually happened.  Other considerations arise as well.  We tried that at the outset.  We acquired several hotels throughout the country.  We found that local communities were not accepting of it.  Some launched judicial reviews.  In one or two places, they blocked us using the facilities.  We found that this was not going to be a successful outcome so we moved away from it.</p></speech>

Obviously, this transcends to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in terms of the debates with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy English.  How is the Department of Justice and Equality dealing with this?  Is it sharing its strategy?  Is the Department making the point that it does not want to go down that route because of the fear of long-term accommodation in communities?  Is that a philosophy the Department is sharing with the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government?</p></speech>

Clearly it would require substantial public expenditure.  The envelope available to the Department is limited.  We also have our own priorities.  For example, a big priority for us in the next couple of years, reflecting the views of Oireachtas Members, is to ensure we will have a new forensic science laboratory.  It will be a very expensive project.  We have to measure it against the available funding from the Government and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  If anyone can come up with a better model, we are quite open to considering it.</p> <p>  I wish to make one other point.  We expect to be in a position fairly soon where people who apply for asylum will have their applications dealt with within a period of perhaps nine to 12 months.  In the European model, if someone does not have status within nine months in particular cases and he or she has co-operated with the system, he or she will be given limited rights to work.  Whether we would wish to do that will be a decision for the Government at some point, if we get to it, but it is important to demonstrate to the committee that our minds are not closed in examining the options.</p></speech>

I am just trying to get a sense of the real long-term policy.  On the one hand, the Department is ruling out actual integration, but, on the other, it seems to have been scared off the process of acquiring buildings for fear of threats in local communities.  That is why I prefaced my remarks.  As a society, are we not moving into that space?  We saw what happened in Ballaghaderreen and elsewhere.  Is that it?  Are we moving away and saying there are no other options?  On what is happening in the camp in Mosney, obviously improvements have been made, but, knowing the standard of facilities there, was it humane from the get-go?</p></speech>

However, it has been improved and we are working to improve all facilities.  One of the key issues which was referenced in the McMahon report is that people need independence in their lives.  One of the best means of ensuring independence is providing the opportunity to cook for oneself.  We already have this opportunity in Mosney and are working with other centres to ensure it will be implemented as quickly as possible.</p></speech>

It cites the opening of a bank account named Garda Student Sport with the Bank of Ireland which opened in 2015, and it was opened without consent.  For the auditor to arrive at that conclusion he or she presumably had to go through a process of verification.  I assume, on the basis of simple reason, that part of that process must have been to check with the Department of Justice and Equality.  Did he check with the Department?</p></speech>

We accept that these are established matters of fact in this report.  I would appreciate if the witness could come back with the facts on this situation.</p> <p>  Section 41 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 obliges the Commissioner to inform the Minister and the Secretary General of the Department in a whole range of different categories.  These are not optional.  One of those is in circumstances where there is evidence that matters might bring the reputation of the force into disrepute.

She specifically raised questions about the opening of bank accounts.  The final paragraph on page 20 of the internal audit report, which is up on the screen, states:</p><blockquote>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Sportsfield Company Ltd continued to operate with Garda College Management as Directors.  The legal standing of the actions of these directors since 2005 is questionable.  Even in the period prior to 2005 it is questionable whether Garda&iacute; as public servants should have been acting as Directors of what was set up as a private company without being appointed by or having the expressed permission of the Minister for Justice ... no evidence was found of any Garda&iacute; having received permission from the Minister to act as a director.</blockquote> <p>To Mr. Waters's knowledge, did the Department receive requests from any member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to become a director of these companies?  If so, was permission granted?</p></speech>

Back to 1992 and the late 1980s, there would have been many paper records and there is a registry with Kardex cards and so forth.  We checked the registry to see whether there were any registered files that referenced this kind of matter and there are not.  Audit files are not retained in that form.  Audit up to the noughties was not as professionalised and detailed as it has since developed into.</p></speech>

My understanding is, because there was confusion when he was having an exchange of views with the Deputy, that the Garda Commissioner became aware of the alleged financial irregularities and the issues that arose from the audit report at a meeting with Mr. John Barrett.  There is some disagreement as to whether it was a five-minute meeting or a two-hour meeting but she was certainly briefed.  Following that, she was given legal advice.

Deputy Connolly spoke about the question of how some of these centres were run and the level of curtailment of the rights of some people who were residents in these centres.  In 2009, when I was a local councillor in Waterford, I received correspondence from a residents association which was set up in one of these reception centres.  They asked me to come and meet them in the centre, which I did but I was refused permission to meet them on the campus because I was told that it was a private company and I had to be given permission.  I was not aware of that and I asked for an alternative date but was not given one.  I asked why I was being refused permission and was told because it was a private company and it did not have to give permission.  I was not comfortable with that and the residents wanted the meeting on site in the place they lived.  They had issues in regard to how the centre was managed.  I was then asked to leave and ultimately barred from the premises.  Garda&iacute; were called although they never arrived.  I have heard the description being used a few times that these centres were being run like prisons.  It struck me that was how I was treated as a public representative, if that was my experience when all I wanted to do was to have a meeting with residents, how then were people living in the centre treated when we were not there?  There was a view that some of these centres were being run on the lines of "out of sight, out of mind".  Given my experience as a local councillor and how I was treated, being told by a manager that I was barred simply because I was looking to meet with residents, how does that square with the idea that these centres are being run well and with people being treated well?</p></speech>

If the witnesses are telling me that there were circumstances in which the State allowed electoral material which was posted directly to residents in reception centres not being handed or given over to people who lived in those centres and that was actually policy, that raises constitutional issues for the Department.

Mr. Waters may not agree but that is my view.</p> <p>  I have also given examples of where I was personally told that I was barred from one of these centres, merely because I turned up to interact with the people who lived there at their request.  That might not be an issue for Mr. Waters but it is an issue for me because everyone has a right to be represented, including the people who live in those centres.  I will ask Deputy Connolly to come in.    </p></speech>

Moreover, another politician was allowed to bring a bus to a direct provision centre.  We could provide anecdotes until 10 o'clock tonight but these cases give an indication of how people in direct provision are treated.  There should be complete clarity surrounding the rights of residents of direct provision centres.  That is not the case at present and the Secretary General is not in a position to state whether the example cited reflected policy.  I ask the witness to clarify the policy for the committee in writing.</p> <p>  I have a few practical questions.  On the housing assistance payment, HAP, if someone receives refugee status and cannot find a home, for example, in Galway city where we have a major housing crisis, I understand he or she will be left in limbo, as it were, as it is not possible to access entitlements without an address.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It also has many other issues to look into.  I am familiar with the position in Galway, where there is a major housing crisis.  I cannot see people in direct provision who receive refugee status getting out of direct provision any time soon.  I raise a practical one and ask the Secretary General to check what the position is for me.  Are people who find themselves in the circumstances I described in a double bind?  If they find a house, they will receive the housing assistance payment but if they cannot get a house, they cannot get a housing assistance payment.  Is it the case that in such circumstances, the person is unable to access entitlements?  Can Mr. Waters revert to me on that issue?</p></speech>

This meeting is one in a series on the potential impact of Brexit on areas identified as falling within the remit of the committee.  At the end of a series of hearings over the coming weeks, the committee will prepare a report on the potential impact of Brexit.  I welcome the witnesses on behalf of the committee.  We look forward to hearing their thoughts and opinions on the implications, positive and negative, of the decision by the people of Britain to leave the European Union.  Now that Article 50 has been invoked, we have seen movement on both sides to set out negotiating positions.  In this regard, both sides have referred to the unique position of Ireland in the process.  The format of the meeting is that we will hear the witnesses' opening statements before moving to a session of questions and answers with members of the committee.</p><p>Before we begin, I remind members, witnesses and the people in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference with the recording and broadcasting equipment in this room, even in silent mode.  Today's meeting is being broadcast live on Oireachtas TV and across various other media platforms.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I call on Professor Murphy to make his opening remarks.  We will then hear from Professor Barrett.</p></speech>

It is always a great honour to be in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am happy to be here in my capacity as a professor of politics at Dublin City University.  I do not propose to read out the opening statement which I submitted but rather to allude to parts of it.</p> <p>  The decision by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union represents not simply a profound shock but a real and deep crisis point for the European integration project.  Since its creation in 1951 with the Treaty of Paris and, six years later, the Treaty of Rome, the EU has been inspired by the idea of ever-closer union.  To all intents and purposes, that has clearly been sundered.  Brexit has shattered that illusory idea and the UK's departure from the EU has revealed deep flaws that cut through the European Union's constitutional fabric.  It has challenged our constitutional understanding of the European project.  I do not consider the European Union to be simply an entity; rather, I consider it to be a project which has brought peace and stability to the continent.</p> <p>  Brexit represents in many ways the greatest crisis since the Union was founded.  Brexit is tied up with wider issues in the European Union and in Europe itself.  We have seen the rise of nationalism which is still a potent force in British and European politics.  The results of the French presidential election show that.  Brexit shows it.  The presidential election in the United States of America also shows it, as does the rise of nationalist parties across the Continent who wish to sunder their countries from EU.  This presents a significant problem for the Union.</p><p>The decision by Britain to leave may represent a timely window for us as Europeans to rethink the foundations of the EU.  I consider myself ardently pro-Europe but even the most ardent pro-Europeans cannot deny the state of the EU is not strong.  It has bumped from one crisis to the next, sometimes at the very risk of its own survival.  The euro crisis has challenged the stability of the EMU.  The migration crisis has put the Schengen free movement zone under pressure and additional challenges in internal security, external trade and defence have put the EU under pressure on other fronts.  These challenges, which my colleague might be more disposed to talk about, expose the limits of the constitutional set-up of the Union.  We have seen nationalist parties and policy-makers across the Union call for a reform of the EU's powers and institutional architecture with the aim of strengthening the Union and relaunching the project.</p><p> The euro crisis has exposed the weakness of the EMU.  States, notably in the south of Europe, as well as Ireland, have suffered from a constitutional regime that prioritises fiscal stability at the price of growth and employment.  The migration crisis has revealed the deficiencies in the fields of justice and immigration.  It has displeased states in the north of Europe which have had to shoulder a greater burden in the management of asylum claims.  States, especially in central and eastern Europe, are concerned that the EU is not able to sufficiently protect them from external military threats, particularly in the light of what might be seen as the United States Administration's distancing from those issues.</p><p> The European Union needs to avoid at all costs the idea of a multi-speed Europe where different member states progress at different rates.  It will be all the more apposite if efforts to reform the constitutional architecture of the EU and the Brexit negotiations do not go as well as we hope for potentially idiosyncratic national reasons.  The Union has developed at different speeds.  Various countries have opted out of Schengen, the common currency and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  A number of states have enhanced co-operation to set up a unified patent court and another ten eurozone countries are discussing the introduction of a financial transaction tax.  </p><p> Nobody should be in any doubt that Europe and the Union will be weakened by Britain leaving the EU.  Britain has been disengaged from the EU&rsquo;s common foreign and security policy and external action programmes.  Brexit will also deal a major blow to the European defence architecture when the EU&rsquo;s biggest army leaves the EU&rsquo;s structures and when the important link that Britain forms between the United States and European pillars of the transatlantic security community ends.  </p><p> Ireland needs to be at the heart of ensuring changes to the EU&rsquo;s architecture are appropriate because the potential consequences of Brexit for Ireland are stark.  Our commitment to the European project should be reassessed.  It should never be taken for granted.  Those of us who count ourselves as ardently pro-European need to take that into account.  Trade with Britain is an essential part of our economy and the doubts about what will happen to the Border remain questions of conjecture until the discussions get well under way and ultimately are concluded.   </p><p> This brings us to the question of the Northern Ireland peace process.  I am not as pessimistic as some that Brexit will mean the inevitable return to some sort of conflict.  The conflict has been over for the guts of two decades.  There seems to be no willingness for dissidents to engage.  There will always be dissidents as long as the country is not united and I would suggest even if the country is united those dissidents would remain dissident.  The peace process is premised on all-Ireland co-operation and integration, an open border, explicit EU mentions, the European Convention of Human Rights and supranational protections.  It is open-ended and continues to have a dynamic of change which is at risk from Brexit because it potentially disrupts North-South integration, turns Northern Ireland more towards United Kingdom, slows dynamic change and ultimately weakens human rights protections.  More than anything else it probably offers a powerful physical and symbolic target for anti-peace process dissidents to label the process as a failure, which it clearly is not, which we all know and are grateful for.  </p><p> For Northern Ireland a hard land border would be the worst possible outcome because it would bring economic disruption to a weak economy, which is in many ways based on the subvention it gets from the British state.  It would run the risk of fortifying security infrastructure which would almost inevitably be attacked by dissidents and then reinforced.  It would be a powerful symbol of reversal and failure and ultimately bring disruption to the premise of the peace process.  It would also conflict with other dynamics.  In 2017 we saw the first ever Northern Ireland Assembly election where traditional unionists are in a minority and where there is a clear strong majority for remaining in the EU.  In that context, it is imperative that the Irish State and people remain, as we have been for many decades, a driving force at EU level in providing a calm voice within the 27 when the terms of Brexit are being agreed.  </p><p> We hosted a major conference on Brexit in Dublin City University a few weeks ago which was addressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  He outlined in a keynote address this is not a time for the EU to punish Britain.  Rather, we in Ireland should seek to ensure Britain continues to play a role in Europe&rsquo;s economic and foreign policy.  We can do this through our negotiating team at EU level and also in our bilateral negotiations with the British.  We should not forget that Ireland had significant links with the British state long before we both entered the EEC in 1973.  We continue to have significant relations which have improved since the peace process was cemented and we see them in the current visit by Prince Charles.  We should not forget that in the bilateral negotiations we have the power to persuade the British and we should concentrate as much on that as on our negotiations with the 27.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gavin Barrett" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017051100002#D00200"><p>I echo the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Professor Murphy.  It is a pleasure and honour to be invited here.  Suggested discussion points were given to me on four topics: UK-Ireland relations, the Good Friday Agreement, trade, and the common security and defence policy.  I will make some remarks on all four points.<br/><br/>Ireland is clearly in a very difficult position as a result of Brexit.  In the European Union we are in a Single Market of half a billion consumers.  No convincing case can be made for leaving it and yet the UK is departing.  While it represents only 13% of our exports, it is hugely significant for particular businesses, the food sector, farms, small and medium sized enterprises, Border enterprises and Irish-owned enterprises.  There is very much a sense of being pulled in two different directions by the process of Brexit.  The risk of the UK distancing itself from Ireland, which I was asked to talk about, depends very much on how hard Brexit turns out to be which as Donald Rumsfeld might put it, is a known unknown.  The worst case scenario is of no agreement being reached on future relations between the UK and Europe, in which case economic relations would fall back on WTO rules.  That is essentially a reduced tariff arrangement.  Economically, it would be a very serious situation for Ireland because it would lead to tariffs on Irish exports and <i>vice versa</i>.</p><p>In the agricultural field, WTO tariffs can be quite high and that would go side by side with vastly increased competition in the UK market and also, I suspect, with a plummeting sterling which would not make life easier either.  No agreement, contrary to what Ms Teresa May keeps saying, is very much worse than a bad agreement, certainly from an Irish perspective.  </p><p> A step up from that would be a free trade agreement like the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, under which there would be no tariffs on goods within the free trade area, that is, the UK and the European Union, but tariffs on goods produced outside, for example, in China, Russia, Korea and so forth.  That seems quite likely if Ms Teresa May holds to her position of exiting the customs union.  It implies that border controls will be introduced between the UK and Ireland in order to control the entry and exit of third-country produced goods.  It also enables the UK to drop its tariffs on non-free trade area products so it involves massively increased competition in the UK market for Irish producers.  It would be bad news, for example, for Irish beef producers and other agricultural producers.  </p><p> A customs union is the next stage of integration but that is unlikely because Ms Teresa May said in her Lancaster House speech that she wants to leave the customs union.  However, she is not as vociferous on that point as she has been previously.  That arrangement would involve no customs controls and therefore, no hard border between the Republic and Northern Ireland.  It could see, however, regulatory divergences creep in between the UK and Ireland as the UK would no longer be bound by Single Market rules.  In these circumstances, Ireland would need to be very careful not to allow a situation to develop in which it would be undercut by lower UK environmental, labour and consumer standards and state aid rules.  However, the EU Commission's draft negotiation guidelines indicate a strong awareness of these dangers.  </p><p> The Single Market would be the next step up.  If we could get a Norway-type relationship, where the UK is outside the European Union but still in the Single Market, that would be the best situation, apart obviously from continued membership.  However, even that would involve some distancing from Ireland in that the UK would no longer participate in the institutions of the European Union.  Thus, in some but not all policy areas, Ireland would lose an ally.  We would also lose UK money - Britain contributes 10% of CAP funding - and the benefit of the resources that the UK puts into processing European Union law, for example, reports, policy inputs, judicial decisions implementing legislation as a precedent and so forth.  That much said, in a Brexit scenario, that would be an optimal result for us but I do not think we are going to get it.  </p><p> I was also asked to consider the likely direction of negotiations on the rights of Irish and other citizens living in the UK.  In that context we must distinguish between the rights of those who are or have been resident in the UK at the time of Brexit and those who take up residence afterwards.  As regards the first category, the European Council guidelines, which were unanimously agreed by all of the Heads of State or Government on 29 April, described safeguarding the status and rights derived from EU law at the date of withdrawal of EU and UK citizens and their families as the "first priority" for the negotiations.  A lot of importance is going to be attached to this.  The annexe to the Commission's draft mandate is more specific.  Among the rights it seeks to see protected are residence rights, social security rights, workers' rights under EU regulations, the right to take up self-employment and the right, very interestingly, to family reunification and to the recognition of qualifications.  This is not just about workers but about anyone who is covered by the Citizenship directive.  The rights involved are very extensive and it seems likely that this will have to be agreed to because the price of not agreeing may be no agreement at all.  </p><p> The situation for the second category, that is, people who move to the UK after Brexit, will depend on whatever is agreed between the UK and the EU.  The European Council guidelines indicate that participation in the Single Market requires free movement of persons.  The guidelines hold that one cannot split up the four freedoms and that is a position that is likely to be insisted upon by the Eastern European states in particular.  However, I think that price may well be too high for the UK so Britain will leave the Single Market.  Controlling immigration seems to have been one of the reasons for the Brexit vote and it still seems to be a very high priority for Ms Teresa May, according to press reports of recent days.  In principle, anything less than a Single Market does not involve free movement rights for individuals.  In other words, a customs union or a free trade area will achieve nothing in terms of free movement rights for EU or Irish citizens.  It is possible, and perhaps quite likely, that some free movement rights will be negotiated but judging by the published account of the conversation at the dinner from hell between Mr. Juncker and Ms May, the negotiations can be expected to be quite difficult.  There is also a possibility that the UK will unilaterally confer rights on Irish citizens alone after Brexit.  It has done that before but for the moment, everything is up in the air.  </p><p> I was also asked to consider the impact of Brexit on the Good Friday Agreement and in particular, on North-South relations and east-west relations.  I have already considered the latter relations.  In terms of North-South relations we already have, in the Miller case judgment of the UK's Supreme Court, a judicial ruling on at least one aspect of Brexit, that is, that section 1 of the Northern Ireland Act applies only to constitutional change concerning reunification, not Brexit.  In other words, the veto on constitutional change does not involve Brexit but only reunification with Ireland.  Interestingly, Article 1 (vi) of the Good Friday Agreement guarantees the right of all of the people of Northern Ireland to "Irish or British, or both" citizenships.  That is interesting from an EU perspective because citizenship of an EU member state like Ireland brings with it EU citizenship so for the first time, more than 1 million people who are not actually resident in the EU and not presently citizens of an EU member state will become citizens of the EU.  </p><p> The long-term impact of Brexit on Northern Ireland is very hard to fathom.  Brexit was rejected by the electorates in Northern Ireland and Scotland and it may increase the chances of Scotland voting for independence.  If that happens, Northern Ireland will have a kind of rump status and that would increase the logic of an economic case for Irish reunification.  However, it is far from certain whether that would actually happen or that a majority would come to favour it.  European Council guidelines have stressed the need to support the goals of peace and reconciliation enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement.  The draft negotiation guidelines are even more explicit in recognising Irish concerns like the common transport area and the transit of goods, which is obviously of major commercial importance to us.  There is a lot of awareness of Ireland's risky position in that regard.</p><p> I will move on now to a consideration of trade policy and the implications for Ireland of the UK negotiating its own trade agreements.  The search by the UK for trade agreements which are worth more than the lost opportunities of the rejected Single Market seems likely to be unsuccessful.  The UK will, it is true, be able to offer one advantage over the European Union in trade agreements, namely speedier ratification.  However, the product it will be selling will be a lot less attractive because all the UK can offer is access to a market of 70 million consumers as opposed to what will be the EU's 440 million consumers.  One can imagine who other countries will be queueing up to negotiate with and who will get the best deal - clearly, it is going to be the European Union.  The search for independent trade agreements by the UK is something of a chimera.  One is reminded of Philip Stephen's comment to the effect that the UK is abandoning real power in pursuit of the chimera of sovereignty.  The search for such international trade agreements is driving the UK's determination to leave the customs union because the customs union requires a common external tariff and thus prevents independent trade deals by the UK.  To take that point a step further, one can say that the UK's desire to leave the customs union is actually going to result in border posts being re-erected between Northern Ireland and the Republic, with all of the negative consequences that this will entail.  No matter how negotiations go between the UK and the EU, unless and until the UK abandons its plans to leave the customs union, we are stuck with a hard border, effectively.  There is no way out of that.  Britain may not abandon such plans because they are central to the image of what Brexit means.</p><p>Any external trade agreement will likely result in extra competition for Irish food producers and farmers on the British market.  When I say that the majority of cheddar on the British market is produced in Ireland, it will give the committee some idea of the economic implications for the food industry and farmers generally.  I addressed the recent IFA conference on Brexit - there are many concerned farmers watching this situation.</p><p> I was asked to address the common security and defence policy, CSDP.  I will make a few rapid comments on this matter.  Without the UK, the CSDP would not exist.  The UK is a large military player, at least in a European context.  It accounts for 40% of public defence investment in the EU and is one of only five EU member states to spend 2% of its GDP on the military.  Paradoxically, though, the direct and immediate impact of Brexit on the CSDP may not be great.  This is because the UK has, at least since David Cameron took office, been in a state of what has been described as "semi-Brexit" and the Saint-Malo declaration was never followed through with.  This was for a number of reasons, including Conservative Party euroscepticism as well as frustration with the small scale of CSDP operations.  For a long time, the UK has focused its efforts on NATO and unilateral action alongside other states, Libya being a case in point.  It had started to cut back on its contribution to EU deployments and walk away from CSDP long before the referendum.</p><p> Although the UK provided leadership in, for example, combating piracy around the Horn of Africa, its contribution in terms of personnel and resources has been limited in recent years, well behind that of much smaller states.  It ranks only fifth among contributors to CSDP military operations behind France, Italy, Germany and Spain and seventh among contributors to civilian missions behind Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, France and Finland.  It contributes only 4% of the personnel provided by EU member states.  To some extent, Brexit represents a loss of potential as much as an actual contribution.</p><p> The implications of Brexit relate more to the politics and governance of the CSDP rather than its operations or armaments co-operation.  It used to be said jokingly that NATO was an organisation designed to keep the Americans in, the Russians out and the Germans down.  Using the same approach, the question of what can keep the EU up and the UK in can now be asked.  It will require a revision of the CSDP's governance model, that is, the core of states driving it forward, and it will involve a new partnership between the CSDP and the UK as a third party.  The EU needs to devise something to replace the Franco-UK axis that was at the core of the CSDP.  A Franco-German engine might be one possibility, given that Germany is evolving from a solely civilian power into one taking greater responsibility for international security.</p><p> The absence of UK vetoes might make some aspects work more smoothly, given that there would be less opposition to permanent structured co-operation and the possible setting up of a EU military headquarters, but some means of including the UK as a third party contributor operationally will need to be found, for example, a revised framework participation agreement.  Defence market co-operation will suffer if the UK falls out.  It has a large defence industry operation, so it may want to opt into co-operation in some form.  Various possibilities that might happen in the absence of the UK have been suggested, such as the creation of an autonomous EU military headquarters, but we do not know what will happen.  It is all uncertain.</p><p> The implications for NATO are unclear.  The UK is clearly an Atlanticist country and likes the NATO core to defence but, judging by the recent German defence White Paper, it is Atlanticist as well.  I see no great desire to get NATO out and to replace it with a European defence alliance.</p><p> Regarding the implications for Irish neutrality, that neutrality presented a difficult issue when Ireland was negotiating entry to the European Communities in the first place.  However, the EU has expanded to include six neutral and non-aligned states, including us, so any future arrangement is likely to be a coalition of the willing.  The special characteristics of national defence policy such as Ireland's are specifically recognised in the treaty, and let us not forget that our Constitution contains a provision precluding our taking part in a European defence alliance.  On top of that is the Seville declaration.</p><p> Brexit may allow things to happen that would not have happened were the UK still in the EU, and it may require things to happen if the CSDP is to continue to have any relevance or begin to have more relevance.  It will require other states to step up to the plate.  Its long-term implications are as yet unclear, but I see no threat to Irish neutrality.</p></speech>

For example, Lakeland Dairies used to be a Cavan-Monaghan enterprise, but it now has major processing plants north of the Border.  Similarly, LacPatrick &ndash; formerly the Town of Monaghan Co-op &ndash; has major processing plants north of the Border.  The raw material &ndash; milk in this case, but sheepmeat and beef in other cases &ndash; travels north and south for processing.  There will be significant challenges if different regulatory regimes apply to food standards.  These are just some issues.</p> <p>  I have the privilege of representing two of the southern Ulster counties.  Our lives in those Border communities have been transformed since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.  Thankfully, the Border has been gone in reality since 1998 and there has been a normalisation and total demilitarisation of our region.  In recent years, but particularly prior to Brexit, all of us argued that we did not see the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement being maximised and that more all-island bodies could have been created to do that.  However, when we undertake an inventory of the Agreement, its success has been significant.  We have taken that for granted.</p> <p>  Be it a soft or hard Border, any impediment to the movement of people, goods or services is a major backwards step, and a worrying one for Border communities.  Where I live, people travel north on a daily basis to work in or access the help service, education, etc.  Unfortunately, I do not underestimate the potential for difficulties when the Border arrives.</p> <p>  It is welcome and significant that Mr. Michel Barnier is addressing both Houses of the Oireachtas today.  He has an understanding of our country.  The European Parliament&rsquo;s chief negotiator, Mr. Guy Verhofstadt, MEP, recently stated that the Good Friday Agreement had to be protected.  That is important.  Many positives have flowed from the Agreement, so it has to be uppermost in all negotiations at every level, a matter on which both of the witnesses&rsquo; contributions dealt with strongly.</p> <p>  I will conclude on a further point before calling on colleagues.  The economy of the Border region, North and South, suffered much over the years because of the Troubles.  We have only started to try to catch up.  There has been good indigenous enterprise, which we have depended on down the years.  Thankfully, some companies that started out small in my constituency and north of the Border have become international corporations.</p> <p>  The Border economy is more heavily dependent on agriculture, construction and engineering than any other region in the country.  Those are the sectors that will be most impacted by Brexit, given that they depend on the British and Northern Ireland markets so much for their exports.  So many double whammies will hit the local economy and communities that such considerations must be uppermost in our minds at all times.</p> <p>  Another issue that has not been taken into account enough is the fact that a great deal of our exports to markets beyond Britain and the EU use Britain as a landbridge.  These obstacles will hit the Border region, North and South, more negatively than they will other regions.</p><p>The presentations are exceptionally good and touch on all of those issues.  Although I took the liberty of making a statement, I ask my colleagues to stick to asking questions.  I call Deputy Darragh O'Brien.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1197" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017051100002#G00200"><p>I will do my best, Chairman.  It is difficult.  I thank the witnesses.  Both of their presentations show what we know, which is how complex this will be.  It could lead us down any avenue.  I will try to restrict myself to specific questions, the first of which is what does Britain want?  My understanding from meetings is that it has no idea what it wants.  I do not mean that in a condescending way, but it does not.  I do not believe the Brexit Theresa May wants is possible and I also do not believe her when she says that no agreement is better than a bad agreement.  What are the chances, and this is not wishful thinking, of Britain re-thinking this and coming back from the edge during the negotiations?  We were given a very stark presentation from the aviation sector.  In that case a deal would have to be done, probably within the next year, to facilitate open skies and to allow sales of tickets into 2019.  These things are coming down the track and UK airlines might not be able to land in the EU.  That is one element.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses believe a new UK-Ireland or Anglo-Irish agreement is needed after the Good Friday Agreement?  I have been critical that the architecture of the Good Friday Agreement has not been used to its potential.  Either we ramp that up or a new agreement is required.</p> <p>  There are many more questions I could ask but I am conscious of the time.  The two-speed Europe piece interests me in particular.  There is a sense that Ireland walks a very fine line in that it will not be used as a Trojan Horse, that is, to advocate for a good British deal while our European colleagues are looking at us and wondering which side of the table we are on.  Ireland walks a fine line in that regard, and I picked that up in Brussels in numerous meetings I had there.  Our situation not just economically, but also politically and diplomatically, is even more difficult than that of the British, once they figure out what they want.  They say they want to leave.  We are trying to maintain a good relationship with a good neighbour and partner, so there is a chance of the isolation of Ireland within the European Union.</p> <p>  I could ask about 20 more questions but I will leave it at that.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  They referred to many of the points that concern me.  The final question is how easy it is to persuade hard Brexiteers.  I do not believe one can.  This is a sovereignty grab and it is immigration based.  It is a view they have of a perceived problem with immigration.  I say "perceived" because it should not be a problem for most British people, but it is a post-colonial issue as opposed to a European issue.  However, one cannot convince them of that.  Some of them just want out and do not care about the consequences.</p></speech>

The witnesses are before the committee on an auspicious day, given that Michel Barnier will be in the D&aacute;il in the next hour.  Professor Murphy described himself as ardently pro-European.  It is not a phrase one hears often but I would probably now describe myself in the same way, despite having been very critical over the years of many aspects of the EU.  However, the Brexit vote has brought out, perhaps by way of contrast, the need to assert European values and so forth as a positive.</p> <p>  To confine myself to questions, I wish to tease out three points.  I thank Professor Barrett for being helpful and clear in setting out the four levels of Brexit that are possible.  As he said, the optimal one for Ireland is that Britain remains in the Single Market, but he envisages that as unlikely.  How likely is it that we will have the next level, that Britain remains in the customs union?  That has better outcomes for agrifood businesses in Ireland and for the Border, the Good Friday Agreement and so forth.  Is that likely?  How can Ireland try to promote that outcome?  Are there ways of doing so?</p> <p>  Both witnesses referred to UK-Ireland bilateral negotiations and relations.  The other EU member states appear to be opposed to that but we must assert ourselves.  For example, Irish citizens have rights to vote in British general elections if they are resident there, while other EU citizens do not.  We already have many demarcations due to our historical relationship.  Can we strengthen those?  In particular, is there a way to strengthen that negotiating position because of the issue Professor Barrett raised, which is the many people in Northern Ireland who currently are not Irish citizens and who may now take Irish citizenship?  They will then be EU citizens but resident in a non-EU state.  The first priority of the EU Council negotiating guidelines is to protect those EU citizens, but perhaps we do not think of Northern Irish people in those terms.  It is an interesting point.</p> <p>  On reform, Deputy O'Brien referred to the multi-speed Europe.  Professor Murphy says that is not something in Ireland's interest.  How likely is it and how can we take a stance against it?</p> <p>  Finally, there are the rights of Irish citizens resident in Britain.  There will be a difference between the rights of those who are currently resident there and of those who move there after withdrawal.  What is the best way to protect their interests and particularly the interests of those who may wish to move there in the future?  Again, I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

Education is another factor in terms of movement.  Perhaps they would comment briefly on that.  All the presentations we have received re-affirm our incredulity at what has happened in Britain.  It is not that we do not respect their right to vote, but it is the lack of exploration, discussion and investigation of what Brexit would mean apart from it being focused on just migration and what Britain would save.  We are seeing so much more emerging now on the massive implications.  What comes across to me is our over-dependence on Britain and the opportunities to go beyond that.  From my involvement with this committee and the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, I am aware of the extensive number of countries in Africa and the Americas who wish to trade with us.  They trust us and they trust that it will be an ethical trade, with respect for human rights.  Perhaps the witnesses would address that.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that there was a gamble with Northern Ireland.  One of the other interesting presentations we received was on the implications for reconciliation, culture and identity, not just the economic implications.  I put that to the witnesses.</p> <p>  We see a rise in nationalism in Europe.  I do not call it "nationalism".  It is not my view of nationalism.  It is some type of ultra right wing horrible "ism".  What type of reform does the EU have to engage in to stem and cope with that?</p> <p>  Britain, while part of the EU, is a major seller of arms, fuelling conflict.  Fuelling conflict fuels poverty and all the other abuses of human rights.  Now that it is out of the EU, where there might have been some type of control over it although it was not much, where do the witnesses see that going?  There will also be massive shortfalls as Britain is a major overseas development aid contributor.  What do the witnesses envisage happening in that regard?</p> <p>  My final point is a general one and is a little away from Brexit.  It is the increasing securitisation narrative from the EU, as opposed to the humanitarian one.</p></speech>

I was anxious to portray in my statement why we should strive, might and main, to avoid such a thing.  When I was preparing my statement, I was conscious of putting stress on the importance of bilateral relations with the United Kingdom, which relates to Deputy Darragh O'Brien's question.  Of course, the British do not know what they want.  Unlike ourselves, they have very little experience of running referendums.  We have re-run referendums relating to the European Union on the Lisbon and Nice treaties.  The British clearly do not know what they want.  The chances of a re-run of the referendum are zero.  It was clearly overwrought and emotional last June, and it would be much worse in a re-run.</p><p>The little England mentality comes much more strongly to the fore in terms of going against the will of the people.  That is an extremely difficult issue.<br/><br/>I will deal with two other issues.  To respond to Senator Bacik, I had been concerned for some time about the development of the European Union along a two-tier process.  We will hear from Mr. Barnier today when he addresses the House but I describe myself as ardently pro-European.  I am here as a neutral commentator but sometimes it is no harm if we put our cards on the table.  The European Union has been extremely good for this country.  In many ways it has transformed the Irish State.  It transformed education, to allude to what Senator Bacik and Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised.  It was announced in <i>The Guardian</i>yesterday that 171 of our colleagues in the University of Manchester, for instance, are at risk of being fired.  Aberystwyth University is firing staff or looking to let staff go.  In many ways all of that is to do with Brexit, which goes to the point that I do not believe the British knew what they were doing in the first place.  That is not to criticise them for making the decision but it goes to the point about the two-speed Europe.  As we know, there are critics of the European Union in regard to the troika and the bailout.  I tend to be of the view that some of that is ideological in nature but overall, I suggest that the European Union has been good for us.  I am keen to stress, however, that we must make use of our bilateral negotiations with the British to state to them that the negotiations they are engaging in with the Union have to be nuanced as distinct from going in, as Professor Barrett said, and saying that no deal is better than any deal, which I believe would be catastrophic.</p></speech>

In respect of what the Chairman said about different regulatory regimes, a free trade agreement, if we get one, should preserve the free movement of goods between the two countries, although the United Kingdom will have to observe EU standards generally.  They will have to follow the EU regulatory regime on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  There are problems in terms of exports as well because China, for instance, recognises EU safety standards.  It is very difficult to get that kind of recognition.  The UK will no longer have that.  I do not know what effect that will have on the industry.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned the absence of the Border.  As I stated, it is dependent on the UK staying in the customs union.  Unfortunately, Theresa May's priorities seem to be elsewhere.  One example of that is how remarkably little priority is paid to the needs of the regions - I do not know what is the correct expression but I refer to Scotland and Ireland in that regard.</p> <p>  Another implication in the area the Chairman spoke about is the Common Agricultural Policy.  The United Kingdom is a massive contributor to the EU budget.  That will hurt farmers in Northern Ireland in a big way from 2020 onwards but it will also hurt farmers in the Republic.  There is a lot of pain to go round in that regard.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned a land bridge.  Interestingly, that is specifically referred to in the Commission draft mandate so it is on to this one and it is looking out for it.  In other words, a special provision is being made to ensure that Irish products being exported to the Continent can go through in sealed containers or something like that or will have special routes.  We will need to watch that one but it is something to which the Commission is paying attention.</p> <p>  Deputy Darragh O'Brien asked what the UK wanted and said that they do not seem to know.  We were told that Brexit means Brexit, which is a highly ambiguous statement.  Ambiguity and lack of clarity can be useful at times.  For instance, it is an advantage in the sense that when Theresa May comes out of the next election, it is likely she will have a much bigger majority.  Currently, she is in thrall to the Conservative Party right wing.  She cannot help but be if she wants to remain in power.  Hopefully, she will have a bigger majority and, fingers crossed - we do not know this will be the case - it will be a more moderate majority.  If that is the case, she will get more room to manoeuvre and, hopefully, she might be able to change her mind regarding the customs union issue.  She has not backed down on it yet but it is receiving less stress at the moment.</p> <p>  In terms of any chance of a comeback from the edge, Brexit will certainly happen.  John Temple Lang, who is a legal scholar, has put forward his view.  He believes that in the course of negotiations economic necessity will come to prevail and that Britain will more or less find itself corralled into a Norway-type relationship for want of alternative, sensible economic relationships.  I hope that is right.  I do not know if it is but I will keep my fingers crossed in that regard.</p> <p>  On the question as to whether a new Good Friday Agreement is needed, that is unlikely.  The core of what is being aimed at is that current arrangements will remain undisturbed.  I refer to human rights protection, the common travel area, to the largest extent possible, funding in deprived Border areas and so on.  Those aspects will be focused on.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's point about Ireland being seen as a Trojan horse, he is absolutely right.  That comes back to my point that we are being pulled in two different directions in this regard.  It is a very difficult situation but our best interests lie in being seen with Europe.</p></speech>

Theresa May said she wanted out.  It is core to the Brexiteers' self-image that they have freedom to negotiate these mythical trade deals all around the world.  That worries me.<br/><br/>As to how we promote that idea, in the past we have tried to exercise persuasion.  We did not have too much luck in persuading them not to vote for Brexit.  If politicians here have links with moderate candidates in the United Kingdom they should go there, canvass for them and help them out.  Apart from that, there is not much we can do.  We can argue the case as best we can but there is little else we can do.<br/><br/>On the best way of protecting the interests of Irish citizens abroad, Ireland has had what I would describe as a spectacular success in getting our priorities included in the draft mandate and the Council guidelines.  The way Ireland has done that has been very impressive.  It is a good illustration of the correct approach to take at European level.  It was similarly used, although it is not a very popular thing to say, at the time of the bailout, that is, that some people promote a very confrontational approach <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the European Union.  It is a case of take them on, defy them, break all the rules and so on.  In fact, the very opposite approach was used.  In other words, if one is seen as a team player one will achieve more and get more.  It certainly has worked at this stage of the negotiations and I suspect it will continue to do so if we do that in regard to the agreement that will follow governing the long-term relationship between the United Kingdom and Ireland.<br/><br/>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised a number of issues one of which was the question of identity.  That is key.  There were many headlines that I was a little uncomfortable with concerning Northern Ireland and the unwinding agreement, if I can call it that, the Article 50 agreement we will reach.  We cannot forget that there are many identity issues bound in that.  The mere fact that it is economically more advantageous, for instance, to unite with Ireland does not mean that people will actually want to unite with the Republic.  It was very noticeable, for instance, that Ulster farmers voted very much against their own financial interests in the Brexit referendum.  They are crucially dependent on Common Agriculture Policy payments and from 2020 onwards, they have absolutely no guarantee in regard to those but yet, the issue of identity was enough to get them to vote in that regard.  I agree that we cannot forget the issue of identity politics.<br/><br/>The Deputy raised a lot of issues but one that struck me was shortfalls in terms of overseas development aid.  That is very true.  It is an aspect of something I have already mentioned, in that the British financial contribution will be missed.  It is a big country.  They contributed a good deal in terms of finance to the European Union and either we are looking at cutbacks in regard to that money or other member states replacing the money in question.<br/><br/>In terms of the United Kingdom's own contribution in respect of overseas development aid, I notice that the Conservative Government has been very favourable in respect of keeping that up.</p><p>Perhaps, even outside of the European Union, overseas development aid will continue but I suppose there will be a certain decline.  One can do much more collectively than individually.  I hope Britain will find some way to opt in when it comes to continuing European efforts.</p></speech>

We, as a State, should be very loath to start talking about a second agreement.  The Good Friday Agreement was hard won.  As both Deputy O'Brien and Deputy Brendan Smith, who is in the Chair, have mentioned, the Agreement probably has not been used to its fullest extent.  That is what we should seek.  I would be very loath for any Irish Government to consider or entertain such a notion if it came from the British.</p></speech>

I am surprised that no one has mentioned the Brexit vote here.  Clearly, there was a significant opposing vote.  No political party opposed Brexit in England and Wales.  A group in Scotland clearly campaigned against Brexit and we have seen the outcome.  In terms of the North of Ireland, the political parties that opposed leaving the EU included Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP, the Green Party, the Alliance Party and the official Unionists.  There was a majority vote against Brexit.  How did Brexit come about?  It stemmed from a row within the Conservative Party.  How does one separate UKIP from the Conservative Party?  Some of us thought that the murder of Jo Cox might have had an impact on the Brexit vote, but clearly it did not. </p> <p>  I would like to ask about the federalisation of the EU, a matter that no one has touched on.  The British Government has long acted as a block when it came to attempts to further federalise the EU.  EU institutions have ignored all of the data and the polls that show the disconnect.  Trust and support for the EU is failing.  Do the witnesses think that the EU institutions have learned anything from the polls and what has happened in Britain?  People had views on the direction that Europe was taking and felt uncomfortable with what Ireland and many other countries have been forced to go through.  I am sure the people of Greece, if given a vote in the morning on the EU, would be fairly critical.</p> <p>  There have been significant developments on the other side of the Atlantic in the US such as the election of Donald Trump as President.  Do the witnesses believe that the British Government will now focus on establishing stronger ties with a new America?  Will Britain prioritise a relationship with the US over one with the EU?  Will greater links with the US be more conducive than what comes from the negotiations?  </p> <p>  There is agreement in these Houses that Northern Ireland should have a special status in the EU.  Do the witnesses think such a status would be significant?  The Good Friday Agreement has been mentioned.  How important is the Good Friday Agreement in the negotiations?  Mr. Michel Barnier has given us a positive message as has the European Parliament.  How important is that?  Some people will be afraid that a precedent will be set.  The Good Friday Agreement is a unique international agreement that acknowledges that we overcame conflict.  Brexit has created uncertainty, fear and greater division, which is the last thing that we want.</p> <p>  Human rights was one of the pillars of the Good Friday Agreement.  Sinn F&eacute;in views the withdrawal from the European Court of Human Rights by the British Government as a game changer in terms of the idea of consent for the people of Ireland.  Brexit will also change the nature of the Agreement if the human rights pillar is removed.  Do the witnesses view this aspect as an important part of negotiations? </p> <p>  It is foolish to contemplate the idea that the Brits will reverse Brexit.  A customs union and the wishlist compiled by the Brits means there must be a hard border.  There is no indication, coming from a successful election, that Theresa May will adopt a softer line.  In fact, such a win may galvanise the right wing element in terms of Europe.</p></speech>

Ireland has a unique situation that, in my opinion, deserves special attention.  We have a better chance of getting a satisfactory agreement by getting the support of the EU at this stage to commence and secure an agreement directly with the British for the Republic of Ireland.</p> <p>  Whether we like it or not, anybody who has dealt with the Unionist community in the North will understand these people, as I do from my dealings with them when we set up the North/South Inter-Parliamentary Association.  It is very difficult for us to understand their fear.  There has been no indication, in my opinion, that the community will willingly tend towards the South of Ireland.  In fact, their position might harden, and I think there is every likelihood of them doing so for religious reasons as well as everything else.  One must be practical about these things.  I would like to hear the opinion of the witnesses on the following.  Should we seek support from our fellow members of the European Union to negotiate a separate arrangement for Ireland with Britain?  I do not believe we should hang around waiting for it to be part and parcel of the overall negotiations because it will get lost.  Those of us who have had the experience of dealing with countries in the eastern part of the European Union will know that they know very little about the Republic of Ireland and its problems.  Our problems are very serious to us but they will get lost in the overall negotiations.  Rather than make a speech, I would like to hear the opinion of the witnesses on this matter.  Am I thinking along the wrong lines?  Should we seek the support of the European Union to secure an independent agreement? </p></speech>

I have a number of questions, some of which have been touched on.</p> <p>  Recently I organised a meeting on Brexit in Sligo that was attended by almost 250 people, including people from the farming community.  As the Chairman has outlined, I represent a constituency region that comprises Sligo, Leitrim and parts of west Cavan and south Donegal.  The region encompasses a very significant number of people who have had a big connection with cross-Border activities over the years, for example, the tourism sector through the Wild Atlantic Way and the education sector.  A large number students from my area have studied in Coleraine College, Queen's University Belfast and in many other educational institutions in the North.</p><p>These are major concerns for parents in my area.  We talk about tourism and education, but farming is a huge issue as well.  A haulage contractor made one of the major comments on that night.  He operates in and out of Northern Ireland and is using the Northern ports every day.  He brought home to us the implications of Brexit for his business and many other businesses and the many other people who use Northern Ireland.</p><p> One of the witnesses mentioned farming in his contributions.  Many of the farmers operating in my area are cattle dealers from Northern Ireland buying cattle and transporting them to Northern Ireland.  What are the implications for the farming community with regard to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP?</p><p> As a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, the implications of Brexit for the Good Friday Agreement and the benefits we have derived from that Agreement over the years are the issues I am concerned about.</p></speech>

Some 70% of those who did not define one way or the other voted to remain.  Clearly, the urge to remain is something that needs to be taken into account in Northern Ireland.  I began my remarks by criticising the EU for the way it had developed and saying it bears some significant responsibility for the result in Britain.  That is not to excuse some of the mistakes that were made by the British Tory party and by the British political elite itself.  The EU has a significant opportunity to change.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised some of the issues it might consider, such as its federalisation and also where it sees itself on the issue of the arms industry.</p> <p>  On the special arrangement, which Deputies Crowe and Barrett raised, the grave danger for the EU is that this begins a long breakup of the Union as nationalist movements become increasingly powerful.  The EU would be very reluctant to offer special agreements for Ireland during the Brexit negotiations because it would run the risk of stoking nationalist movements in other states, including in eastern Europe where states might consider exiting the Union if they could get a good deal.  The Union has to be very cautious about this, and this is why I said at the beginning of my remarks that this is in many ways the greatest crisis the Union has faced since its foundation.  We should not take the idea of a special arrangement off the table, but the difficulties would be considerable.</p> <p>  My colleague, Professor Barrett, can answer the agricultural questions as he is far more qualified than I am.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1222" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Gavin Barrett" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017051100002#K00800"><p>I cannot address all the questions in the time remaining to me, unfortunately.  I would like to focus on the question concerning the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is very clear from the text of the Good Friday Agreement that it was assumed that Britain would remain a member of the European Convention on Human Rights.  That point was conveyed in no uncertain terms by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, to the Government of the United Kingdom.  It is important to remember that the European Convention on Human Rights is separate from the EU, so withdrawal from the EU does not bring with it a withdrawal from the European Convention on Human Rights, although Theresa May has spoken about withdrawal from that as well.  She seems to have a thing about that.</p> <p>  Deputy Barrett raised the important issue of negotiating separately or together.  It brings to mind Winston Churchill's old saying, that, "We must all hang together, or most assuredly we shall hang separately."  Clearly, we have a far greater economic interest in this whole process than many of our fellow member states of the EU.  In so far as it concerns the common travel area, the Good Friday Agreement etc., what we have been talking about is safeguarding the package that is already there, and we negotiated that package for ourselves.  Those were more or less directly negotiated.</p> <p>  In terms of trade, which is the other aspect of this which is of key economic importance to us, are we better having a separate argument or a joint argument?  The logic for having a separate argument is one for Irexit.  No one is arguing for that, but that is ultimately where that logic takes us.  The gain of individual negotiations is that we gain an independent voice.  The loss is a huge loss of bargaining power.  Professor John FitzGerald stated that the smaller party to international negotiations approaches them as the beggar.  That is the way it works and that is the position we were in with Britain prior to our membership of the communities.  Ironically that is the position the British are going to be in during the negotiations with the 27 member states.  The benefits of being in the EU include the benefit of huge bargaining power, and that is reflected in the draft of Council guidelines and the draft mandate.  As long as our views are taken account of within the greater organisation, I have no doubt that we are better off in it.  So far, Ireland has succeeded spectacularly in doing that, and it is to be hoped that will continue to be the case.  I take the point about other member states not even being aware of the circumstances here, but the people who matter are aware, and I suspect we will see that reflected in what Michel Barnier has to say to us today.  It should be remembered that the negotiations are going to be conducted by the Commission, subject of course to the supervision of the member states and Council.</p> <p>  Deputy McLoughlin clearly represents a constituency that has many people living along the Border who are most sensitive to Brexit, including those involved in the tourism and haulage industries.  He asked about the impact on farmers.  I see it impacting on farmers in several ways.  One is on the CAP, because the British withdrawal of funding is going to hit farmers throughout this island, make no mistake about it.  Those who will be hit hardest are the farmers in Northern Ireland.  They are looking at the end of the CAP as there are no guarantees past 2020.  Joint exports are another area that will be effected, particularly exports into the UK.  If they pursue a cheap food policy, it will really hit Irish exporters, and perhaps increase competition on third country markets as well, depending on what kind of deals the British can negotiate for themselves.</p> <p>  Unfortunately the impact of Brexit is not going to be even.  There is no doubt it will hit some sectors more than others, especially the food industry and farmers.  I would love to look at the common security and defence policy but time does not permit.  Perhaps if I am back before the committee at a later date I can speak about that.</p></speech>

It is a Private Member's Bill that was referred to the select committee by order of the D&aacute;il on 6 October 2016.  The joint committee has reported to the D&aacute;il on its detailed scrutiny of the Bill in accordance with Standing Order 141(2).  I welcome the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.  I understand Deputy Pearse Doherty and the Minister wish to make introductory remarks.  I invite Deputy Pearse Doherty to make his opening remarks first, as sponsor of the Bill.</p></speech>

It was a study of legal protections for consumers of credit and other financial services in Ireland.  My office engaged with FLAC to produce the Bill based on its report.  The Bill was introduced in the D&aacute;il in September 2014.  It is appropriate for me to thank FLAC for its engagement with me in the preparation of this legislation.  I also thank the Financial Services Ombudsman for his ongoing engagement and that of his officials in discussing matters that arise in dealing with the legislation.  I thank Members on all sides who supported the passage of the legislation on Second Stage and all members of the committee who unanimously agreed that the Bill should proceed to Committee Stage because of the sense of urgency attached to its core element, the six-year rule.  In October 2016 the Bill was passed on Second Stage.  That timeline tells us how long the issue has been ongoing.  There are many important issues dealt with in the Bill, but the six-year rule for the making of complaints against financial institutions is the most pressing concern for me and many others.</p> <p>  It was a coincidence, I am told, that on the eve of the Bill being passed on Second Stage the Government published the heads of a Bill.  Again, on the eve of the Bill being taken on Committee Stage the Government published its Bill.  Having said that, I welcome publication of its Bill.  It is very comprehensive legislation that will need scrutiny which we will give it when it reaches Second, Committee and Report Stages.  I am glad that some of the core issues I presented in my Bill in 2014 are included in the Government's Bill.  We can discuss them as the day passes.</p> <p>  The issue is one of timing.  The question we have to ask ourselves is should we proceed with Committee Stage of this Bill or should we allow the Government's Bill to proceed to Second Stage?  That question has been discussed and answered by the committee.  Given the urgency of the matter and the recognition that there are countless people who cannot access redress and compensation through the Financial Services Ombudsman from their financial providers because of the six-year rule, the committee recommended that we proceed with this legislation and that its measures be incorporated into the Government's more comprehensive legislation which will provide for the merger of two public bodies.  I hope that is the way we can proceed today.</p> <p>  I look forward to hearing from colleagues about their concerns.  There was valued engagement during the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  I thank the officials of the committee for their work in preparing the report on behalf of the committee that scrutinised my legislation and the heads of the Government-sponsored Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill.</p></speech>

In general terms, it is good and necessary legislation.  There are, however, aspects of the Bill which, from the Government's point of view, require amendment.  I thank the Chairman, committee members and staff for facilitating us this morning.  The best way for me to be helpful is to read the speaking note with which the Department of Finance has provided me.  We can then have a more informal conversation.  The note outlines how we might proceed in dealing with the content of the Bill.</p> <p>  I fully understand the intention behind the Sinn F&eacute;in Private Members' Bill which seeks to provide for the strengthening of the functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman, the consumer complaints procedure and related matters.  While, in overall terms, I support the intention behind the initiative, the provisions, as set out, do not fully achieve that aim.  I did not oppose the Bill on Second Stage as I agreed in principle with what Deputy Pearse Doherty was trying to achieve - to improve the legislation in place for consumers.  The Government's Bill to amalgamate the Financial Service Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman was published yesterday.  It is more comprehensive and provides for a number of improvements to the existing legislation.  It will also amalgamate the offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman and consolidate and update the existing legislation, including the extension of the time limits for complaints, a singular concern of Deputy Pearse Doherty.  With the agreement of the House, I hope to take Second Stage of the Bill in the D&aacute;il by the end of the month.  I have been told informally that the Business Committee will facilitate that request.  I do not think we are setting up for a long delay.  I am as interested as the Deputy in having the Bill enacted by the D&aacute;il and the Seanad before the summer recess.</p> <p>  The Government's Bill has the potential to strengthen the functions of the Financial Services Ombudsman under the new body, the Office of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman, and to improve the consumer complaints procedure for consumers of both pensions and financial services.  I am requesting Sinn F&eacute;in to work with me and my officials in order that we can focus on the Bill I have proposed which is broadly in line with the principles underpinning Deputy Pearse Doherty&rsquo;s Bill.  I make that formal request, although I know that the Deputy has an alternative view on how we should proceed.  I will not, however, enter a quarrel about it either.  If the Deputy is not open to accepting this offer, I am agreeable, in the interests of achieving the best result for the consumer, to working with him and the committee on the draft Bill, bearing in mind that it will have a more limited impact.  However, in doing so I point out that if the Government's Bill, published yesterday, is enacted, it will repeal Part VIIB of the Central Bank Act 1942, part of which will be amended by the Deputy&rsquo;s Bill.  Therefore, my Bill, if enacted as it stands, will render the Deputy&rsquo;s Bill ineffective by repealing the provisions his Bill is proposing to amend.  This is in accordance with the recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny committee.  In working with the Deputy in incorporating his Bill into mine, the principles of his Bill will be retained in the Government's Bill.  I am sure he will agree that there is a finite number of resources in the public service and that the taxpayer is entitled to their best use.  It is for that reason I urge Deputies to enable us to concentrate fully on progressing the larger and more comprehensive Bill through the Oireachtas to benefit consumers.</p><p>For this reason I urge the Deputies to enable us to concentrate fully on progressing the larger, more comprehensive Bill through the Oireachtas, which will benefit consumers.</p><p> I note that Deputy McGrath has proposed amendments.  As these are stand-alone amendments, they can be dealt with during the debate on their merits in the ordinary way.</p><p> If we are to proceed now, I must highlight that there are some sections in the Bill that I can broadly support: section 1, section 2, as amended, section 3, as amended, and perhaps, after discussion, section 6.  However, there are other sections which I believe require amendment and in respect of which I expect to work with the committee, particularly with Deputy Doherty, to find a solution.  I agree in principle to section 4, which concerns time limits, but I believe it requires amendment to bring it more into line with the proposals in the Government Bill.  I also believe that the appeal from the Ombudsman should continue to lie to the High Court and that it is in the best interest of consumers that it should do so.</p><p> If the Bill proceeds to Report Stage, I will propose amendments on that Stage to the principles in section 4, which concerns time limits, and in sections 7 and 8, which concern appeals, while perhaps flagging that I might need to make some more minor amendments to section 5, which concerns mediation, and other sections.</p><p> I wish to turn my formal speaking note into a conversation.  The programme for Government commits us to amalgamating the offices and functions of the Pensions Ombudsman and the Financial Services Ombudsman, and the more comprehensive Bill published yesterday does that.  Deputy Doherty's Bill, which is very important legislation, amends, strengthens and makes more amenable to public concerns certain sections of the existing legislation.  Apart from the normal differences of opinion one would have about sections in a Committee Stage or Report Stage debate, I do not have a problem with the principles of what Deputy Doherty is advancing.</p><p> One option is to proceed with the Government legislation and incorporate the principles of Deputy Doherty's Bill into that debate, and I can assure him that we will approach it on the basis that we would seek to incorporate the essentials of his legislation.  The alternative is to run two Bills in tandem and have the Government Bill proceed to Second Stage and Deputy Doherty's Bill proceed through Committee Stage, taking into account the caveats I have expressed about some sections that would need to be amended.  The principal difficulty that would arise from running the two Bills in tandem is that while in some areas of Deputy Doherty's Bill the destination he outlines is the same as that at which the Government wishes to arrive, his method of getting there is different.  He bases his amending legislation on the Central Bank Act 1942, while the Government legislation is based on a different legal premise.  If down the road the Government Bill were to replace Deputy Doherty's Bill, if enacted, his Bill would have to be annulled in its entirety because it is built on the Central Bank Act 1942, which we would annul to get to our new legal base for the more comprehensive legislation.  I am prepared to proceed on either basis.  I know it is not easy to produce Private Members' Bills, that an awful lot of time and effort is put into them and that they are one of the elements of being in opposition.  The successful delivery of a Private Members' Bill is a fairly serious piece of work in any parliament, particularly the D&aacute;il.  If we are to go ahead today, I can facilitate Deputy Doherty very quickly with the sections I have outlined with which we do not have an issue.  Then, if I can get a commitment of openness to amendment, either today or on Report Stage, to the sections with which I have difficulty, we can go along that way.</p><p> There is one other difficulty, of which I am sure Deputy Doherty is aware, but I will point it out anyway.  If his Bill passes all Stages in the D&aacute;il and the Seanad and becomes the law of the land on these issues, the complaints initiated by persons under Deputy Doherty's legislation would have to proceed to their legal conclusions.  While the base legislation would be overtaken by the more comprehensive Government Bill, the particular complaint, as initiated, would have to proceed under the rules as outlined in Deputy Doherty's Bill.  Therefore, one complainant might proceed on a particular legal basis under the Government legislation while another complainant in parallel proceeds under a different complaints procedure, as outlined in Deputy Doherty's Bill.  It is hard to foresee whether this would have major or minor consequences but it is worth putting on the record.  I will go whichever way Deputy Doherty wants to go.</p></speech>

I am familiar with the issues the Minister raises about some of the sections, and we can see from the legislation published yesterday the differences between the Bills.  Some of the differences are minor and some are major and we can discuss them as we go through the sections of the Bill.  I am very conscious of the Minister's comments to the effect that the passage into law of this legislation, if it passes both Houses of the Oireachtas, and when the Government's merger of both public bodies takes effect, would annul the previous legislation, that is, my legislation.  That is what we talked about in our committee report.  The principle here is that we need to make sure that the principles within this legislation mirror the same sections in the Government's legislation.  This is only about a matter of timing.  I am not precious about the fact that I sponsored this Bill.  I already have another Bill in Committee Stage, which I have discussed with the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, regarding the timing of that legislation because of the pressures within the Department in dealing with other issues.  I am not precious about this at all.  I have left it until this Stage.  The reason I believe it is important to proceed at this point is that there are people locked out of the system.  I am not convinced the Government's legislation will be enacted in law before the summer recess.  I wish to flag to the committee the intention, when we conclude this and if it passes Committee Stage, that it would go to Report and Final Stages in the House before the end of this month.  We have secured space in the Seanad to proceed with this legislation at the start of June, so there is a pathway to allowing it to become law, which would allow for people who are locked out of the system at present.  Yesterday I spoke to a woman who cannot get access to the Financial Services Ombudsman or seek redress from the financial institution because of this rule and is waiting impatiently for this legislation.</p> <p>  I welcome the Minister's comments.  I believe the issue of how we proceed has already been discussed by the committee, and we had the benefit of a letter from the Minister stating he would publish the legislation.  What we need to do now is make sure that the sections, particularly the likes of sections 4 and 6, are mirrored in the Government's legislation.  For that purpose, I am very open to amendments and want to hear what the Government and indeed other Deputies here who have an opinion on this issue have to say to make sure we proceed.</p></speech>

Following the pre-legislative scrutiny and discussions with stakeholders, I have decided to propose deleting the section.  The original intention -  one I still support - is to make sure that the Financial Services Ombudsman is about protecting the small consumer, individual customers and small businesses.  It should not be swamped by large cases that are more suited to the commercial court.  The issue in my proposal was that the interpretation of it could be to exclude sole traders in charities.  That was raised during the pre-legislative scrutiny.  Sole traders could be excluded from accessing the services of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  That is something that would run counter to my intention.  I am glad that we have started a discussion about possibly looking at a two-tier process at some point in the future.  However, by deleting the section we would be reverting back to what exists in law at this point in time.</p><p>Currently, the definition of a consumer for the purpose of the ombudsman is:</p><blockquote>(<i>a</i>) a natural person when not acting in the course of, or in connection with, carrying on a business, or<br /><br />(<i>b</i>) a person, or group of persons, of a class prescribed by Council regulations;</blockquote> <p>When we look at the council regulations, we see that in 2005 the council used its powers to expand the definition of a consumer to include a person or group of persons but not an incorporate body with an annual turnover in excess of &euro;3 million.  For the avoidance of doubt, a group of persons includes partnerships and other unincorporated bodies, such as clubs, charities and trusts not consisting entirely of bodies corporate.  The definition also includes incorporated bodies with an annual turnover of &euro;3 million or less in the financial year prior to the year in which the complaint is made to the ombudsman, provided that such a body is not a member of a group of companies having a combined turnover greater than the said &euro;3 million.  There was a further clarification in 2014.</p><p>The original section in this Bill arose as a result of FLAC highlighting some court cases that judges suggested should have been directed towards the commercial court instead of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  That said, given the pre-legislative scrutiny, I want to delete the section in the Bill, which would mean reverting back to the existing definition of a consumer as laid down in the original Act and as prescribed by the regulations of the ombudsman's council.</p></speech>

The Department of Finance's point of view was that it would have unintended consequences of narrowing the definition to exclude small businesses such as sole traders and holders such as charities.  The Department has engaged extensively with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel on the definition of "consumer".  That definition is more comprehensive.  In particular it defines the term "consumer" as meaning in general terms individuals, small businesses, charities, clubs and so on.  On reflection, Deputy Doherty is moving an amendment to delete the section.  I welcome that very much and can agree to it.</p></speech>

The original wording of the Bill sought a large change by deleting the words &quot;in an informal manner&quot; and &quot;without regard to technicality and legal form&quot;.  My amendment today attempts to refine this approach by simply adding the word &quot;undue&quot; in order that the Financial Services Ombudsman will act &quot;without undue regard to technicality and legal form&quot;.  The key here is that while the office must be approachable, it must be correct in its duties.  I am confident that the amendment strikes the right balance.  I note that this proposal is also to be found in the Government's newly-published Bill.  We had quite an extensive discussion on this during the pre-legislative scrutiny.  This amendment arises from that discussion. </p></speech>

He has explained the impact and intent of the amendment in his contribution.  I note the current amendment no longer seeks to delete the words "in an informal manner" from the original Act and introduces the word "undue" to read as "without undue regard to technicality and legal form".  I very much welcome this amendment to section 3 of the Deputy's Bill as it resembles what is included in the Government legislation.  The provisions outlining that the ombudsman needs not have regard to technicality or legal form is considered by the ombudsman to be a very valuable and fundamentally important provision upon which reliance can be placed, while the ombudsman nevertheless complies with the requirements of natural justice.  I recognise that this text, which is also in the Government Bill, allows for informality while also acknowledging that such informality is to be bound by an appreciation for due process and fair procedures.  Therefore, I support this amendment.</p></speech>

The Government has its own piece of legislation to merge the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman and has accepted that this issue of the six-year rule will be part of that legislation.  It is important to try to mirror what is in both pieces of legislation in order that there is a seamless provision of services from the Financial Services Ombudsman and a clarity to how that would operate.  We have looked at the Government's heads of Bill and listened to what came out of the pre-legislative scrutiny.  We have proposed an amendment based on that.</p><p>This is one of the most important sections of the Bill.  It is the core area and the cause of the urgency to have this legislation enshrined into law.  The original proposal based on the FLAC report was to move to a two-year rule, which is two years from the date on which a consumer becomes aware of the act or deed.  As we speak, there are families across the State for whom this is a very real and pressing issue.  As I mentioned, I published this Bill back in September 2014.  We are two and a half years on since the publication of this Bill.  Even now, I am personally engaged with the Central Bank of Ireland on what I believe is another payment protection insurance scandal that has taken place, with thousands of customers of certain different institutions having been mis-sold products who did not originally come under the scope of the Central Bank's investigation.  There are potentially thousands of people who fall into this bracket.  As I mentioned, I had a conversation about this just yesterday and we have had a number of individuals contacting us just this week on this key area.</p><p>I know that there is cross-party support with regard to dealing with this issue.  I also want to note that Deputy McGrath has legislation on this issue that also proposes removing the block of the six-year rule.  The amendment today changes it from two years to three years, which is in line with what was suggested by both Deputy McGrath and the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  The three-year rule would apply to consumers who otherwise would be excluded by the six-year rule.  I have also taken steps in this amendment to address concerns about other aspects of the section.  I have inserted the term &quot;products of duration of greater than 6 years&quot; to make sure that renewable products that have a life but not necessarily a term of six years are eligible for the new time limits.  I have also decided not to use the Government's wording of &quot;ought to have known&quot;.  We discussed this during the pre-legislative scrutiny.  I feel that that terminology included in the legislation would only act in favour of the banks and to the detriment of the consumer.</p><p>I believe that this amendment is in line with what the Government's heads of Bill outlined.  I note that the Government has adopted a different approach because it is coming from a different legal basis.  There are some significant differences, particularly with regard to &quot;ought to have known&quot;, but I see no reason why that needs to be included.  I think that would provide a loophole for financial institutions to take cases against individuals and against the Financial Services Ombudsman by saying that an individual should have known that the tracker mortgage issue was in the public domain and so on, which would therefore continue to see people locked out of the system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1251" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017051100002#E00100"><p>I thank Deputy Doherty for his explanation.  I think I can go some of the road with him.</p> <p>  I note that the Deputy's Bill as published provides for an additional time limit to make complaints up to two years from the date of knowledge.  The heads of the Bill published last September provided for a possible three-year discoverability period for complaints with regard to long-term service.  This is now reflected in section 52 of the Government Bill that was published yesterday.  In that respect, the extension from two to three years for long-term financial services included in Deputy Doherty's amendment is to be welcomed.  The extension from two to three years is in line with what we have published now, and I thank Deputy Doherty for that part of the amendment.  I still have some difficulties with the section and I will explain what those are now.</p> <p>  The Government Bill provides an extra discretion to the ombudsman to extend the time limit that would benefit consumers in cases where it is just and reasonable, similar to the provision that exists for pension complaints.  Furthermore, the Private Members' Bill is silent as to whether the new time limit applies only prospectively - that is into the future and the conduct that occurs in the future - or retrospectively, to conduct that occurred in the past.  It could be that it applies to conduct that occurred in the distant past and these claims may be difficult to defend.</p> <p>  Section 51 of the Government Bill published yesterday provides for all pension products and for long-term financial services where the duration of the service is five years and one month or more and not subject to annual renewal or cancellation unilaterally.  Complaints can be made either six years from the date of the conduct giving rise to the complaint, or three years from the earlier of the following two dates.  The first is the date on which the person making the complaint first becomes aware of the conduct and the second is the date on which that person ought reasonably to have become aware.  The phrase is "ought reasonably to have become aware" of that conduct.</p> <p>  Section 51 also states that complaints can be made within "such longer period as the Ombudsman may allow where it appears to him or her that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just and equitable, in all the circumstances, to so extend the period".  The new time limit for long-term financial services will apply to complaints made to the ombudsman about conduct that occurred during or after 2002 if "the long-term financial service concerned has not expired or otherwise been terminated more than 6 years before the date of the complaint".  Furthermore, it is a common feature of these discoverability tests and in other ombudsman's schemes that the date runs from "the earlier of the date on which the person making the complaint became aware, or ought reasonably to have become aware, of the conduct giving rise to the complaint".  This is a standard objective test of knowledge and a necessary provision to prevent the possibility of an open-ended time limit.  The respondents would have a right to a reasonable time limit in which they are expected to keep records and defend any complaints.  I am happy to discuss this provision in more detail in the later stages of my Bill.</p> <p>  If this section proceeds to the next Stage, I wish to put the committee on notice that I will bring forward amendments on Report Stage covering the issues such as time limits and other technical drafting changes.  There may be other technical or related issues that the Department of Finance needs to explore further on Report Stage with a view to bringing forward an amendment.  Effectively, I agree the main thrust of the amendment is to extend from two years to three years and I welcome that, but there are other issues which need to be amended.  Rather than trying to patch it up now, we should leave that to Report Stage.  I also indicate that my officials will be available to Deputy Doherty and his support group to discuss Report Stage amendments in advance to see if we can reach agreement on them rather than bouncing them on the committee at Report Stage sight unseen.  If we could proceed on that basis, we could get over this difficulty.</p></speech>

I noted after reading the Government's published legislation some of the areas which the Government had included which I have no issue with, and which would give greater clarity.  For example, the extra discretion for the ombudsman is something that should be included.  The drafting of this would allow for it to be retrospective, but if that needed to be clarified as is in the Government's Bill, then that is not an issue.  The issue of the distance passed is one of debates, but it is not something that I would die in the ditch over.</p> <p>  There are two other areas which are probably areas where there are significant differences and where we need to engage to try to find common ground.  The method used by the Government in its legislation is the long-term financial product or service.  A long-term financial service in the definitions has to not be subject to annual renewal.  This is a core or very important issue on which I gave an example in pre-legislative scrutiny, where if somebody, for example, took out home insurance seven or eight years ago and renewed it every year under the definition, that would not be a long-term financial service, and therefore would not come under the subject of the section which deals with the six-year rules.  There is an issue there that we can tease out with officials.</p> <p>  The other issue is one I have raised before.  I am not convinced at all that "reasonably ought to have become aware" should be included in this.  I am very conscious that financial institutions, with their firepower and resources, turn up to the ombudsman with junior and senior counsel for very minor issues.  This creates an arguing point for them since it is very hard to define as to when somebody "reasonably ought to have become aware" and it can only work to the benefit of the financial institution.  If there was wrongdoing by the financial institution and if that was noted or became known within the six years or three years, then the ombudsman should be able to hear that case and determine that.  I have concern about that issue, but I welcome the Minister's suggestion that we sit down and discuss an amendment on that for Report Stage to make sure that the provisions in this section mirror what the Government intends to do in its Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill 2017.</p></speech>

It follows from this that we cannot have an unlimited time limit.  That would not be reasonable for the financial services firms which are putting a defence in place.  The reason for the form of words that we have included in the Government legislation is that it is the form of words in the UK legislation.  In Australia, which would be a similar common law country, the financial service ombudsman's records are kept for six years under the consumer protection code.  It is hard to go back beyond the legal requirements to preserve records.</p> <p>  We can work on the basis that the amendment proposed by Deputy Doherty is acceptable to me, but there are outstanding issues.  Part of the outstanding issues are matters that I do not think there will be difficulty in reaching agreement on, taking into account the comments made by Deputy Doherty, having read the Bill as published yesterday.  I think we will be able to accommodate those.  There is a real issue around the "might reasonably have known" point.  We need some cut-off, whether it is this form of words or through a different legal form of words.  I will commit to my officials being available to Deputy Doherty and his advisers to see if agreement can be reached.  While we are proceeding very rapidly at this point, this is a potential sticking point.  There are real issues here and we will see what comes from the engagement with officials.</p><p>Otherwise, I am happy to proceed.</p></speech>

Again, this legislation was published in 2014.  Since then, we have seen a change in the way the Financial Services Ombudsman is operating.  There are far more cases of mediation, which is to be welcomed.  There are also far more positive results in the service in recent times.  That process is voluntary at present and this section puts an onus on the financial institutions, where they refuse to mediate, to give a reason for their refusal to engage in the mediation process.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1260" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017051100002#F00700"><p>I note that section 5 of the Bill seeks to put greater pressure on the financial service provider to engage in the mediation process.  The Government Bill published yesterday seeks to strengthen the role of the Financial Services Ombudsman in promoting engagement in the mediation process and continues to provide for mediation as a tool for the ombudsman in cases where he sees fit.  In addition to this, I note that the Deputy&rsquo;s Bill was published at a time when mediation in the Financial Services Ombudsman was at a low base.  Deputy Doherty acknowledged that in his contribution and indicated that he is well aware of a change of practice in the ombudsman's office, where recourse to mediation is a more normal option than it was in the past.</p><p>As members are aware, the Financial Services Ombudsman last year introduced a dedicated dispute resolution service to resolve disputes through mediation at an early stage and with the minimum formality necessary.  The recent annual report of the FSO highlights that mediation is now the first and preferred option for resolving complaints.  A total of 2,378 complaints were resolved through mediation between 1 February 2016 and the end of 2016.  There has been a very big change of practice since we considered this initially and since Deputy Doherty drafted his Bill.  There is far greater recourse to mediation, and it is the norm rather than the exception to have recourse to mediation in the first instance.  We have reflected that practice in the new legislation sponsored by the Government and it should be reflected in Deputy Doherty's Bill as well.</p><p>I wish to notify the committee that I will bring forward amendments covering the issues set out in my Bill and discussed here now, as well as other related matters including technical drafting changes, on Report Stage.  However, that is not to subtract from anything proposed by Deputy Doherty in section 5.  It is to add to it and to take account of current practice at the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman.<b></b>Again, we can engage in advance on the detail of the provision.</p></speech>

The section broadens the range of findings the ombudsman can make.  Currently, the Financial Services Ombudsman can only rule a complaint to be substantiated, partially substantiated or not substantiated.  This section would extend the range of findings to upheld, substantially upheld, substantially rejected or rejected.  It might appear minor but it is an important change as it would allow us to better assess the performance and the outcomes of the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  At present, a consumer could have their case effectively lost, but the ombudsman would have to declare it partially substantiated even if no award was made to the consumer.  That is because on the basis of a technicality, a minor issue, the ombudsman felt the consumer was correct in that area but in the major charge that was levelled against the financial institution the ombudsman found against the consumer and it would be recorded as a partially substantiated case.</p> <p>  I am conscious that this change would cut across the name and shame provision which was introduced to allow the Financial Services Ombudsman to name in his report financial services providers who consistently have rulings against them.  I intend to table an amendment on Report Stage to section 57BS of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 to ensure that the broadened range of findings by the Financial Services Ombudsman is reflected in respect of the provision for naming and shaming.  I am happy to engage with officials on the drafting of that amendment.  It was also suggested to me that the ombudsman could be empowered to go further and publish findings, edited to protect identities.  The Minister has talked about looking at some of the provisions in Britain in terms of the drafting, but in Britain the findings are published in the format of Mr. or Mrs. C versus the Bank of England and so forth.  If the committee considers this would be a worthwhile amendment, I would be happy to consider it too.</p></speech>

Currently, the possible findings are limited to a finding that the complaint was substantiated, not substantiated or partially substantiated.  The Bill allows for findings of upheld, substantially upheld, substantially rejected or rejected.  The Government Bill goes further and proposes that decisions will be published, which is more transparent even though the names would be redacted.  Transparency and better reporting are the objective of the Bill and I support the intention behind this provision.  Any change to the determination categories would need to operate harmoniously with the name and shame provision, in order to be effective in increasing transparency.  As currently drafted it could operate to limit the name and shame provisions, and I am aware that is not the Deputy's intention.</p> <p>  Other steps have been taken in the Government Bill published yesterday to improve transparency in reporting, including the introduction of preliminary determinations, more detail and publication of determinations for financial services complaints, and more transparent information in the annual report on all investigations, including those terminated and settled.  If this section proceeds to the next stage I wish to put the committee on notice that I may bring forward amendments covering the issues mentioned, and other technical drafting changes, on Report Stage.  We have a common interest and a common purpose to make the findings at adjudication level more transparent and to enable the provision of additional information to the public at large as well to both sides in the complaints procedure.  The Bill published by the Government goes further and is more refined in the options given.  I wish to amend this section to import many of the provisions in the new legislation published yesterday into this Bill.  Again, it is a matter which the Deputy is amenable to consider.  We can have a preliminary discussion at official level before the draft Report Stage amendments are provided to the committee, if that is agreeable to the Deputy.</p></speech>

This is unnecessary, as the Government's Bill allows for full rectification to be granted in addition to compensation for inconvenience.</p><p>The proposed amendment might be based upon a misunderstanding.  The existing legislation allows for a number of redress tools, including rectification and compensation.  Rectification makes good the loss to consumers and there is no ceiling.  Compensation, which can be additional to the rectification, can be high or low depending on the specific facts of the case.  I understand from the ombudsman that the ceiling of &euro;250,000 has not caused problems in directing compensation.</p><p>Compensation can be high or low depending on the impact on the individual, for example, the inconvenience caused to consumers by the misconduct of the provider.  This is usually determined by the specific facts of the case.  The Financial Services Ombudsman's office has advised that, to date, it has not found that the ceiling of &euro;250,000 causes problems in directing compensation.</p><p>Examples of where rectification could be in excess of &euro;250,000 include a direction by the Financial Services Ombudsman that a financial service provider apply a lower rate of interest to a mortgage loan, pay an insurance claim, pay a life insurance claim and pay a critical illness claim.  Other important directions might include amending credit history information and ordering an insurance company to reinstate cover and-or continue cover over the next number of years.  For example, in the ombudsman's 2016 annual review, there was a direction to a provider to rectify the conduct complained of by immediately buying back an investment that had been mis-sold for the original amount of &euro;250,000, together with a direction for payment of an additional sum of &euro;7,000 in compensation.</p><p>At the pre-legislative scrutiny meeting on 27 October, the ombudsman drew the committee's attention to the fact that he could direct a financial service provider to pay compensation of up to &euro;250,000 and that he could also direct rectification.  He highlighted that such rectification could be significant, as it can involve putting a person back to the position in which he or she was before the complaint arose.  In some instances, such as where a home or life insurance policy has been voided or an income continuance or life insurance claim denied, this is potentially more important for the complainant than compensation.</p><p>In terms of reviewing the maximum compensation ceiling that the Deputy refers to in his proposed amendment, there is provision to enable the increase in compensation amount in the Government Bill, which was published yesterday.  This is a new power given to the Minister, one that is provided to the council under existing legislation, to adjust and update the maximum compensation amount if necessary.  Under section 4 of that Bill, for example, the Minister for Finance may, whether on his or her own initiative or at the request of the ombudsman, make regulations.  Section 4(2)(h) states that such regulation may &quot;specify a maximum amount of compensation that the Ombudsman may award to a complainant under <i>section 60</i>&quot;, which relates to complaints and redress in respect of financial service providers.</p><p>Furthermore, in the existing legislation and in the Bill published yesterday, there are provisions to carry out reviews.  Section 25(3) of my Bill on the publication of other reports states: &quot;The Ombudsman may, from time to time, prepare and submit to the Minister such other reports in relation to the performance of the functions under this Act as he or she considers appropriate.&quot;  Section 25(4) enables the Ombudsman to &quot;publish reports on other matters if he or she considers that it would be in the public interest to do so&quot;.  If this section in Deputy Doherty's Bill proceeds to the next Stage, I wish to put the committee on notice that I may propose Report Stage amendments covering the issues mentioned above and other technical drafting changes or other related issues.</p><p>My key point is that, if someone's complaint relates to serious financial loss and is upheld, it is not the compensation that makes good the loss, but the ombudsman's rectification power.  It is only after making good the loss in full that the compensation issue arises.  Without trying to rewrite law, it seems that the compensation piece is analogous to punitive damages in civil actions.  The case is settled and the compensation due is paid, but because of the bad behaviour of the party against which the complaint is made, an additional sum of money should be paid to allow for the fact of such bad behaviour, which is a loose lay man's description of how punitive damages arise.  It is the same in this context.</p><p>There is nothing in the existing legislation or Deputy Doherty's Bill that would prevent a full rectification to be made to a complainant.  According to the ombudsman, the head room of &euro;250,000 is sufficient for any further compensation provisions along the lines that I have described to be paid.  The legislation published yesterday has gone further again in teasing out certain aspects of the compensation provisions that might be necessary and how they might be kept up to date.  As such, I request that Deputy McGrath reflect on the matter between now and Report Stage.  I will get my officials to dialogue with him on whether we can incorporate the essential request of his amendment in the Government's Report Stage amendments.</p></speech>

I acknowledge his core point that the rectification can be 100% of the loss and that the compensation is in addition to that.  The amendment does not require the council to increase the compensation limit.  Rather, it provides that there would be an annual review.  The Minister has stated that his Bill provides for a possible increase in the compensation limit.  I make the point again that we are not examining the Government Bill.  Rather, we are examining Deputy Doherty's and seeking to improve it as best we can.  It is ahead of the Government Bill in the queue and where everything will end up is unknown.</p> <p>  I take the Minister's key point that the loss can be rectified in full and that the compensation is, in effect, additional to that.

As timing is an issue, we want to find as much common ground as possible before dealing with the issues again in the Government's legislation.  The provisions contained here have started a debate on an independent appeals mechanism that is accessible to the consumer.  Unfortunately, when the Financial Services Ombudsman finds in favour of a financial institution, an appeal to the High Court is beyond the reach of many people.</p> <p>  During the pre-legislative scrutiny stage, we heard about the drawbacks that could be associated with this section.  However, we also heard that the existing mechanism is expensive and intimidating for ordinary customers.  The instinct and motivation behind this section is to make access to the justice system affordable for the greatest possible number of people.  I listened to the debate during pre-legislative scrutiny and recognise some of the arguments as to why, despite the best of intentions, this section could be considered a double-edged sword.  I acknowledge the changes that are taking place within the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  It has been issuing preliminary findings since the start of the year.  It is early days yet but at least it gives people a type of appeals mechanism, although it is not independent.  We left the section in nonetheless.</p> <p>  There are two parts to the section.  The first provides that people would have access to the Circuit Court instead of the High Court.  The second pertains to the timelines that would be laid out for persons seeking to appeal a decision, which would increase to 60 days.  We have included that provision because, if an ordinary consumer is preparing a case for the Circuit Court or High Court and finds that the ombudsman has ruled against him or her, a period of 21 days is very restrictive in terms of getting a legal opinion, lodging an appeal, securing a solicitor and securing junior or senior counsel.  It is a very costly journey for ordinary consumers and families.  That is why we provided for an extension of the period to 60 days.</p> <p>  I am conscious that there is very strong opposition to this provision from Government.  I do not intend to push the provision on moving from the High Court to the Circuit Court.  The debate was worth having and we should continue to discuss having a more accessible, independent appeals mechanism.  Let us look at the changes being made within the ombudsman's office since the start of the year and how they can be strengthened.  I would, however, emphasise that the extension of the period from 21 to 60 days is important.  The courts set out their own timeframe but they are also obliged to respond to the legislation laid down by these Houses.  I hope we can find an area of common ground in respect of this provision as there is serious merit in it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1279" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017051100002#H00500"><p>Although there is disagreement on this section, Deputy Doherty's contribution just now has narrowed the ground considerably.  I welcome that.  The best way to proceed is by reading the formal speaking note.  Then we can chat about it and see if we can narrow the ground further so that we can arrive at agreement on Report Stage.</p><p>The purpose of the ombudsman is to be a free alternative to the courts system for consumers.  The intention of section 7 may have been to improve consumer protection by offering a <i>de novo</i>appeal in the Circuit Court to avoid the expense of the High Court for consumers.  That was a worthy intention.  However, I have some concerns.</p><p>A <i>de novo</i>appeal to the Circuit Court would involve the ombudsman as a notice party only, meaning that if the financial services provider appealed a decision which favoured the complainant, the complainant would have to defend the appeal in the Circuit Court, with all of the attendant expense.  The provider is in a considerably stronger position both to go to the Circuit Court and to succeed, due to the lack of inquisitorial powers of the Circuit Court.  In the existing statutory appeal to the High Court, the complainant is shielded by the high threshold which is applied to the statutory appeal and by the fact that the Financial Services Ombudsman can be a party to the complaint, and thus take the role of defending its own decision.  Neither of these factors operates in a Circuit Court <i>de novo</i>appeal and so the real effect is not only that the provider is in a stronger position on a case-by-case basis, but that the existence of the threat of an appeal by the provider operates as a deterrent to consumers generally.</p><p>In addition, in a High Court appeal, the ombudsman can defend his decision as a party to the statutory appeal.  This has the effect of protecting the consumer from the costs or threat of costs of a High Court appeal made by the provider.  Furthermore, a re-hearing could allow for a situation whereby people use the ombudsman as the first step in litigation before inevitably going before the courts, and taking their case again to the courts if unsuccessful.  This could result in a floodgate scenario for the office, which would have implications for staffing and the effectiveness of the office to process and determine complaints.  Time limits for appeals are currently set within such limits as the relevant court allows.</p><p>Finally, while a Circuit Court appeals process may appear to benefit the consumer as it is cheaper, it should be borne in mind that the Circuit Court can only award in cases up to &euro;75,000, where the ombudsman can award compensation up to &euro;250,000.  In addition, the Circuit Court will not hold an investigation, as the ombudsman can.  Instead, the consumer will be obliged to prove his or her case <i>de novo</i>to the civil standard, without the benefit of the ombudsman who can look into all the codes of practice and regulatory standards in addition to the facts of the case.  On balance, therefore, I do not believe that an appeal to the Circuit Court would provide greater consumer protection.</p><p>If this section proceeds to the next stage I wish to put the committee on notice that I may bring forward amendments covering the issues mentioned above and other technical drafting changes on Report Stage.  I may also look again at the time limit for appeals to court.  I welcome Deputy Doherty's latest intervention.  In a movement towards further agreement between us, I could commit to looking again at the time limit of 21 days versus 60 days between now and Report Stage.  I will examine the matter seriously and will get my officials to have a discussion with the Deputy.  It might be feasible to have an advance on the 21 days while still being short of the 60 days.</p></speech>

I am aware of how financial institutions try to use every possible mechanism to thwart the efforts of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  We need to be very careful about any changes.  This is evident even in respect of the tracker mortgages, where one financial institution is appealing right the way through the system.</p><p> I believe that this debate is worth having and that we need to continue to monitor an accessible and affordable independent appeals mechanism.  I do not intend to push the issue of the Circuit Court and High Court as it would delay the legislation.  I would welcome engagement with the officials on the issue of having a 21 day or 60 day interval.  I understand that if we lay the provision down in legislation then the courts will be obliged to act on that basis.  I have no problem with the section being opposed.  If it were opposed then I reserve the right to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage to deal with the timeframe for the Circuit Court as opposed to the High Court.  If the section were opposed it would also delete section 8, which is consequential on section 7.</p></speech>

The report dealt with the issue of an oral hearing.</p><p>I am conscious that my amendment may have resource implications for the Financial Services Officer, FSO.  My amendment provides that where a complainant makes a request for an oral hearing to be held in respect of his or her case and where, in that circumstance, &quot;there is a discrepancy in the account of events between the parties that is fundamental to arriving at a conclusion, the Financial Services Ombudsman should be obliged to hold an oral hearing&quot;.  My amendment seeks a significant change as it removes, in certain circumstances, the ombudsman's discretion to hold an oral hearing.  FLAC has made a strong case for the change to be made.  I have come across cases where complainants wanted an oral hearing but it did not subsequently happen.  My amendment is worth consideration. </p></speech>

The law states, indeed the High Court and Supreme Court rulings make it clear, that where an oral hearing is warranted then one must take place.  The amendments give clarity and certainty about the issue.  There may be concerns that this provision could be frustrated by financial service providers.  The amendment used the phrase "fundamental to arriving at a conclusion," which somewhat leaves a discretion with the Financial Services Ombudsman to appoint.  The amendment has been carefully worded and I have no problem accepting it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1291" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1326" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPS2017051100002#J01100"><p>I understand the intention of Deputy McGrath's amendment, which seeks to oblige the ombudsman to hold oral hearings in certain cases.  Oral hearings are best left best to the discretion of the ombudsman, in my view.  This is common practice in many public bodies.  For examine, An Bord Plean&aacute;la has the discretion to hold a hearing in any case of an appeal, referral or an application for permission or approval of strategic infrastructural development.  In the case of strategic infrastructural development, it will normally direct the holding of an oral hearing unless the application can be readily assessed by way of written submissions.  In appeals and other cases, it will normally grant an oral hearing only where this will assist its understanding of a complex case or where significant national or local issues are involved.</p><p>The reason I referenced An Bord Plean&aacute;la is that many of us who have served on local authorities will be familiar with the oral hearing provisions where the board of Plean&aacute;la has discretion to grant an oral hearing.  What I have put on record are the considerations they take into account.  </p><p>To begin, I am advised that the Financial Services Ombudsman agrees that it is very important to hear complainants.  For this reason the FSO introduced new procedures and entirely reoriented its processes so that complainants can discuss their case at length with a dispute resolution officer who is trained to use mediation techniques to deal with the case.  The new dispute resolution process is considerably more consumer friendly than the earlier more formal adjudication systems.</p><p>Notwithstanding the above, the adjudication process is still available to the parties if the case is not resolved in dispute resolution.  During the investigation process, the ombudsman may determine that an oral hearing is required based on the circumstances of the case.  It is the experience of the FSO that providers are usually well represented at oral hearings and, therefore,  it can be a difficult process for the complainant who must undergo cross-examination in an adversarial environment.  As a result, these are exceptions rather than the rule.  The courts have, on a number of occasions, endorsed the ombudsman's decision regarding whether to hold an oral hearing.</p><p>Additionally, it would seem contrary to fair procedures to allow the complainant only to dictate when an oral hearing was held.  There is a risk that the proposed amendment would have to allow the provider to also demand an oral hearing.  If this were the case, it is the FSO view that complainants would be put to a significant disadvantage and potentially discouraged from taking cases in the first place.</p><p>I am advised that there is relevant case law that ruled that &ldquo;The calling of experts on each side is an undesirable feature of a proceeding which is designed by an Act of the Oireachtas to be informal and expeditious.&rdquo;  Another case found the following:</p><blockquote>It cannot be the case that the FSO has an obligation to hold an Oral Hearing merely because there is a conflict of fact.  The requirement to hold an Oral Hearing can only arise where the fact in issue cannot be resolved without such Hearing.  It seems to me that the FSO has a significant discretion in considering this issue to decide whether in fact the holding of an Oral Hearing would be likely to be of any assistance.</blockquote> <p>One of the requirements behind the Financial Services Ombudsman legislation is to provide an out-of-court redress facility.  This helps the consumer to have a low cost and informal forum to have a case heard.</p><p>Deputy McGrath's proposed amendment requires an oral hearing<b></b>where a complainant has made a request to hold an oral hearing, and where there is a discrepancy in the account of events between the parties that is fundamental to arriving at a conclusion.  I appreciate what he is trying to achieve but this may have a negative impact on the consumer as there are always discrepancies at an initial stage when a complaint is made.  I am advised that this could inadvertently impose a requirement for oral hearings in all situations.</p><p>The premise of the Bill is to support informal redress procedures.  I am sure that the Deputy will agree that the best way to achieve this is through mediation.  As I referred to earlier, the statistics from the FSO's annual report shows that mediation is now the first and preferred option for resolving complaints and has contributed to successful outcomes in the office.  My Bill, as published yesterday, strengthens the role of the ombudsman in promoting engagement in the mediation process. It continues to provide for mediation as a tool for the ombudsman in cases where he sees fit.  This allows for the ombudsman to take a more proactive approach to encourage participation.</p><p>Additionally, the High Court and Supreme Court have noted on a number of occasions that the FSO must follow fair procedures, that oral hearings may form part of those fair procedures and that the FSO should determine whether an oral hearing is required, taking into account all the circumstances of the case<b>.</b></p><p>The ombudsman does hold oral hearings where necessary and it is more suitable that the power is maintained in a discretionary manner.  While I appreciate the Deputy's desire to achieve a solution in difficult cases, it is clear that mediation should be the primary route.  For that reason I do not support this amendment.  If this section proceeds to the next Stage, I wish to put the committee on notice that I may bring forward amendments covering the issues mentioned and other technical drafting changes.</p><p> The differences are narrow enough.  I favour oral hearings but the power to have an oral hearing should be vested in the ombudsman and should be invoked at his discretion analogous to what the Planning Appeals Board does now.  Oral hearings can serve a very useful purpose but I do not want to make it mandatory on the ombudsman to have oral hearings on every case for the reasons I have outlined.  Also, in terms of where the amendment is silent, it seems to me that if the right to request an oral hearing is vested in the complainant, the company or person against which the complaint is made might be able to invoke analogous rights and also insist that they have the right to go for an oral hearing.  That will then complicate what is intended to be an informal process.  The Deputy might reflect on it, as I will do, between now and Report Stage and we will come back and talk about it again.</p></speech>

That is quite a comprehensive response.  I will not press the amendment.  I would make the point that the amendment is crafted in a way that it does not make it mandatory.  Even where the complainant requests an oral hearing, there is discretion on the part of the ombudsman because it only applies where the difference or discrepancy in the evidence is fundamental to arriving at the conclusion.  It is not in every case that a complainant would want to have an oral hearing but we should not take the human element out of proceedings.  Some people like to have the opportunity to make their case in person, face to face with a human being, and I do not believe we should remove that.  I accept that mediation is the preferred route and can be successful in many cases so I will withdraw the amendment and reserve the right to resubmit it for Report Stage.</p></speech>

I am pleased the committee has also invited colleagues from the HSE and RCPI.  I would also like to welcome Dr. Joan Gilvarry, director of human products monitoring, Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA.  We look forward to working with the committee and extending to members every co-operation and assistance in their work.</p> <p>  Vaccination is regarded as one of the safest and most cost-effective of all health care interventions.  The World Health Organization, WHO, estimates that up to 3 million lives are saved each year as a result of vaccination.  All vaccines undergo long and careful review by scientists, doctors, and regulatory authorities to make sure they are safe.</p> <p>  Routine immunisation programmes commenced in Ireland in 1932 with the introduction of diphtheria immunisation.  The current national immunisation programmes include the primary childhood immunisation, PCI, programme, which offers vaccination against 13 infectious diseases, and the schools immunisation programme, SIP, which offers booster immunisations to all children and the important cancer-preventing HPV vaccine to girls.  In addition the HSE, through GPs and pharmacies, provides seasonal influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccines for people aged 65 years and older and those in medically at-risk groups.  Participation in immunisation programmes in Ireland is voluntary, and, in the case of childhood vaccines, requires parental consent.</p> <p>  Ireland's immunisation policy is influenced by the policies that are developed through the WHO for the European region.  The process and outcome targets established by the organisation have been used to guide the objectives of the Irish programme.  These have specified the coverage levels to be attained, and outcomes such as elimination of target diseases, for example, polio, measles, and diphtheria.  Other relevant international bodies include the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the European Medicines Agency.</p> <p>  Immunisation policy and processes in Ireland are underpinned by the following principles, which support the Healthy Ireland goal to protect the public from threats to health and well-being - a fair equitable safe and relevant policy based on best evidence, and provided within a sustainable budgetary framework; a system of immunisation delivery which is flexible and cost effective to ensure easy introduction of new vaccines; promotion of immunisation equity; immunisation coverage uptake rates to achieve WHO targets of 95%; strong surveillance system which detects changes in rates of VPD, or new strains not covered by existing vaccines; information systems that can provide data of uptake and early warning of reduced uptake; and an effective public communication system capable of providing understandable scientific information which challenges misinformation from whatever source.</p> <p>  A number of key stakeholders are involved in immunisation policy and delivery of immunisation programmes in Ireland and I will briefly outlines their roles.  The Department has ultimate responsibility for policy decisions relating to immunisation.  It is also involved in securing the funding of immunisation programmes through the Estimates process, the legislative and regulatory framework underpinning immunisation programmes, and co-ordination between key stakeholders.  The NIAC is a committee of the RCPI.  It is an independent national technical advisory committee, which advises the Department of Health on vaccines, immunisation and related health matters in the Irish context.  The HSE has a key role in the delivery of immunisation programmes, which it supports through the national immunisation office, the Health Protection Surveillance Centre, primary care and community health offices which come under the aegis of the health and wellbeing directorate.  The NIO is responsible for the implementation of national immunisation programmes, and has a number of roles, in particular, communication with professionals and with the public about vaccination.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, is responsible for national surveillance of infectious diseases, including vaccine preventable diseases, VPDs, and acts as the focal point for communication with international agencies on VPD and immunisation uptake.  Local primary care and community health officers co-ordinate invitations and the monitoring of the PCIP and school immunisation teams administer the SIP in most regions.  The  Health Products Regulatory Authority is responsible for licensing of medicines, including vaccines, in Ireland.  The HPRA also monitors and evaluates adverse events relating to vaccine.  General practitioners are contracted to administer the primary childhood programme.  In some regions they deliver the SIP.  They also provide other vaccination such as influenza to risk groups under contract.  Retail pharmacists who have undergone the required training can apply for a contract to administer certain adult vaccines.  Currently, pharmacists can administer seasonal influenza, pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccines.</p> <p>  The State's immunisation programmes have had a significant impact in improving the health of the people.  Diseases that used to be common in this country and around the world, including polio, measles, diphtheria, whooping cough, meningococcal Band C and many other serious infectious diseases can now be prevented by vaccination.</p><p>However, vaccines also can prevent the development of cancer, as well as preventing disease.  The hepatitis B vaccine given as part of the six-in-one vaccine in the primary childhood immunisation programme helps prevent cancer of the liver caused by hepatitis B infection, while the human papilloma virus, HPV, vaccine given to schoolgirls can prevent the development of cervical cancer from that virus.  </p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s uptake rates for many vaccines in the primary childhood immunisation programme are close to the WHO uptake target of 95%.  However, challenges remain.  In recent years, due to the success of our programme many vaccine-preventable diseases have become so infrequent that we have lost the collective memory of how serious some childhood illnesses can be.  Furthermore, some people believe the perceived risks of vaccines outweigh the risks of forgotten serious infectious diseases.  For example, a scare surrounding the MMR vaccine in the 1990s resulted in a large reduction in uptake rates for this vaccine.  In January 2000, a large outbreak of measles occurred in Dublin and resulted in more than 100 children being hospitalised, 13 of whom required intensive care treatment and there were three measles-related deaths.  It has taken many years to get MMR uptake rates up to the current national level of 92%.  However, this figure masks a small number of areas of low uptake.  These areas are therefore vulnerable to measles outbreaks.  Several European countries are currently experiencing large measles outbreaks, the biggest of which are in Romania, Italy and the United Kingdom.  Last year, 40 cases of measles were reported in Ireland related to three imported cases from Europe.  Measles cases occurred in children who either had no vaccination or were under-vaccinated.  If Ireland is to achieve the WHO target of eliminating measles by 2020, efforts must be made to identify children who are at risk and offer them vaccines.  The HSE continues to work in this area.  Details of the work will be given later in today&rsquo;s proceedings.</p><p> A similar situation pertains with respect to the HPV vaccine.  Unfounded false claims of an association between the HPV vaccine and a number of conditions experienced by a group of young women have been made.  There is no scientific evidence that the HPV vaccine causes any long-term illness.  However, this misinformation has led to a significant drop in uptake rates of the HPV vaccine.  As recently as last week, the director of the national cancer registry stated the reduction in uptake rate of HPV vaccine among Irish girls is very concerning.  The Irish Cancer Society states that based on national cancer statistics, the drop in the rate of uptake to 50 % for the 2016 to 2017 academic year will lead to the death from cervical cancer of at least 40 girls who did not receive the HPV vaccine.  A further 100 girls will develop cervical cancer and require life-altering treatments.  Another 1,000 girls may require invasive therapy to prevent the pre-cancerous form of HPV.</p><p> Despite the availability of free and effective vaccines, a small number of people choose not to vaccinate themselves or their children in the belief that vaccines are unsafe or no longer necessary.  People need to be aware that a decision not to vaccinate has a wider public impact.  Such a decision may put a person's own life and that of his or her child at risk, as well as vulnerable individuals with whom the person comes into contact including people with a reduced immunity such as sick and elderly vulnerable patients, pregnant women or small babies who have not yet completed all their vaccinations.</p><p> The uptake of the seasonal influenza vaccine in health care workers in Ireland is disappointingly low.  As a result of the winter initiative campaign this year, there was an increase in uptake rates compared to previous seasons.  Some units achieved above the target of 40 %.  However, the national rate fell far short of the target.  As people who care for sick and vulnerable patients, health care workers need to consider their duty of care to patients and make it a priority to receive the flu vaccine every year.</p><p> Parents want to do everything possible to ensure their children are healthy and protected from preventable diseases.  Vaccination is the best way to do that.  It is understandable that parents may feel anxious about vaccinating their child, in particular when they hear or read alarming stories about side effects of vaccination.  I urge any parent who has doubts or questions about vaccination to engage with his or her family doctor or to visit the national immunisation office website.  These sources of information are clear, accurate and will answer any queries parents may have about the benefits and risks of vaccination.  </p><p>We all have a public health commitment to our communities to protect one another and one another&rsquo;s children by vaccinating ourselves and our family members.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague, Dr. Brenda Corcoran, who is a consultant in public health medicine at the national immunisation office.  We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee and engage with members.  I appeared before this committee 16 years ago on a review of the same topic.  The committee subsequently produced a very influential report.  Dr. Corcoran and I are very proud of what we have achieved in the 15 years since that report.  As Dr. Bonner said, vaccination uptake rates have increased dramatically.  We have also introduced new vaccines.</p> <p>  An immunisation programme is one of the great benefits a state can provide for its community.  It protects its community, in particular the most vulnerable such as children and the elderly.  It is one of the most cost-effective health interventions available, being second only to clean water.  Each year, it saves millions of people worldwide from illness, disability and death.  In 2005, the Harvard school of public health observed that the economic benefits of immunisation have been greatly underestimated, which is true and very important.  People do not understand how much of a change has taken place.  Today&rsquo;s witnesses are all doctors.  Each of us has seen a massive change during the 20, 30 or 40 years that we have been in practice.  I am the only witness who has been in practice for 40 years.  There has been a massive change.  One saw things then that one simply does not see today.  Doctors and consultants now do not encounter diseases which I encountered in the 1970s.  </p> <p>  The national immunisation programme aims to prevent diseases in individuals and groups by achieving the World Health Organization vaccine uptake targets of 95% for childhood vaccines and 75% for seasonal influenza.  To achieve these targets, a well-functioning immunisation programme is essential, involving a multidisciplinary integrated approach from all key stakeholders, including the bodies represented here today.  Other witnesses will give evidence of the very robust national and international processes that underpin the introduction of new vaccines, with patient safety considerations always being paramount.</p> <p>  Ireland has a strong history of having a comprehensive dynamic immunisation programme.  Nine new vaccines were introduced to the childhood schedule in the 20th century.  Since the year 2000, there have been 12 changes to the childhood schedule, including three catch-up campaigns.  We are moving on and are protecting more people against more diseases.  </p> <p>  We now provide several programmes, one of which is the primary childhood immunisation programme.  It is provided free of charge by GPs, who are in contract with the HSE, to approximately 65,000 babies per year.  Children require five visits to their GP which take place at two, four, six, 12 and 13 months.  They receive seven vaccines which prevent 13 diseases.</p><p>That includes, in the past year, the new meningococcal B and rotavirus vaccines that were introduced at the end of last year. </p><p> The school immunisation programme is provided by HSE school vaccination teams to 70,000 junior infants through two vaccines preventing seven diseases and to nearly 60,000 students in first year of secondary school.  Boys receive two booster vaccines that prevent four diseases and girls receive three vaccines that prevent five diseases over two visits.  In 2016, 900,000 vaccines were given to babies and schoolchildren to protect them and the wider community through herd immunity from 14 serious diseases. </p><p> Each year GPs, pharmacists and occupational health services provide the seasonal flu vaccine to everyone who is 65 years or older, people under 65 with certain long-term medical conditions, pregnant women and health care workers.  We distribute around 800,000 doses of flu vaccine every year and estimate around 700,000 are used.</p><p> We continue to reach the target of 95% for most of the vaccines given to babies.  The uptake of the MMR, or measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, declined to 69% in 2001 due to discredited vaccine safety allegations but it has slowly increased to 92% or 93% in 2016.  We still see measles outbreaks because not all children and young adults are fully vaccinated.  Most recently there was an outbreak of 40 cases last year, half of whom were hospitalised.  The human papilloma virus, HPV, vaccine uptake was 87%.  The uptake has dropped due to vaccine safety concerns and rumour and is now estimated to be around 50% for this year.  The uptake of the influenza vaccine has remained at around 55% for those 65 years and older and less than 20% for pregnant women.  Uptake among hospital health care workers is still low this season at just 31% although it has increased from 22% last year.  The rate of uptake by nurses has almost doubled this season, which is very impressive.</p><p> Significant efforts are made each year to understand the factors that drive and motivate people to be vaccinated.  Campaigns and public health messages are designed with key stakeholders and service users.  All of this work is regularly evaluated and future work revised to take cognisance of learnings to date and shifting behavioural trends.  It is very important to note the immense amount of work done by nurses - be they practice nurses, public health nurses or school nurses - doctors, GPs, community medical staff, occupational doctors, pharmacists and clerical administrative staff.  I highly commend the work of the national immunisation office, the health protection surveillance centre and our communications partners, internally in the HSE and our colleagues elsewhere who are outside of the organisation.  </p><p> Although overall public trust in vaccination is positive, as evidenced by the generally high uptake rates, current parental concerns about HPV vaccine safety on social and local media, which have no scientific basis, have left large numbers of girls at a future risk of cervical cancer and at short-term risk of anal-genital warts.  There is concern that the reduction in HPV vaccine uptake may lead to reduced rates in other childhood vaccines and there is some evidence that is happening.  This may be due to vaccine complacency as many of the diseases are not visible now due to the success of vaccination or are not perceived to be as serious and immediately life threatening as they are.  Ongoing concerted efforts are required from all health care professionals and opinion leaders to improve and maintain vaccine confidence in HPV and all vaccines.  The scientific evidence is clear.  Vaccination is the most effective intervention for the prevention of many serious diseases.  Vaccines are one of modern medicine's major success stories and this public health success must be sustained.</p><p> My colleagues and I are happy to answer any questions.  </p></speech>

We thank the Chairman and committee for inviting us here today to focus on the important issue of vaccines.<br/><br/>I am a paediatrician and infectious disease specialist.  I have worked in this area for a very long time; I shall not specify how long.<br/><br/>The benefits of vaccine are quite simply a matter of fact.  Vaccines work.  Vaccines save lives.  Vaccines prevent illness, misery and hardship.<br/><br/>The committee has heard all of the numbers from Dr. Bonner and Dr. Kelleher.  The numbers are dramatic.  In 1959 there were over 15,000 cases of measles.  In the 1970s, which is not that long ago, there were seven deaths a year on average.  Last year there were 43 cases but that should have been zero.  The number of diphtheria, pertussis and polio cases all tell the same story.  I will not focus on the numbers but will try to give the real picture to the committee.  When I think about the impact that vaccines have had on lives, I do not have to look very far.  I can think of my own family in the 1940s, a time just before the initiation of vaccine programmes.  My uncle, who was then four years of age, died of diphtheria.  My grandfather shortly thereafter succumbed to o<font color="#212100">ropharyngeal cancer.  It is most likely such a cancer would now be preventable.</font><br/><br/><font color="#212100">  In the 1950s one of my generation, at six months of age, was taken from the family home in the midst of panic and driven to Cherry Orchard Hospital in Dublin.  The child had polio and had to stay in an isolation ward in the hospital for over six months.  I recall going to Cappagh Hospital in the 1960s and seeing alongside me the children who had been in the ward in Cherry Orchard Hospital.  The wards were full of children wearing callipers and sitting in wheelchairs as a result of the polio epidemic.</font><br/><br/><font color="#212100">  In the 1960s we all experienced a series of measles, mumps, whooping cough and whatever.  I remember them all.  We were the lucky ones because we recovered.  There are many people today who suffer chronic lung disease or blindness and there are those who did not survive.  </font><br/><br/><font color="#212100">  In the 1980s there was another generation.  My daughter almost died </font>from haemophilus influenzae sepsis, while her playmate was in an intensive care unit with meningitis.  <br/><br/>When I left my home this morning my two-year old grandchild, who was visiting me, ran around.  I am delighted that he has had all of these vaccines and that I do not have to worry about him suffering those diseases.  Luckily, he has also received the meningococcal B vaccine.  I work in Temple Street and Crumlin hospitals and this week, I left the bedside of a child who is two years and four months old.  He is fighting for his life having suffered meningococcal B meningitis because he was not lucky enough to be born in the era of a national campaign.  We did not have funding for a catch-up campaign.<br/><br/>I have outlined the real impact of vaccinations.  When misinformation spreads it denies people the benefits of vaccines, thus resulting in family tragedy and community tragedy.  There has been a lot of misinformation about vaccines.  We acknowledge that no medicine or therapy is 100% safe and nor is there a vaccine that is 100% safe for every person.  It was not 100% safe for me to leave my house and drive my car here today.  On a balancing of risks, the benefits of vaccines at an individual level and community level far outweigh those risks.  It is important that we have close surveillance to pick up adverse events.  We acknowledge that the history of vaccines is not without its problems.  We now have very careful pre-licence and post-licence monitoring to detect signals that might say there is a problem.<br/><br/>Ireland, as a country and a community, cannot shy aware from problems.  For example, narcolepsy has been associated with the pandemic flu vaccine.  When a problem occurs it is investigated, acknowledged and then appropriate actions are taken.</p><p>If we contrast that with the current scares around the HPV vaccine, those concerns have been heard and I have seen patients with this constellation of symptoms in my clinic.  It is a problem for the family.  We do not deny that.  These are very real issues when one has a son or daughter and saw the child performing very well, and suddenly it seems that the rug has been pulled from under him or her because he or she is tired and has muscle aches and pains.  We do not understand that complex of symptoms.  Those symptoms were there before the HPV vaccine.  They are there in girls who are vaccinated.  They are there in girls who are unvaccinated.  They are there in boys.  The European Medicines Agency, EMA, looked at it when that concern arose and the vigilance committee in the EMA looked at what the incidence rate was in the vaccinated and in the unvaccinated, and there was no difference.  Contrast that with narcolepsy.  When the EMA looked at it, there was a higher incidence in the vaccinated.  The background instance had stayed the same.  That is the difference between these two things, so we can be reassured that these symptoms, although they may temporarily occur after vaccines, are not causally related.  What we may find, as Dr. Bonner has alluded to, is that children are missing out on the vaccines and will later suffer the impact from cervical cancers and other cancers, as Professor Donal Brennan can expand on later.</p><p> I put it to the committee that our national immunisation programme has safe and effective vaccines that benefit our community.  We have to shatter the myths around vaccines, that diseases are extinct or no longer a threat, the myths such as happened with MMR that vaccines cause autism, the myth that HPV vaccine causes chronic fatigue symptom or the postural orthostatic hypotension syndrome.  We have to communicate and learn how to better communicate that these vaccines are safe.  What we really need to look at is how we can expand our vaccination campaign so we can protect the lives and health of others.</p><p> We need to look at how we can make sure that no other two-year old comes into our clinic with the meningococcal B infection when we know we have a very effective vaccine.  It was introduced in the UK, our close neighbour, ahead of us.  The UK has just published the data on the effectiveness of the first six months of the campaign, and the number of cases had already halved ten months after its introduction.</p><p> We have to look at why we are not using varicella chickenpox vaccine in this country.  People have a wrong idea about chickenpox.  They think it is a simple, uncomplicated illness.  Just this week, I have tended four children hospitalised with serious complications from chickenpox.  When they get chickenpox, they are vulnerable not only to its complications, but the complications of serious invasive bacterial disease.  At the moment, we have a very invasive, nasty streptococcal disease that is causing bone infections and skin infections.  It was called "the flesh-eating bug" in the newspapers, and we have seen that in children who have had chickenpox.  I tended four children this week, two with bone infections and one with complicated seizures.  There is an effective, safe, licensed vaccine.  I have to ask why we are not using it in our programme.  We would certainly like to.</p><p> We need to make sure that we strengthen our programme and expand it to benefit our community, both its health, but also, as Dr. Kelleher said, benefit it through the reduced economic cost.  Thankfully, we have introduced rotavirus vaccine that will make a big difference to families and to workplaces, and to the country's economy.</p><p> I thank the committee for inviting us here today.  I ask it to understand that all of us here are physicians.  None of us wants to do any harm to any of our patients.  We would not give vaccines if we did not truly believe they were safe.  My girls were among the first to receive the vaccine, before it was introduced to the national programme.  I gave them that vaccine because I had looked at the data and knew it was safe.  I did not want to see my daughter, who now has one child and is expecting her second, succumb to cervical cancer in her 30s or 40s when her children are still young.  However, I know someone who is in that very position today as we sit here debating the merits.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1331" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051100002#G00300"><p>I apologise in advance because I was jotting down my questions as I went along and they might jump about a bit.  My questions are for all the witnesses.  I thank them for coming in and for their evidence.</p> <p>  The first question is on the low uptake of vaccinations among health professionals.  Does anyone have a view on it?  It would not exactly fill one with confidence if the person who is telling one that it is a good idea to be vaccinated is also part of a group offered vaccinations and not taking them up.</p> <p>  On the six-in-one vaccination, I have had representations from a constituent advising that in that person's opinion, this is better if taken individually rather than together.  I see a nod from a witness and understand that it is known where that is coming from.  In the interests of furthering our discussion on it, do the witnesses have any comment on whether there are any known benefits of breaking this into six individual vaccinations?</p> <p>  On the HPV vaccine, I had some very small and tangential involvement in this as a union official when it was being rolled out.  We were in the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, at the time.  It is the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, now.  There seemed to be a frantic rush to bring in this scheme, to the extent that we got approval in the early hours of the morning for self-certification for Garda clearance to be used.  A particular group - teenage girls - is being dealt with.  Garda clearance is necessary and appropriate.  There was not enough time for Garda clearance for the doctors and public health nurses that were going to be rolling out the vaccine between when we in the LRC - I think Dr. Kelleher was there - and the roll-out of the programme in September.  The HSE and Department of Health received clearance to allow the programme to go ahead on a self-certified basis.  I could not understand at that time what the rush was.  It was explained to us with regard to the shelf-life of the medicine itself.  It was never effectively explained to us.  I would be interested to know if it has improved from self-certification and if Garda clearance is now the norm.</p> <p>  A patient information leaflet is provided.  My daughter would have received it in school, going back a number of years.  Parents are given a small consent form.  My understanding is that a much broader leaflet is available.  Parents have a right to know but may not necessarily know that further information is available other than that which they get from the school.  Can more be done, given the fact that there is a drop in the uptake rates, to give parents the information that they need?  If I am asked, I take a very simple view.  I advise people to go to their doctor, to talk to any health professional that they need to to put their mind at rest and to make their own decision.  I would not seek to advise anyone.  I am not a doctor.  I appreciate that I am in a room full of doctors, but I am not one.  I wonder if there is more information that can perhaps be made available to parents in advance.  The new school term starts in September.</p> <p>  My final question is for Dr. Butler.  She mentioned that the adverse incidents - I do not think she used the words "adverse incidents" and do not want to put words in her mouth - are investigated and acknowledged where issues arise.</p><p>The witness says surveillance takes place, but how is that done?  Do clinicians wait for people to come to them with a problem or do follow-up questionnaires go to parents or through the school?  When the witnesses say there is surveillance, investigation and follow-up, how do they find the people?  Do they come or do the witnesses go to them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051100002#H00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  We have discussed this issue at this committee but the ears of the broader public do not seem receptive, particularly with regard to the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccine.  The evidence is overwhelming in terms of broad vaccination programmes, and the national immunisation programme is clearly responsible for thousands of being alive or without injury or illness.  In the case of the HPV vaccine, the concerns being expressed by individuals are clearly being received by the people because the immunisation programme and the confidence around it are being undermined by social media, misinformation, false information and fears to the point that people have told me that when girls in first year are waiting to be vaccinated, some make a decision there and then not to go ahead with it.  They are chatting among themselves and decide as a group not to go ahead with it.  Those fears can be quite profound and ingrained.</p> <p>  In view of the fact we were late to the table with this vaccination programme for HPV and other countries are ahead, has there been any similar drop-off in other First World countries using this vaccination programme?  We were at 87% or 88% at one stage but we are now down to 50%.  We are now possibly beyond the critical mass for community or herd immunisation.  Have there been similar difficulties in other countries in terms of a drop-off because of misinformation, a lack of understanding and all that flows from that?  This has come about primarily because of Internet and social media, especially the sharing of information or misinformation, depending on how one looks at it.  It involves the sharing of views and opinions and that almost escalates at times to crisis point in social media discussions.  In India and other regions, voodoo or taboo-type concerns would be expressed about vaccination programmes, but this is what we must deal with here.  Have we the capacity to explain this scientifically in a way that is friendly and comprehensible in a social media context?</p> <p>  Professor Karina Butler explained this in a passionate and simple way in order that it could be understood by people.  I do not mean to be disrespectful but I am a layperson and sometimes when the medical community explains issues or formulates advertisements, it may not amount to what is required in the modern era of social media.  That is something that should be looked at.  Rather than going around on the issue, have there been similar problems in other countries and what has been done to address that?  Are we unique in that we have seen a critical drop-off in the uptake of the Gardasil vaccine?</p> <p>  The cases in Denmark have been referenced on a number of occasions by groups like Reactions and Effects of Gardasil Resulting in Extreme Trauma, REGRET, and others who are campaigning against this particular vaccination programme.  They are not necessarily always campaigning against it but rather arguing that the Gardasil vaccine is unsafe.  They instance Japan and Denmark as examples, which are two First World countries with good safety records.  Denmark referred Gardasil to the European Medicines Agency or the World Health Organization for investigation.  Why did that happen?  Do the countries still have a vaccination programme?  Those issues are consistently being raised.  As a proponent of immunisation and vaccines, it is important to have information put not just to this committee but put to the broader public fairly quickly.  As the Irish Cancer Society has indicated, otherwise we could end up condemning 40 women to certain death.</p> <p>  Pandemrix was manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline around 2009 as a swine flu vaccination and there issues arising from it with regard to narcolepsy.  It is accepted there were side effects and this is sometimes used by the people who campaign against the human papillomavirus, Gardasil.  Were the checks and balances, including an evaluation of the Pandemrix vaccine, done in the exact same way as every other vaccine or was it rushed because there was a pandemic?</p> <p>  There is the issue of parental information.  Parents have come to me and while some advocate the vaccination, others were very concerned and some had the view that it should not be given.  In the context of information being provided at school level for the Gardasil vaccine, even by the clinicians or nurses providing it, a better effort may need to be made.  As I already said, there are girls chatting in corridors while queuing for the vaccination programme and they are very uncertain about it.  I had a case reported to me recently with people fainting in advance of getting the vaccine because of the fear of it.  This was used on social media to undermine the credibility of the programme.</p> <p>  Article 50 has been triggered and negotiations will take place about Brexit.  Is there any concern for the short and medium term that there could be a divergence between the UK and European thinking on issues related to community and herd immunisation on the island of Ireland?  There may be different vaccination approaches, one without a vaccination programme in one or the other jurisdiction.  Is there a concern in that context or a plan to ensure the issue is Brexit-proofed, as we say with everything else?</p></speech>

I appreciate that very much.  I have a particular instinct or background that I wish to bring to this.  The issue of confidence, language and how we promote this are important.  Professor Butler made the final opening statement and it could be described as coming from a parent or grandparent who is also a doctor and very much involved with the issue.  It struck me as an approach to better communication.  The parents who are concerned about this want to do the right thing.  There has been mention of social media and local broadcasts.</p> <p>  I was diagnosed with a condition called infantile paralysis and a little while later they figured out it was polio.  I remember reading afterwards that they connected this with kids drinking Coke because they became paralysed afterwards.  They concluded that drinking Coke or soft drinks caused the condition.  There are always people making such connections.</p><p>I have seen here in Ireland young people with polio, thankfully not people who grew up here but people who came here from other countries.  I believe the world is now free of polio or very close to it.  We even had awful things, I think in Pakistan, with the Taliban going around killing the people involved in vaccinations.  These things are cultural and political.  There is lots of stuff going on.  When people such as the witnesses are saying there is absolute evidence for it and people are making false claims, that is technically true, but how do we best communicate these things?</p><p> We need to reach that herd immunisation of 95% - it may be less for some conditions.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the voluntary nature of immunisation.  I can see why we might not want to go down that road.  It is not simply a matter for an individual; the community, one's neighbours and society are impacted by it.  Those are some of the issues.  </p><p> When people lose confidence in banks, irrespective of whether they have buckets of money, certain things will happen.  We need to realise that is the space we are in with Gardasil in particular and some other things.  I believe Dr. Bonner talked about the collective memory.  That is for those of us of a certain age, but we are talking about people who are a generation or two younger.  How do we communicate that?  How are we going to shatter the myth?  The rug has been pulled from under us.</p><p> We have a massive communications, and hearts and minds issue to deal with.  The witnesses will forgive me for saying this.  The more they wear the white coats, the more it causes people to say "Well, you would say that".  We need to suggest that people do the right thing or take advice.  I do not know that those straightforward messages are enough.  That is my point; it is not that they are wrong.  Facts are facts and we need to deal with them.</p><p> People do not have confidence in our health services.  No one wants to know about preventive science; they are bothered about trolleys, etc.  The witnesses have been candid in saying there can be side effects, etc.  Seatbelts save lives, but it does not mean they save every life.  Given that people do not have confidence in our health services, if something unintended happens, I do not have the confidence that my son, daughter or anyone else will get a timely response and support.  That is an issue not so much for the witnesses but for us.</p></speech>

We are under some time pressure this morning and we hope to conclude the meeting by 11.15 a.m.  However, if we do not do that satisfactorily there is an opportunity to revisit the situation again.  I do not want the witnesses to feel under pressure for time because we would like to do a complete review of this.  We just have some pressure this morning because Mr. Michel Barnier is coming to address both Houses of the Oireachtas.  If we do not get satisfactory completion this morning, we can revisit it at some other stage.</p></speech>

We will take the first group first and come back to the HPV issue.</p> <p>  We were asked about the low uptake of the flu vaccine among health care workers.  It is a problem internationally.  We are involved in a number of working studies.  Last week, I attended a meeting with UK colleagues to discuss this issue.  Internationally, people have taken two approaches to getting health care workers to take flu vaccines.  It can be done through a major promotional campaign, which has a degree of success and we saw a significant change in the past year.  However, it takes years.  The UK has been going at that for some years.  England has increased the uptake among health care workers to nearly 60% with some hospitals higher than 90%.  They have been going at it for five or ten years.  Interestingly, a number of states in the US have introduced mandatory flu vaccination for health care staff, primarily as a patient safety issue.  Clearly, there are high uptake rates because it is mandatory.</p> <p>  There is an interesting thing about the attitude of health care workers, predominantly nurses.  It is very difficult to say this because those of us on this side of the table are all doctors and it sounds classic doctor speak.  Our problem has primarily been with nurses' uptake of the vaccine.  We have been working very hard to try to understand that.  Considerable work has been put in on it leading to changes.  Clearly what works is having leadership in the institution concerned and, in particular, leadership from the nursing profession makes a big difference.</p> <p>  Incentives also work.  I am not going to defend that, but it is clear that incentives work, including incentives for the institution or for individuals.  They range from giving them chocolates - actually chocolates work extremely well and there is some very good evidence of that.  Even the medical literature has some very good evidence of that.  Chocolates, draws for iPads and things like that work very well in improving the rate of uptake.  The Minister has been very clear about, and we are the same.  This is a very important issue about us protecting our patients - how we do it and how we move on this into the future.</p> <p>  Interestingly, the push for the HPV vaccine came from outside the system - from the media and the public.  There was a massive public campaign back at that time to introduce the HPV vaccine.  Interestingly it coincided with the death of-----</p></speech>

There was massive external pressure on us to introduce the vaccine and then to do the catch-up for the girls who had missed it as a result of it being delayed for a year or so.  It was external.  Of course, one then gets into these IR things - I was at a meeting until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m.  There is no problem now.  All the staff are clearly vetted and nobody starts the programme before going through the Garda vetting process.  It is incredibly different from how it was in 2010.  We have gone through that in quite a major way.  It is important to realise that.</p> <p>  I ask Professor Butler to speak about the six-in-one vaccine versus individual injections and how vaccine problems are dealt with.  We can then come back to the issue of confidence, etc., and move on the HPV.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1340" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Karina Butler" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051100002#J00600"><p>First, let me pick up on the flu vaccine.  I can totally understand the question, "Are we not giving confidence?"  There are some unique problems with the flu vaccine in the sense that flu changes every year so we are always in catch-up mode and we do not always catch up exactly on target.</p><p>We do not get 99% or 100% protection against 'flu.  Our protection rates in the last season were approximately 68% or 70%.</p><p> Then there is the other issue, that people mistake what 'flu is.  Even when the vaccine has protected them against real 'flu, they pick up another virus and think they have got 'flu.  The protection that it affords is not as evident.  The reality is it saves lives.  Even when given to healthy children, it saves their lives.  It saves the lives of elders in their community as well.  The 'flu vaccine is unique.  It is strange that those who have a difficulty with it are primarily among our nursing colleagues because also there is a perception we all have had 'flu, we will not get it again and it is a trivial illness.</p><p> Another big element that plays a key role - the chocolates work - is ease of access.  One is on the floor and does not want to take time out to go and queue somewhere to get the 'flu vaccine.  What the hospitals have been doing, because our occupational health colleagues have been looking at this, is bringing the vaccines to the floors and the uptake has increased.  I anticipate we will see big improvements.</p><p> The 'flu has some unique issues in that there is not 100% guaranteed protection in any given season because the 'flu virus changes.  We get lots of other illnesses that we mistake for 'flu.  What made a difference in our hospital was when we had an outbreak in ICU and one of the nurses who was pregnant ended up in the ICU of an adult hospital.  That changed a lot of attitudes towards the 'flu vaccine when it came round the following season.  It comes back to Senator Dolan's point.  It is a matter of communication and how we do that better.</p><p> The six-in-one vaccine was the question from Deputy Louise O'Reilly.  Parents have concerns about giving the six-in-one vaccine because they think it will overload the immune system and one will get too many antigens.  From a single infection, there would be multiples of the number of antigens that are in the 'flu vaccine and the body is more than capable of dealing with them all without any problem.  What one has to do is ensure that there is no interaction, such as where giving one together with the other might blunt the response of the other, and that is done.  That is always studied in any combination vaccine.  Then it comes down to whether one wants to give his or her child six jabs by three - 18 injections - when one can, effectively and safely, give them together and, therefore, get protection quickly.</p><p> As for what we have in the six-in-one vaccine, one of the key elements in there is whooping cough vaccine.  As for who is liable to die from whooping cough, the Deputy and I will not die.  We will get a bad cough that will last for three weeks.  If one's child under six months or one's six-to-12 months' old gets it, he or she will end up in ICU and die.  That is why one would want to get in there early and why those vaccines are given in combination.  As for who is most likely to get meningitis, our highest rates are among those under one year and the one-to-two year olds.  That is why we want to get those vaccines in there efficiently.  The reason we give combination vaccines is to make it easier for the child, not to give them so many shots and to get protection onboard at the time when the child needs protection, and immunologically, it is very effective and very safe.</p></speech>

Dr. Joan Gilvarry can come in on this.  In some areas, we also have enhanced surveillance.  For example, last year we partook, at the EMA's request to the vaccines companies, in what we call enhanced surveillance.  Everybody who came in to whom we gave 'flu vaccine was given a card and number by us, there was a hotline and if they had any early problems, they could phone in.  Therefore, those were categorised so that there would be an early red flag if there were any problems related to the vaccine.  That is called enhanced surveillance.</p> <p>  However, in general, it is a passive surveillance system for vaccines.  Dr. Gilvarry might want to speak to that.</p></speech>

Gardasil is licensed since 2006.  We monitor the safety of the vaccine after it comes to the market by health care professionals telling us of adverse reactions or suspected adverse reactions they have seen.  Similarly, we hear from patients, carers, public health doctors when they are out in the schools.  We also put all of these adverse reactions that we get into the European database which gives us a much bigger global database of adverse reactions.  One can interrogate that database much better than a small Irish database and look for signals.  We also look at published literature, new clinical trials, any new epidemiology trials.</p> <p>  Also, the manufacturers of the vaccine must submit what we call a periodic safety update report to us.  In the case of Gardasil, that has been submitted to the regulatory authorities and to the European agency every year since it was licensed.  The product is now licensed in 130 countries worldwide and 72 million people have been vaccinated.  This involved approximately 200 million doses because the girls get two-to-three doses, depending on their age.  We have a vast amount of knowledge about this particular vaccine.</p> <p>  Specifically about Denmark and Japan that Deputy Billie Kelleher talked about, in mid-2015, Denmark did see some cases of chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic regional pain syndrome and POTS, as Professor Karina Butler has referred to, and the regulatory authority in Denmark asked the Commission to trigger a European-wide review.  That was done via the European agency and its safety committee.  The safety committee of the European agency is made up of expertise from all the member states including doctors, nurses and scientists.  They reviewed every piece of data that was available.  They pulled in experts on vaccines and on epidemiology.  They talked to the patient groups.  In fact, on the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee, PRAC, which is the safety committee, there are patient groups and health care professional representatives.  They came to the conclusion by consensus - every member state and every patient on the committee agreed - that there was no evidence to support a causal relationship between the syndromes that were being seen and the vaccine.  That recommendation went from that committee at the European agency to the licensing committee, which we call - without giving the committee too much technical jargon - the CHMP, and it agreed with that recommendation, also by consensus.  The European Commission, in early 2016, issued a legally binding decision that there was no causal relationship with this.  The product has not been withdrawn worldwide by any regulatory authority.  The Government of Japan has taken the product out of its immunisation programme, but not in agreement with the regulatory authority, and it continues to be used continuously in Denmark.  The Danes accept the recommendation.  They were a party to the recommendation from Europe.</p> <p>  There was another question on pandemics and whether there was a rush to licensing.  There was no rush to licensing, but I must admit it was a different situation.  Everyone was prepared at some stage for a pandemic.  We, on the Irish pandemic group, were preparing for years previously because we were expecting a pandemic.  What we did, from a European regulatory point of view, is license mock-up vaccines.  We did not know what the strain would be and for the years before, the companies submitted to the European agency mock-up so-called "dossiers" - it was with the H5N1 - so that we were ready.  These mock-ups were licensed by the European Commission for all the member states in 2007 so that when the pandemic was declared, and we knew it was H1N1, what needed to be done was to vary that licence and, essentially, take out the H5N1 and dip in the H1N1 that was then identified.  There was then active surveillance.  They were licensed, probably at the end of October 2009, and there was active surveillance.  We were in constant communication on a weekly basis on any new data or any new adverse effects that were appearing.  The immunisation programme here in Ireland ended at the end of March 2010.  The first signal that came on narcolepsy was from the Finnish agency in August 2010 and nobody could have predicted it.  There was no rush to judgment.  In fact, as soon as Finland brought that to attention, a European-wide referral and review was started.  However, it had really no impact on our programme because it was finished here in Ireland at that stage.</p></speech>

My predecessor as director of the HPSE, Dr. O'Flanagan, conducted a study here in Ireland that actually replicated what had happened in Scandinavia and showed that there was an explicit link between the vaccine and those, predominantly children, who got narcolepsy.</p><p>We were part of that process, as Dr. Gilvarry has said.  Dr. O'Flanagan carried out the study which showed very clearly that there was a link.  That has formed part of our process since.  However, just to reinforce this, in these other circumstances it has been shown there is no such link.  It is not even possible to do such a study in the same way that Dr. O'Flanagan did because we do not have any specifics around it.  </p><p> There is a group of questions about HPV.  It may be better to take those first and then come back to more generic questions raised by Senator Dolan around confidence, mandatory vaccination and things like that, which are more general questions.  Dr. Corcoran can begin on some of the issues around the HPV vaccine and perhaps Dr. Brennan can help.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1348" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brenda Corcoran" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051100002#L00200"><p>There were a number of questions relating to the HPV vaccination programme.  I will take them in order.  The first one related to the leaflet that we provide and whether we should provide supplementary information.  The HSE is committed to providing clear, accurate information to all parents to allow them to choose whether to vaccinate their children in a school-based programme.  In a school-based programme we do not meet the parents so we have to convey our information either through written information, the website or other media.  We will talk a little bit about that later.  Regarding the leaflet, at the start of the school year all parents receive a leaflet, consent form and invitation letter inviting them to take part in the HPV programme.  They are also invited to get the other two vaccines that are given in the first year of secondary school.  Those are a booster for tetanus and pertussis - that is whooping cough - and a meningococcal C booster.  Three vaccines are given.  The HPV vaccine is given to the girls and the other two vaccines are given to girls and boys.</p> <p>  The information leaflet we supply has been changed yearly, based on feedback from both parents and health professionals in the field.  We also look at the information leaflets that are supplied in other countries that have had very successful immunisation programmes, particularly for HPV.  We look at the information materials from the UK, where an uptake rate of over 85% has been sustained, and Australia, which sustains a 75% to 80% uptake rate.  We compare our information materials with those supplied in those countries.  We also have our information materials proofed by the National Adult Literacy Agency and they are in line with HIQA guidance on the use of plain English.  That is why the information materials are worded and laid out in the way they are.  </p> <p>  We work on what might be called an onion system, in that we provide layers of information.  The information leaflet gives very clear guidance that if a person would like to receive more information they should go to our national immunisation website.  That website is the only immunisation website in Ireland that has been accredited by the World Health Organization as having clear safety information on all our vaccines.  It has had that status since 2008.  </p> <p>  We do not provide the patient inserts, that is the licensed documentation, but in the leaflet we provide information on all side effects from the HPV vaccine that have been scientifically shown to be caused by the vaccine.  The product insert, the patient information leaflet, is a licensed document, as has been referred to by Dr. Gilvarry.  It is a licensed document that has been agreed by the European Medicines Agency.  That document also contains a list of other symptoms that have been seen around the time of HPV vaccination, but for which there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine was the cause.  The HSE includes the information on the side effects that are caused by the vaccine and in the information leaflet actively asks parents to go to our website, where there is a link to the patient leaflet where they can read all the information they want, as well as find a lot of other information on HPV vaccine safety, impact and facts.  That is about the patient information leaflet but I fully accept all of the comments on communication with parents because that is a huge challenge for us.  </p> <p>  As I already mentioned, we do not see the parents.  That is why when we realised that the information was being misinterpreted and that there was a lot of misinformation in the public domain we developed a strategy to work with like-minded organisations.  We have created an alliance with organisations such as the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, the Irish Cancer Society, cancer support groups, the national cancer screening programme, the Irish Pharmacy Union, the Irish Medical Organisation, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland and the Marie Keating Foundation.  All of us are working together to provide the same information.  </p> <p>  In addition, we are working very closely with our colleagues in primary care.  It is recognised, and there is a lot of research to show, that in spite of all the mistrust there is in the health services the primary reason that a parent chooses to have their child vaccinated is the recommendation of a trusted health professional.  In that regard, we did a huge amount of training last year for HSE staff, but also for our colleagues in primary care - general practitioners and practice nurses - because they see parents on a day-to-day basis, perhaps about something completely different.  We have given them information on the facts and figures and on the issues about which parents are concerned and we have asked them to act as advocates for us and to help us persuade parents to get this vaccine.  We have also done some focus group work with parents to ask them the kind of information they want and we use that information to customise the information we give.  </p> <p>  As we know, the uptake rate dropped to 50% for the first round.  It is a two-dose vaccine, given firstly in September with a second dose in March.  We instigated a programme to offer all parent a second chance in March or April when we returned to the schools.  We sent all the parents another information leaflet, which was slightly modified based on the feedback that we received.  Vaccination of those who took up the offer is being carried out in the schools at the moment and is ongoing.  While it is very preliminary, the information from the schools so far is that the uptake appears to have stabilised.  It has not dropped any further and there are a small number of parents who are coming forward to ask for their daughters to be given the first dose.  It is good news but there is a huge amount of work yet to be done.  </p> <p>  With regard to 2017-2018, we have already developed a leaflet for sixth class parents.  That is being distributed to the schools to give parents more information in advance.  That gives more information and advises parents to check the website.  We will be running a comprehensive communications campaign between now and September and working with the partners that I have already mentioned and with HSE staff to introduce and implement the information in as clear a way as possible.  This will include using social media, videos and bite-sized pieces of information backed up with scientific evidence while using the ways in which we now know parents communicate, adapting to this new landscape and bearing in mind all the constraints applied by not seeing the parents.  We have to use other people to help us get our message out.  There is a slight improvement, which is good news, but there is a lot more work to be done.</p></speech>

We will get to all the answers in time.  I have a number of questions myself.  On the influenza vaccination for pregnant women, is there a reason that vaccination is not offered in the ante-natal clinics?  As a GP, I find it difficult to get the message across because pregnant women feel they should not take any drug or anything during their pregnancy as they feel it could have an adverse effect.  That seems to be the barrier that I come across in giving pregnant women the influenza vaccine.  Is it possible that it could be promoted through the ante-natal clinics?</p> <p>  Second, on HPV, is there a programme envisaged to offer HPV vaccine to boys?  On the HPV vaccine and the problems that are causing a reduction in uptake, the Minister has announced that he is going to develop a care pathway for those who feel they have been affected by the vaccine.</p><p>The Minister had announced that he was going to develop a care pathway for those who feel they have been affected by the vaccine.  This will enable them to get specialist opinion to examine their symptoms and provide them with treatment.  I wonder whether that care pathway is still under discussion or development.</p></speech>

Social media, which has been touched briefly during this debate, is a major influencer.  When false information is given in the print media, it can be corrected reasonably quickly.  There is a great deal of incorrect information on social media and it is difficult to correct it.  We need to take a new approach to social media when vaccines are being rolled out.  Has there been engagement with those who have expertise in social media to try to deal with this aspect?</p> <p>  A second issue is the need to engage with major influencers.  A motion on the HPV vaccine was recently passed at a teachers' union conference.  Have there been engagement with the teachers' unions, which are major influencers?  I was appalled by the fact that a motion was passed because no medical expertise was offered to the conference before the decision was taken.  Has there been engagement with that union since the motion was passed?  What information will be given to members of that union in respect of the vaccine?</p> <p>  Third, I am working with transition year students in a school who are involved in a project called Young Social Innovators.  The final is on today.  Out of 400 projects submitted, it is down to the final 11 today, which includes the school I have worked with.  I was impressed by the work of the students and the teachers.  Can more be done to engage with young people because they are major influencers?  I was mesmerised by the volume of information that the students in the school I worked with were able to put together.  It was a detailed project, which will end up having a major influence on other young people because of the results they have achieved.  There should be more engagement with young people on the HPV vaccine because they can influence people.  The transition year students involved in this project can influence younger students entering secondary school.  Has this been considered?</p> <p>  I thank Dr. Butler for the facts sheet relating to measles.  I have not seen that information previously.  There were 10,000 cases in 1980 but there were only 43 cases in 2016.  That information needs to be publicised in respect of the success of immunisation and vaccines.  More needs to be done with public representatives and people in the education sector in this regard.  Has a programme been devised to publicise that information?  That would be effective where there is a debate within a school on the matter.</p></speech>

I am a community pharmacist and I am also the daughter of an infectious diseases nurse.  I am sure she may have worked with them in Cherry Orchard back in the day.  I come from a family of health care professionals.  As someone who works in the community and who was among the first batch of pharmacists trained for the initial roll-out of the influenza vaccine, I was shocked when I entered the D&aacute;il last year at the difference between what I perceived to be the understanding of vaccination and immunisation, and the emails and discussions I encountered around this vaccine on becoming a public representative.  There was a gap between my understanding of people's understanding and what goes on in reality.  There is a major gap between those of us who have been privileged enough to have been educated to a high level or who are scientists and who have been given that information, and getting that information into the public domain.  The remarks on collective memory were helpful.  My mother told me that I nearly died from measles as a child.  People forget that these are serious illnesses.  Awareness must be increased that risks should not be taken with measles and we have a body of work to do in this regard.</p> <p>  The falling take-up rate for the HPV vaccine is concerning and I have commented on this publicly.  The Irish Cancer Society says 40 people would die, 100 would require cancer treatment and 1,000 would need treatment for precancerous cells annually if not for the vaccine.  I operate a pharmacy close to St. Luke's Hospital in Rathgar.  I have seen the 40 year old woman with two children at her ankles with stage 4 cancer.  I recall the resistance to the vaccine when it came out first, but we have overcome that barrier.  After clean water, this vaccine is the second greatest success in public health ever but people on the ground do not get that.  They think public representatives or health professionals are dealing with it.</p> <p>  Regarding meningococcal B, there is a perception that it leads to death.  I dealt with somebody whose child is deaf as a result of contracting this illness.  We need to get the message out that these diseases can not only lead to death, but to a range of preventable conditions.  I cannot imagine what it would be like as a parent not to have vaccinated my children and for them to die or become deaf or blind as a result of my decision about their health.</p> <p>  Senator Burke referred to major influencers, which sparked something in my mind about Jade Goody.  The take-up rate of the HPV vaccine increased following her tragic death.  Perhaps we need to examine who are the influencers.  I am sure I do not influence many 15 year olds.  Maybe I do and maybe Deputy Durkan does, but we need to get the people that young people listen to involved. When somebody such as Avril Lavigne has something wrong with her, they are all listening to her.  We need to get somebody whom young people look up to and who is on the right side of science and facts.</p> <p>  Regarding barriers to access, Dr. Corcoran mentioned trusted health care professionals such as GPs and practice nurses.  Pharmacists are open to this.  I even had people working in hospitals coming into the pharmacy late at night because they did not have to queue when filling their prescription.  It works well in the community pharmacy setting.  Perhaps it is an aversion to the white coats, the doctor's surgery or being in a waiting room with other people.</p><p>We generally know the patients.  We do not get busloads of people coming from elsewhere.  They are generally the people we know from mass, the shop or SuperValu.  We know these people and they trust us.  We can leave them sitting there and chat with them while we are going about our business.  The community pharmacy is a very good way of delivering this service.  It is different for an elderly patient who is going to the GP anyway but for a healthy person, perhaps a nurse, it is very handy to nip into the community pharmacy.  We have to do our very best to deal with this unmet need where people working in the delivery of health care are not being vaccinated, for example, a pregnant nurse in ICU.  We need to get the message out there.  Pregnant women have a difficulty with having vaccinations.  One can understand that when considering things in the past.  I was pregnant around the time of the swine flu vaccination in 2009.  I think I have been pregnant the whole time since then, but at that time I was pregnant.</p></speech>

Is there any proposal to roll out the chicken pox vaccine in Ireland?</p></speech>

Leaving aside the health benefits, there is a massive economic issue.  As a working mother, one is nearly putting concealer on them going into the cr&egrave;che.  Once the pox is out, my view is that they should be sent to cr&egrave;che, but there is a stigma attached to it and then the mother, father or granny has to take days off work.  There is an economic loss attached to it.  Most children are brought to their GP, but with chickenpox the GP cannot do anything.  There are secondary infections such as impetigo or bacterial skin infections as a result.  Though it is an expensive vaccine, there are economic and health benefits.  It is something the committee should be pushing for.  We have to get the message from the HSE and the Department down to the ground to deal with this.</p> <p>  Confidence has been mentioned.  I am not sure where Dr. Brennan works.  My experience of the public system for the treatment of cervical cancer is that the system is very good.  We spend a lot of time in here complaining and saying everything is awful and everybody is on a trolley, but my understanding on the ground is that the system is working.  People are being seen in a timely fashion and are getting the best possible treatment in this country.  It is worth saying that young women are getting that treatment.  What we really want is that in years to come my two young daughters and the children in cr&egrave;che with them now are not in that category.</p> <p>  The committee has a body of work to do.  It is important we get the message out that this is the second biggest public health breakthrough ever in the world.  We have a duty as elected representatives.  It is what we are here to do.  We are here to try to improve people's lives.  My colleagues and I will work with the Chairman and everybody else to try to get the message across.  We have a body of work to do here.  Time is of the essence.  If we do not deal with this, trolleys will be the least of our worries.  I thank all the witnesses for coming in today.</p></speech>

Most of what I was going to ask has been asked by my colleagues already.  I only have sons so the HPV vaccine does not arise.  Many of my close friends have daughters who are due to have the vaccination.  The fear they feel and the big decision they face on whether to vaccinate cannot be overemphasised.  They are all very level-headed girls but their parents are torn with anxiety about whether they should get their daughters vaccinated.  I welcome that Dr. Corcoran said sixth class girls are now getting the leaflet.  It is an excellent idea.  It buys time and is not just thrown on top of them.  The witnesses said they do not meet the parents.  Do they think it would be a good idea to start doing that?  Is it for financial reasons or because of time constraints?  Why have they not already started meeting parents of girls in fifth class to buy that time for the parents to decide whether to vaccinate?</p></speech>

I apologise to our guests for arriving late.  I was attempting tri-location, not under medical supervision, but I tried it and it did not work.  I thank the witnesses for their submission.  I am familiar with the territory.  I come from a generation which, to a large extent, was pre-vaccination.  I have family experiences from that particular time.  It is true that many deaths occurred as a result of the lack of that kind of treatment in the 1940s, 1950s and even into the 1960s.  I was a member of what was originally a large family but it did not finish up that way.  There are salutary lessons to be learned from that.  As public representatives, we have a duty that when an issue is raised, we have to be reasonably certain what we are telling the public is accurate to the best of our ability to prove it.  I have no doubt at all that, generally speaking, the vaccination programme is in the best interests of children and families and the health of the nation.  However, we live in a world of mass media communication and social media where quite a number of diverse opinions arise.  Sometimes they are backed up scientifically and sometimes they are not.  To what extent can the witnesses respond to these claims when they arise?</p> <p>  Are the witnesses satisfied that to the best of their ability the reaction to or the side effects of particular vaccinations can be more profound or long-lasting that others?  That is just by way of reassurance that when we stand over something, we know exactly what we are talking about.  Otherwise, we as public representatives and the medical profession can be accused of not testing sufficiently the issues that come before us.  We as Members of both Houses have had numerous experiences over the years of issues arising, sometimes ones which we were not alert to in the time we should have been.  Sometimes we were wrong and sometimes we were right.</p> <p>  Those are my questions.  With regard to the metabolism of individual children are there exceptions to the rule?  As a result of those exceptions to the rule in the metabolism of the child, can there be very different outcomes?  I would like clarification on that.  I thank the Chairman.  That was my usual truncated fashion.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1362" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Mary Horgan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051100002#O00100"><p>I will comment as a clinician in infection diseases and who treats adults, and also as a parent.  One of the differences between uptakes is that if one gives meningococcal meningitis vaccine to children, everyone understands it.  People die immediately of meningitis so for most parents, that is a no-brainer.  As a clinician who has seen people die of meningitis, meningococcal disease, up to very recently - the figures have gone way down - I can say that it is a fantastic vaccine.  We had one of our final medical students die from meningococcal C, despite all medical efforts about a decade ago, and it brings home to one that it could be one's own 20 year-old dying there.  People get the immediate effects of why it is important to give the meningitis vaccine.<br/><br/>What is more challenging for many parents is seeing the benefits of a vaccine in ten or 20 years time.  People do not get it when it is about giving a vaccine when someone is 12 or 13 years of age and saying that it will prevent cancer in 15 or 20 years, which Professor Brennan will talk about.  When one sees it as a clinician, one gets it.<br/><br/>Professor Brennan will talk about people who get a preventable cancer.  If, in the morning, someone told us we have a tablet that would prevent a cancer, people would take it.  They would not even think about it.  We have vaccines that prevent cancers.  We have another one, hepatitis B, which is part of the childhood vaccine, that prevents liver cancer.  Liver cancer is one of the major causes of death in south-east Asia, where chronic hepatitis B is very common.  People give that to their children.  It is a safe, effective vaccine that prevents cancer decades on.<br/><br/>It is trying to get the message across on what is totally effective now, people buy into the vaccine for meningitis, <i>versus</i>what is protecting them, say, when they are a grandparent.  I am a mother and gave my daughter a vaccine before it was part of the routine vaccine programme.  I paid for it myself because, like Professor Butler, I knew the data, I had been at the meetings and I spoke to those who developed it.  The initial studies were pulled because the vaccine was so good.<br/><br/>We have people such as Dr. Gilvarry and the HPRA who monitor the effects of all vaccines.  Vaccines are good because on a day-to-day basis, I see people coming into hospital, being on ventilators with influenza, getting liver cancer that could be prevented because it is caused by hepatitis B, seeing people with cancer of the cervix, again which can be preventable, it could be any of us or any of our children.  When one is on the front line, one has the stories, one sees them.  I am sure Professor Brennan will give more insight into this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1363" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Donal Brennan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017051100002#O00200"><p>On ante-natal vaccination, we do advise the influenza vaccination to all ante-natal patients and also pertussis vaccination in the second or early third trimester.  As Dr. Butler will confirm, we have had a number of cases of neo-natal pertussis in Dublin and a number of neo-natal deaths as a result, so we advise it.  There is a logistical issue about where the vaccine is given which needs to be addressed and without doubt, there is an understandable worry among pregnant ladies about whether they should take any medication.  That is part of all our roles as health care professionals to advise on the safety of the vaccination but also the dangers of influenza infection in the pregnant population as highlighted earlier.</p> <p>  I will spend a few minutes highlighting some of the consequences of cervical cancer in particular.  We have talked a lot about death today.  One of the reasons people have this issue about getting information down is that it is very hard for a person to think that his or her 13 year old daughter will die of cervical cancer.  Many of us will believe that our 13 year old daughters are immortal.  It is a very hard concept to understand but unfortunately there is much more to cervical cancer than death.  There are more than 3,000 women alive today suffering the consequences of those treatments, as Deputy O'Connell spoke about, many of whom have been treated in what is an excellent service.  We do meet all international standards in regard to seeing patients and treatments and our outcomes are comparable to all international standards.  It is very important that we highlight some of the success stories in that.  Possibly the greatest success story has been the cervical screening programme.  We were late to the party but thanks to Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly who is the clinical director of Cervical Check and the national screening programme, we are now meeting all international standards in that.  </p> <p>  However, there are still 300 patients a year diagnosed with cervical cancer and they come into our clinics in the Mater Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital on a weekly basis.  The surgery or radiation that those patients have to endure is life changing.  Many of those patients will tell one the treatment is worse than the disease.  I have had numerous patients tell me that they came in feeling fine and three years later they feel terrible, asking what had I done to them.</p> <p>  We obviously perform surgery on a proportion of patients and in many cases this means that a young woman will lose all fertility.  The long-term consequences of this are huge.  Remember half of the women diagnosed are under the age of 50.  They are mothers, daughters, aunts and they are all working in normal, important jobs and they often do not go back to work.  The consequences are huge.</p> <p>  I will finish with a case.  We recently had a lady who presented to us, having had six failed cycles of IVF.  She presented with early bleeding in pregnancy and we diagnosed an advanced stage cervical cancer.  This was obviously a very sought-after baby and she advised us that she did not want to do anything that would harm the baby so we proceeded after a long consultation to give this woman chemotherapy during the pregnancy.  She proceeded to have four cycles of chemotherapy and delivered her baby at 34 weeks, which was a little early.  She had to have a caesarian section and a radical hysterectomy which involved the removal of her uterus and all her cervix and part of her vagina and all the lymph nodes as well.  Then she had to have radiotherapy.</p> <p>  She has had a year of very severe, hard medical treatment and unfortunately her little girl, who is beautiful, has significant hearing loss.  I saw her last week, and before we came in here, I asked her if she would vaccinate her daughter and she said, "What do you think, doctor?"  It is not just about the patients who die, which are very unfortunate, it is the patients who sometimes survive.</p> <p>  Just next week, we have a young woman, she is 38 years of age, who is going to come in and have her bladder, uterus and rectum removed because of her cervical cancer.  She will spend the rest of her life with a stoma bag on one side for faeces and one on the other for urine.  These are the real life stories that people need to understand.  It not just those who die of cervical cancer, it is the survivors.  Sometimes in cancer care in particular, we forget about the survivors because we think that once they survive that is all that matters.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for listening to us today and I hope that we have highlighted some of the issues around cervical cancer.   </p></speech>

The National Immunisation Advisory Committee, NIAC, makes recommendations to the Department of Health on vaccines.  That is one that we have not had an official advice about yet.  We have not gone through any process regarding that yet.  </p> <p>  On HPV for boys, we are looking at the possibility of extending the programme to boys and the Department of Health has asked HIQA to do a health technology assessment in order to look at the effectiveness and the cost-effectiveness of introducing that particular programme.  That health technology assessment has commenced and we hope to have a decision on that in September 2018.  It is quite a long process because it involves quite a lot of modelling and so on.  In the meantime, our focus is to increase the rates of HPV vaccination in girls.</p></speech>

I take up the point quite keenly about the young innovators.  My daughter was in the final six or seven years ago.</p><p>It is something we could look at trying to get involved in and I thank the committee for the promotion.</p><p> With regard to Brexit, the UK already has different immunisation policies to us.  There are variations, and the committee has heard we give hepatitis B vaccinations at birth while the UK does not.  It has a programme for shingles for the elderly and we do not have this.  It has changed its programme on the flu to being very much more concentrated on children.  Clearly this is something we will have to do because it is beginning to show quite major success as a consequence.  There are some differences but, having said that, it is very difficult to have total uniformity throughout Europe.  Major attempts have been made to do so but they have failed for many different reasons.  We are not that far off what the UK does.  Sometimes we are ahead and sometimes it is ahead.  I do not think there are too many more specific points.  The more general point is the issue on confidence in vaccines, which will not be debated before the committee goes to its important meeting.</p></speech>

It is not linked to the vaccine.  We have to be very clear it is not being provided for anybody who claims he or she has those symptoms as a result of a vaccine.  It will be provided to them and they can avail of it.  We have clearly identified, and Professor Butler has intimated this, that these children have not been dealt with as well as they could have been, be they children today or children ten years ago.  We want to make sure boys and girls all get the same care.  Professor Nicholson has produced this pathway and we have tried to have discussions with the parents concerned but it has not been totally successful.  It will be introduced within the next year.  It is trying to provide clarity.  It is very clear such children have always been there, and for longer than any of us in the room have been alive there has been evidence for it.  We need to provide them with good services as a consequence.</p></speech>

I am very pleased to have this opportunity to outline the 2017 priorities for my Department.  The responsibilities of my Department are very broad and diverse.  They include the facilitation of the economic development of Ireland's regions and the sustainable development of vibrant and rural communities; the conservation, preservation, protection, development and presentation of Ireland's heritage and culture; and the promotion of the Irish language and support of the Gaeltacht and island communities.  My Cabinet colleagues and I remain committed to working with all stakeholders to progress and deliver the measures set out in A Programme for a Partnership Government in the interests of all the people of Ireland.</p> <p>  I propose to address the issues arising across my Department's Vote on a programme by programme basis, but in the first instance would like to provide a broad outline of the overall position.  A gross provision of more than &euro;368 million is available to my Department in 2017.  This represents an additional &euro;41 million over and above the combined 2017 pre-budget ministerial gross capital and current expenditure ceilings for my Department published in the mid-year expenditure report in July of last year.</p><p>An additional &euro;13.548 million in funding has been carried over from the 2016 capital provision for expenditure on priority projects in accordance with the provisions of public financial procedures.  In broad terms, the 2017 breakdown of allocations to my Vote is as follows: over &euro;158 million for arts, culture and film, including &euro;65 million for the Arts Council; over &euro;42 million for the national cultural institutions; almost &euro;16.5 million for the Irish Film Board and a dedicated funding stream of &euro;5 million for Creative Ireland, the Government's legacy programme for Ireland 2016; over &euro;45.5 million for the conservation and protection of Ireland's built and natural heritage, including &euro;11 million for the natural heritage, just over &euro;6.2 million for the Heritage Council and &euro;4.5 million for built heritage, including the very successful built heritage investment scheme; over &euro;46.7 million for the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and the islands; over &euro;38.6 million for North-South co-operation, including support for two North-South Implementation Bodies - Waterways Ireland and An Foras Teanga; and over &euro;79 million for regional development and rural affairs, including &euro;40 million for the Leader programme, over &euro;15 million for rural development schemes and &euro;12 million for town and village regeneration.  </p><p> The gross allocation for my Department in 2017 is more than 8% higher than in 2016 when the figures are adjusted to take account of the once-off funding for last year's highly successful Ireland 2016 centenary programme.  The 2017 provision allows for increases in funding across a range of arts and heritage bodies within my Department&rsquo;s remit, as well as increases in funding for a number of rural schemes.  The additional funding is targeted at key initiatives, including an additional &euro;5 million for the Arts Council, an 8% increase in its annual budget; boosts in funding for all of the national cultural institutions; &euro;2 million to allow for the opening of the newly restored historic wings at the National Gallery of Ireland and the opening of Killarney House on foot of significant capital investment by the State; an increase of &euro;2 million for the Irish Film Board and &euro;1 million for Culture Ireland; an additional &euro;1 million to assist the Heritage Council with its work; dedicated funding of &euro;5 million for the implementation of the Creative Ireland programme; a trebling of funding for town and village regeneration to &euro;12 million; and an additional &euro;8 million for national rural development schemes, including &euro;5 million for the recently reopened CL&Aacute;R programme and &euro;40 million for the delivery of the Leader rural development programme in 2017.  </p><p> My colleagues, the Ministers of State, Deputies Se&aacute;n Canney and Michael Ring, and I will make brief remarks.  We will commence with the arts, culture and film programme and will be happy to expand later on any matter members wish to raise.  I will go through the arts, culture and film programme first.  </p><p> Over &euro;158 million is being provided in 2017 for arts, culture and film, with a further &euro;11.548 million provided by way of a capital carryover.  In 2016 funding for the Creative Ireland programme was primarily focused on the very successful Ireland 2016 centenary programme.  The programme was multifaceted and included over 60 State ceremonial events, a capital programme of eight major restoration and development projects, flag-raising ceremonies, schools Proclamation day activities and a wide range of other shared community, historical and cultural events.  The Ireland 2016 programme provided for engagement with Irish people at home and abroad in an unprecedented way, with record levels of engagement and participation by schools, communities, cultural institutions, organisations and individuals.  </p><p> The Creative Ireland programme is the Government's legacy project for Ireland 2016 which aims to harness the goodwill, engagement and momentum created by the Ireland 2016 programme and places creativity at the centre of public policy.  Creative Ireland is a high level, high ambition, all-of-government initiative aligned with Culture 2025, &Eacute;ire Ild&aacute;nach and framed within A Programme for a Partnership Government.  It is a five-year initiative from 2017 to 2022 building up to the centenary of the State.  The initiative aims to mainstream creativity in the life of the nation in order that, individually and collectively, we can realise our full creative potential.  There are a number of ambitious targets set for Creative Ireland in its first year.  Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca is among these priorities.  The first Cruinni&uacute; took place on Easter Monday this year when a wide series of family friendly events took place across Dublin city centre, with events, both large and small, also taking place across the country.  The event was curated by RTE on behalf of my Department and delivered in conjunction with the local authorities.  Every county in Ireland hosted an event and between Dublin and the regions, over 550,000 people participated in Cruinni&uacute;.  This is another great example of the power and impact of successful collaboration.  It is hoped to expand and develop Cruinni&uacute; further in the coming year as part of the Creative Ireland programme.  </p><p> The 2017 allocation for the arts, culture and film programme area of my Department's Vote includes boosts in funding for all of the national cultural institutions, making their combined total allocation for 2017 in excess of &euro;42 million.  In particular, the increased allocation in 2017 for the National Gallery of Ireland allows for the opening of the newly restored historic wings next month on foot of significant capital investment by the State.  The gallery has continued to operate successfully, despite the closure of its historic wings but its reopening of the Vermeer exhibition is expected to draw even greater numbers of visitors.  The Irish Film Board is receiving a funding increase of &euro;2 million in 2017 and Culture Ireland an increase of &euro;1 million.  The important and valuable work of the Arts Council has also been recognised and is reflected in the 2017 current allocation of over &euro;65 million, an increase of &euro;5 million, or 8%, on the 2016 allocation.  </p><p> A total of 56 cultural organisations will benefit from &euro;9 million in capital investment under the arts and culture capital scheme for the period 2016 to 2018.  This is the most significant investment in regional arts and cultural centres in a decade and recognises the importance of high quality infrastructure for a vibrant arts and culture sector.  This type of investment is at the core of what my Department and I are trying to achieve through Creative Ireland and the action plan for rural development, placing creativity and culture at the heart of the community and revitalising towns and villages through a range of initiatives.  Of the &euro;9 million in funding, 85% is going to projects outside Dublin.  I will be happy to expand on any issue Deputies raise in respect of this programme area.</p></speech>

It includes &euro;35.7 million for current expenditure, with a further &euro;9.8 million in capital funding.  A further sum of &euro;2 million is available by way of a capital carryover.  The protection of Ireland's unique raised bogs and special areas of conservation is a key concern, as is the avoidance of major fines imposed by the European Court of Justice.  This is reflected in the allocation of a further &euro;1 million in 2017 for peatlands restoration and management.  Priority also continues to be given to the turf cutter compensation schemes and investment in alternative turf cutting sites for the affected cutters.  The Government has also committed in A Programme for a Partnership Government to the continuation of current processes involving all stakeholders impacted on by measures put in place to meet conservation objectives and legal obligations on the State under the habitats directive.</p> <p>  The built heritage investment scheme which was based on the highly successful built heritage jobs leverage scheme will operate again in 2017.  The scheme aims to protect the built heritage and create and protect employment across the country.  Together with the structures at risk fund, it will leverage significant private investment and stimulate labour intensive projects nationwide.  Funding for the Heritage Council has been increased by &euro;1 million in 2017 to allow for the continuation of the very successful Heritage Week which will take place from 19 to August 27, as well as equally successful initiatives such as the heritage officer programme, the county heritage plans programme, the heritage in schools programme and the museums standards programme.  </p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ring, will speak about the Estimate as it relates to national parks and nature reserves.</p></speech>

I will set out my responsibilities in the Department for the benefit of committee members.  They include national rural development schemes, including rural recreation, the rural walks scheme, the rural development fund and the CL&Aacute;R programme, national parks and nature reserves, the development of the Atlantic economic corridor, reinforcing the role of the Western Development Commission, Dormant Accounts Fund measures, the Tidy Towns initiative and social enterprise.</p> <p>  In respect of the heritage programme, my intention as Minister of State is to continue to invest in national parks and natural reserves to ensure they will remain a vital tourist resource which underpins the economy, both nationally and regionally.  The strategic partnership announced earlier this year between F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the National Parks and Wildlife Service is evidence of the Government's ongoing commitment to the preservation of the natural heritage for future generations of citizens and visitors.  It is a culmination of constructive engagement between my Department and F&aacute;ilte Ireland and addresses a long-standing strategy to foster the natural heritage.  It should also increase the awareness of the benefits of national parks and natural reserves and show how they can help to create and sustain jobs, as well as contributing to economic and regional development.</p><p> I also want to mention the refurbishment of Killarney House and the gardens in Killarney National Park.  This project, with a total cost of &euro;8 million, includes co-funding by F&aacute;ilte Ireland of &euro;5.2 million.  The final phase of works to the house is now substantially complete.  Work on the interpretative exhibition is advancing with a view to the amenity being fully operational later this summer.  The Office of Public Works, OPW, oversaw the completion of much of the work on the gardens at Killarney House and I was very pleased to be able to officiate at the official opening of the gardens last summer.</p></speech>

Building on the remarks of the Minister, I would like to bring the following to the attention of the committee in respect of my role in this area.  The recently announced outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme will provide funding for the development of outdoor recreational infrastructure and for the necessary maintenance, enhancement and promotion of existing outdoor recreational infrastructure in rural areas throughout Ireland.  The 2017 scheme will be implemented over a period of up to 15 months to allow for the effective implementation of larger strategic projects.  Applications to the value of &euro;11 million will be approved this year.  The facilities and amenities funded through this scheme will create better experiences for visitors to rural areas and will also enhance the quality of life for people who live in or close to the supported areas.  Recreational tourism is a significant growth area, and the natural resources available to us here in Ireland offer great potential to avail of the economic benefits this type of tourism can offer.</p> <p>  The funding forms part of the Government's Action Plan for Rural Development, launched at the beginning of the year, and reinforces the ongoing commitment to support rural Ireland.  The CL&Aacute;R programme is very important for communities in remote parts of rural Ireland, providing funding for small-scale capital projects in rural areas that have experienced significant levels of depopulation.  I was pleased to be able to reopen the scheme last year, and an allocation of &euro;5 million is being made available for CL&Aacute;R this year.</p> <p>  Following on from the success of the scheme, which was launched under the programme last year, funding is again available in 2017 for safety measures near schools and other community facilities, as well as funding for play areas.  A new initiative under CL&Aacute;R for 2017 is support for voluntary first response organisations, which provide an excellent service in rural areas, often under very difficult circumstances.  This funding will enable them to purchase or upgrade equipment that is fit for purpose in assisting them in their life-saving activities.</p> <p>  A sum of &euro;1.75 million in funding is being made available in 2017 from the dormant accounts fund to assist social enterprises which support disadvantaged and marginalised communities and play a very important role in addressing social exclusion and unemployment and providing services that are often not offered on a commercial basis.</p> <p>  My Department has established the Atlantic economic corridor task force which includes senior representatives from the business community, public bodies, Departments, third level institutions and the wider community.  I am very pleased to chair this task force.  There is great potential in the area covered by the proposed corridor and it is vital that public, private and community sectors work together to maximise this potential in terms of natural resources, tourism and infrastructure.</p> <p>  The Tidy Towns competition, now in its 59th year, which is organised by my Department and sponsored by SuperValu, continues to be a well-recognised and successful way of encouraging community participation and volunteerism.  It helps bring neighbours with shared values and shared interests together to improve their surroundings and make our villages, towns and cities better and more attractive places in which to live, work and do business.  My Department also supports the related competitions: the Best Kept competition, which is a North-South collaboration; the EU-wide Entente Florale competition; and the Communities in Bloom competition.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I will take any questions in respect of any of these issues.</p></speech>

These allocations are also subject to the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council.  In respect of Waterways Ireland, the overall allocation for 2017 is just under &euro;23 million, which is broadly comparable with 2016.  Over 90% of the waterways remained open during the 2016 boating season.  Works to repair damaged infrastructure from the winter of 2015-2016 on the Shannon navigation were completed, allowing navigation to Limerick from Parteen Weir to reopen in August 2015.  The Shannon-Erne Blueway attracted 100,000 visitors in 2016 and 121 events were offered support under the Waterways Ireland 2016 sponsorship programme, attracting 138,000 visitors to the inland waterways and contributing more than &euro;5.5 million to the local and national economies.</p> <p>  Moving on to regional development and rural affairs, which is the final section with which I will be dealing, responsibility for regional development and rural affairs transferred to my Department in June 2016.  It is a priority programme area both for myself and the Government as is reflected in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The Taoiseach and I launched the Action Plan for Rural Development at the beginning of this year.  The plan provides an overarching structure for the co-ordination and implementation of initiatives across Government for the benefit of rural Ireland.  It aims to unlock the potential of rural Ireland through a framework of national and local supports which will ensure people who live in rural areas have increased opportunities for employment locally and access to public services and social networks that support a high quality of life.  More than &euro;79 million is allocated for regional development and rural affairs in my Department's Votes this year, including &euro;40 million allocated for the Leader element of the Rural Development Programme 2014-2020.  </p> <p>  There are a number of funding schemes, both well-established and new, which will provide specific supports to rural communities in the coming years.  Funding for town and village regeneration has been trebled to &euro;12 million in the 2017 Estimates.  Together with the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, I recently announced details of the 2017 town and village renewal scheme, which will see up to 300 towns and villages benefiting from funding.  The 2017 scheme will operate over a period of 15 months and provide funding of &euro;20 million in total, including the &euro;12 million available in this year's Estimates to support rural regeneration, with a specific focus on rural towns and villages with populations of less than 10,000.  The town and village renewal scheme is part of a package of measures at national and local level to support the rejuvenation of towns and villages across Ireland, which also includes initiatives in areas such as heritage, tourism, arts and culture, the reuse of vacant premises, energy efficiency and business supports.</p> <p>  Other priorities in this programme area include working with local authorities and other stakeholders to eliminate delay factors in advance and to enable effective rural broadband delivery once a contract has been awarded under the national broadband procurement process.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1391" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG12017051100002#E00400"><p>I thank the Minister and Ministers of State for the comprehensive outline of the events and the money available.  Getting the money is one thing, spending it is another.  As I believe the Department will be aware through parliamentary questions etc., I am very concerned that the money the Department has will not be spent.  On what do I base this?  At the end of last year &euro;28 million was given to local authorities by the Minister's Department for work that was not done.  It is unprecedented.  I remember a time when we were not even allowed give money to local authorities for tar which they had bought but which they had not spread and for which they could give us invoices.  Now the Minister is able to give &euro;28 million, but it is of no benefit to people.  There was also &euro;13 million carried forward.  This means that of the money the Department received last year, &euro;40 million of capital did not actually have any effect anywhere on the ground.  That is quite concerning.</p> <p>  I am told by the Minister that up to the end of February approximately &euro;2.5 million of that &euro;28 million had been spent.  I asked the question again at the beginning of May and was given the figure for the end of February again, so I cannot provide a more accurate figure.  I am told that only &euro;2 million of the money carried forward had been spent by 6 March.  Again, I am basing my comments on a question I asked on 9 May.  Obviously, the Department could not give me a more up-to-date figure.</p> <p>  To go further, I look at the outturns every month and I am trying to get the Department to give me the expenditure reports all the time.  I have made another freedom of information request for them.  It is very hard for us to oversee what the Government is doing if we cannot get very simple data.  One very interesting thing I noticed when I looked at the Exchequer returns was that the net capital expenditure of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs at then end of April was minus &euro;1 million.   I advise the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, to write that down.  I understand what happened.  The appropriations-in-aid exceeded the actual expenditure.</p> <p>  Gross expenditure at the end of April with a third of the year gone and after very little projected expenditure pertaining to February and March, instead of being &euro;20 million, was only &euro;13 million.  The Department has not spent last year's money, that carried forward.  The county councils have not spent any percentage of the &euro;28 million worth talking about.  We are already behind in respect of this year's money.  This is going to come up repeatedly in this discussion.  We also know that of the &euro;40 million allocated for the Leader scheme, up to perhaps &euro;10 million will be spent on administration.  That leaves &euro;30 million.  It does not take a genius to figure this one out but I predict that the Department will be lucky to spend &euro;5 million of that by the end of the year with the processes that are in place.  We will come back to that.</p> <p>  Based on information released to the media by the islands section of the Department and parliamentary replies I have received, there is no way that construction will commence on Inis O&iacute;rr pier this year.  It is just not going to happen.  The Minister will be lucky to spend &euro;300,000 in fees between Inis O&iacute;rr and Inis Me&aacute;in.  There is another &euro;1.7 million.  Before all the groups get money, the Department has to insist that they spend the money they have.  If I know local authorities, if they are let away with not spending what they have, they will put their hands out for more, which they will not spend either.  At the end of this year I see us having a huge amount of money that will not be spent.  All this arguing about Estimates, how much money was received on budget day and so on will be a waste of time if we are not getting the money on the ground to be of benefit on the capital side.</p><p>I am sorry for the long preliminary remark but this is big stuff.  We are not talking about a million here and a million there, we are talking about as much as &euro;30 million.  My first question is, how quickly is the Minister going to reallocate the money, because she has to go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to do so?  How quickly are we going to reallocate the money?  It is no good coming back in September or October and saying that we are not spending on Leader, it is not happening.  It is no good saying that we are not spending on the islands and that we now have to go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform who would sit on it for a few weeks.  The Department would then have to get tenders and the Minister knows herself that will not be done.  </p><p> Is a re-evaluation at this early stage realistic, because the figures we are talking about are so astronomical?  Is the Minister going to sit down with her colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputies Ring and Kyne, and say that they have money and that is time to go back the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform early and ask it if they can put more of it into rural development on the ground, necessary rural and town and village schemes, necessary CL&Aacute;R programmes, necessary Gaeltacht and island infrastructure projects which could be done this year?  Will they do this in order that there will not be an embarrassment of riches at the end of this year while the work has not been done?  That is my first big question to the Minister today.  Will there be a re-think, because the Minister is sitting on a lot of cash and there is no way she can spend a lot of it because the Leader programme will not spend it this year?  It might spend a bit but it will not spend significantly.  </p><p> Taking it in the round and without looking at any one budget line, though I will come back to that again, is the Minister developing a strategy?  We are in May.  Forget August, if the Minister has not re-jigged this by the end of July it will be too late.  Is that debate taking place?  This is my hang-up every time I ask these questions.  I think they are valid questions for a Deputy to ask.  Will the Minister give me some outline of her thinking, or is she still being told that she will spend all the budget on what it was given for?  That is not going to happen.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1393" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG12017051100002#F00200"><p>I thank the Deputy.  First, I fought hard, as did my two colleagues, to get an increase in the budget for rural Ireland.  I was delighted to do that in the 2017 Estimates.  The Deputy is correct, I also want the money spent.  At this stage, it is far too early to make definitive assessments of likely outturns.  The real story around capital takes place in the summer.  My Department is liaising very closely with the local authorities and my officials are continuing to impress on them the need to have projects completed as soon as possible, as am I and the Ministers of State, Deputies Ring and Kyne.  Under this year's recently launched town and village enhancement programme, local authorities will have to spend a certain amount of money before we will pay anything out.  That puts more pressure on them to get the money spent, get the projects completed, get the work on the ground, get it up and running and get it started.  They will not get the final money until the project is complete.</p> <p>  We are currently looking for expenditure on the rural schemes to the end of April.  We are on to the local authorities and asking them what they have spent.  They will also have to spend their 2016 allocation before we will fund them under the 2017 schemes.  We are putting the pressure on.  We are telling the authorities that the money they received last year is there and must be spent.  We will look at how they are progressing with their spend before we will allow them to continue to spend.  Some counties, as the Deputy knows, are very good at spending and other counties are a bit slower.  This will put the pressure on because the town and village enhancement programme is a competitive scheme and the encouragement is there for those that are up to speed to get the money spent and get the work done on the ground.  All of us here know how important these projects are in the local towns and villages.  I will come back to the Deputy about the Leader scheme specifically.  We will speak about that later.</p> <p>  I assure the Deputy that I am monitoring the situation very closely.  I am looking at emerging pressures.  If I need to move money into a different area, I want to do so as early as possible.  I work very closely with my two Ministers of State.  I believe the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, wishes to say something on this matter.</p></speech>

Local authorities, in my experience, are great at coming up with projects, but they have no concept of time and delivery.  I saw some paperwork relating to the town renewal programme that the Minister announced.  Is the funding for that programme &euro;20 million?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1397" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG12017051100002#F00600"><p>The local authorities have until the middle of next year to finish the work, according to the documentation.  In other words, they do not have to have it done by 31 December.  My understanding is that last year there was still a small provision in the Estimates for legacy expenditure under the RAPID programme, which closed down when I left the Department.  That is how slow the local authorities are to spend.  They promise the sun, moon and stars in terms of speed.</p> <p>  Once the money has been given, there is a problem.  If the Minister draws back, they will tell her that they will go to the public and say the Department withdrew the money.  They will never say that they did not deliver in time.  Recognising realities, I always believed that the only way around that was to actually sanction way more money.  Then there is a dilemma, which concerns me.  If the Minister does that before the 2016 funds are spent, there is a chance the authorities will not even spend that money this year.  I am really concerned, and that is before we look at the &euro;25 million saving in the Leader programme.  I was given a figure of &euro;300,000 for projects that had been approved under the Leader programme.  These are going to communities, local authorities and all sorts of combinations.  </p> <p>  We all know how slow they are at spending.  Therefore, I have to disagree from my experience with the Minister when she says that it is too early.  It is not too early because this is like turning the Titanic, as it is so slow, big and cumbersome.  Simple as the schemes were ten years ago, they have all gotten so convoluted and so much paper is needed.  When applications are opened, 300 are received that have to be sifted down to 30.  That takes the time of the Minister's staff.  Everything has to be scored and so on.  Everything takes time.  There is so much compliance nowadays.  If we going to have all this compliance in the system, on which we all insist, the only solution is to start way earlier, because the process cannot be cut down.  I do not want to labour the point, but I will be pursuing this agenda every week of every month.</p><p>I think it is a right agenda because, as the Minister said, she did a good job.  I can have arguments about how good a job she did but I will give her credit for a reasonably good job in getting money.  The real sin in this game, however, is to get the money and not spend it.  There is a knock-on consequence for next year.  If the Minister gets the money this year and does not spend it, when she returns the next year saying she needs more, she will be told that she did not spend it in 2016 or 2017 and will be asked why she needs more next year when she is not spending it.  This is an Estimates meeting so it is fundamentally about the money.  We have piles of figures in papers and how many people are going in this door and that but ultimately, one has to get value for money, and one does not get any value for money if it being handed back to the guys in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because they will just put it in some black hole.  My worries are not assuaged.  When I hear "it is too early", that is something I used to hear myself.  I could take a piece of paper and write out all the steps that it takes from deciding to start a little scheme to getting someone with a shovel or digger or whatever it takes to work on the ground and this is growing continually.  Insurances, insurance bonds, or whatever one cares to name, there is so much process now that my worry is not that it is too early but it is actually too late.  I hope the Minister proves me wrong but I will be back after her in June and July - I will not give up in August, September, October, November or December - and then in January I will count it all up, just as I did this year and I will look for the underspend.  This is not because I want to pay games but because I think it is an awful travesty of justice when one states continually that we have no money, only to hand back a wad at the end of the year.</p><p> I will compliment the Minister on one thing before I hand over to my colleague, namely, setting up the Moore Street advisory group.  It was a courageous decision and could have gone very wrong or very right.  I had suggested that it might be the way forward.  It is fair to say that the chair of that group did an excellent job in bringing together disparate people in a coherent plan.  The group presented a report to the Minister.  Last week in the D&aacute;il, she told me she hoped to be able to move ahead with its proposals.  This matter needs to move forward.  I noticed again that &euro;3.8 million was carried forward on centenary events and put into the National Gallery or something like that.  Will she tell us when we will move forward again with this?  I am afraid that when the bicycle stops moving the person on the bicycle falls off.  Can the Minister tell me if she has been able to move forward on this in the last week?  </p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy that there is no point in central government providing the funding if it does not get out to the projects.  We all know the projects nationwide and especially in our own constituencies that need to get the funding and we want to see the money spent.  I can assure the Deputy that I am very conscious of the pressures but I will be keeping the pressure on the local authorities.  The funding is in the baseline of my Department's Vote and that will allow for the larger-scale programmes, such as the &euro;20 million, over a longer period which is the 15-month period.  The payments are being staged, as I explained earlier.  I welcome the Deputies' interest in this because they should get onto their local councillors and the chief executives of the local authorities and put pressure on them to get the money spent because we will not allocate 2017 money until they spend their 2016 money.  That is it.  Those that spend get more, and those that do not will be left behind.  It is very simple.  I have explained that payments in 2017 will be contingent on their reaching a certain level of expenditure.  We are involving business interests and we are involving communities more in this more recent town and village announcement.  We want them to consult with communities and communities are good at driving things forward.  The pressure will be on the local authorities.  One only has to look at the tidy towns scheme and what communities do there.  They drive those on.  They are out until midnight or 1 a.m., getting villages ready and there is such interest there.  The pressure will continue on the local authorities and I will maintain the pressure within the Department to keep going and to make sure that this money is spent.  It does not come easy.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows from his time as Minister that getting extra allocation for one's Department takes a bit of work.  Deputy Smyth, who is also from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, is present and I can say that I am not in the habit of giving money back.  I want to see it spent.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v for his input in the Moore Street forum.  He played a big role in that, he suggested it and it has worked out very well.  I thank those who were involved in it, the political representatives, the 1916 relatives, the street traders and other stakeholders and, like Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, I want to thank the chairman, Mr. Gerry Kearney in particular.  He worked on a voluntary basis and gave up a huge amount of his time.  He was very committed and was able to facilitate all the stakeholders, got everyone working together and it is important that we continue this momentum.  I said that I will set up the advisory group and am pleased to say I have appointed a new chair, Dr. Tom Collins.  I intend to make appointments to that group within the next week.  We want to get it up and running because there is a lot of work to do there and we want to see it moved on and Moore Street to be developed in a way that reflects the important events of the 1916 Rising and the street's role in that and to be able to accommodate one other and work together to find the right solution.</p> <p>  I think I have covered most of the questions.  </p></speech>

I will focus on the arts and the Creative Ireland programme, which is wonderful to see.  I have attended two of the Minister's workshops which are moving around the country, both in Monaghan and Cavan, and I compliment her on it.  It has been wonderful to see the engagement with local communities from all walks of life, both professional and amateur, and she has managed to encompass the visual, literary and performance elements.</p> <p>  As for the expenditure of the &euro;5 million, how much has been spent so far?  Have the workshops that were being held nationwide taken place in each local authority?  What is that costing, including the promotion of the Creating Ireland programme?  The programme has five specific pillars and the one of huge interest to me is education.  There is one on community, one on cultural and creative infrastructure, one on media and one on global reputation.</p><p>Will the Minister provide a breakdown of the expenditure on these five pillars for the coming 12 months?  How does she intend to divide the funding between each pillar?  Are there priorities among the five pillars or will they all receive the same amount?  How much will each local authority receive to implement the Creative Ireland programme?  A pilot scheme of the local arts in education partnership took place in Cavan and Monaghan.  I have always advocated that the idea and ethos of partnership could work very well with local authorities and the 16 education and training boards, ETBs.  We have discussed the idea of funding local arts in education partnerships on numerous occasions.  Does this come under Creative Ireland?  If so, will there be 16 local education partnerships and how much will they receive?</p></speech>

She was present at the two consultations in Monaghan and Cavan, which were very well attended.  There is great interest in it and there was great feedback.  We are going throughout the country to consult.  We are listening to people's views and asking them what they think of this, how they can support us in this and how they can work with us.</p> <p>  There are five pillars, namely: enabling the creative potential of every child; enabling culture and creativity in every community; investing in our cultural infrastructure; Ireland as a centre of excellence in media production; and unifying our global reputation.  The Deputy asked about the budgetary figures and I will give her the broad outline.  A total of &euro;5 million was allocated for the Creative Ireland programme in the budget.  This will ensure the programme can deliver on its key deliverables and implement a comprehensive public awareness campaign supported by a high-impact, high-profile events programme.  Local authorities have been allocated &euro;1 million and an additional &euro;1 million will be provided by the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, which means each local authority will receive approximately &euro;64,000.  The local authorities are establishing their creative teams.  They will also be a Creative Ireland plan for every county, which will tie into the overall national plan.  Cruinni&uacute; na C&aacute;sca was very successful.  It followed on from Road to the Rising in 2015 and Reflecting the Rising last year.  We spent &euro;1.25 million on it.  Much of the funding went directly to artists in terms of performances and various activities organised on the day, and it was curated by RTE.  Approximately 450,000 people came into Dublin city and 100,000 attended events in every county.  The notice was a bit short this year, but I hope to work on building a national cultural day on Easter Monday in every county throughout the country.</p> <p>  The public engagement and events will cost &euro;1.6 million.  This involves going out and meeting people and consulting with all of the stakeholders.</p></speech>

We have signed the arts in education charter.  We are elaborating further on the charter through Creative Ireland, which is enabling the creative potential of every child.  We want to ensure that every child will have the opportunity to access tuition in arts by 2022.  It is about arts in education.  We are bringing in all the stakeholders.  I met them last Saturday, which was national arts in education day and I am sure the Deputy is familiar with it.  I spoke in St. Patrick's in Drumcondra.  I met teachers, artists, education officers, arts officers and young people who experience arts in education at first hand.</p></speech>

The Creative Children plan, which will be launched in September, will set out how the plan will be rolled out over the next five years.

It is great that more money is being made available for such worthy initiatives.</p> <p>  The town and village renewal scheme, a worthwhile Government initiative, has been provided with many millions of euro this year.  Will the Minister provide an update on the scheme? </p> <p>  I gather extensive funding is being provided for arts centres in the regions, which I have long supported.  The increase in expenditure is very welcome and I congratulate the Minister on having secured this increased commitment on behalf of her Department. </p> <p>  What is the reason for the 12% decrease in the allocation for capital expenditure?  Has funding for capital programmes decreased?  I gather funding for current expenditure has increased.  What is the reason for the decrease in capital expenditure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1444" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1249" speakername="Heather Humphreys" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG12017051100002#J01700"><p>I will explain the decrease in capital expenditure.  The lower overall capital allocation is due to the once-off nature of a number of capital projects in 2016, including the decade of centenaries programme and a pier project.  These capital projects have been completed.  The reductions were offset by an increase in rural capital funding of &euro;17 million.  The best comparison that can be made is with the published 2017 baseline for my Department's Vote published in 2016 by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  In mid-2016, the Department of Expenditure of Reform indicated that my Department would have a ceiling of &euro;327 million for 2017.  The figure was set on the basis that a number of capital and centenary projects were once-off projects in 2016.  However, I made a case for an increased allocation to my Department and the ceiling was subsequently increased by &euro;41 million or 12.5%.</p> <p>  Deputy Brophy referred to increases in funding.  Funding for the Arts Council has increased by &euro;5 million or 8% and the allocations provided for all the national cultural institutions has increased.  For example, an additional &euro;2 million was provided to allow for the opening of the refurbished Dargan and Milltown wings of the National Gallery of Ireland.  I am pleased to note that, as a result of the wonderful renovations carried out at the National Gallery, the refurbished wings will open next month.  Killarney House was also opened on foot of significant State investment.  The allocations for the Irish Film Board and Culture Ireland have increased by &euro;2 million and &euro;1 million, respectively, while an extra &euro;1 million has been provided to assist the Heritage Council.  Funding of &euro;5 million has been provided for the implementation of Culture 2025, the Creative Ireland project which has been discussed at length.  The Department also trebled funding for the town and village regeneration scheme from &euro;4 million to &euro;12 million.  In addition, it has also provided &euro;8 million for the national rural development schemes, which includes &euro;5 million for the CL&Aacute;R programme.</p> <p>  I was pleased to allocate &euro;9 million for the arts and culture capital scheme this year.  Many cultural centres have benefitted from the scheme.  As Deputies will be aware, funding has not been provided for cultural centres for the past eight or nine years.  I was pleased to provide investment to these institutions because many have leaking roofs and windows in need of replacement.  A total of 56 projects have received funding, with seven flagship projects due to receive substantial allocations and 49 projects set to receive amounts of between &euro;20,000 and &euro;276,000.  This new funding has been extremely well received. </p> <p>  Funding of &euro;20 million has been provided this year for the town and village enhancement scheme.</p><p>The focus is on working with local businesses, local communities and local authorities and asking them to devise projects that will most benefit their towns and villages.  There is no point in me saying that I know this will work in some town in Mayo, Galway or so on.  I know what is happening in my county best.  I am telling communities and business people - there is an economic aspect to this situation - to figure out what they want and that I am happy to support them.  It is a ground up approach under which the Department enables local communities to devise good ideas and projects that will have an impact.  They know better than most what will work in their own areas.</p><p> That is the current state of play.  I believe I have covered all of the questions.  If not, the Deputy can revert to me.</p></speech>

I have a friend who works in a voluntary capacity at the gallery.  From what I have heard, it is an amazing project.  Traditional visitors to the gallery as well as a large number of new visitors will be attracted to visit it.  I am looking forward to having the opportunity to see it.</p> <p>  The Minister concluded on the regeneration scheme.  I was lucky enough to be a member of South Dublin County Council before my election to the D&aacute;il.  The council was innovative in pioneering a project that was similar to this one.  I was involved in co-founding one of the groups in the Templeogue area.  It was built on the idea of bringing local people and businesses together in a small community way - a village or other geographical area - and having them decide what worked best for them.  They would then request funding to do that.  There have been successful outcomes across my constituency where a number of groups have been set up.  It has been positive.  I do not doubt that such an outcome will be reflected in what the Minister is doing nationally.  In terms of value for money, the spending of the council's money through and with these groups delivered greater bang for its buck than the more traditional way of approaching the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1447" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1263" speakername="Michael Collins" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG12017051100002#K00300"><p>I will take the opportunity to ask the Minister and Ministers of State a few questions.  I am conscious of the time.  People want to get out on the road, so we will try to be out of here as quickly as possible.</p> <p>  I will touch on the Leader programme and funding for various projects, which is a major issue for rural Ireland, as the witnesses would expect.  This was raised in the D&aacute;il yesterday by my colleague, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae.  As politicians, we are being put under pressure to deliver locally.</p> <p>  I have put together a few notes on the Leader programme 2014-20, which is the current one.  From 1992 to 2016, the programme was successfully delivered by community-led local development companies.  In 2016, local action groups, LAGs, established within each local authority were contracted to deliver 23 Leader contracts, with the remaining three contracts delivered directly by local development companies.  The 2014-20 programme, launched in July 2016, allocated &euro;220 million to address poverty reduction, social inclusion and the economy of rural areas.</p> <p>  Evidence from these programmes has shown a failure to lead.  This comes from the communities, not us.  In their view, the move away from a development-led approach to a competitive grant fund has reduced the level of community engagement in the Leader programme.  Ten months into the programme, the level of grant approvals nationally is low.  In one mid-west LAG, for example, &euro;1.4 million of grant aid was approved after ten months in the 2007-13 programme compared with just &euro;6,600 under the current programme, or 0.5% of the earlier level.  In a south-west LAG, the respective figures are &euro;1.7 million and zero.</p> <p>  In the application process, the estimated minimum timeline for promoters seeking grant support from expression of interest to grant contract stage is nine months.  The programme's administration is complex, with the workload trebling, thereby reducing the time that front-line staff can spend supporting communities and entrepreneurs.  This is costly.  The Department has contracted Pobal to audit 100% of programme expenditure.  That is unprecedented.  Previously, administrative checks were carried out effectively by local development companies, as evidenced by the low level of ineligible funding - 0.5% at no additional cost - in the 2007-13 programme.  In reality, local development companies continue to undertake checks, passing them on to local authorities, which in turn pass them on to Pobal for triple checks, leading to significant delays and costs.  The cost of the 100% audit function may end up being higher than the cost of ineligible funding under previous programmes.</p> <p>  This is the national picture.  I have spoken about this issue often.  I have seen the benefit of the Leader programme to rural communities, as have the Minister and Ministers of State, who come from rural communities.  We have discussed the local issue in west Cork.  It now has three Leader companies where there was one before.  Where is the programme in west Cork?  Last December, the Minister told me that an office would open in Clonakilty, but none has.  When will the local community development committee, LCDC, Leader local development strategy be published?  No one appears to have seen it or been involved in its preparation.  Requests from Cork County Council to Pobal and the Department have been ignored.</p> <p>  When is the money going to be spent on the ground?  People have projects and ideas.  I meet many groups that are pulling out because this is not happening.  The vibe out there is bad, especially given that this was a super programme that used to get projects off the ground.  Groups claim that the funding is poor.  I can only speak on behalf of west Cork, where groups are finding it more difficult to engage and are not encouraged to apply with their projects.  These are serious issues, so I would appreciate it if the Minister would address some of them.  I have a question for the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, as well, but he will contribute in a minute, so we can discuss it then.</p></speech>

Like him, I want to see the money being spent in communities.</p> <p>  I will give some background information.  The Leader programme 2007-13 was active until 2015.  Indeed, some of the projects continued into 2016.  Sometimes, it takes a while to get these programmes off the ground.  The rural development programme 2014-20 was not agreed by the European Commission until 26 May 2015.  Following that, a minimum of six months had to be provided to allow for potential LAGs to prepare local development strategies.  That brought us up to the end of 2015.  The functions were transferred into my Department in June 2016 and I was anxious to get the Leader funding out to communities.  In July, the majority of the agreements were signed for the delivery of the Leader programme with LAGs throughout the country.</p> <p>  Since then, LAGs have sought expressions of interest from the project promoters.  More than 4,000 expressions of interests for funding have been received by LAGs, with a total value in excess of &euro;183 million.  LAGs are now concluding calls for proposals and working with potential applicants to develop and finalise project applications in each area.  As many as 25 projects have been approved by LAGs to date and are worth approximately &euro;548,000.  A significant increase in project approvals is expected as the year progresses.</p> <p>  A total budget of &euro;40 million has been provided for 2017.  Total expenditure for the Leader subhead to date in 2017 is &euro;3.339 million.  Of this amount, &euro;2.761 million has been paid in respect of administration and animation for the LAGs and preparatory support for a local development strategy for east Galway.  Expenditure on LAG administration and animation costs, plus other Leader delivery costs, will be in the region of &euro;12.5 million this year.  It is difficult to estimate expenditure precisely on projects in 2017, given that the process is controlled by the LAGs, but we will keep the expenditure under review.</p> <p>  Most committee members will be fully aware that it is a standard pattern for EU-funded programmes such as Leader to commence slowly.  However, activity increases rapidly after the first year or so.</p><p>I understand that the Leader programme in most other EU member states has only ramped up in recent months.  We are not, therefore, out of kilter with other EU countries.  I accept that some administrative problems have been encountered by the LAGS and the project promoters, some of whom have expressed concerns about administrative arrangements under Leader.  We must be conscious that this is 63% funding for Leader, approximately &euro;157 million of the &euro;250 million that is being provided by the EU, and there are checks that must be put in place.  There are very specific requirements that must be met for the EU funding to be drawn down and this is the same for every single member state.  Under the programme, we have tried to ensure that we are satisfied that all the projects are in order before they actually commence so there are no problems further down the line.</p><p> Having said that, I am very conscious that there are issues which need to be examined and, for that reason, I will host a forum with all the LAGS and local development companies on 17 May to discuss progress and explore the issues with them.  I want to hear what they have to say and, to be frank, if there are problems we are going to have to sort them out because I want to see the money spent.  That is the bottom line.  The money needs to get out to communities and to the various enterprise and heritage projects that badly need this type of support.  I shall meet them all, listen to their concerns and hear about the issues they feel are blocking the speedy delivery of this programme.  I shall sit with them, my officials will be there also, and we will try to iron out the difficulties.  Ultimately, it is about getting the money spent.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1450" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG12017051100002#L00200"><p>I always thought that the Leader programme was democratic.  It is a constant fight to try to get the money out.  The situation now is that we have 15 steps, with the addition of this expression of interest.  I am absolutely surprised that the Minister has not received &euro;183 billion in expressions of interest because every community is saying they have to get something in; some will be good and some not so good.  It is another layer.  I do not know where this came from or whether it is an EU or a national measure.  Whoever dreamt that one up deserves a medal for procrastination.  The reality is that the way it worked was those who had really mature projects approached the Leader groups when they were ready.  If the groups were going to apply with a project that was a pipe dream and could not happen or with one that was not yet mature or did not have the required information, the groups were sent away, told what to get and then they came back.  We have become so focused on planning in this country that we are getting nothing done.  I think of all the things that happened by people doing things on a wing and a prayer and I look at the Minister of State, Deputy Ring and I say "God bless Monsignor Horan".  Today, instead of being considered a really good guide for Connacht, he would probably have wound up in prison because he just got on with the job.  I also think of the many people involved in development when I was involved in that sort of work, including the former Senator, P&oacute;l &Oacute; Foighil, and ask what would have been the position if we had been obliged to try to do it under the conditions being created for the new generation of developers and community people.  It seems that governance has now become much more important than delivery.  I am told that there are 15 to 18 steps - the final three are optional.  This is 15 steps from conception to approval of a project.  I am not worried about the first two years being lost as this period is always lost with the way the EU operates.  I believe this EU cycle is crazy but it is there.  I am, however, worried about the way we are going to get these through.  A lot of Leader companies, because of the shortage of money, are making upper ceilings of &euro;50,000.  We have all these pages of targets and outputs and all the stuff that I bothered to go through.  In that context, I make the prediction that in ten or 15 years if somebody were to go back and look at the previous Leader programme and examine the legacy of the &euro;5,000 or the &euro;10,000 grants paid here and there, they will discover them to be long gone in the wind.  The projects that cost &euro;400,000 or &euro;500,000 with Leader grants of up to &euro;1 million are the projects that will still be benefiting the communities substantially because it takes that kind of money, and it is getting more expensive.  The planning process alone is costing a few hundred thousand euro.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ring, should consider the Cong Crossroads community centre which is a fantastic facility and which received &euro;500,000.  Anything less would not have been any use.</p> <p>  Who dreamt up the idea of bringing Pobal into this process as another outside agency?  We now have the LCDCs and Pobal in addition to the local groups, the Department and the EU.  Now there are more people with a hand in the pie at every step in a process.  We should face facts.  The Minister is where she is and I wish her luck unravelling this.  It needs to be unravelled and she inherited a great mess from the former Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  It managed to do so much destruction in five years it is unbelievable.  The Minister was handed a poisoned chalice in the way the Department gave it over to her Department.  All the gold is there but the Minister cannot actually get at it.  I wish her luck in her efforts but she will not unravel in time for the money to be spent this year.</p> <p>  The Minister comes from a farming background so she must understand the issues relating to cows.  When I was in the Department and when, at the beginning of the year, I would be worried about money, the Secretary General at the time would say to me "There is a cash cow here".  The Minister has a cash cow.  She has too much cash that she will not spend.  Will she spend that money on something else?  It is now May and &euro;1 million has not been approved.  Only &euro;500,000 has been approved.  We know that &euro;12 million is going to go on regeneration and that more than &euro;2 million will be allocated to administration, but the Minister will not spend &euro;5 million in actual projects by the end of the year.  The communities will not convene and rush out just to get to the Minister so she can make a claim on the Exchequer by the end of the year.  One can forget about anything that is given out in November or December.  August is out - the Minister knows that LCDCs do not meet in August.  It is going to be worse now that the local authorities are involved.  So the available months are June, July and September.  Perhaps some things initiated in October might be completed by the end of the year, but that would be a tight call.  Certainly, nothing substantial would be done.  I have said enough.</p> <p>  I wish to raise another issue.  May I go on?</p></speech>

I may have missed the second topic when I was out of the room but will the Minister indicate if a good section of the Ulster Canal will really be dealt with?</p> <p>  There was a recommendation in the Moore Street campaign report to include a flagship Irish language project as part of the overall project.  I was a little surprised to discover in recent days that Foras na Gaeilge has been given approval to sign a 30-year lease, with a 15-year break - in other words, it is tied in for 15 years - on a headquarters on Amiens Street.  Will the Minister clarify if the lease is in the name of Foras na Gaeilge or in that of the OPW?  If it is in the OPW's name, then at least it could put some other entity in there if and when this proposal on the Moore Street area comes to fruition.  It is somewhat disappointing that, before the ink was dry on the contract, one of the potential anchor tenants was pulled away for the benefit of some landlord.  Perhaps the Minister could address this issue.</p><p> I ask the Minister to answer two questions.  On the basis of years of experience and by looking back at the pattern of spend relating to the previous programmes, what are the her officials telling her she will spend on projects relating to the Leader programme?  Was the lease relating to the building on Amiens Street signed by Foras na Gaeilge and the OPW?  If it was just signed by Foras na Gaeilge, then that was a monumental mistake.</p></speech>

I want to be clear that in the event of any Leader savings emerging this year, I will seek, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, to ensure that the value of any savings will be retained for the benefit of rural Ireland.  It would arise if all of the money is not spent, although I would still say it is early.  I am meeting them next week and will listen very carefully.  We must sort out the issues, iron out the problems and get this money out.  The point I want to be very clear about is that if any savings emerge, I want the money involved to be spent in rural Ireland.  That will be in that budget.</p></speech>

Every piece of evidence-based analysis would indicate that to a person checking the spend on capital programmes.  This is worse because the Minister does not have any control over it as a result of the fact that it goes out to communities, which do the choosing.</p></speech>

This is the stretch that will go from Belturbet to Castle Saunderson.  On another part of it, funding was applied through Waterways Ireland and was successful.  A total of &euro;5 million was received to develop the blueway on the towpath along the canal from Smithborough to Middleton so that is protecting the route of the canal as well.  Another application exists.  They are looking at funding to see how we can move to carry out a recreation project along the route of the old canal into Clones.  A forum has been set up for all the stakeholders.  They were consulting this week with the different stakeholders on both sides of the Border but I must say that I was delighted to get it started.  The most important thing is that it has started and will be done on an incremental basis.  It is about getting the first bit and working back.  I think we should be working from Clones heading back in towards Belturbet.</p> <p>  The Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, will talk about the forests issue.</p></speech>

The OPW was not prepared to enter into a long-term lease in the context of its own plans for the property.  The sub-lease on the North Frederick Street premises where 15 staff from An G&uacute;m are based will come to an end on 31 May 2017.  Again, no extension to that lease is possible.  Accordingly, and in accordance with section 5 of the financial memorandum, Foras na Gaeilge submitted a comprehensive business case to the two sponsoring Departments to bring the two offices together at a new headquarters on Amiens Street.  Obviously, the Moore Street report does not specifically state that Foras na Gaeilge should be located there.  That report is under consideration by Department officials.  The lease is in the name of Foras na Gaeilge, not the OPW.  As I said, it needs to vacate the existing premises.  Obviously, Moore Street has some way to go before it would be available as a premises.</p></speech>

The vast majority of the group relating to Moore Street is also conscious of this.  One of the cost-effective ways of using some of the space we are looking to preserve involved putting in State agencies that are now in expensive rented properties.  It is a win-win situation because if we have to put an agency somewhere, why not put it there?  If we are going to make specifically it l&aacute;rionad Gaeilge, one of the obvious anchor tenants was Foras na Gaeilge.  I am glad to hear that there is some kind of lease break but I presume that if someone goes back after four or five years, and I accept it could take that long, I would love to see what the terms of the lease break are.  It is a pity it is not in the name of the OPW or somebody because it could use it for some other body.</p></speech>

I overlooked that question.  In respect of development in west Cork, the strategy submitted by the two parties in respect of west Cork was of a very high standard but the strategy submitted by the West Cork LCDC scored highest, as the Vice Chairman is aware.  The European Commission has confirmed that the West Cork Development Partnership has made two complaints to it about the selection process in Cork.  The first complaint relates to a suggestion that the &euro;1.25 million community development initiative, which Cork County Council agreed to make available to the West Cork LCDC and not the local action group, LAG, amounts to state aid.  The Department does not believe that there are any state aid issues associated with this funding but has been assisting the Commission with its consideration of the complaint by providing responses to specific queries.  The Commission has not provided the Department with details regarding the second complaint.  I will check the issue relating to the opening of an office in Clonakilty and get back to the Acting Chairman because I do not know the answer.

Let us begin.</p><p>I will start with the CL&Aacute;R programme, about which I have some questions.  When it was constructed initially, it was fundamentally a leverage scheme.  In other words, I had about &euro;20 million available and the idea was to leverage another &euro;20 million to &euro;30 million from other authorities in order that there would a drawing of money into rural areas from the main State agencies which should have been doing things there.  For example, we used to provide money for health centres.  We provided 50% of the money.  That meant that if, for example, it was decided to construct a health centre in Banada, a health centre that might have been at the bottom of the list suddenly came to the top because it became very cheap to provide it.  However, it brought double the amount of money into Banada that the Department was giving.  It appears from all of the CL&Aacute;R schemes which have been rolled out so far under this regime that it is no longer a leverage scheme but a straight funding scheme.  Will the Minister of State confirm this or will he go back to leveraging, whereby those who do not wish to come to the party can stay away from it and get nothing?</p></speech>

He was quite correct in what he said in an earlier conversation, that when one gives them funding, they still complain that they do not have any.  I listen to them complain every day on local radio about this, that and the other, yet when they have funding, they will not spend it.  I have been dealing with CL&Aacute;R programme funding and if the local authorities have not spent money, they will be penalised.  I will not give to local authorities that do not have a fair percentage of the money spent.  I am not talking about a figure of 10% or 12%.  I do not care who says it is not fair not to allocate funding to local authorities that are not dealing with the funding they have been given.  I have examined the local improvement scheme, LIS.  In one area the local authority wrote letters to the general public telling people that it had made an application under the CL&Aacute;R programme and that it was depending on it to come up with funding for the local improvement scheme.  It wrote to people to tell them that we were producing the money.  If the local authorities put forward proposals relating to the LIS or any other scheme, we will look at them.  For now, however, we are targeting schemes and giving a big percentage of the money available, but we expect the local authorities to come up with some of the funding required.  What I would like to do, but I cannot get agreement from the officials is go to communities and give the money to them.  However, it is like the sports capital programme in that it takes too long and will not work, as the Deputy himself told me.</p></speech>

Did he go to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and tell them that if they were willing to put &euro;3 million or &euro;4 million into the LIS, he would put in the same amount?  These bodies could undertake certain road projects and the Minister of State could undertake others.  That is the way we worked it.  We used to wait until they received the allocation from the Department for the LIS and matched it euro for euro and doubled it in CL&Aacute;R programme areas.  Does the Minister of State intend to talk to agencies such as the HSE and so forth?  There are other types of community infrastructure, aside from footpaths, roads and street lighting.  It is usually harder to secure a refurbished health facility in a rural area with a small population.  One is always told about the cost benefits.  This changes the cost benefits for the HSE because it would be at half the price.  The reason there is no health centre in Inishbofin is that when the matching funding was pulled years ago, the planning and so forth was not undertaken.  Will the Minister of State approach a wide range of agencies?  We had an arrangement with the electricity supply network and so forth.</p></speech>

We will talk to them.  I would not have a problem in talking to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or the local authorities if they were prepared to come up with some funding.  We could match some of the funding if the Departments were willing to do so.  </p> <p>  With regard to the HSE, one of the areas I have targeted under the scheme I announced in the past few weeks is where local groups work to provide local ambulances to bring people to and from hospitals or appointments each day in rural areas where the HSE will not provide that service.  I am providing funding for these groups.  They can make an application and draw down some funding from the Department.  The HSE has agreed in the action plan to support as many rural projects as possible and stated it will work with my Department.  However, the Deputy knows from working with the HSE in the past that it is not simple to get funding from it.  That is the reason I wish to focus on targeted programmes.  One of the schemes I included this time was a miscellaneous scheme.  I wish to see what communities are seeking and if I find that ten or 12 communities are seeking the same thing, it is a measure I will consider the next time.  All Departments are stating they have to work with us on the action plan and certainly provide funding for rural schemes and rural areas, but getting them to work on a particular scheme is not easy, as the Deputy is aware.  That is the reason I am trying to target the money where it will be spent.</p></speech>

Will he give a county in which there are only 2,000, 5,000 or 10,000 people in a CL&Aacute;R programme area the same amount of money as a county in which there is a big population in a CL&Aacute;R programme area such as County Mayo where virtually all of the county is included in the CL&Aacute;R programme, except Westport, Castlebar and Ballina?  How is he operating the scheme?</p></speech>

However, the Deputy is right.  It would not make sense.  Part of the problem with the CL&Aacute;R programme, as I have discovered, occurs where half of a parish is included in the CL&Aacute;R programme.  That does not make sense and creates a problem.  Of course, the centres with a bigger population will have to receive a larger amount of money than those with a smaller population included in the CL&Aacute;R programme.</p></speech>

Ultimately, there had to be lines because otherwise one would be told that Beaumont Hospital was providing services for people living in CL&Aacute;R programme areas and as such it should be receiving CL&Aacute;R programme money.  We were rigid in that if one happened to be inside the line, one was included in the programme.  If one was two inches outside it, one was out.  However, we will park that issue.</p></speech>

We live in a very funny country.  One thing that is scary is that when An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga resigned, the media were silent.  The chairperson of the Western Development Commission has said he does not wish to be reappointed and outlined clearly in his letter the reason he does not wish to be.  It must be great to be in government when there is media silence about such things.  If that were to happen in an urban agency and affected Dublin, there would be wall-to-wall coverage.  However, it does not mean that the substance of what has happened is not very serious.  This is not a hangover appointment from our time in government.  It involved the appointment of an ex-Fine Gael county councillor, a fine person.  He was scathing about the Western Development Commission and the Government on the issue of rural development.  Is it intended to give a serious role, teeth and money to the Western Development Commission to enable it to do its job or will it always be an excuse of an organisation that does not get any money from the fund and is using funds that could be recycled funds purely to engage in business development?  What will happen to the commission?  Will it be placed in the queue to receive unspent Leader programme funds?</p><p>Regarding the Western Development Commission, the Deputy is quite correct that the Chairman had two terms, effectively.  He had part of one term and a full second term.  He wrote and said he did not want to be considered for the chairmanship.  I heard him speaking on "Morning Ireland" and I said, on the record of the D&aacute;il, that when everything was outlined to him, in terms of the action plan, jobs and that the Western Development Commission was very much involved, he said that this was all news to him.  I cannot be responsible for the Chairman if he was not involved in what was actually going on with the commission.  The commission has a very important role to play, as do the regional and local authorities.  Since the time when Fianna F&aacute;il was in office, we have made changes and improvements to local government.  The local authorities all have enterprise sections within their councils.  The regional authorities have a very strong role with regard to the regions.</p><p> The Western Development Commission has a very important role to play.  I have advertised the vacancies on the board and more than 80 people have applied.  I hope to be in a position to fill the vacancies on the board soon.  When I came into office, the chief executive of the commission had retired.  I went to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and got permission to appoint a new CEO.  However, I feel that there is no point in recruiting a new CEO until we have a new board in place.  I want to give that board the responsibility of appointing a new CEO.  As I said, we have permission from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to appoint a new CEO and I hope that the board vacancies will be filled very quickly, now that applications have been received.  </p></speech>

We have outlined today what we have achieved in our time in government and what we have done for rural Ireland.  I am very proud of what this Government has done.  If certain people want to make comments I cannot stop them from doing so.  All I can do is defend the Government and defend our role.  We have played a very strong role in relation to rural development.  The action plan is working very well.  The action plan for jobs is also working very well.</p> <p>  The Western Development Commission has my full support.  I will be working with the new CEO when he or she is appointed.  I have also been working with the chief executive who is currently in place.  The commission has a role to play in terms of rural development.  There are lots of very good things happening in rural Ireland.  However, there are some people who, at every opportunity they are given, will downgrade what is actually happening.  There are lots of positive things happening.  Of course, we want more money, development and jobs.  It is the job of the Minister, Deputy Humphreys and myself to ensure that we provide whatever funding and infrastructure we can to make sure that the west and the north-west get the same opportunities as the east coast.  That is why I set up the economic corridor - to make sure that we can compete with the east coast.  That is working very well and I will be attending a further meeting next week about it.  I am very proud of what this Government has done.  </p></speech>

For many years, rural areas were growing right out into the periphery but we have seen a rapid suck in since Fine Gael came to power and that is typified here today.  I am beginning to wonder what rural Ireland actually means.  I like to look at spatial maps and there was a very interesting one published by the CSO showing the percentage of people in every county in Ireland that live in rural houses, outside of villages and towns.  All I ever hear from this Government is plans to spend money in rural towns but there are 1.5 million people who live outside rural towns and villages.  It is as if they do not exist.  It is as if all of those people have no rights to anything and are for annihilation as self-sustaining communities.  All of the time the narrative from Departments, including the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, concerns towns and villages.  The recently announced &euro;20 million fund, for example, is not for people who happen to live outside the village - the street village, not the baile or the traditional village.  If I live outside the street village or the town, I do not exist.  There is no money for me.  There is nothing for me.  The Department is actually a Department for the development of very large towns and to a lesser extent, small villages, despite the fact that the vast majority of people live outside of rural towns and villages.  Those people do not exist, do not count and are not meant to get anything.  That is a huge concern.  It seems that everyone is getting sucked in to the narrative of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment and its long-term project which is the forced urbanisation of Ireland.  Despite the drug problems, the housing problems and the congestion in urban areas, that Department wants more and more urbanisation.  I ask the Minister of State to define rural Ireland and outline the schemes funded by the Department for those who live outside the street villages and towns of rural Ireland.</p></speech>

The focus of the town and village enhancement scheme is on communities and economic clusters.  It is about the hinterland as well.  It is not just about the actual towns or villages.  It is about coming up with projects - which may or may not be located in the towns or villages - that will benefit the whole community.  We have the town and village enhancement programme, the rural recreation programme and the CL&Aacute;R programme.  The latter is helping schools out in the middle of the countryside.  We have schemes that involve projects that are located outside rural towns and villages.  The focus is on the bigger picture and the focus is economic.</p> <p>  A lot has happened under the action plan for rural development.  As the Deputy knows, there are 276 actions listed in that action plan.  A lot of things have already happened in rural Ireland but some people do not want to acknowledge that.  One often hears radio reports and reads in the newspapers that rural Ireland is dying but that is the wrong message to send out.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v knows, and I know, that there is lots of enthusiasm, commitment and strength in rural communities.  That is what this is about - building on those strengths and helping people to come up with ideas for projects that will improve their communities.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1512" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/RG12017051100002#O01700"><p>It is sad that we are in such a hurry on something so crucial.  Statements are often made here that are superficial.  The two greatest drivers of the economy in the area where I live, which Deputy Ring would know very well, are ECC Teo, which is out in the countryside, a timber mill employing 120 directly and up to 300 indirectly and McGrath Quarries, which is also in the countryside and not in the town.  Who would build a quarry in a town?  When I go around the real rural Ireland that I know, I find that an awful lot of the economic drivers are actually in the countryside.  Were it not for the planners insisting on trying to put industries cheek by jowl with residents, there would be even more industry in the countryside.</p><p> I have no problem with industry in the countryside and I do not understand why the planners are so against it.  We have destroyed the edge of every town in Ireland with horrible industrial buildings, one on top of the other.  This idea that the towns are the drivers is actually the main problem in rural Ireland if we look around.  When the Minister of State, Deputy Ring, has a private chat about this, he will be able to validate this.  I was going one night recently to a meeting in a place called Roundfort.  It used to be in the Minister of State's constituency.  Roundfort is a fantastic area.  There are so many beautiful houses and people living there.  However, the village itself, other than the school and the church, is fairly dead.  The village is the redundant part.  I was thinking about this.  Why did this happen?  Why are so many villages closed?  If I go into Ballinrobe, I see the same thing.  Why are they closed?  It is because the services they used to provide to the people living in those houses in the countryside are no longer the service those people want.  They go to the town if they want to get clothes.  That is the scenario and those are the challenges of the small town.</p><p> If there is a redundancy and a challenge in the country, it is in the urban areas, where we see all of this decay.  There are very few rural towns in Ireland, even where the countryside is alive and kicking and fantastic, that are actually as alive as they were because of the change.  I will give a simple example.  I was in a planning office one day recently.  I asked why they wanted me to live in the village.  I got the usual trite answer to the effect that I could walk to the post office.  I responded that I have the services of a post office, bank and my travel agent when I use the phone in my pocket, therefore I do not need to go to the village much.  I do not need to go to the town.  That is why there is a problem with the towns.  Even where the rural community is strengthening and growing, there is a problem with the towns because the purpose that the town served 50 or 60 years ago is dead.  When I came to Corr na M&oacute;na, there were three shops there.  Now there is one.  Before that, I think there were five.  It still has the same population, but everybody is going to Galway or Castlebar to do the big shop.  That is the way it has happened.  I think we need a much bigger debate on rural Ireland and on the trite lines spun by the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment.</p><p> Why am I spending time on this when the Chairman is anxious to get to west Cork?  It is because the Government is going to draw up three plans in the next month or so that are all built on this false premise.  They will be called the spacial plan, the capital plan and the mitigation plan.  They are against the rural part of rural Ireland, as is the Minister of State's own rural plan, which I quoted back to him in the D&aacute;il, which talks about stopping people living in the one-off house in the countryside as something that is desirable.  It is no good saying that the Department has got money for all of this when we do not seem to even know what we are trying to achieve.  I hate being called a hinterland.  I hate rural Ireland being called a hinterland of anywhere.  It infers an inferior status.</p><p> A lot of the drive that has come into this economy through young people coming to the city who are well-educated, smart, driven and competitive has  come from those much-benighted one-off houses of rural Ireland.  If we look at GAA clubs around the country, there are more superb players per thousand of population in rural areas.  Go to the towns and go to the rural areas.  When I think of all-Ireland competitors like Ballyea, St. Thomas's and other clubs in Derry and so on, I ask how they can, with they tiny populations, take on St. Vincent's, Nemo Rangers and other big city clubs.  I then realise that we have a huge resource in rural Ireland.  There is a lot of drive and energy.  It is not dependent on the town.  It is dependent on a self-reliant community.  Yet, we will not give them the crumbs off the table.  I guarantee that when these trade plans come out, they will be totally focused against one of the greatest drivers of our economy, which is the real rural communities.</p></speech>

It will speak to rural issues.  There is going to be an opportunity for us all to have a debate on rural Ireland in the context of the national planning framework.  It is important that we make submissions to that.  I do take the Deputy's point.  I was a member of Monaghan County Council and I absolutely defended the right of people to live in rural Ireland.  I live in rural Ireland myself and I was allowed to build my house there.  I do not want to see people from the country who want to live in the country being prohibited from doing so.  However, for others, it is more attractive to live in towns or to live in villages at different stages of their lives.  That is why I am developing the pilot scheme of how we look at people who wish to move back into the centre of towns and how we can incentivise them to do that.  The framework consultations will specifically ask us to consider whether as a society we want to continue to see a drift into the cities.  Personally, I believe there is a huge attraction to rural Ireland.</p> <p>  We did not get to discuss it but on the issue of broadband, when we get connectivity into every house in this country it will be a gamechanger for rural Ireland.  I have no doubt about that.  We are living in what I consider to be an IT revolution.  The whole world of work is going to change.  Where there will be good connectivity, people will more than likely be able to enjoy living in rural Ireland.  They will be able to work close to home as well or maybe work in clusters in small villages that have this connectivity.  One could hook into it anywhere in the world.  We are working closely with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to ensure that the national planning framework includes proper recognition of rural Ireland, including areas outside of towns.  We cannot continue to carpet from the east coast and Dublin outwards as that continue to sprawl.  There are many more opportunities to live in other areas.  We do not all have to be here.  We are living in a different era and we need to prepare for that.  I believe there is an absolute opportunity for rural Ireland to get its speak in there.  I will be making my views known in the national planning framework.</p></speech>

The only thing I see happening in rural Ireland, and it is happening in rural areas quicker than in the towns and villages, is that Eir seems to have its vans all over the place.  It is purely commercial.  It is very frustrating because when they go halfway down the road and stop, the next person telephones me to ask about connectivity.  In fairness, between now and the end of next year, Eir - a totally private company with no State input - is I understand, going to connect 300,000 houses in the most rural areas of Ireland.  It seems to be able to connect the likes of Ballykinealy and west Mayo.  It seems to be everywhere but unfortunately, while it is only doing half or a third of every area it is concentrating on very rural areas and not on towns and villages.  It is ironic that everybody told us that we would have to go into the town or village to get broadband.  In fact, for those 300,000 lucky people, they will have better broadband within the next 16 to 19 months than the people living in the city of Dublin.  They will have 1 Gbps in the house.  If one happens to be beside them, one will get in through the gap.  This is happening in real rural Ireland.  It gives the lie that one has to be in a town or a village.  That is yesterday's world.  The new world is one in which one can do most things wherever one is sitting, even at the top of a mountain, as long as one has 1 Gbps of power.</p> <p>  Maidir le ceisteanna Gaeltachta, bh&iacute; an-d&iacute;om&aacute; ar na heagra&iacute;ochta&iacute; Gaeilge agus bh&iacute; an-d&iacute;om&aacute; ormsa mar urlabhra&iacute; Fhianna F&aacute;il ar ch&uacute;rsa&iacute; Gaeilge, Gaeltachta agus oile&aacute;nda os rud &eacute; nach raibh an m&eacute;id a gealladh i gcl&aacute;r an Rialtais do gn&oacute;tha&iacute; Gaeilge, Gaeltachta agus oile&aacute;nda ar f&aacute;il i mbliana.

We are delighted to welcome today's panel of speakers.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome all of those who have come today: Ms Anne Graham, chief executive of the National Transport Authority; Mr. Barry Kenny, from Irish Rail, and all the way from Washington DC, Mr. Sean Kennedy, senior vice president of Airlines for America, which represents a range of airlines, both freight and passenger across the US.  They are all very welcome.  We have conducted a number of meetings to date and we will have many more across a range of sectors.</p><p>This morning we will focus mainly on transport issues and the impact Brexit will have on the transport sector.  What we say to everyone who appears before the committee is that we are keen to hear practical, imaginative solutions that we can put into place and include in the final report, which is coming down the tracks ever so quickly, and I am starting to get a little nervous that someone will want me to be involved in writing it.</p><p>Before I invite the witnesses to speak, I must read a short note on privilege and I ask them to bear with me for a few moments.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her, or it identifiable.</p><p>As those present are aware, we will have to suspend this session on time today due to the address by former Commissioner Barnier to the Joint Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a momentous day in the entire Brexit process so it is an appropriate one on which to have such an important session starting off the day.  I have decided to take the three witnesses in the alphabetical order of the organisations they represent so I will go first to Airlines for America.  I invite Mr. Kennedy to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1563" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean Kennedy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051100002#A00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for inviting me to participate at this hearing.  My name is Sean Kennedy and I am the senior vice president of global government affairs at Airlines for America, A4A.  A4A is the trade association representing the leading US-based passenger and cargo airlines.  Our members carry approximately 90% of all US passenger and cargo traffic and include American Airlines, United Airlines, FedEx, UPS, and Atlas Air.</p> <p>  I will begin by expressing my appreciation for the opportunity to address this committee.  I have worked in both Houses of Congress in Washington, as well in the White House under President Barack Obama.  I thought health care was a challenging issue, but Brexit puts health care in the halfpenny place.  This committee is tackling the implementation of an incredibly complicated and comprehensive issue that will affect all of Ireland.  The range of hearings the committee has held and the countless hours of preparation involved in the work are impressive and are a testament to the committee's solutions-based approach to governing.</p><p>Discussion of airlines and air traffic has become a pretty straightforward topic.  This is largely because virtually everyone has travelled by air, and at this point takes for granted that it is available to them.  My father was 27 years old before he took his first flight.  My first flight was when I was five years old.  It was a transatlantic flight.  Each of my children flew within months of their birth.  Air travel is now akin to mobile telephone service, something that was initially a luxury, but is now something woven into our culture and relied upon every day.</p><p> My written testimony offers data on the economic impact of commercial aviation for Ireland.  Some key statistics are that aviation drives &euro;4 billion of economic activity in Ireland, 4% of its gross national product.  Ireland receives 12 million passengers each year from the United Kingdom, and almost three million passengers from the United States.  Each day, 30 flights leave the US bound for Ireland.  Those travellers have seen their fares - adjusted for inflation - go down 26% since 2000.  It is no wonder that Dublin Airport broke another record for transatlantic passenger volume last year.</p><p> I do not need to spend much time characterising the significance of air travel between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Multiple carriers in both countries serve the market, offering a wide array of flights.  The air bridge between the Ireland and the UK is a critical aspect of their cultural, business, and family ties.</p><p> Air services are exchanged globally through hundreds of bilateral and multilateral international aviation agreements, without which airlines would not have the legal authority to operate.  This system for exchanging aviation rights internationally has been the status quo for decades.  In light of this unique system, Governments have historically carved out air services from trade agreements, like the WTO General Agreement on Trade in Services, GATS, agreement.  Air services between the US and the EU are based on the 2007 US-EU open skies agreement, which liberalised the transatlantic aviation market, meaning no restrictions on the number of flights, capacity, pricing or market entrants for flights between the US and Europe.  This agreement provides the legal foundation for airline alliances, such as Star, SkyTeam, and oneworld, which includes Aer Lingus.  The vast majority of our travellers fly on one of these alliances, either directly from the US to continental Europe, or from the US to the UK and then on to other countries, including Ireland.  Airlines within an alliance coordinate - with government approval - on routes, schedules, and capacity.  This yields more frequent flights spread throughout the day, with better-timed connections for travellers.  Competition between alliances keeps fares low.</p><p> The United Kingdom is critical to international air transport.  Each year, 14 million passengers fly between the US and the UK, representing a third of total US-EU traffic.  Over half of those passengers, some 7 million, are flying to or from other member states, using the UK as a stopover.  When the UK formally leaves the EU in March 2019, it will no longer be part of the US-EU open skies agreement or the European single aviation market.  So on the first day of Brexit, US airlines will no longer have the authority to fly to the UK, or fly through the UK to the EU 27.  The same will hold true for Irish airlines.</p><p> I noted earlier that other industries, such as agriculture, telecom, or financial services, have a WTO fallback position that allows them to operate in the absence of a bilateral agreement.  Airlines do not.  Air services are specifically carved out of the WTO.  The industry would have to dust off bilateral aviation agreements dating as far back as the 1940s and operate under outdated restrictions which would include limitations on the number of flights and the number of carriers.  This would trigger cuts in air services between the US and the UK, and the UK and Ireland.  In short, these antiquated agreements do not reflect the reality of what the aviation market represents today.  Additionally, the US-EU open skies agreement facilitated the emergence of transatlantic airline alliances, which offer greater connectivity.  Government approval of these alliances hinges on a fully open transatlantic market, one that will no longer exist on day one of Brexit.  Another complication is that airlines generally sell tickets about a year in advance.  The industry needs confidence that it can continue selling tickets to the European market, to the Irish and to the UK, starting in March 2018.</p><p> Where does this leave us?  At the start of my remarks, I noted that air travel has become akin to cell phone service.  I suspect that all of the Senators' constituents assume that, on day one of Brexit, they will still be able to make calls to and from the UK without interruption.  By the same token, they will assume the same for air transport.  They will assume that they can still fly to the UK and that passengers from the UK can still come to Ireland.  This begs for Government and the Senators here to take action now to provide legal certainty for their constituents.</p><p> There are two necessary steps to maintain international connectivity between the US, the UK, and the EU.  The first is an open skies agreement between the US and the UK, which Airlines for America, A4A, is actively pursuing with both countries.  The second step is an EU-UK agreement that will allow access and connectivity between the UK and Europe.  This would lead to the continuation of an aviation market that allows continued competition and avoids unnecessary regulation of commercial decisions.</p><p> I recognise that Senators have much to do in a very short period of time in finding agreement across industry sectors and with other Governments about Brexit.  A major disruption in airline service between the US, the UK, and the EU would wreak havoc for all sides.  As an island nation with a critical air bridge to the UK, Ireland is uniquely exposed.  As Senators know, there is increased discussion of transitional arrangements to limit the immediate impact on member states by the exit of the UK from the European Union while a future arrangement is being defined.  These arrangements will be targeted at those industries most severely impacted.  Aviation falls squarely within those goals, and we urge the Irish Government to make this industry a priority.</p><p> The severe disruption of air travel from the UK to Ireland should be a disturbing thought to all the Senators.  A transitional arrangement between the EU and UK would ensure that the air bridge between the UK and Ireland remains in place and that US airlines can continue to provide the vital link between Ireland and the United States.  The US airline industry appreciates the Seanad's leadership in tackling these issues and working on behalf of the Irish people, and we appreciate the opportunity to speak here today.  I look forward to the Senators' questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1566" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Anne Graham" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051100002#B00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend.  I understand that the committee wishes to focus today upon the impact on transport of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union.  To assist me in dealing with the committee's subsequent questions, I am joined by Ms Anneliese Jones, public transport regulation manager with the National Transport Authority.</p> <p>  Before dealing with the specific area of focus, I would like to set the context by providing a brief overview of the remit of the National Transport Authority in the provision of public transport services.  The remit of the National Transport Authority is to regulate and develop the provision of integrated public transport services - bus, rail, light rail and taxi - by public and private operators in the State, to secure the development and implementation of an integrated transport system within the greater Dublin area, and to contribute to the effective integration of transport and land use planning across the State.  In addition to its statutory responsibilities, the National Transport Authority has various arrangements with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to discharge functions on its behalf.  This includes the assignment of responsibility to the National Transport Authority for integrated local and rural transport, including provision of the rural transport programme.  The National Transport Authority is therefore an agency that implements Government and departmental policy in line with its legislation.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will play a key role in managing any change in legislation or regulation required for the management of cross-Border public transport services.</p> <p>  The National Transport Authority is responsible for securing the provision of public transport services through two specified mechanisms, public service contracts, where services cannot be provided on a commercial basis, and the licensing of public bus services, which are operated on a commercial basis.  The main relevant legislation is the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009, as amended by the Vehicle Clamping Act 2015 and the Public Transport Act 2016.</p> <p>  I would like to now deal with the specific areas of focus raised by the committee.  On cross-Border Rail services, Northern Ireland Railways, operates the Dublin to Belfast service in partnership with Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  There are currently eight services per day from Monday to Saturday in each direction, with five services in each direction on Sundays.  The distribution of the revenue and costs of the service are agreed between both parties.  This arrangement can continue post-withdrawal of the UK from the EU.</p> <p>  Cross-Border bus services are regulated at an EU level under Regulation (EC) No 1073/2009.  The National Transport Authority is the designated competent authority to issue authorisations and control documents - journey form books, formerly known as waybills - and to authorise cabotage operations under this regulation.  The Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland is the competent authority for Northern Ireland.  Currently all bus and coach traffic to and from the UK is regulated by Regulation (EC) No. 1073 2009, on the common rules for access to the international market for coach and bus services.  This regulation sets out the categories, applicable circumstances, requirements, and procedures to issue authorisations and control documents to enable international travel within the EU.  As part of the procedure to evaluate an authorisation, explicit protections are given regarding competition between such a service and any comparable service provided under one or more public service contracts.</p><p>The regulation also sets out the circumstances under which cabotage services are permitted.  These are limited, as cabotage is only permitted as part of an international service, provided that cabotage is not the principal purpose of the service and cannot be first, a transport service meeting the needs of an urban centre or conurbation or, second, a transport service meeting needs between urban centre or conurbation and the surrounding areas.<br/><br/>The Interbus Agreement has been suggested by the UK as a possible replacement for EU Regulation 1073.  It applies to international carriage of passengers by road by means of authorisation, occasional services and unladen journeys of the buses and coaches concerned with these services between a non-EU member state and an EU member state.  It does not apply to national services, the use of buses and coaches designed to carry passengers for the transport of goods for commercial purposes or to own-account occasional services.  The following provisions within the Interbus Agreement would require clarification, if it was agreed as the proposed replacement agreement: the evidenced-based rational for granting or refusing an application; inclusion of own-account transport and the grounds upon which an operator could temporarily be denied access to a territory and the maximum duration of such a suspension.  The authority would have serious concerns regarding the imposition of the Interbus model on the domestic market as that would render the PTR Act defunct, with the result that the authority could not regulate competition between commercial providers in the public interest based on the demand or potential demand for services, as is currently the case.  The PTR Act 2009 has created a level playing field where a diverse and vibrant commercial bus sector, with a growing number of commercial operators holding route public bus passenger licences.  <br/><br/>On the impact of a hard border, the introduction of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would have a very significant impact on cross-Border public transport services as it would be impossible to deliver reliable journey times for passengers.  The growth in cross-Border bus and rail services would be significantly curtailed if not reversed following the imposition of custom checks at the Border.  <br/><br/>On taxi regulation, the regulation of the small public service vehicle industry is Ireland is covered by the Taxi Regulation Act 2013 and the Small Public Service Vehicle (Consolidation and Reform) Regulations 2014.  There is currently no provision for a licensed taxi driver in the Republic of Ireland to pick up passengers in their own jurisdiction and drop a passenger within Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa</i>.  There is a requirement for primary legislation to provide for cross-Border taxi services. <br/><br/>On free travel, in April 2007 the all-Ireland free travel scheme for seniors resident in all parts of the island was introduced.  The scheme enables seniors, 66 and over, resident in the republic to travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland. Likewise, seniors, 65 and over, in the North can travel free of charge on bus, rail, air and ferry services participating in the free travel scheme in this State.  The Northern Ireland authorities require that DSP customers wishing to avail of free travel in Northern Ireland should do so using a similar smartpass as used by their Northern counterparts.<br/><br/>I trust we will be able to answer any queries that arise<b>.</b></p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Kenny to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1569" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry Kenny" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051100002#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to attend today to discuss the topic of the impact on transport of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union as it relates to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Our chief executive, Mr. David Franks, apologises that he is unavailable to be here today.</p> <p>  The chief executive of the NTA has detailed the regulatory environment for cross-Border transport services, including for the Belfast-Dublin Enterprise service.  As detailed, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann operates the Enterprise on a joint-basis with Translink, Northern Ireland Railways, and the agreements between the two companies are expected to be unaffected by Brexit.  European regulations for passenger rights for international services, EC 1371/2007, govern Enterprise services under a number of categories, including compensation for delays, information, sales channels and assistance.  As the Enterprise passenger charter agreed between the two companies predates these regulations, and the current charter exceeds the minimum standards set out in EC 1371/2007, customers will be unaffected should Brexit impact on the applicability of these standards.  However, there exists the potential for very real and negative impacts on the operations and future of the Enterprise subject to the model of Brexit the UK chooses to pursue.  As detailed by Ms Graham, a hard border impacts on journey time and service reliability negatively.  As well as the weekend, leisure or business traveller or tourist, this impacts also on daily commuters.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann operates a daily commuter service from Newry to Dublin, in addition to the Enterprise service, and demand for such cross-Border travel has increased in recent years.</p> <p>  Looking at hard border arrangements internationally is instructive.  At the EU frontier between Bulgaria and Turkey, passengers are required to exit the train and visit the passport office for entry into Bulgaria and vice versa.  Passport control is then conducted on board the train, following which there is a customs inspection.  Russia to Finland sees passport control and custom checks carried out while the train is moving, although the return leg sees the train stop at the Finnish passport control and customs station.  Passengers cannot leave the train until they have cleared customs.  In North America, Amtrak services which cross the US-Canadian border are subject to inspection by US and Canadian law enforcement officials.  Delays can occur due to customs and immigration procedures.  Inevitably, therefore, a hard border will lead to a worsening in journey time, service uncertainty and restrictions which will impact on cross-Border travel and commuting and the all-island economy.  There is also the potential for a requirement for station modifications to accommodate any customs or immigration activity.</p> <p>  A second consideration is the ambition of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Translink to continue to improve the Enterprise service and the role European Union funding could potentially play.  The decision in the 1990s to invest in the Enterprise service by both Governments, and supported generously by the European Union, predated the Good Friday Agreement, but represented a statement of intent by the EU and Irish and UK Governments in the strengthening of cross-Border links.  Over the past two years, the mid-life refurbishment of the original Enterprise fleet and the upgrade of the Boyne Viaduct in Drogheda were both financed through the European Union&rsquo;s INTERREG IVA programme, which was managed by the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, with support from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, DTTAS, in Ireland and Northern Ireland&rsquo;s Department for Regional Development.  Both Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Translink have ambitions to enhance the Enterprise service further, through fleet expansion to increase the service from every two hours to hourly, and by investing in infrastructure to improve journey times.  The EU&rsquo;s INTERREG and PEACE funds have supported cross-Border programmes in the past and it was anticipated that support would be sought from the EU for further enhancement of the Enterprise.  While a hard border does not automatically imply that the UK could not continue to support such programmes, it would be complacent not to be aware of, and to alert the committee to, the potential risk to our ambitions for the Enterprise. </p> <p>  While there will be one land border between the EU and the UK post-Brexit, there will of course be two railway land borders, with the Channel Tunnel also providing a land link.  At a European level, there are also technical considerations on interoperability, market access and technical standards, as well as passenger rights and funding, governed by EU regulations.  We have liaised, and will continue to do so, with European colleagues to understand and address areas of common concern as the model of Brexit emerges.</p> <p>  I would also draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the fact that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is the port authority for Rosslare Europort.  Rosslare Europort is the closest point from the southern part of Ireland to the UK and the European Mainland.  The port is a hub for all the major RORO passenger and freight services operating in the southern Irish Sea and continental routes.  Rosslare Europort is Ireland&rsquo;s second busiest in terms of ship visits and unitised freight and is designated as one of only five ports of national significance in the national ports policy.  A hard Brexit will impact on the operation of the port.  It is likely that dwell times in ports will be longer for both passenger and freight traffic.  We expect we will need to redesign port layout and traffic flows to deal with longer queues.  For example, the distance between the berth and the immigration and customs post for incoming traffic is crucial.  It is likely they will have to be moved further away so that traffic backed up onto the ship does not prevent us from loading the ship as quickly as possible to facilitate a quick turnaround for shipping customers.  Funding is essential for any physical changes.  There is concern that under current TEN-T designations, Rosslare Europort may not qualify for infrastructure funding.  We would hope that given the unique circumstances arising from Brexit provision could be made to support affected European ports requiring modifications, including Rosslare.  There is also the potential for an impact on traffic flows, with an increase in freight movements direct to-from continental Europe, rather than via the UK land bridge.  This may result in changes to ferry service patterns to-from Rosslare Europort and we would work with our ferry customers to provide for this. </p> <p>  My presentation is a brief overview of the issues we in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann are facing and considering in the context of Brexit and I welcome any queries members have on these matters. </p></speech>

We might note in our report the requirement for primary legislation on the cross-Border taxi issue.  I thank the witnesses for their presentation on the cross-Border bus service but that needs a detailed explanation as to what we can do for our report.  All of the issues raised by that were concerning.</p> <p>  Regarding the open skies policy, the US-UK agreement is a concern to us.  However, the UK-EU agreement is our main concern.  I realise Frankfurt and Paris will try to steal Heathrow&rsquo;s economic benefits.  We need to press that because of the air-bridge issue.  The committee needs to include in its final recommendations a draft of what is required in this regard.  When the European Union says Ireland needs to be supported first before it moves on to the next element, air travel needs to be part of that because of the air-bridge between Dublin and London.  I would suggest the committee writes directly to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport after this meeting calling on this to be done.  It is of such a pressing nature that we need to make sure it is on the agenda.</p></speech>

The Good Friday committee, of which I am a member, has made a draft recommendation on Brexit that all current and future EU funding should continue to be provided for Northern Ireland in the absence of an alternative agreement by the UK.  That may be of assistance to the issue of rail services.</p> <p>  Are there details of any proposals the French rail service has suggested should be put in place for the channel tunnel?  It would allow us to refer to it for Dublin-Belfast rail services.</p></speech>

There is significant demand for it to upgrade to an hourly service.  This was re-affirmed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade recently in an interview with the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  Belfast City Council has agreed on a motion for the adoption of an hourly and improved rail service between both of the main cities on the island.  Will Ms Anne Graham and Mr. Barry Kenny elaborate on the engagement between Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Translink, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and Department for Infrastructure in the North for offsetting some of those direct negative implications for workers, commuters, tourists and students who avail of this service?  We are reaching a point where we need to hear at mid-government and Civil Service level of what exchanges are taking place to offset some of these negative implications?</p></speech>

He actually shocked me with the implications of Brexit for air services.  I fly regularly into Heathrow Airport to get back to Dublin from Chicago.  I am concerned by it as I use air miles.  One can be re-routed by the airline because of what seats are available.  The implications that there is no agreement when Brexit comes in are frightening.  I am available anytime to meet with Mr. Sean Kennedy&rsquo;s association, whether here or in Chicago.</p> <p>  There has been a 13% increase in traffic every year from the US since The Gathering.  The tourism industry is vital to the country but we are in uncertain times with Brexit.  However, Mr. Sean Kennedy said the open skies policy will stop.  It is critical we have an open skies policy between Ireland, the US and Britain.  I would be prepared any time to meet with Mr. Sean Kennedy&rsquo;s people.</p></speech>

Should the United Kingdom decide it does not want to be part of that, is there an opportunity for Ireland to become the European hub for transatlantic flights?  There is a suggestion that British Airways has been examining that option with the development of the new runway in Dublin Airport and the availability of US preclearance facilities?  If the UK is not subject to the legislation to compensate for delays, etc., that might also be an opportunity for this country.</p> <p>  It was said that legislation would be required for taxis to allow them to pick up and drop off across the Border.  Will that require joint legislation between the UK and Ireland?</p> <p>  Expansion of Rosslare Europort is limited because of the amount of space available there.  It was mentioned at a meeting in Brussels with Mr. Michel Barnier that there is an opportunity to develop a ro-ro port to bypass the UK because of the problem of tariffs in and out.  Is there room in Rosslare for such a development or has the National Transport Authority looked at alternative ports?  Has it looked at capital funding options from the European Investment Bank to develop much larger ro-ro and passenger services to mainland Europe from Ireland to squeeze the UK out of it?</p></speech>

My comments are directed to Mr. Kennedy.  The situation which could obtain and which Airlines for America is fearful of is shocking.  Most people would be taken aback to hear this could happen.  We take air travel for granted to a great extent in the western world.  It just confirms the notion that there is nothing good about Brexit, even for the British who are landing themselves in a backward position.  Everything seems to be going backward.  It has been suggested that they are going back to the old empire, which hardly represents progress.</p> <p>  Mr. Kennedy has set out his case and concerns.  What engagement has he had with our negotiators here, including the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, and other personnel?  What level of response has there been in terms of where this lies in the pecking order?  Significantly, Mr. Kennedy points out that timing is important and things will need to be clear by March next year if airlines are to sell tickets.  It is not like this can go to the end of the process.  It is a cliffhanger situation a year earlier than in other business sectors.  What is being said at European Commission level?  It sounds shocking, but then again this is so critical for the UK and Europe that common sense might prevail and something will be sorted out notwithstanding the current posturing, frayed nerves and high emotions.  One imagines that this should be looked after in normal business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1581" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051100002#E00200"><p>I thank the three speakers for their contributions this morning.  I differ from some here in that I believe the common travel area is almost certain to survive completely unchanged by the Brexit process.  While I agree that we have to look at the worst-case scenario in respect of North-South and east-west transport and movement of people, I do not believe there will be immigration checks on the Border or across the Irish Sea.  The Government of the United Kingdom will continue to have visa-free access for EU citizens, which will include Irish citizens.  The common travel area will be made the subject of a special carve out.  As such, I am slightly more relaxed than others here on that subject.</p> <p>  In respect of Mr. Kennedy's airline analysis, he is absolutely right to signal to us the consequences of a hard Brexit were Article 50 to mean the United Kingdom was leaving the European Union after two calendar years.  However, we must remember that Article 50 provides that the actual departure date from the United Kingdom can be altered by an agreement negotiated within that time.  I emphasise strongly that while Ireland would be especially affected by the collapse or evaporation of the European and US-EU air transport arrangements, I do not believe others are blind to that.  As such, transitional arrangements will be negotiated on a front-loaded basis to preserve the air travel market which, as Mr. Kennedy says, is so important.</p> <p>  On the regulation of public transport, bus services probably constitute an issue.  I do not predict that there will be a problem with rail services as long as the absence of INTERREG funding does not cause a major disruption to plans to expand the Enterprise service.  However, there are serious implications for bus transport of having two jurisdictions not operating at least a co-ordinated system as happens within the EU.  I would be very interested to hear whether negotiations, or at least discussions, have taken place North-South on an all-Ireland approach to this matter.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, these are the kinds of things that can be dealt with by cross-Border institutions.  Given that everyone is agreed that the Good Friday Agreement is going to continue, I see no reason we should not at least explore using cross-Border institutions, existing or new, to deal with these kinds of issues.</p></speech>

Having regard to what Senator McDowell said, I feel we have to prepare for all scenarios, including a hard Brexit.  At what speed are the witnesses working on these issues with the Departments and other stakeholders?  To be prepared, we must communicate and plan.  What scenarios are being planned for and with whom are the witnesses engaging?  Aside from discussions, what is being prepared in writing for what is coming down the line?</p></speech>

Is there not such a commercial imperative to maintain the <i>status quo</i>and is that not so important financially to stakeholders on all sides of the Irish Sea that it is what will happen?  Is the commercial logic not such that it will happen?  While I understand where Senator O'Sullivan is coming from and that Mr. Kennedy referred to planning for the worst case, I share Senator McDowell's optimism.  Leaving that aside, will the desire to maintain commerce, business and jobs be so overwhelming and imperative that none of these things will be allowed to happen in the end?</p></speech>

Senator Paul Daly raised a very good point in respect of technical issues.  While we are happy to provide whatever technical assistance we can, this is less a technical challenge than a challenge of will.  The underlying agreement is pretty simple and the Senator has probably seen what the text looks like.  There are 121 countries with an open skies agreement and they all use pretty much the same text.  The Senator can find that and has probably read it.  The question is whether there is a will within the EU to take on the task as part of a transitional agreement.  That is the biggest problem we have seen.</p> <p>  A few Senators asked how other countries were reacting and whether commercial logic would prevail, with everyone recognising we cannot go to the brink when it comes to commercial air transport.  What gives us pause on our side is that Airlines for America has met representatives of member states and of the EU itself.</p><p>As one would expect there is a range of emotions in statements we have had.  People from certain countries have said quite clearly that there will be no transitional arrangement and that aviation will be lumped in with pharmaceuticals, agriculture and automobiles.  That gives us pause for the reasons I said earlier.  Those industries can still operate in the absence of a law - in the absence of an agreement.  Airlines cannot operate in the absence of a law or agreement.</p><p> I believe Senator O'Reilly asked if a rational reaction would occur.  We are very concerned that the raw emotions that underlie Brexit may lead to the exact opposite of that.  We have had very positive meetings with Irish officials.  The reaction has been very consistent with what we have heard from members of the committee today.  The notion of the air bridge is vital as everybody has recognised.  Leaders continue to ask very smart questions; they are keeping us on our toes.  There is a strong willingness to work with all sides.</p><p> Senator Craughwell asked if airlines would relocate operations to Dublin or to other countries.  The challenge with that is that Heathrow is one of the largest airports in the world by volume.  Given the billions of US dollars we have invested, they could be transferred overnight - I do not even think it would be over time.  On day one of Brexit, what will the operations be?  I assure the committee that the operations cannot move over at the flick of a switch, which is a challenge.</p><p> Senator Paul Daly asked about the impact on flight paths and plans in airspace.  We do not anticipate Brexit will have any impact on things like over-flights.  Flights could still go over Ireland; it is service to the country that would be implicated.</p><p> Senator Grace O'Sullivan asked what the remaining back-up plans were.  We are not at the point to make commercial plans.  We are still selling tickets and still encouraging travellers to buy with confidence.  We do not want to be put in a position where we can tell customers that they should, perhaps, postpone their trip to Dublin or any point in Europe.  We do not have a lot of contingency plans right now because we are still in an advocacy position urging the EU and the UK to reach an agreement.</p><p> I believe those are all the major points that have been raised.  The Chairman might let me know if I have missed any.</p></speech>

We do not believe it will be impacted by Brexit; the arrangements can continue.  Regarding what the committee can recommend on bus services in particular, we would like to see whatever replacement agreement is put in place reflect EU Regulation 1073.  That regulation works well and we would like to see the replacement agreement reflecting those requirements.</p> <p>  For commercial bus services, such as the Dublin to Donegal bus service, it will be up to the operator to put in whatever contingency plans are required based on whatever delays might occur on those services.  If there are delays to their journey times, they would have to apply for amendments to their licences with the authority.  Obviously, if there are changes to journey times for contracted services that may cross the Border, we may have to put in additional services that are more frequent and cover the services during the day.  I believe the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is engaged in discussions about a replacement for EU Regulation 1073 for cross-Border bus services.</p> <p>  There was a question about taxis.  Legislation from both sides of the Border would be required to allow for cross-Border taxi services.</p> <p>  From a regulatory point of view, we just have to manage whatever the agreed scenario is, including a hard border.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann would be having more discussions directly with Translink on the hourly service than we would.</p> <p>  I think that covers the main issues that were raised for the authority.</p></speech>

It is, of course, a Schengen to non-Schengen country operation and as such there are existing border controls there.  They take place before boarding the train at either end because it is essentially a single operation.  The complication we have is that there are 36 stations along the Dublin to Belfast corridor, six of which are served by the Enterprise.  As it stands today, a passenger can hop on a DART or a commuter train at a station such as Raheny or Skerries and get off that train at the same platform the enterprise calls at.  There are complications there.  While we sincerely hope that Senator McDowell is correct in his beliefs on a hard border, that it adds to the complexity of how this would impact.</p> <p>  At a European level much of the concern relates to the interoperability, the technical standards and the market access provisions that have been built up over the years to allow for a single European area for rail transport.  Certain European companies operate and own rail franchises in Britain and vice versa.  The concern there is obviously to maintain that type of market and to understand how the technical models would apply post-Brexit.</p> <p>  Regarding our engagement with Translink and other agencies, we have a regular Enterprise board, involving the chief executives of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Translink, which addresses all strategic issues, including this.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has also been very proactive in its approach.  Earlier this year it hosted an all-island transport forum at which all sectors were able to contribute and directly feed into the Government's overall approach to Brexit.  That has been reflected in the reports published in recent weeks.  We will continue to do that.  We will not be spending in terms of contingency at this point in railway station provision.  We will await the ultimate decisions that are made.  Through that joint enterprise board we will feed directly to our parent departments and very much have that common approach.  Obviously the common travel area is at the heart of that.</p> <p>  We are working with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on models which would allow a boost to investment in Rosslare Europort.  Effectively all surpluses generated over the past 20 years have been reinvested there, but that has been relatively limited overall.  We want to be able to expand and deepen berths so that we can develop the port further.  The main option we are examining is to establish a private concession to operate the port over a long-term period.  It would remain in our ownership, which would allow the concession to get the finance to invest further without impacting on the wider CIE group debt levels.  In either a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit we will take that approach to expanding the operations at Rosslare.</p> <p>  On contingency, it is about timetabling for border checks.  However, the examples I gave show that even where that happens, delays can occur depending on the situations that operators will encounter and that the customs and immigration officials will encounter.</p> <p>  I believe that covers the questions I was asked.</p></speech>

I have been following the committee's proceedings and applaud the important work it is doing on this issue which is of critical importance to Ireland, as well as the wider European Union.</p> <p>  Brexit is a tragedy for Europe and Ireland and eventually will be for the United Kingdom.  The European Union is the world's most successful peace process.  It has brought together in co-operation European nations which slaughtered one another's peoples in the world wars of the 20th century.  It has united around its core principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights countries which had been until recently ruled by suppression and the denial of freedom.  It has created the biggest single market on the planet.  It offers the hope of fresh opportunity to neighbouring states.  It donates more than half of all the development and humanitarian aid in the world.  It has given global leadership on the issue of climate change.  </p> <p>  For all of its shortcomings and it has many, the European Union is one of the greatest forces for good in an increasingly dangerous and uncertain world.  None of the challenges facing the European Union today - conflicts in neighbourhoods, migration, globalisation and demography - would be better addressed by the 28 member states acting separately rather than collectively.  In Ireland, we know this better than most.  We know that how our economy and living standards have improved since Ireland's accession to the EEC; how the European Union helped us to develop our infrastructure; how it encouraged us to improve environmental standards, consumer protection, working conditions and rights for women; how it supported the Northern Ireland peace process; and how it has enabled our Irish identity to thrive in a European context.  Now, for the first time in its 60-year history, the European Union is being put into reverse.  One of its largest and most influential member states, our nearest neighbour, has decided to leave, but the European Union will survive its departure.  The danger that other member states might follow the United Kingdom to the exit has, for the time being at least, been halted by the recent elections in the Netherlands and, last Sunday, France.  However, without the United Kingdom, it will be a lesser European Union and that is the first negative consequence for Ireland.  As a small country, we need a strong, united European Union to provide the main market for our export-led economy, stability for our shared currency, the euro, and the political union to amplify our voice and influence in the world.</p> <p>  The departure of the United Kingdom will, I fear, also change the European Union.  Ever since it joined, with Ireland and Denmark, in 1973, the United Kingdom has been a champion for the Single Market which it now wants to leave.  It promoted enlargement to include the very countries the peoples of which Brexit is now designed to exclude.  Throughout its 40-plus years of membership, the United Kingdom has been a consistent advocate for the open society values on which EU membership is based.  The United Kingdom's departure from the European table will weaken the defence of these values at a time when so-called "illiberal democracy" is on the rise in some member states.  Earlier this year I had the privilege of teaching at the Central European University in Budapest, which is now threatened with closure by the Government of Hungary.  This is the first time there has been such an attack on academic freedom in a member state of the European Union.  I hope the departure of the United Kingdom and the consequential weakening of the European Union and its values will not embolden those political forces which place little worth on freedom of thought and expression.</p> <p>  Many hope the United Kingdom may yet somehow change its mind about departure.  The President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani, has suggested the option of the United Kingdom remaining in the absence of a withdrawal agreement should be kept on the table.  I agree.</p><p>I agree, too, with former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has promoted the idea of a second vote.  However, I think both scenarios are highly unlikely.  Any prospect that the decision to leave might be reversed has been rendered almost impossible by the political support at Westminster for an extreme interpretation of the referendum decision. <br/><br/>I am surprised, especially given the closeness of the referendum result, that there is so little political challenge to the assumption that Brexit now means the hardest Brexit possible.  Many of those who voted to leave believed - and were led to believe - that they were voting for a future relationship between the UK and EU akin to that of the EU and Norway.  For all the talk of respecting the will of the people, it is not convincing to interpret last June's vote as a mandate to leave the Single Market and the customs union, nor as a mark of support for the prospect of crashing out altogether should the negotiations go badly for Prime Minister May. <br/><br/>I do not understand or agree with the way in which the current leadership of the British Labour Party and the remainers within the Conservative Party have folded into such a consensus on the defining issue in contemporary British politics.  The people of the UK, whose decision last June has led to the triggering of Article 50, ought at least to be given the final say on the outcome of the negotiations in a final referendum.  Had the result gone the other way, and by such a slim margin, it is highly unlikely that Mr. Farage and his collaborators would not already be seeking a re-run. <br/><br/>It is of course possible that the political climate may change in the UK, maybe in response to the realities of the withdrawal negotiations and their consequences or perhaps if the general election on 8 June gives the Prime Minister more time and flexibility.  The working assumption for Ireland must, however, be that the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal is going ahead and that we have to address the implications for this State and this island.  It is a significant achievement for Irish diplomacy that the Irish dimension of Brexit has already won acknowledgement and prioritisation, both in the UK&rsquo;s statement of principles and in the EU negotiating guidelines, which were agreed by the European Council on 29 April.  Throughout Europe, not only in governmental and diplomatic circles but also among the wider public, there is an understanding that Ireland requires special consideration and that issues such as the land Border, the peace process, the common travel area and trade must be central to the eventual separation settlement.<br/><br/>I congratulate all those whose efforts have secured a pre-negotiation position for Ireland expressed in very strong language, which I believe has the potential to go beyond areas already in public discussion.  At the heart of all this is the Good Friday Agreement, which is primarily about Northern Ireland, but which is also an international agreement between the United Kingdom and Ireland on the totality of the relationships between our two countries.  One of those relationships is our common membership of the European Union.  The Good Friday Agreement, in several of its parts, makes specific provision for discussion and some management of EU-related matters, for example in the British-Irish Council, at the North-South Ministerial Council and in bilateral discussions.  Matters within the purview of the North-South Ministerial Council, including agriculture, environment and transport, the cross-Border bodies on food safety, trade, and the Special EU Programmes Body, SEUPB, were all chosen on the assumption that both the UK and Ireland would continue to be members of the EU and that the shared EU regulations and policies would facilitate increased cross-Border co-operation.  The Good Friday Agreement, the foundation on which relations between Ireland and the UK are built, clearly assumed continued membership of the EU by both countries.  The UK&rsquo;s decision to leave the EU has fundamental implications for that agreement which are deeper than obvious issues such as a possible hard Border.<br/><br/>In her letter to President Donald Tusk, Prime Minister May acknowledged this by referring to &ldquo;the UK&rsquo;s unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland and the importance of the Peace Process in Northern Ireland&rdquo; and her commitment &ldquo;to continue to uphold the Belfast Agreement&rdquo; as being among the UK&rsquo;s principles for the forthcoming negotiations with the EU.  This is very welcome.  The EU guidelines of 29 April go even further, stating:</p><blockquote>The Union has consistently supported the goal of peace and reconciliation enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and continuing to support and protect the achievements, benefits and commitments of the Peace Process will remain of paramount importance.  In view of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, flexible and imaginative solutions will be required, including with the aim of avoiding a hard border, while respecting the integrity of the Union legal order.  In this context, the Union should also recognise existing bilateral agreements and arrangements between the United Kingdom and Ireland which are compatible with EU law.</blockquote><p>I found it interesting that the phraseology used today by Monsieur Barnier in his address to the Houses of the Oireachtas echoed that reference to the Good Friday Agreement.  He did not use the phrase &quot;in all its parts&quot; but used instead &quot;in its several dimensions&quot;.  This clearly recognises that the Good Friday Agreement is broader and has further implications for the UK-EU negotiations than just the obvious issue of a hard Border.  What all of this means is that &ldquo;the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland&rdquo; or &ldquo;the UK&rsquo;s unique relationship with the Republic of Ireland&rdquo;, whichever formula is preferred, is not just one more item for the withdrawal negotiations, but instead has the potential to shape and influence the very nature of the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU.<br/><br/>The UK has to find a way of reconciling its exit from the EU with its commitments under the Good Friday Agreement and the EU has effectively confirmed that this is how it will approach the negotiations.  It is possible to envisage how that could be achieved in the context of a softer Brexit, but it is difficult to see how the Good Friday Agreement &quot;in all its parts&quot;<i></i>can remain intact if the UK is out of the Single Market and the customs union.  We may hear a lot more about the phrase &ldquo;in all its parts&rdquo;<i></i>as these negotiations proceed.  The institutional and constitutional arrangements made under the Good Friday Agreement are described in the agreement itself as interlocking and interdependent.  They are not open to be unpicked to facilitate a hard withdrawal agreement.  In my opinion, therefore, the UK's commitments to the Good Friday Agreement and its wish for an absolute exit from the EU, including from the Single Market and the customs union, are not compatible.  If the UK is to continue to uphold its commitments under the Good Friday Agreement, it will have to change its tack and opt for a softer exit from the European Union.<br/><br/>It is deeply disappointing that at the very time the UK, through its Government and Parliament, was formulating its negotiating position on Brexit, the Northern Ireland Assembly had fallen silent.  There is still no restored Executive, and consequently North-South Ministerial Council meetings are not taking place.  The opportunity for Northern Ireland&rsquo;s leaders to shape the nature of Brexit has, therefore, perhaps been partially lost.  I hope that the Executive can be restored before much longer.  The issues at stake for the whole island because of Brexit are surely greater than the differences which apparently are preventing the two largest parties from reaching an accommodation.<br/><br/>Those issues which are of impact for the whole island include the economic consequences of Brexit.  In that context, I recommend to the committee an excellent document recently published by the Labour Party, entitled Our Island, Our Europe, Our Future, which make a number of specific recommendations to allow Ireland flexibility in responding to post-Brexit challenges.  These include the modification of the EU&rsquo;s Stability and Growth Pact and fiscal rules, the establishment of a Brexit trade adjustment fund, the development of new EU markets, and the inclusion of a new Irish protocol to the EU treaties.<br/><br/>It is already clear that the negotiation of a withdrawal agreement will not be easy, not least because it has never been done before.  The outcome will have to be approved by the Council and passed by the European Parliament.  It will also have to be ratified by each of the remaining 27 member states of the EU.  Ratification will inevitably raise the question of a referendum in Ireland.  Irrespective of the legal advice which will be available to the Government, it is almost certain that some Irish citizen will seek a determination in the courts.  There is a good case for the Government and the Oireachtas to decide now, at the beginning of the negotiations, that a referendum will be held on ratification of the withdrawal agreement.  An early political decision to hold such a referendum would strengthen the hand of the Irish Government in the negotiation phase, and would help to keep the Irish dimension at the centre of the talks. <br/><br/>Finally, as the committee has asked me here in my capacity as a former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, I wish to refer briefly to the foreign policy and security dimensions of Brexit, which have received very little attention to date.</p><p>Following its withdrawal from the EU, the UK will no longer be a party to the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the Common Security and Defence Policy.  The UK has made a significant contribution to the foreign, security and defence policies and actions of the EU since it joined in 1973.  The position on such issues taken by the UK was often similar to Ireland&rsquo;s position. The departure of the UK therefore removes an ally on many important external issues.</p><p> Its departure will probably also result in its increasingly concentrating on involvement with NATO and with its North American friends.  Most EU member states are also members of NATO and there is a risk that the locus of European decision making and action on foreign policy, security and defence will shift from the Foreign Affairs Council of the EU, at which Ireland is represented, to a military alliance to which we do not belong.</p><p> To counter this, Ireland will need to become more engaged on these European issues and be prepared to perform even more actively in areas such as peace work, development, humanitarian aid and the promotion of the soft power approach of EU foreign policy.  It is welcome that the UK has said it wishes to continue to co-operate with the EU in these areas.  However, this is an area of our EU engagement on which there is a need for greater discussion by the Oireachtas.</p><p> I thank members for their invitation and their attention.</p></speech>

I asked his views on the possibility of the State being required to hold a referendum.  I am still trying to decipher what his response was.  With all due respect, that is probably quite typical of him.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Gilmore for his very thoughtful contribution.  There was much interesting information and many suggestions in it.  He brings much experience in that regard.  I wish him continued success as EU special envoy to Colombia.  It is extremely important work which he is enjoying immensely.  </p> <p>  A referendum is likely to be required on any final agreement that may emerge from the negotiations.  To our cost, cases are taken to the courts, as citizens are entitled to do, and the Government is forced into a referendum on a treaty change or a change that is considered to be a treaty change.  For many reasons, there is something to be said politically for the Government to make the case for a referendum and the Oireachtas to decide to if it should be held.  It is welcome that Mr. Gilmore put that on the agenda and spoke very coherently about why that should be the case.  </p> <p> The alacrity with which those on the remain side in the UK, in particular the UK Labour Party, have folded the tent and decided to allow Theresa May and others a free run to argue for a likely hard Brexit is very alarming.  When the reality of what the UK will face hits home, it will inevitably open up ground for further consideration of the prospect of a referendum on a final agreement.  I hope that clear-minded people in the UK will continue to consider that option and to campaign and advocate for it because this match is not over by a long shot and when reality hits home, the prospect of a final referendum on a withdrawal agreement, or whatever emerges from the process, will hover into view.  It will remain on the agenda but it beggars belief that it is not being given more consideration.</p> <p>  Mr. Michel Barnier, chief negotiator of the task force for the preparation and conduct of negotiations with the United Kingdom, said earlier today to the D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann sitting in joint committee that we have to speak the truth.  The departure of the UK from the EU will have consequences.  Customs controls are part of EU border management.  To a point, he was stating the obvious.  For example, Mr. Gilmore is well aware of concerns in my constituency about a possible return to a hard Border, physical customs posts and all the disruption that would entail.  While Brexit will have general trade implications, the Border counties in particular are exposed.  The reintroduction of Border and customs posts would raise the spectre of a very painful past for people in Border communities North and South.  What would the optimum arrangement be for Ireland in the context of trade and ameliorating some of the worst effects of the prospective reintroduction of customs controls?  How can we ensure minimal disruption for the continuation of the trade and free trade that we currently enjoy, notwithstanding that there will be customs controls of one form or another post-Brexit?</p></speech>

I thank him for his attendance and for his paper which will be of much use to members.  His contribution is informed by his wealth of experience as former Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and former T&aacute;naiste.  His very valuable insight is appreciated.  His paper is interesting and challenging.  It is a very good document which gives members much to ponder and will form a core section of our final report.</p> <p>  Does Mr. Gilmore think that the commonplace optimism, which I share, that we will achieve and maintain the common travel area and the free movement of people is grounded?  Will we achieve that?  In his paper, he acknowledges previous successful diplomatic efforts and the success of Irish diplomacy in this sphere.  The issue of the free movement of people was noted in Mr. Barnier's remarks today and all the statements and pre-negotiation team documents.  Does Mr. Gilmore think we will achieve it?  The issue is critical to the area that Senator Nash and I represent and come from because it is estimated that approximately 30,000 journeys take place across the Border every day for trade, work, schools, hospitals, for kinship and so on and .  That is especially so in Senator Nash's area between Newry and Dundalk, where 3,000 trips are made per day.  That is a critical point.  I refer to travel from east to west such as travel to London.  That was discussed this morning in the context of air travel.</p> <p>  The free movement of goods is also critical.  The former Taoiseach, Mr. Ahern, gave evidence to this committee that the UK would need an increase of 20% in trade with the Commonwealth to replace 5% of its free trade with the EU, bearing in mind that the Commonwealth is already trading with Europe and has its own trading arrangements.  I am not aware of the source of the figures but they were part of Mr. Ahern's submission.</p><p>All things considered, is Mr. Gilmore hopeful that in the end a free trade arrangement will be achieved?  In other words, would Mr. Gilmore be hopeful that we could ultimately avoid tariffs and customs specifically?  How hopeful is Mr. Gilmore that that would be the ultimate result, and what does he think personally we will or will not achieve?  </p><p> The corollary of that is from Mr. Gilmore's party's own documents, which is an interesting concept of the Brexit trade adjustment fund.  The ideal would be that we have no customs or tariffs, but in the event of us not fully succeeding there, how does Mr. Gilmore see the trade adjustment fund correcting the problem?  The margins in a lot of our agricultural goods and services, specifically in beef and milk, are so small that any diminution in their value would render those exports almost unviable.  Apart from factory farming, much of the ordinary small farming would become totally unviable.  Much of the mushroom industry has already been affected, so how would Mr. Gilmore see the fund working?  The critical thing is who would finance and administer the fund.  Does Mr. Gilmore see the fund being financed in general from Europe?  If we could achieve something on that level it would have great implications for this country.</p><p> I wish Mr. Gilmore well in his relatively new international role, but given his domestic political experience he knows only too well that most of the jobs in my area are related to agriculture and food processing.  If that sector were to be further threatened those jobs would go and would be very difficult to replace.  It is therefore of critical importance that something is done for that area.</p><p> I would be grateful if Mr. Gilmore could address the movement of people, in the sense of whether or not he feels our optimism is grounded, and also the question of trade and tariffs.  I greatly appreciate Mr. Gilmore's presence here and look forward to his responses.</p></speech>

I have a couple of brief questions.  I would like to hear a little bit more of Mr. Gilmore's thinking behind the idea of a referendum.  While not opposing it, just to play devil's advocate, there is an agreement so what would happen if we said we had to have a referendum here?  Once the election was lost in the UK, the Irish economy started losing ground the next morning due to insecurity in money markets and the falling value of sterling.  If the markets perceived that this agreement is bad and we had to have a referendum which would take a minimum of six months, would it not possibly be detrimental for our economy to make a commitment for a referendum on the agreed outcome?  It would push the boat out a bit further and leave our entire economy, including cross-Border trade, wide open.  I am not opposing Mr. Gilmore's idea but I am asking him to elaborate on it.  I would like to hear the pros and cons.</p> <p>  I would also like to hear Mr. Gilmore's personal opinion, as an eminent former politician and member of the Labour Party, on the whys and why nots of Theresa May calling the general election when she did.  What role can Mr. Gilmore's sister party in the UK play?  We all know where they are at the moment, but what role can they play from the British perspective on Brexit, which may or may not be advantageous for us in future?  If Mr. Gilmore was a member of the British Labour Party where would he take it in the context of the full Brexit scenario?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1606" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1390" speakername="Gerard Craughwell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051100002#FF00300"><p>I thank Mr. Gilmore for being here today.  I am sure there are many other things he could be doing apart from sitting here, but we feel that his experience on the international stage is vital.  I will deal first and foremost with the referendum issue, if I may.  I firmly believe that Britain, a country that fought in two world wars, will not back down even if they realise that their current course of action is to their detriment.</p><p>We are seeing the stiff upper lip from all sides over there now, so unless there is a Damascus moment I cannot see them changing.  When I hear of the prospect for a referendum in Ireland I shudder.  I am not anti-democratic, but I think we have learned down through the years that referendums in this country are rarely, if ever, about the subject.  I would be interested to hear Mr. Gilmore's views on that.  </p><p>Is there a way that we can accept any agreement negotiated on our behalf by Mr. Barnier and his team without going back to the people?  How does Mr. Gilmore think that would rest with people for those who are currently in power or in opposition in the Oireachtas?  When I hear the word referendum I really have to brace myself because Mr. Gilmore knows as well as I do the problems we have had with referendums down through the years in this country.</p><p>As regards the issue of security, I also have a fear that there would be a drift towards the NATO side of things rather than the Committee on Foreign Affairs.  As an eminent person in foreign affairs himself, Mr. Gilmore has drawn attention to that, so it is clearly something he feels strongly about.  There are particular security arrangements between Britain and the Republic of Ireland.  Does Mr. Gilmore see those security arrangements being under threat in the event of Britain being isolated - for want of a better word - as a result of a hard Brexit?  A soft Brexit may bring many advantages for all sides, but a hard one will force people into their respective corners.  I wonder what Mr. Gilmore thinks that will do to security.</p><p>Mr. Gilmore mentioned the Good Friday Agreement and he was heavily involved in North-South politics during his time as T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  There is a possibility for leverage in negotiations or, at least, discussions between Britain and Ireland through the Good Friday Agreement process, including the North-South ministerial bodies.  While we cannot have bilateral negotiations, we can certainly inform the negotiations through discussions under the umbrella of the Good Friday Agreement.  I may be wrong but I would be interested in Mr. Gilmore's view of that. </p><p>I have a concern that the Good Friday Agreement may finish up as a football on the pitch when push comes to shove between the EU and the UK.  The Good Friday Agreement is sacrosanct to us here in Ireland, but it is not quite that sacrosanct in eastern Europe and places like that.  Does Mr. Gilmore see the agreement as a leverage tool for us in discussions, and perhaps turning out to be a leverage tool for both negotiating sides when it comes to trying to iron out some of the more difficult things?</p><p>We do not have a Border <i>per se</i>in this country now, or at least there is no manned Border.  None of us hopes a hard Brexit will happen and all sides seem to be committed to the notion of free travel back and forth.  In the event of a hard Brexit, however, the reorganisation of the Defence Forces in 2013 has more or less moved all our troops south of a line from Dublin to Galway.  We have very few troops left in Donegal or Dundalk, and none at all in Cavan and Monaghan.  The same applies to the customs and excise service.</p><p>Would Mr. Gilmore agree that over time there has been an erosion or loss of corporate knowledge in the management of the Border?  Should we now be war-gaming - although that may be a poor choice of words - or preparing for the likelihood of a hard Brexit?  We could always pull back from it later, but should we now revisit the question of Border management to prepare in the event of things going wrong?</p></speech>

I really appreciate the amount of work he has put into the presentation, which was clear and precise.  My father came from Rathlin Island which is off the north Antrim coast.</p><p>I have very clear memories of going through the Border as a child.  It was traumatic to see army men with guns and I would always ask why they were there.  It was very hard to understand and I would be devastated to see them return.  I go back and forth to Rathlin all the time and I will be going tonight.  What does Mr. Gilmore think the chances are of a hard Border?</p><p> Most people in the North want to remain in the EU.  What are Mr. Gilmore's thoughts on that?  It would be great if the North could remain in the EU because that is what they voted for.  Does Mr. Gilmore think the economy would benefit from a united Ireland?  Would it be a positive thing and might it happen?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1610" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1414" speakername="Mark Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051100002#GG00200"><p>Mr. Gilmore said we needed to engage more on European issues such as defence and he mentioned peace work, humanitarian aid and the promotion of soft power in EU policy.  In the Italian Senate two and a half years ago, Ms Mogherini spoke about closing down Operation Mare Nostrum and said we needed to stop picking up refugees in the Mediterranean as it only encouraged them to come.  When a vessel not fit for the open seas overturned and 800 people were drowned, however, causing a public outcry, the EU changed its position.  Many hundreds had died silently, however, not in the public gaze, and the EU has no interest in humanitarian aid.  More provocatively and dangerously, Ms Mogherini said she aimed to ensure the EU replaced the US on our own borders and that the EU would be able to intervene as the US had on our borders.  Mr. Gilmore will have seen the US intervention on Europe's borders and in the Middle East, which has had disastrous consequences.  Such an aim, by the head of European foreign policy, is not one to which we should subscribe.  I am concerned that Mr. Gilmore is saying we need to abandon neutrality in light of the UK departure.  We disagree with the EU in many areas and agree in others but the drift towards militarisation is of huge concern.  Operation Mare Nostrum was not pursued from humanitarian concerns but public pressure.</p> <p>  In respect of the Good Friday Agreement, the Taoiseach has spoken of the need for unifying Ireland and has said the EU needs to prepare for a united Ireland.  There have been statements and press coverage since January and, following a meeting of heads of Government, it was announced that it would be provided for in the same way as German reunification was provided for.  What does Mr. Gilmore believe the Government should be doing on this issue?  Members of the Ulster Defence Regiment have contacted me and others to ask me what will happen.  While this is the main aim of most political parties in the State under Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, Brexit now makes the economic argument.  There are data on how farmers who receive EU peace funding will be affected, and the people in Northern Ireland who voted to stay in the EU will be directly affected by a result which they had no control over.  Without an assembly they will not have a say over what happens in the future.  What should we do about this?  I have read a lot about the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland from 1967 to 1970 and one author pointed out that not one single civil servant in the Irish Government was engaged in the issue of Northern Ireland in the 1960s.  That was to our detriment.  Instead of engaging on the civil rights issues with Britain we entirely ignored it, hoping that nothing would happen, but we all know the consequences of this lack of policy in the area.  When former members of the Ulster Defence Regiment are asking questions the Government needs to have some form of policy on the longer-term issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-11a.1612" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Gilmore" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/WUS2017051100002#GG00400"><p>If I am not sufficiently brief, please remind me.  The Chairman asked whether there would be opportunities for trade.  One of the big rules in trade is that one should do the most trade with one's nearest neighbours.  Mr. Bertie Ahern said that to replace 5% of trade with the EU the UK would have to make up 20% of trade with the commonwealth.  I do not have a figure for the amount we would have to make up in trade with the rest of the world to make up for what we might lose in trade with the UK, but I think it would be quite substantial.  The global opportunities for us lie probably more in the area of investment than trade and the fact that Ireland will be the sole English-speaking member state of the European Union will be an attraction for investment.  The further one goes from this Continent, the more people see Europe as Europe, rather than its individual states.  Very often they do not make a distinction between who is in or out of the European Union until they have to make a decision based on whether to invest in a state with 60 million people or one with access to a market of 500 million.  There will be advantages for us in this area.</p> <p>  Senators Nash and Craughwell asked about another referendum in the UK, but I do not think there will be one.  They have made their bed in this respect and I do not see any political movement to hold another referendum.  The situation may change but it is not the case at the moment.  Another question was on the prospect of a referendum here.  We might not be the only country to ratify by referendum and the Netherlands held a referendum on the association agreement with Ukraine.  I can foresee a situation where the legal advice to the Government would be that, on balance, a referendum was not required but I can also see that option being challenged in the courts and we do not know what the outcome of that would be.  The Crotty judgment did not turn on the Single European Act itself but on the implications of the Single European Act for foreign policy.  There is probably no bigger implication for Irish foreign policy than Brexit, particularly in respect of Northern Ireland, and it greatly outweighs other changes to European treaties on which we have held referenda.  The decision to hold a referendum might be required by a decision of the Supreme Court after the withdrawal agreement is concluded and an attempt made to ratify it.</p><p>I am simply raising the question that if that is the scenario we are facing into, might it not be better now to make a conscious political decision to say that when the final agreement is made we will have a referendum on it and to have the advantage that would give in strengthening the hand of Government in the negotiation process and at keeping the Irish dimension at the centre of attention?  It is something that requires some discussion and consideration and it may well be something on which members may wish to reflect before they make a report.  I hope that answers Senator Paul Daly's question.  Nobody wants a prolonged period of uncertainty.  That is not in anybody's interest but none of us can predict what the courts may decide, nor can we predict what other states might decide.  We have seen already that the Netherlands has a trade stake in this.  We saw what happened in Belgium in respect of the Canadian free trade agreement.  Events can happen in other states that may influence it as well.</p><p> Senator Nash asked about the optimum arrangement in respect of a hard Border.  This may also address some of the points raised by Senator Black.  Were the United Kingdom to leave the Single Market and the customs union, there would have to be customs control but it might not necessarily be on the island.  If we look at the politics of this in the UK, this is largely an English-driven agenda.  It would not be necessarily a big deal not to have a customs Border between the two parts of Ireland - Northern Ireland has a population of less than 2 million - but what I can envisage is that the hard border is on the neighbouring island.  It is when one crosses the water that one would have a customs border, as we did during the period of the Troubles, for example.  When one was travelling through UK airports one went into a channel for passengers from Ireland where they checked one's passport to see who one was and so on.  They could do the same in respect of goods traffic.  Border checks do not have to take place on the actual physical Border.  They can take place when a boat docks in Stranraer, Liverpool or Holyhead or when goods are being transported through the island of the UK.  That is probably a more likely scenario.  </p><p> There is probably a Northern Ireland dimension that needs to be considered here, particularly by people in Northern Ireland who consider themselves British and part of that whole arrangement, in that they may well be faced with a form of control getting on and off the island of Britain that might not be called a Border in respect of the actual transportation between, say, Belfast and Glasgow but in reality could be.  That is probably the more likely scenario that in effect would avoid a hard Border on the island.  None of us want to go back to that.  I remember the time spent going through Aughnacloy to Donegal, for example, at different times.  That is probably the more likely scenario.</p><p> Senator O'Reilly asked if I believed we will achieve the common travel area.  I do.  The common travel area predated our membership of the European Union.  We need to think about what we mean by the common travel area.  I travelled to London yesterday on a flight from Dublin.  I got off in London City Airport.  I walked right through the airport.  There was no check of passports; the common travel area.  I came back to Dublin this morning and joined the queue to have my passport checked.  On this side of the water we need to give some thought as to what we mean by the common travel area.  We cannot claim that we have a common travel area if we insist on checking the passports of people travelling from the UK when they are not doing the same on the other side.</p><p> I am not as confident, however, in respect of the free trade arrangement.  The reality is that if the UK leaves the Single Market or the customs union, we are part of the common European Union trade market arrangement.  Because of the unique relationship between Ireland and Britain, as it is called in the documentation, that trade issue will have to be addressed.  The likely situation is that we will be expected to be part of the EU 27 common arrangement with the UK but that will give rise to particular disadvantages for Irish business in respect of its trade with the UK.  That is where the idea of the Brexit trade adjustment fund would kick in.  As for how it would operate, the EU operates many different types of funds of this kind to address particular problems that arise in the trading relationship and free movement and to address particular issues of disadvantage.  There is no reason a fund of this kind could not exist where it could not be measured by reference to the historic pattern of trade between the two islands and measured also in respect of the levels of tariffs that are applied.  It would be then an issue for different industries or sectors to respond to it.</p><p> Senator Craughwell asked about the Good Friday Agreement.  As I said earlier, it is not possible to reconcile a hard Brexit with the Good Friday Agreement.  I cannot see how the UK can fulfil its commitments to the Good Friday Agreement and have a hard Brexit.  If we consider the practical issues, for example, the agriculture sector, the work InterTrade Ireland does and areas where there is at least some level of cross-Border activity, it is all based on the presumption that the rules are common and that the Common Agricultural Policy applies both North and South.  If we have a situation where, for example, farmers in this part of Ireland are in receipt of some form of EU transfers or supports, farmers in Northern Ireland will not benefit from that.  Will Westminster replace that in some way?  What is the common issue on the agenda for North-South Ministerial Council meetings?  The same applies to other areas such as fisheries and so on where a common policy applies.  The removal of the UK from the EU removes those areas of common discussion and common policy which render cross-Border issues less relevant.</p><p> On the issue of a united Ireland raised by Senator Black, I would like to see a united Ireland.  I believe I share that aspiration probably with most people in this country.  We have to deal with that issue with a great deal of care.  It cannot be simply dealt with by way of having a Border poll or a head count.  The reality is that many people on this island identify themselves as British, and that British identity will need to be protected and guaranteed within a united Ireland context.  We have to talk about what that means in terms of the likely institutions that might be established in a united Ireland situation.  We also have to examine areas where there is harmonisation.  That discussion should take place.  We need to talk about how that would work in practice.  In particular, we need to talk with people on the island who do not share that aspiration because it needs to be an agreed situation.</p><p> I was going great until Senator Mark Daly spoke; everybody was agreeing with everybody.  I disagree with Senator Daly on several issues.  I disagree with his representation of Federica Mogherini.  She is doing an outstanding job as the European Union's High Representative on foreign policy.  If the Senator checks her record over her period in office, it has been outstanding and, I might add, exhausting.</p><p> Reference was made to humanitarian aid.  I do not agree with the suggestion the European Union is not doing enough.  It is the greatest contributor of humanitarian aid in the world.  In particular, it is the greatest contributor of humanitarian aid in dealing with the crisis in Syria.</p><p> I never said we should abandon our neutrality and reject the suggestion I did.  What I am saying is that if we want to maintain our policy of neutrality and want it to mean something, we need to ensure the foreign policy of the European Union is made at the Foreign Affairs Council rather than NATO.  My fear stems from the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union.  It is already a major part of NATO where proceedings will become far more the focus of its foreign policy agenda rather than the European Union.  Given that the majority of other member states of the European Union are also members of NATO, there is a danger European policy-making in respect of the Common Foreign and Security Policy will shift even more towards NATO than is the case.  That would not be in our interests because we are not a member.  We are a member of the Foreign Affairs Council.</p><p> Let us consider the issues that have to be addressed.  Probably the greatest issue in Europe in this area is the relationship with Russia.  It is critical that this relationship and the associated policy be addressed at the Foreign Affairs Council.  It is vital that the place where decisions are made on the relationship of the European Union with neighbouring countries, including in respect of issues in the Middle East and Africa, is the Foreign Affairs Council where Ireland has punched above its weight in the making of foreign policy, peacekeeping activity, the provision of development assistance and so on.  It is probably fair to say there has been a reluctance to engage on security and defence issues.  Again, this is due to our position on neutrality, but we will have to be more active in policy-making.  This is not about abandoning our neutrality or becoming part of a military alliance.  However, in the context of the making of security and defence policy, we will have to take a more active interest in and engage on the matter.  If we do not ensure these decisions are made where the neutral countries are present &ndash; Ireland is not the only neutral country &ndash; the reality is that the centre of gravity on these issues will shift further down the road to NATO headquarters.</p></speech>
