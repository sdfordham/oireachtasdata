We will discuss its report entitled Decent work? - The Impact of the Recession on Low Paid Workers.  I wish to apologise in advance.  I had hoped many more members would attend today's meeting, but it clashes with party meetings among all the various parties.  Some members hope to join the meeting at a later stage.  If not, this discussion will feed into later ones and will be well received by others.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-17a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Light" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013091700004#C00200"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I thank you and the committee for the invitation to appear before you.</p><p>  Mandate is one of the country's largest private sector trade unions representing 45,000 workers across retail, distribution, administration and the licence trade.  It is therefore not a surprise that our membership comprises predominately female part-time workers.  Significantly, the sector in which we are active counts for 15.5% of employment in our country.</p><p>  From an individual worker perspective, it is crucial to note that the importance and value of retail work has significantly increased largely due to the loss of employment in other traditional sectors, such as construction and manufacturing.  In many instances, the earnings derived from retail have become the principal income for households.  Therefore, it is fitting that appropriate attention is focused on the concerns of all workers in the sector and not just those with union membership.  Furthermore, decent pay, which is an issue that we wish to highlight and discuss with the committee, is more than a sectoral interest in that it touches the lives of all workers.</p><p>  Quality of employment is crucial from a societal perspective: it not only shapes how economic activity is generated and maintained, but affords significant swathes of citizens the basic human right to access and sustain decent work in order to allow them and their families to fully participate in the society in which they live.</p><p>  Since the 1970s, there has been a growing concern about the growth and prominence of what is referred to as precarious work.  Ten years ago, seven in ten workers worked at least 35 hours a week.  By the end of 2011, this had fallen to six in ten workers.  Recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, data show that the share of involuntary part-time working is also growing, with more than 135,000 workers classified as underemployed representing a staggering 46% increase on 2008 figures.  Those figures are the highest in the European Union.</p><p>  For the purpose of this discussion, precarious work arises from uncertain, unpredictable and risky provisions contained in employment situations or contracts.  Labour market security for these workers is increasingly eroded by demands for greater flexibility to hire and fire, growing use of temporary and part-time contracts, flexible working hours, downward pressure on pay, and limited investment in training and upskilling, along with an erosion of social security rights.  These workers are trapped in jobs that do not allow them to earn a living wage and, at the same time, deny them the opportunity to seek another job or even to quality for social welfare payments. </p><p>  Typically, certain groups of workers are more exposed and affected than others - women, young people and migrants are all over-represented.  It is sad that basic protections for those vulnerable workers, such as statutory minimum wage, joint labour committee, JLC, pay arrangements, the low income tax regime for low-paid workers, along with social protection, were among the first areas to come under pressure as the recession took hold.  </p><p>  Against that backdrop, it is important to note that the Irish labour market is one of the most flexible, with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, statistics showing that we are placed sixth out of 42 countries.  More significant is that the same figure shows that, from an EU perspective, only the UK is more flexible.  It is remarkable that in such an environment our social protection regime remains lean.  More than 25% of our workforce is low paid, with the national employment survey showing that workers in the wholesale and retail sectors are the second lowest paid in Ireland, with only accommodation and food service employees earning lower wages.  Recent EUROSTAT labour costs annual data show that Irish retail labour costs are 20.6% below the average of EU-15 countries, 16.2% below the average other core EU-15 countries and 37.4% below the average of other comparable small open economies. </p><p>  The economic crisis has exacerbated the problems.  Total consumer spending has fallen by more than &euro;11 billion from its peak.  It is solely this fall that has been the driving force behind the predicament in the retail sector, not labour costs and inflexibilities.  Consequently, we urge the Government to redress some of its austerity measures in the coming budget with a view to introducing confidence-building measures with the domestic economy and retail at the core.</p><p>  It is surprising that the problem of precarious work receives little study or debate.  Mandate therefore commissioned Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes to conduct a survey of our membership to fill this obvious information deficit.  A unique insight into the financial and psychological distress being endured by low paid workers in the retail sector emerged.  However, those difficulties are not unique to Mandate members and it is frightening to consider, if that level of difficulty is apparent in the unionised sector, how prevalent and deep it is elsewhere. </p><p>  The Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes research findings include the information that more than 70% have worked in retail for five years or more; fewer than 33% have full-time contracts and the rest work on average 22 hours a week over at least five days; 50% have their hours changed at least once a month; only 33% have stable working hours; more than 25% sought greater clarity or certainty on their working hours; 40% reported a fall in take-home pay over the previous 12 months, which is an average of &euro;109 a week; 60% were seeking additional hours, 50% of which had their hours cut; 40% were experiencing personal financial difficulties; 70% were less inclined to visit a doctor, which is remarkable; 75% are suffering more stress; 10% have another job; 17% are claiming a social welfare payment; 48% - nearly half - are available five days over seven; and 97% receive no shift allowance whatsoever.</p><p>  In the economic environment there are those among the employer ranks who argue for the need for total flexibility in employment contracts in order to compete in the challenging and competitive situation that exists.  It is ironic that many of the same voices made identical demands during the years of unprecedented growth. They also argue - mischievously and without foundation in our view - that such freedom will act as a catalyst in reducing unemployment levels.  The latest focus in this area is remarkable, given the promotion by some for zero-hour contracts.</p><p>  Certain sectors in an economy require part-time working and flexible working arrangements.  However, we are talking about the disproportionate extent to which the offers of such involuntary employment contracts have become the norm.  A recent International Monetary Fund review of the Irish economy pointed to the reality that were these involuntary contract workers to be factored in, effective unemployment levels would rise dramatically.  The challenge of persistent high levels of unemployment is significant without increasing the burden on the State by swelling the ranks unnecessarily with those who are involuntarily underemployed.</p><p>  A key consideration behind our recommendations, which will follow the presentation, is the need for an appropriate balance between the responsibilities of employers and the State in ensuring access to decent work.  Members should be under no illusions that greater flexibility for employers and the subsequent growth of precarious work increases the need for the State to supplement inadequate pay.</p><p>  It would be remiss not to inform the committee about how Mandate is directly intervening with reputable and willing employers in an effort to deal with the decent work agenda.  Since the demise of the social partnership model, we are increasingly involved in direct collective bargaining with individual employers.  During these negotiations we have, in the main, successfully agreed arrangements through which the established weekly earnings thresholds of our members are protected.  Moreover, they are guaranteed access to additional hours, in a structured manner when they become available.  The valuable and real contribution that agreements make to individual workers, their families and their communities cannot be overlooked.  The economic confidence and participation that follows such income certainty must also be beneficial to the domestic economy by making an obvious contribution to the immediate and sustained boost that it requires.</p><p>  It is argued by some that sufficient statutory employment measures are in place to ensure that such intervention by trade unions is not necessary for workers to ensure that they are not subject to discriminatory, victimising or downright unfair practices in the workplace.</p></speech>

I now call our first speaker, Senator David Cullinane.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-17a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1133" speakername="David Cullinane" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013091700005#D00300"><p>Go raibh maith agat.  I welcome the representatives of Mandate to this meeting and thank them for their presentation.  I attended the launch of Mandate's report in the Oireachtas audiovisual room eight or nine months ago and have read it a number of times since.  I ask the representatives to outline how the current recession and austerity policies are impacting on the people that Mandate represents.  The speakers gave us a very good overview but I ask them to tease it out a bit more.  They mentioned the changes to the JLC system.  Some trade unionists believe that some aspects of the reform proposals are quite good and I agree that there are positive elements.  However, I am concerned about the proposals regarding the Sunday premium payment.  If what the Government proposes is implemented, it will negatively impact on low-income workers in particular.  What is the difference between the protections currently in place, that is, the levels of Sunday premium payments that workers currently enjoy and what is being proposed?  What will the difference be and how will the changes affect low-income workers?</p><p>  I also wish to raise the issue of zero hour contracts, which are becoming more common here.  Such contracts are very prevalent in the UK and they are a cause of great concern.  They are underpinned by employer bodies and governments who talk about flexibility.  Nobody is against the principle of flexibility but we have seen unscrupulous employers exploit workers on zero hour contracts, especially those workers who are not in trade unions.  If such workers do not comply with the wishes of their employer, if they join a trade union or even talk about doing so, their hours are reduced.  Workers have been bullied in the UK.  Do we have sufficient protections in this State to protect workers against that type of exploitation, harassment and bullying if zero hour contracts become more prevalent?  How prevalent are such contracts here?  They seem to be on the increase in the health sector, particularly among care workers.  In terms of the people represented by Mandate, how prevalent are such contracts and what concerns does the union have about them?</p><p>  The representatives spoke about the need for collective bargaining and trade union recognition, with which I agree.  We are in the year of the 100th anniversary of the Lock-out and this should have been the year when we put in place proper collective bargaining rights.  What is the view of Mandate on the Government's commitments in this regard?  The Government has given a very loose commitment to some form of collective bargaining.  Has Mandate been given any indication as to what shape that will take?  Has the union any concerns in this regard and what is its view on the best way to introduce collective bargaining rights?  </p><p>  On the issue of the reform of employment rights bodies, we are now looking at the creation of a single, independent body that will adjudicate on complaints made by workers.  There are many good aspects to this reform but does Mandate have any concerns about what is being proposed with regard to the new employment rights bodies?  </p><p>  My final question draws all of the previous points together.  Mandate's figures show how difficult life is for retail sector workers.  Less than 33% have full-time contracts while the rest have worked an average of 22 hours per week over the last five years, with 50% of them experiencing a change to their hours.  One of the problems in this economy now is that employers can simply disregard employment rights.  They can choose not to give people what they are entitled to, be it holiday pay, minimum hourly rates of pay and so forth because the employment rights legislation we have is not robust enough.  There are not enough sanctions in place for non-compliant employers.  Does Mandate share that concern?  If so, what improvements in the sanctions against those unscrupulous employers who disregard employment rights would the union like to see introduced?  Such employers exploit workers because they believe they can get away with it and that the worst that can happen to them is that they will have to appear before an employment appeals tribunal and pay the money owed.  Are there sufficient sanctions to deter employers from behaving in such a fashion?  It must be said that I am referring to a minority of employers - the majority do not behave in that way.  What is Mandate's view on this issue?  Has Mandate made any submissions regarding improvements to legislation on foot of what the Government is considering in terms of the reform of employment rights bodies?  What is Mandate's analysis of the situation and what, if any, proposals has it put forward?</p></speech>

He raised an extensive range of issues, all of which I will attempt to address because they are very important in their own right, in the context of the broad issue being discussed here today, namely, decent work.</p><p>  To address the last question first, Mandate is very active in making submissions in respect of all of the live issues before the current Government.  We do so in our own right and also under the auspices of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  I have with me, for example, the detailed submission that Congress made to the Minister in March of this year on the issue of collective bargaining.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-17a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013091700007#F00200"><p>I thank Mr. Light.  I believe that covers most questions.  I call Senator Quinn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-17a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1145" speakername="Feargal Quinn" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013091700007#F00300"><p>It is good to meet Mr. Light again.  I must explain to everybody that Mr. Light and I sat on opposite sides of the table for many years and always got on fairly well together.  I believe we managed on that basis.  I was pleased with the way he concluded his presentation, talking about the need to lift consumer confidence in spending into the domestic economy.  That reminds me that he and his colleagues in Mandate recognise there is a need to create consumer confidence.  If we do not have people spending it is unlikely we will be able to create jobs.</p><p>  My query to Mr. Light concerns how, in regard to flexibility, we can balance the difference between the importance of having a job and the importance of the rate of pay.  It would appear that if a retailer is going to succeed he or she must balance the books.  To do that the books must ensure that ultimately there is a profit.  In the 50 years I have been in business a number of chains and shops have disappeared from the high street.  In recent years, as one travels throughout the country one sees streets that have so many empty shops, which is a shame.  Yet it is not merely a question of increasing consumer confidence in spending but also about being able to balance the books.  How does Mr. Light reach a decision in that respect in pursuing benefits for his own members?  Is it better to have somebody with a full-time job, or somebody with higher pay?  The higher the pay the fewer jobs there will be.  I am not sure how long that can last or how he can balance the books on that basis, and would like to hear his view.  It seems to me a very large number of jobs no longer exist.  When I started in business there were always young people to wheel one's trolley out to the car and there were bag-packers at every check-out in the supermarket.  When one went to buy petrol there was always someone to fill the tank.  However, when the rates went higher those jobs no longer existed.  Is it better to have somebody in a low-paid job than to have no work?  I am not sure how one strikes that balance.</p><p>  Clearly, there are other areas to be considered.  Mr. Light mentioned the unemployed, and our rate being the highest in Europe, a point I did not quite understand.  He mentioned that recent CSO data show that the share of involuntary part-time working is also growing, with more than 135,000 workers classified as "underemployed", which represents a "staggering" 46% increase on the 2008 figures, and a figure that is also the highest in the EU.  Mr. Light might explain to me exactly how we might solve that.</p><p>  I have only one other point to make on what was stated, in regard to the refundable tax credit for low-paid workers.  Will Mr. Light look again at that so that I can understand the point he is making?  Is there something we can do on that basis?</p><p>  I am introducing a Bill next week that I hope will solve the problem of upward-only rent reviews for retailers.  Does Mr. Light have any comment on this area?  It threatens a very large number of retail and commercial businesses.  Before 2008, rent reviews were upward-only and they have been maintained.  In consultation with my legal advisers I believe we have found a solution.  We will introduce it next week and will seek the support of everyone in that respect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-17a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Light" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013091700007#F00400"><p>I thank Senator Quinn for that brief history.  It was productive for us to be able to do business together as a worker representative body in a very successful and indigenous retail business in Ireland.  In many ways that epitomised what is good about what we are seeking here, which we hope will become the norm within the retail grocery business and on a broader footing across the employment scene in Ireland.  We agreed on many points during these years and were very clearly tuned in to the needs of business but we could also prove when we came to the table that we had a realistic mindset in respect of everybody's needs.  In many ways we were not greedy and were prepared to take whatever we needed to take out of the business to justify our participation.  That can be achieved and in many ways it is what we are talking about today.</p><p> I will take the Senator's last point first before coming back to what he spoke about in respect of balancing the books.  Over the past seven years we have become more proactively engaged, in very difficult circumstances, working with certain businesses since the impact of the recession has hit.  Some very difficult decisions have had to be taken by our members under our guidance.  I am of the view that those businesses will come out of the recession stronger and better for having such an approach, compared to those businesses that reduced everything to the bare minimum of statutory entitlement.  Nobody knows better than Senator Quinn that ultimately, when there is a workforce that is regarded properly and is in tune with the needs of the business, it is more likely to be a successful business.  The opposite is also the case.  When people come to work every day feeling it is a drudge and that they are being exploited, without seeing any real tangible benefit for the fruits of their labour at the end of the week, what one will get from them is only a basic involvement in the business, nothing more.  Every successful business needs more than that to be successful.</p><p>  We have been very proactive on the rents issue in appropriate circumstances and working with certain employers, aligning ourselves to certain campaigns where we believed the situation in which some businesses found themselves was clearly unfair, given the extortionate rents and rates that were being applied, particularly within the context of upward-only reviews.  Some work has been done on that in recent times, which must be welcomed.  A greater degree of common sense is being applied to the whole area of rents, as opposed to rates.  Rates are very much within the gift of the Government and the local authorities and they know what needs to be done.  Some public representatives were very much to the fore in saying it was ridiculous to have increasing rents applied to businesses that were in decline.  At the same time, only last week I read that certain local authorities are raising their rates in respect of those same businesses.  There are double standards here.  We must all get real and focus on the battle.  The price is huge but it will benefit all of us.  </p><p>  How do we balance the books?  It is the classic scenario - how far does one go and when does a job become not worth having?  That is the key question, the core of what Senator Quinn has posed.  All of us around this table have been around long enough to know and accept the basic principle that being at work should be a route out of poverty.  However, on an increasing basis, having a job is not proving to be such.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-17a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1078" speakername="Damien English" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013091700008#G00200"><p>To clarify, when Mr. Light spoke about a company working with 80% part-time workers, did he mean that extra staff are taken on for part-time hours rather than full hours being given to other staff?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-17a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Light" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013091700008#G00300"><p>That is what happens.  While it is an unintended consequence, as Senator Quinn would be aware this would be a regular feature within the retail sector where people are relatively low paid.  The sector also has incremental pay scales based on service.  Those scales and progress through them is closely monitored and when somebody gets to a particular point, the hours are maxed out at the contractual entitlement and somebody else is brought in.  This is something we are working on.  Banded contracts and the arrangement whereby established hours are protected and future hours, when available, are guaranteed are ways of eradicating this practice by and large.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-17a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013091700008#G00400"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh &aacute;r gcuairteoir&iacute; anseo inniu.  This is an important issue and it is a pity that because some parties are having their think-ins today there are not more members here.  Ireland is an outlier with regard to under-employment, which is causing so much damage in society.  Men, women and children are in poverty as a result of under-employment and the impact is felt right throughout society.  We need to focus on this issue.  The idea of a zero hour contract is a retrograde step.  It reminds me of the 1920s and 1930s when men and women would go to a market square or to the docks and hope an employer would pick them for the day.  If they were unlucky, they would return home without a wage.  It is incredible to think we are going down that route with regard to employment.</p><p>  The question asked about where the balance lies was a good one.  For me, a person is entitled at least to a minimum standard of living.  This minimum standard includes the right to shelter, education, health, food and clothing for children and the opportunity to raise one's family properly outside of poverty.  This should be the yardstick or base.  There is no doubt that if we keep pushing wages down, this will enable another group of businesses to function.  However, we must have a floor.  </p><p>  One of the problems with under-employment is that it creates a situation where we have what is like a three-card trick.  We look at employment figures and believe the situation is improving, but even the IMF figures showed that due to the level of under-employment, real employment is far lower.  People fall off the social welfare cliff when they enter this area.  I know of people who if they work an extra hour on a Thursday will lose two full days of entitlements to social welfare benefits and a gamut of other welfare supports.  Other sectors of society, such as the legal profession and other professions are very well regulated and have protected wage structures.  </p><p>  Mr. Light touched on the issue of the zero hour contract, but would it be possible for him to explain to the committee how it works in practice for an employee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-17a.24" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Gerry Light" time="14:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013091700009#H00200"><p>It is very clear in the current legislation.  It is a fairly simplistic model and the provisions contained in the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 are not satisfactory.  If a worker makes himself or herself available for work and that work is not made available, there is a very small compensation of 25% of the minimum 15 hours for which the worker must make himself or herself available.  That corresponds to three or four hours, which is minuscule.  I would say that the application of the legislation is largely not practised outside of the unionised sector.  Within the unionised sector, we are now making advances in the other direction entirely, which is the banded contract arrangements that we are negotiating, even in the teeth of the recession, with reputable and willing employers.  That shows that it can be done.  I will go back to Senator Quinn's question earlier.  If there is a will to engage, both sides can sit down and figure out where costs can be cut.</p><p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n made an important point, which we highlighted in our presentation, in referring to the basic standards that are needed for somebody to participate properly in society.  Whatever is required to allow that should be the basic return.  If a business cannot provide that return to its employees, we have to ask whether it is worthwhile offering those jobs and whether we should put our efforts into different areas.</p><p>  We need to beef up the legislation on zero hours contracts.  We would like it to follow our achievements in the area of banded contracts.  We would like to see greater compensation awarded to the worker.  The current scenario is that I must make myself available, so I cannot do other things such as look for that second job because I am effectively on call.  It interferes with some of the very complex social welfare arrangements that we currently have in place.  We need to ensure that the compensation is greater.  Greater onus must be placed on the employer to ensure that adequate notice is given to employees of the extent to which they are required to make themselves available.  Running a business can be complex at times, but it is not rocket science, particularly when it comes down to rostering staff.  Even in the current difficult times in which we live, staffing requirements can be determined to a fairly exact degree.  We have passed that by and many employers now figure out their staffing requirements first and then figure out how to reduce those staffing costs even further, with a view to increasing or maintaining the profitability they may have had two or three years ago.  Common sense tells us that such a degree of profitability is not attainable any more, but profitability is still attainable if we are all realistic and generous towards each other and figure out what we need to take out.</p><p>  We also need to have a provision in the zero hours legislation whereby there is an obligation on the employer, after a period of time, to sit down with a worker to figure out the hours secured over a period of time and put them into a contract of employment as a minimum number of hours.  Increasing the threshold from 15 hours would also help significantly.</p><p>  A point was made about the intricacies and complications that arise in respect of the interface with the social welfare system.  This is a major issue.  Because of those intricacies, the relevant provisions are not apparent or known to many, not least to the individuals who suffer when they are thrown into those circumstances.  There are five broad areas in the report, but I would like to put one of these on the record.  I refer to the treatment of flexible workers under the social welfare system.  Flexible workers cannot meet the substantial loss criteria. Under-employment of flexible workers is not recognised in the current social welfare code, which means that we still discount work on the basis of days lost and not hours.  If I lose hours, these are still calculated on the basis of days under the current social welfare code and in the legislation.  It is impossible for precarious workers to establish normal patterns of work, which is often a requirement for social welfare, as they do not have normal patterns of work.  Our presentation has shown how much these patterns fluctuate from one week to the next.  In certain circumstances, flexible workers cannot qualify for systematic short-term work options.  That is a plethora of different requirements, depending on whether it is systematic short-term work, permanent or temporary work and so on.  This entire area must be examined and we must ensure that we are not making a difficult situation worse for these precarious workers, because if we do that we are doubling the burden.  I made that point during the presentation.</p><p>  One of the main provisions for the support of low-paid workers is family income supplement.  Due to the way it is set out at the moment and due to the minimum hours threshold - 19 hours - many precarious workers cannot qualify.  Due to the fluctuating nature of their work, their circumstances change from one week to the next.  One week they can be above the ceiling and the next week they can be below it.  Many employers are reluctant to sign off on family income supplement forms as well.  Notwithstanding the fact that the workers are at the threshold, the employers cannot be certain that their employees will be at the threshold the following week.</p><p>  The interface of the social welfare code with working hours is probably worth an entire committee meeting in itself, but-----</p></speech>

We have a social welfare system designed for the early part of the 20th century.  I met the Minister during the summer and I made that point to her.  People are afraid to sign off because it takes so long to sign back on.  Deputy Lawlor kicked off the ball on this last year and we need to do something about it.  A debate has started about the income trap, which Mr. Light described well.  The Minister spoke about it at lunchtime on the radio, but she just said the Government would take care of it.  We have much work to do to enable the implementation of Mr. Light's suggestions, which he highlighted so well in his response.</p><p>  I would not like this committee to give the impression that every employer is trying to get the last drop of profit and cut hours.  Many small employers have not even paid themselves over the last few years.  They have tried to keep the door open and they have not had support from banks or others.  In trying to keep their workers paid, they often have not paid themselves.  They are not profiteering; they are trying to keep the door open.  Unfortunately, many of them are not able to do that and then they find themselves subject to a social welfare system that does not cater for them.  I would not like the wrong impression to go out.  There are undoubtedly multinational employers that are doing what Mr. Light is describing, but the last three years for most SMEs have been about keeping the door open and trying to keep people in employment, often at a cost to themselves.</p></speech>

The Mandate magazine <i>Shopfloor</i> is a very good magazine.  Mandate has the power to bring about change.  Someone raised the point when I was coming in to this meeting about how to create awareness.  As one of the better-organised unions, Mandate should be promoting the good employers and the businesses that are trying to give a decent wage and fair employment such that when I am spending the few euro I have I know that if I go into business X those running it are doing everything in their power to try to support employment, but if I go to business Y I know those running it are enforcing contracts on them.  I can make the choice but if I have the knowledge I would be better able to make it.</p></speech>

I reiterate what I said earlier.  We are in no way suggesting that all employers are bogus.  Probably more than anyone else we are working with the employers who have struggled in recent years and we are getting their employees to work with them through our guidance to ensure that they are in a better place if and when we come out of this recession.  We are acutely aware of that and therefore we do not tar everyone with the one brush.  We are only too glad to promote the cause of good employers.</p><p>  I thank Deputy Calleary for his kind comments about our <i>Shopfloor</i> magazine.  A good deal of hard work goes into it and it is good to see that recognised.  We launched a key initiative at the Irish Congress of Trade Unions biennial conference in Belfast this year and we promoted it heavily there.  It is called our Fair Shop campaign.  The details are on our website if committee members wish to examine them.  Basically, the Fair Shop campaign does what Deputy Calleary suggested, that is, it recognises and applauds employment that works with workers and the representative bodies in a proactive way to ensure the difficulties that we are all encountering as we travel through this recession are lessened to the greatest extent possible or as much as we can.  We believe it is an important initiative.  Even if we do not go beyond the trade union family, some 800,000 workers are still affiliated to trade unions on this island.  It is the biggest civil society organisation on the island.  We believe it is most important but it is important beyond that family as well.</p><p>  The concepts of fairness and fair play should be inherent in us all.  We should not do a bad turn to lose the chance of doing a good turn for anyone.  The concept of Fair Shop is there and we are only too pleased to promote it.  We have had local events and we plan to have more local events.  This may be of interest to some of the Deputies and Senators in the committee.  We had the national launch but we plan to have local launches of the Fair Shop concept and if any committee members are interested to know when and where they will take place, we would be pleased to let them know and invite them along.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, Mr. Light, thank you very much for your presentation today.  My apologies that some members are not here, but the work will be shared among them.</p><p>  I have a question of clarification.  In the list of recommendations or areas on which you want us to focus reference was made to the income trap and a temporary reduction in the number of working hours required to qualify for the family income supplement.  Why are you saying "temporary" and how temporary do you mean?</p></speech>

I suppose it should be long enough to have some kind of meaningful impact.  We maintain it should be brought down to address some of the concerns and the obvious reasons.  We do not know and we are not being very prescriptive but it should be something lengthy enough to have a meaningful impact and not simply for the sake of doing it.  Am I picking up your question wrongly?</p></speech>

The argument I got was that we need to make a permanent reduction in the hours required, but you are saying there should be a temporary reduction.  Do you mean it should be for a couple of years until we get back to the better times?</p></speech>

I think so.  We should apply that level of thinking to many issues before us.  No more than around this issue, what we should be doing is assessing the situation as we find it to give ourselves the opportunity, hopefully, sooner rather than later, as we work our way out of this recession, to question whether it is still appropriate to retain that measure, whether we should build on it or go back to where we came from.  I have no wish to fool anyone about this.  Given the stark circumstances that present to precarious workers as we sit here today I believe we will be building on what we have as opposed to moving back on a temporary basis.  What we need is permanent meaningful movement in respect of a whole swathe of different areas that affect the daily lives of precarious workers and their families.</p></speech>

Based on the EUROSTAT labour costs report from 2011 Irish labour costs in the wholesale and retail sector are now substantially below those of most other EU 15 countries and well below average as well.  Irish labour costs are 20.6% below the average of the other EU 15 countries, 26.2% below the average of other core EU 15 countries, that is, excluding the countries in the bailout, and 37.4% below the average of other small open economies, that is, economies with a similar economic structure to Ireland based on a small domestic market reliant on the export sector.</p><p>  The Chairman raised a point about the family income supplement.  Mr. Light has dealt with the temporary measure very well but I will add to his comments.  This measure should be targeted primarily at precarious workers.  The idea is to lower the threshold and make it available only to workers who have attempted to access additional hours but who have had their hours reduced.  Our report shows that number to be rather significant at this stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-17a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Gibney" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013091700010#J01000"><p>I will reiterate a little of what Mr. Forbes has said.  It would be good to put on the record where the balance lies as well.  If an employer pays at a high rate he will not be able to employ as many people.  However, if everyone keeps cutting wages there is less money for people to spend in the local shops and the economy.  In the past 18 months Mandate has negotiated wage increases for approximately 70% of our members and this has put approximately &euro;10 million in the back pockets of low-paid workers, who spend all their money in the local economy.  It is important to put that on the record as well.</p><p>  On the zero hours issue I was pleased to hear Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n point out that these are real people.  Sometimes we produce reports and discuss statistics and numbers and we forget that these are real low-paid workers in difficult situations.  In the past six months or so I have met with many non-union workers and talked to them.  They are not necessarily getting zero hour contracts but they are getting low hour contracts.  I offer one example.  The individual is on a ten-hour contract but he had been working for between 40 and 50 hours for the past two years.  Then, in February he made a health and safety complaint about a fire door being locked.  Subsequently, he was brought down to his contractual ten hours contract.  He was obviously intimidated and now he is behaving very reasonably for the employer but he will not put his head above the parapet.  Earlier, Mr. Light referred to the breaches of legislation and that out of all the inspections which took place, some 55% of retailers have been in breach of some form of legislation.  This individual and his situation does not fall into that bracket because no breach of law occurred but he has been intimidated into not complaining about his rights of employment.  We do not have a collective agreement with this particular employment but, to echo the comments of Mr. Light, that is why collective bargaining rights are altogether necessary in today's economic climate, especially with levels of precarious employment on the increase.</p><p>  I have a little experience of working with the trade union movement in Australia, where they have proper collective bargaining rights.  They also have right of entry rights.  This means that within 24 hours I can walk into any employment anywhere in that country and inspect for health and safety breaches or other employment breaches.  If that type of legislation was brought into Ireland it would sort out a good deal of this trouble.  If we are really going to make an impact on the suggestions or make an impact to try to improve the lives of the real people who are at the bottom of these cases then the suggestions in the document are excellent but putting in place effective collective bargaining rights should be a priority as well.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss with the committee the importance of the retention of the 9% VAT rate in creating and maintaining jobs in the tourism and restaurant sectors.  Following the presentation, which I will keep brief, we are happy to take questions.  We made a formal pre-budget submission to the Department of Finance last week.  We have a greater sense of clarity on the emerging issues and priorities for business in advance of budget 2014.</p><p>  To provide some context, it will be useful for me to set out what the Restaurants Association of Ireland is picking up from the business community and our 1,000 members on the performance of the economy over the first half of the year and the issues arising as a result.  Restaurants have to deal with, on average, 25 bodies and agencies in the day-to-day running of their businesses.  It is an industry that has not been given a helping hand by local authorities and our SMEs contribute a massive 28% to the total income of local authorities.  Restaurants can be seen as engine rooms of local economies in small towns and villages around Ireland.</p><p>  Irish tourism suffered a major setback with the onset of the global recession in 2008.  In the case of Ireland, the severity of the decline in demand for what we have to offer was all the more marked due to an already significant loss of competitiveness during the Celtic tiger boom years.  Between 2008 and 2010, overseas tourism to Ireland slumped by over 20% in volume and value, equating to a loss of 1.8 million visitors and over &euro;1 billion in revenue each year.  As a consequence, 50,000 jobs were lost in the tourism sector.  We have been fighting to regain those jobs lost in the hospitality sector in the past three years.</p><p>  A reduction in the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9% was a key measure introduced to accelerate recovery in tourism through the Government's jobs initiative of May 2011.  The Minister for Finance recognised that, "much economic activity within the tourism industry is highly intensive in its use of labour, particularly true of hotels and restaurants, recreation and entertainment".  The Minister further stated that, "tourism can make a very substantial contribution to our economic recovery and to the creation of employment in all parts of our country".  We are asking the Minister to recall these facts when considering budget 2014.</p><p>  The reduction in the VAT rate provided a much-needed boost to help restore competitiveness and a return to growth in demand, as predicted by the Minister.  The sharp decline was arrested in 2011, with an increase in overseas visitors for the first time in four years.  This modest recovery was maintained in 2012 and figures are already showing signs of improvement, thanks to The Gathering.  More encouragingly, results for the early part of this year suggest that revenue growth is outpacing volume growth - a major turnaround, given the economic and trading conditions in Ireland's main source tourism markets.</p><p>  The Restaurants Association of Ireland welcomed the Government's jobs initiative in 2011 with open arms.  It is evident that the changes to the VAT and PRSI rate regimes complemented each other in having a favourable impact on both prices and employment.  In the hospitality sector in the past 18 months we have created 9,000 jobs at a time when job losses are dominant in other industries.  Tourism has seen the largest growth in employment in the last number of years, coming second only to agriculture.  However, it is also clear that the recovery is fragile and sustainable growth is not yet assured.  The restaurant industry is starting to see a three-tier recovery across the country.  There is now a three-speed economy.  In Dublin city centre in the vicinity of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, restaurants are doing well, paying their bills and we are even beginning to see growth and new openings.  Unfortunately a different picture is painted around the country.  Urban areas around Ireland are also busy, but only on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights.  Further into the country we see restaurants and cafes on life support.  The reduction in the VAT rate to 9% has been a lifeline for them with rising costs facing SMEs such as the price of food, excise duty increases, rates, regulatory burdens.  If the VAT rate is increased it will tip these businesses over the edge in every corner of the country.  For these reasons it is imperative that the VAT and PRSI sections of the jobs initiative are retained.</p><p>  Even before allowing for the stimulus effects of the 9% VAT rate on tourist spending and employment, it looks like the budgetary cost of the measure as it applies to tourism-related products and services has been approximately &euro;90 million.  I have provided a copy of the Deloitte report to members.  The Irish tourism industry confederation and F&aacute;ilte Ireland reports in August of this year are based on CSO figures which confirm the figure of &euro;90 million.  This contrasts sharply with the &euro;350 million estimate published at the time the jobs initiative package was first announced in 2011.  When the resultant boost to employment is accounted for, the cost to the Exchequer is further reduced and may in fact become a net gain.</p><p>  Common sense, international experience and anecdotal evidence, including a recently published Department of Finance paper, strongly support the argument that the VAT cut has been passed on to consumers.  Our sector has fully complied with the measure and passed on the savings to the consumer.  This has happened at the same time as visitors' perceptions of value-for-money in Ireland have improved substantially and despite the fact that key input costs have been steadily rising.</p><p>  We are a labour-intensive industry with the ability to employ people quickly.  We are encouraged by sentiments expressed by politicians the length and breadth of the country who want to continue to see jobs being created in their local towns and cities.  Local authorities in 12 counties have passed motions and a further 14 are due to ratify motions in the next two weeks supporting the retention of the VAT rate at 9%.  We have received great support from restaurateurs who realise that the increase of the VAT rate would mean job losses, price increases and closure for many.  We are asking the Minister to retain the 9% VAT rate so we can all work as a collective to create even more jobs and employment opportunities than those that have already been created since July 2011.</p></speech>

However, we failed at the first hurdle, purely because the criteria relate to food processing, as opposed to restaurant and hospitality skills.  Perhaps the committee might examine that issue with a view to placing hospitality to the forefront of activation efforts.  Part of the difficulty is that F&Aacute;S which has responsibility for training is being subsumed into SOLAS, the latter having no major remit in the area of hospitality.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland, on the other hand, which has the remit for hospitality, is pulling out of the training side in certain areas and reducing its budgets accordingly.  That shortfall must be addressed.  As I said, there are positions available in the sector.  Today, in fact, there are some 300 chef training positions advertised on<i> irishjobs.ie</i> and other websites.  As it takes four years to train a chef, there is an urgency attached to all of this.</p></speech>

Their proposal that the VAT rate of 9% be retained is really a no-brainer.  Employment in the sector is up 10,000, which is not an achievement many sectors can claim in the past two years.  Likewise, tourism numbers are up.  There is definite and recorded feedback that the proposition we are offering as a tourism destination is better value than it was in 2010.  We should bear in mind that this proposal does not require additional moneys to be found.  The levy on private pensions introduced in the special budget in 2011 is specifically to pay for the VAT reduction.  Given the success of the initiative in creating and sustaining employment, there should not be any doubt about its retention.  In that context, the committee should send a strong message of support for the retention of the 9% rate to the Minister for Finance.</p><p>  Mr. Cummins makes a very strong point on the shortfall in training provision for the hospitality sector.  CERT had a strong role in this regard in the 1980s, but since it was subsumed into F&aacute;ilte Ireland the training element seems to have gone skew-ways.  There must be a revival of the strong role previously played by CERT, which might well be by way of the Restaurants Association of Ireland getting into the training business.  Whatever the format, support must be given.  We cannot set out our stall and declare tourism as a job creation focus, which it certainly can be, without putting the appropriate training programmes in place to ensure the necessary quality.  The figures show that the 9% rate has worked and we should support its retention.  The delegates should note, however, that the proximity of this institution to the restaurants of Dublin 2 has had no bearing on their resurgence in recent years.</p></speech>

One of the difficulties for the hospitality sector is that its offering is often considered a luxury product which may be more sensitive to price increases.  An increase in VAT, therefore, is likely to have an even greater impact than would be the case in other sectors.  I have a dislike for VAT in general because it is a regressive tax which does not involve a strong linkage between the charge levied and ability to pay.  We have seen VAT rates increase steadily since 2001.  In the restaurant industry, a particularly labour intensive industry, it is effectively a tax on labour.</p><p>  I strongly agree with Mr. Cummins's point on the great disparity between urban and rural in the context of the overall performance of the sector.  In County Meath, for example, restaurants served as a weather vane of the crash, being some of the first businesses to topple when the economy declined.  They continue throughout the country to struggle.  Another factor hitting restaurants hard is the payment of rates.  My view is that rates should also be tied to income or ability to pay.  It seems very unfair that businesses which are not even making a profit are being hit to the same extent as their profitable counterparts.</p><p>  I was impressed by Mr. Cummins's proposal of a linkage with food tourism.  There is ongoing expansion of the level of trade and employment in the agrifood sector.  Food tourism fits very closely with the idea of Ireland as a food island, both in an export sense and in terms of tourism.  There is certainly an opportunity in that regard.</p><p>  Mr. Cummins apportions a specific figure to jobs created as a consequence of the reduction in VAT.  Are all of these jobs directly related to the VAT decrease or have other initiatives taken by the Government to support tourism come into play?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-17a.53" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Adrian Cummins" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2013091700013#M00100"><p>The figures from which we are taking our soundings come from the CSO and from two reports that were compiled on the basis of the latter's figures.  Both reports analysed the increase in employment in the tourism sector in the context of accommodation and food.  One cannot separate the PRSI element from the VAT rate and both are linked within the entire job stimulus package.  To answer the question, therefore, it is very difficult to provide exact figures regarding how many jobs were created as a result of either the VAT change or the PRSI reduction.  However, both are of equal importance to our sector.</p><p>  It is important to point out that when a tourist enters the country - the measure under discussion relates to tourism - and stays here for seven days, there is one thing which he or she must do, namely, eat.  He or she will eat on approximately 21 occasions - that is, breakfast, lunch and dinner - during that week.  Our industry is labour intensive and my colleagues will inform the committee as to the number of employees they have on their books.  We are a fast-track employment sector so we can create 15 to 20 jobs in a small business fairly rapidly.  It is a labour-intensive sector.</p></speech>

In light of the current level of unemployment, it is crazy that there has been absolutely no movement in respect of this issue.  The industry will suffer greatly in three to four years from now as a result of a lack of suitably-qualified people.  We often discuss the skills-jobs mismatch, particularly in the context of the high-tech industries.  If and, hopefully, when the restaurant industry gets going again, we may be obliged to bring in chefs from other countries to fill vacancies because people here will not possess the necessary skills.</p></speech>

We will invite such representatives to come before us in the next couple of weeks because it is crazy that a potential 1,000 work and training placements are not being filled.  That is just not on and we cannot accept it.  I presume that any action taken in respect of this matter would be cost-neutral in nature because most of the people who would be taken on would come off the live register.</p></speech>

I know something about the tourism business because my father ran Red Island holiday camp in Skerries.  In those days there was, certainly at a higher level, a degree of snobbery in respect of the profession.  Those to whom I refer did not really want people to come here to stay in a holiday camp.  Rather, they wanted them to come here to hunt, shoot and play golf.  Does that type of snobbery still exist?  Are there still barriers in the context of attracting certain types of tourists?  Are there any bureaucratic barriers which our guests would like to see removed?</p><p>  Deputy Calleary stated that the move in respect of VAT was a no-brainer.  In the past I argued that a reduction in the percentage of VAT would give rise to a corresponding increase in the moneys accruing to the Government.  The move to reduce the rate of VAT was a real win-win situation.  I cannot believe that the Government is considering increasing the VAT on restaurants.  It should be considering introducing a second reduction in order to provide the industry with another boost.  The previous reduction had a tremendous impact.</p><p>  I was jolted by what was said with regard to the lack of chefs, etc.  What action can we take to solve this problem?  Mr. Cummins explained the position but I would have thought that it would be very easy for people to gain entry to the profession.  I was chairman of the leaving certificate applied programme for five years.  That programme identifies talents, skills, abilities and levels of intelligence among students which are not necessarily measured by the mainstream leaving certificate.  We tried to encourage those who pursued the leaving certificate applied to develop the talents, skills and abilities to which I refer.  In that context, people who had sat at the back of the classroom up to junior certificate and who were not considered to be great academically turned out to be brilliant chefs, orators and so on.  At the end of each year we visited the various schools which run the leaving certificate applied and were entertained by and treated to the cooking of the students.  One could see that some of the students - all of whom were 17 or 18 years of age - had suddenly discovered that they possessed abilities which had not previously been identified.  Is there some way we can encourage more people to enter the profession?  As stated, I am shocked by the fact that there are vacancies in this area.  There are vacancies in the information and communications technology sector which we cannot fill other than by taking on people from abroad.  As Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n noted and as a result of the fact that we have not encouraged people here to develop the necessary skills, we may also be obliged to fill vacancies in the tourism and restaurant sector by importing individuals from abroad.  What should we do?  Is there a need to increase investment in education, particularly at third level, to deal with this problem?</p></speech>

I represent Galway West, which includes Galway city, Connemara, the Aran Islands, Inishbofin and other offshore islands.  The latter are all very much reliant on and have benefited from the tourism industry.  They also benefited from the reduction in VAT.  There is no doubt that the latter has worked, particularly as the numbers coming here from abroad have increased.  I support the retention of the reduction and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, is on record as indicating his support for it.  Heretofore, we would have been given a figure of &euro;360 million in respect of this matter whereas the report with which we have been presented refers to a sum of &euro;90 million.  I do not know for how long the report has been available but I only saw it today.  There is a pretty big difference between &euro;90 million and &euro;360 million.  I will be obliged to examine this matter closely in order to identify the origin of that difference.</p><p>  As Deputy Calleary indicated, the original jobs initiative involved a levy on private pensions.  In order to retain that source of funding, said levy would also have to be retained.  The issue of private pensions is one which gives rise to its own concerns.  Obviously, this debate will be ongoing for some time but I firmly believe that the VAT reduction has had a very positive impact and I support its retention.  We have expressed that sentiment to the Minister.  We look forward to pursuing the issue relating to chefs with officials from the Department at one of our forthcoming meetings.</p></speech>

The jobs stimulus package was for tourism.  However, newspapers, hairdressers, cinemas and entertainment venues also benefited from the reduction to 9%.  The tourism element of the overall amount of &euro;350 million is &euro;90 million.  In media bulletins earlier today the Minister for Social Protection indicated that 7,000 jobs equates to savings of between &euro;90 million and &euro;93 million.  We rounded up that figure.  The 9,000 new jobs we created in the tourism industry are worth &euro;123 million in cost-----</p></speech>

That is a something to which consideration should be given in the context of retaining the reduction.  There is no doubt that the reduction to 9% has benefited every part of the tourism economy.  I visited Inishbofin two or three weeks ago and I discovered that from a tourism point of view, it has had one of its best summers ever.  The island seems to be doing well in the context of tourism promotion and the reduction to 9% has been greatly applauded by every business out there.</p><p>  On creating more jobs for chefs, 2004 was the last year in which there was a national HR policy in respect of tourism.  There is a need for a new policy.  When we set down a HR policy, we also establish benchmarks such as the number of jobs to be created, the nature of the training to be given and the level of investment and resources required.  Under such policies, we can also identify where skills shortages exist.  There is an urgent need for such a policy to be developed by F&aacute;ilte Ireland or some other body with responsibility in this area.</p> <p> Senator Quinn inquired about tourism growth, fishing and hunting.  Tourism can be increased in every county in Ireland, not just the specific high-tourism destination areas such as the Ring of Kerry, Connemara and Dublin city centre.  If one is a visitor from Britain, for instance, it does not matter whether one goes horse racing in Kildare, game fishing in Ballina or cruising on the River Shannon.  Tourism is part of every town and area in Ireland.  We need to get agencies and local authorities to understand that.  As long as local authorities have a grasp of tourism then we will at least be going in the right direction.  We need to make sure that the creation of jobs comes first.  I read in today&rsquo;s newspaper about a small caf&eacute; in Gort in County Galway that has to close its doors because of the outdoor seating charge.  It is a bit of nonsense.  We call it a sunshine tax, making people pay for having tables and chairs outside their premises.  This year we had a good summer but we did not have a good summer in the previous ten to 14 years.  That business only has 30 seats inside in the restaurant but it was able to put a couple of tables and chairs outside and now it is being penalised.  It would have been brought to court and had a &euro;5,000 fine imposed.  What happened is that ten people have lost their jobs and the caf&eacute; has closed down.  Local authorities must have more flexibility and look at what is fit for purpose.</p></speech>

We were told to put in a project with about 200 training places.  We had between 150 and 160 businesses that had guaranteed to take on one or two people and give them jobs.  When one replicates the estimate for an industry that has nearly 4,000 restaurant businesses - that does not include hotels or pubs that do food &ndash; there are vacancies.  We are inundated at the moment with requests for chefs.  There are 300 jobs today on <i>irishjobs.ie</i> and other job websites.  We are looking for skilled staff.  There is a need out there but we need to get the bodies in place.  One cannot just take a person off the live register and put them into a kitchen.  One must train them.

I very much welcome the fact that the Chairman has indicated that he will bring the relevant Departments together to see how skills shortages and the shortage of chefs can be addressed.  It seems ludicrous that so many people are emigrating when there are obvious career opportunities for young people and that we cannot sort out the problem once and for all.  We must focus and see how we can get more people into the supply chain.</p><p>  I strongly support the notion of keeping the VAT rate at 9%.  There is no doubt it has been a great success.  Mr. Cummins correctly said that agriculture and tourism have been the two areas in which we have seen significant job growth in the past two years.  I hope we can build on the successes of 2013 with The Gathering and that many people who have had a good experience in this country in the past year will return or will spread the word and their contacts and relatives will make their way here next year.  What is significant is that it would appear that the majority of restaurants have passed on the VAT reduction.  There is no doubt there is much better value to be had in restaurants around the country.  If customers get good value and service, that is what will bring them back.  There is a strong emphasis in most establishments on looking after the customer.  Senator Quinn is someone who always talks about care of the customer and ensuring that their experience is good whether they go into a store or a restaurant.  There is no doubt that if one has a good experience one will tell a few but if one has a bad experience one will tell many.  I compliment the work of the Restaurants Association of Ireland in recent years in instilling in their members the importance of looking after the customer.  I will do everything possible to ensure we keep the VAT rate at 9%.</p><p>  Following on from Deputy Kyne&rsquo;s question about the &euro;90 million cost, I can see the difficulty the Minister might have with the figure of &euro;360 million in some of the areas that were included as part of the overall VAT reduction package.  I would not be surprised if there were a change but I hope the 9% VAT rate is retained for the hospitality industry and the tourism sector.</p></speech>

I have two points to make.  One relates to the figures under discussion.  When the issue of maintaining the 9% VAT rate has been brought to the Minister&rsquo;s attention he has always raised the figure of &euro;360 million.  It is important that the witnesses get the message to him that it is not costing that amount according to the report of Bord F&aacute;ilte.  The point should be made more loudly than we have heard it so that everyone realises that is the case.</p><p>  It is important for the sector to become involved in devising new ways of increasing tourism.  I am promoting the development of the canals as cycleways.  There is potential for new restaurants and caf&eacute;s along the canals.  It is necessary to find new ways of bringing people into the country rather than sticking with the Cliffs of Moher or fishing.</p></speech>

We hope that the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will come together and get the figures right.  That report says it is costing the tourism industry &euro;90 million, and we stand over that.  It is a great deal of money in today's budget, but it is not a great deal when 9,000 jobs are created and many people are taken off the live register.  There are huge savings for the Department of Social Protection in that regard.  We will ramp up our efforts over the next month to get that message across clearly and distinctly.</p><p>  With regard to the new types of tourism, I fully support the Deputy.  We must look at all areas and, as I said earlier, every county must benefit from it.  Senator Mullins and I are from the River Shannon area but there is no policy regarding the growth of waterways in Ireland as a tourism product.  That could be done.  Cruise hire on the River Shannon and on many inland waterways has declined rapidly.  Angling tourism is being decimated by a number of issues that can be discussed at a later date.  We must examine green ways and cycle routes, linking with the canals across the midlands as a cycle route.  The Greenway in Mayo has worked and it is a huge benefit to that area.  We must use our natural physical environment, our forestry through Coillte and walkways.  Consider small towns and villages where there might be a small pub, shop and grocery.  If tourists are brought to such areas, it brings life to the village.  That is what we must consider so we can give them hope, to use President Obama's phrase.  Unfortunately, in the tourism industry at present certain counties and regions are getting much more hope than other counties.  Tourism is a 26-county industry for development; it is not just for specific centres.  In respect of international promotion, it is a 32-county promotion through Tourism Ireland.</p><p>  I am sure my colleagues will wish to give their own opinions on why the 9% rate should be retained, but I will first make a final point.  When we conducted our roadshow around the country and talked to the businesses, one guy equated the 9% VAT rate to the corporation tax.  The corporation tax is sacrosanct.  For us, a change in the 9% will have international ramifications.  It is not that it will increase by 1% or up to 13%, it is that Ireland will have become more expensive.  Tour operators and the international travel media will be writing about this for two or three months and it will have a negative effect next year on tourism throughout the country.</p></speech>

We thought we would have to work really hard to convince the committee but the members already appear to be convinced that the VAT reduction has been a great success.</p><p>  Adrian Cummins represents almost 1,000 restaurants in the country.  I can outline the reality of what he has said.  I have a restaurant in Dublin and one in Kildare.  Undoubtedly, there are two tiers at work.  In central Dublin, in Fallon &amp;amp; Byrne, we have approximately 160 staff.  We have increased the number by approximately 10% in the last two years.  There is no doubt that the VAT reduction has been a massive boost to us.  It might sound a bit alarmist but it is simple mathematics that if the VAT increases, the number of our staff will decrease.  It is that simple.  Kildare is something of a struggle.  As Deputy Lawlor knows, things are a little different outside the Pale.  While we are seeing double digit growth in town, we are seeing double digit decline in Kildare, which is a little worrying.  Only God knows where that will end.</p><p>  With regard to chefs, this is something I have been shouting about for a long time.  Driving through town today I passed two restaurants that had "Chefs wanted" signs in the windows.  It is incredible.  Many of our European counterparts cannot understand it.  I have a friend who runs a catering school on the Costa del Sol and he just cannot believe we are in such dire straits for chefs.  We are now looking outside the country for them, which is a cardinal sin with so many unemployed.</p><p>  Again, I thank the committee for such a positive reception today.</p></speech>

The 9% VAT rate is vitally important to us.  It is a matter of survival.  It is a mixed bag when discussing restaurants and how they are doing.  I am also located in Dublin, in Temple Bar.  I have been there for 25 years but this year is the most challenging year I have had to date.  It has been extremely challenging.  The weather affects it a little, but the British tourist still has not returned to Ireland.  We reduced our prices and we are very competitive.  There is a great deal of competition among restaurants and this winter will be quite tough for many restaurants throughout the country.  If VAT is increased from 9% it means that for every &euro;10,000 worth of food I sell per week, it will cost an extra &euro;450 in VAT.  That is one job.  It is either one or the other; it cannot be both.</p><p>  Our industry is a front-line industry and is very labour intensive.  As has correctly been said, it is all about services.  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n referred earlier to Navan in County Meath where the restaurants were the first to fall.  Yes, we are on the front line.  We must react.  We cannot sit back.  We have nobody to back us.  We do not have banking behind us.  We have nothing behind us, just the people who come in the door and making sure they come back.</p></speech>

I wish to reiterate what my colleagues have said and especially to emphasise the point about the rise in food costs and in excise duty that has occurred over the last year or 18 months.  The cost of beef and potatoes, which are basic staples in our industry, has increased by 15% to 20%.  That should be seen in the context of how central the food and restaurant industry is to consumer confidence, not just in terms of tourist numbers but also for people living here wishing to enjoy themselves, and how obsessed we are as a country with food.  The issue of the shortage of chefs has not been emphasised enough and actually makes us uncompetitive.  When I started in this business it was difficult but we tried to cut wage and food costs wherever we could.  However, it is impossible to do that with the chef shortages because obviously chefs can command much higher salaries.  In view of all that, we ask the Government to retain the VAT rate at 9%.</p></speech>

It is clear that members are very much behind the campaign.  The association has run a very good campaign in the past couple of months which is reflected in the views expressed here.  We will send a copy of today's presentation to the relevant Ministers in order that they can see the questions and answers on the presentation.  We will probably decide next week to do something formally ourselves but we will keep the witnesses posted on what we are doing.  It is clear they have got cross-party support on the issue.  The Minister spoke about this yesterday and nothing is definite.  The campaign will have to continue.  He made it clear that the Department of Finance had factored in this figure.

Professor Barry will make some opening remarks which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the public gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off.  I advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If the witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and he continues to so do, he is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  The witness is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given, and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

It was entirely fortuitous that by the time I had figured out what was going on, the Westminster committee and the US Senate sub-committee had released the results of their investigations.  I presented a paper at the Institute of European Affairs about a month or six weeks ago to explain the fruits of my research.  On foot of that, I was invited here to reprise that.  As the committee knows, what we call aggressive tax planning by multinationals is in the news almost every day.  In other words, it is entirely legal but it pushes the margins of legality to the limit in terms of trying to avoid global taxation.</p><p>  Clearly, there is an important Irish dimension to this, because Ireland surfaced quite substantially in the Westminster and US Senate hearings.  We have a very long history of using corporate taxation to attract foreign direct investment.  The slide shows my iconic image of Irish industrialisation.  I found it going through the files of <i>The</i><i>Cork Examiner</i>.  It is Fermoy in the mid-1950s.  We are all familiar with Faber-Castell.  I am sure we all chewed those pencils when we were kids in the classroom.  This was one of the first foreign firms that came to Ireland in the mid-1950s.  The second John A. Costello Government introduced export profits tax relief and that is the origin of our low corporation tax regime, so it has a very long history.  Very generous tax allowances were given for corporate profits derived from new manufactured exports.  The idea had been knocking around the bureaucracy for about ten years or so.  It was originally thought to be a way of promoting indigenous exports in view of the dollar shortage after World War II and so on.</p><p>  This is the foundation of our low corporation tax regime today and on that foundation is built the entire infrastructure of drawing in foreign firms.  Ireland is one of the most FDI-intensive economies in the world.  The idea of exports profits tax relief was initially conceived as an incentive to indigenous exporters.</p></speech>

The entire infrastructure that makes us very successful at drawing in foreign industry has been built on that foundation.  Initially, export profits tax relief was conceived as an incentive to indigenous firms to export.  I was interviewed on National Public Radio in the US about this when the Senate sub-committee released its report.  I had been researching where the ideas came from so the following irony amused the Americans to a great extent.  It was a Marshall aid-funded consultancy study commissioned by the IDA that drew Ireland's attention to the case of Puerto Rico, which had developed very rapidly post-World War II because, as a US protectorate, it had tariff-free access to the US market but had control over its own corporation tax because it was not a US state.  The idea really stimulated the Irish bureaucracy into the notion that there is a valuable policy to be implemented here and that policy was eventually implemented in 1956.</p><p>  To bring it up to today - this story is replete with ironies - members will see that the reason I use this quote will surface again and again in my presentation.  Back in 2000, the EU complained that the use of Caribbean tax havens by US multinationals gave US firms a competitive advantage.  That is important to bear in mind in view of the logjam that prevents the US from coming up with policies towards its own corporation tax that satisfy everybody.  The use of Caribbean tax havens gives multinational firms an international advantage and it is primarily US firms that use the Caribbean tax havens.  </p><p>  I know that people from the OECD have appeared before the committee and have gone through the next couple of slides, but I want to present it from my perspective because it is an important part of the story.  We know the US Senate sub-committee branded Ireland a tax haven.  To me, that is Alice in wonderland language, where words mean what one wants them to mean.  I prefer to go with the OECD definition, under which Ireland is definitely not a tax haven.  Initially, to define a region or jurisdiction as a tax haven, the OECD had four criteria.  One of these is that the region must have no or very low taxes, but the OECD warns that this criterion is not sufficient.  This point is really missed in most public debate.  Different kinds of economy have different appropriate tax rates.  It makes sense for big, centrally located and long-industrialised economies to have higher corporation tax rates for the reasons members see on this slide.</p></speech>

Before I move to other members, I will ask some quick questions.  What I gather from Professor Barry is that this is a tax avoidance issue that dates back to 1997 and the check-the-box issue from the US.  To deal with any problems the corporations had with this, they managed to persuade Congress to push legislation through, creating the look-through rule which actually copper-fastened this activity on behalf of the American corporations.</p></speech>

He might give us a very short note on that.  What is more interesting is the recent OECD report on base erosion and profit shifting.  Can Professor Barry give me an idea why the EU is coming to talk to us when it is bypassing the City of London and Washington?  There is a sense that it is the small fellows getting kicked around.

How this situation suits the corporations is that, before 1997, royalty payments for intellectual property were taxed as soon as they were earned, no matter where they were made in the world.  Since 1997, however, they are taxed only when they are repatriated to the US.  The US multinationals earn this money in the Caribbean but they do not repatriate it, so this does not trigger immediate tax liability.  It is like getting an interest-free loan from the American taxation authorities.  That is how they benefit from this.</p><p>  As I said, the Republicans in Congress realise this, which is why they are defending the use of the Caribbean tax havens.  I paid attention to the Senate sub-committee and I did not particularly get a sense they were trying to hide the role of the Caribbean in all of this, but the Chairman might have read it differently.  I believe everybody is aware of the role of the Caribbean.</p><p>  Why Ireland gets mentioned and gets called a tax haven is simply, I think, that the American politicians do not want public recognition of the fact they are responsible for allowing their US corporations to avoid immediate US taxation.  There may be good reasons for allowing their companies to exploit these rules, but they just do not want to recognise it.  I guess it is populist politics at play, or that would be my understanding of it.</p><p>  The Chairman's second question was why the EU was now looking into Ireland.  I was talking to some people about this recently.  First, it would be great if it clears us - if the Revenue sends over its Excel files or whatever, Brussels looks at them and everything is fine and above board.  From talking with other people in the past couple of weeks, there is a sense that the European Commission has been so sidelined by the euro crisis that it is nowhere near as important as it used to be five years ago.  It may be struggling to find a role for itself and it is being overshadowed by the OECD in this matter, so maybe it is saying: "We want a bit of publicity out of this."  That is a sceptic's point of view but there may be validity to it.</p></speech>

On the issue of tax havens, which has come up in the US Senate, Professor Barry says it is Alice in Wonderland stuff and that we should refer to the OECD criteria for tax havens.  Would Professor Barry not agree that, using the same criteria of the OECD, his claim that Bermuda or the Cayman Islands is a tax haven is equally Alice in Wonderland because they do not fit the criteria of tax haven as expressed by the OECD, which has been confirmed to this committee by an eminent member of the OECD at the last hearing?</p></speech>

The reason I am saying this is that "tax haven", if we go back to the definition, does not mean anything today because tax policy has changed so much, whether Professor Barry believes one place is a tax haven and another person believes it is not.</p></speech>

I know that when the OECD initially came up with these criteria, even after the fourth one was vetoed by the Americans, there was a whole batch of states that fit those criteria, including all of the Caribbean countries, but the OECD has progressively forced them to take certain actions to extricate themselves from that precise definition.  I did not realise they had all been deemed acceptable now.  We know, for example, that one of the things the OECD forced them to do was to sign tax exchange agreements with a minimum of maybe eight other states.  What the Caribbean islands did was to sign tax agreements with each other, which is generally regarded as doing the very bare minimum to escape being harassed by the OECD.  It is a good point.  If there are no longer any tax havens in the world, then I suppose we have to come up with a new definition.</p></speech>

I do not believe the definition of a country as a tax haven is applicable any longer.</p><p>  To move on to other questions, the table on corporation tax rates is very interesting and shows we have the lowest effective tax rate out of the 33 listed on the table.  When we ask the Government in regard to the effective tax rate of this State, it relies on the figure of 11.8%, which emanates from a PricewaterhouseCoopers report.

The reason I ask is that the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which claimed our effective tax rate was 11.9%, used a standardised methodology as described by the World Bank, whereby to come up with our effective tax rate it examined a company in Ireland which produces ceramic flowerpots and has a gross profit margin of 20%.  This company does not trade internationally and operates out of Dublin.  It does not have land, leases, machinery or trucks and is not able to avail of any tax relief.  I state this because it is about busting these myths.  Ireland is not a tax haven because there are no tax havens in the world.  The Government tells us Ireland's effective tax rate is 11.9% but this is based on the example of a company which produces flowerpots and is not Apple, Google or any company able to avail of tax incentives.  Will Professor Barry comment on this?</p></speech>

They take a hypothetical company, exactly as Deputy Doherty states, which is a producer of ceramics which has no exports, and asks what tax rate this company would pay in every country.  It is how it came up with its number.  It is a bizarre company which is not reflective of the real companies that operate in the world.  That is why I dismiss these studies.  It is what I call a back-of-an-envelope study.  It is done over the space of a few months.  I prefer to rely on academics, whose entire life's work is working out how to evaluate appropriate tax rates.  Amazingly, 11.1% is close enough to 11.8%, but what really matters is how other countries are ranked.  In the PwC study the rate for France was 5% or 6%, whereas in the academic studies it comes in closer to 30%.  These numbers are much more plausible because they fit in with the logic, as I explained, of why centrally located large industrialised countries invariably tend to have higher effective tax rates.  These numbers are much more credible.</p></speech>

Much stock is being put on the OECD report by certain sources in the Government.  Professor Barry called it a damp squib and I believe his analysis is 100% correct.  I put it to the OECD representative who came before the committee, whose name I cannot remember, that the threat of the US vetoing this is enormous and that Professor Barry's analysis with regard to deferral and the headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> from 1975 to which he referred in previous presentations is accurate.  If the OECD report is a damp squib - we will go through all of this - and if it is vetoed by the United States, how will we as a country deal with base erosion and profit shifting?  What steps can we take to deal with it?  I know it is best achieved through global co-operation and, on a secondary basis, through EU co-operation, but there are actions we can take ourselves.  Does Professor Barry have any recommendations as to what we could do to deal with this issue?</p></speech>

Clearly, if it is not in the interests of the US to institute dramatic change, it will not happen.  I do not have high hopes that the OECD will introduce dramatic changes.  It certainly will not introduce them without US support; perhaps it will do some tinkering at the margins.  The White House statement from the Obama Administration in 2009 threatened to introduce all kinds of radical policies but they went nowhere.  I see paralysis at the heart of the US position as preventing action at a global level.</p><p>  What we can do ourselves is a big debate among academics who work in the area.  Committee members will probably have seen newspaper reports of studies which state we receive only a tiny proportion of the corporate taxation revenues we are due.  Revenue economists disagree vehemently with this and state that studies such as these include as taxable profits in Ireland a whole chunk of profits which are not taxable in Ireland, namely, profits spent paying royalties to where the intellectual property is located.  If the intellectual property is located outside Ireland we cannot tax the revenues paid for it as it is a cost to the company in Ireland.  There is a separate line of thought, with which committee members are probably familiar, that we do very well in terms of corporation tax rates compared to most of the rest of the OECD.  Generally, corporation tax rates as a share of GDP in Ireland are higher than the OECD or EU average.  As a share of GNP they would be far higher.  We do not too badly in collecting corporation tax.</p><p>  The difficulty with trying to take unilateral action is that other countries are hovering and waiting to see whether Ireland makes a mistake.  The Netherlands always keeps a close eye on Ireland; when we change our laws it changes its laws also.  It is like a football match.  In recent years, the UK introduced the patent box, which offers an effective rate of 10% corporation tax.  It is a competitive battle and we must be very careful in what we do because other countries will be waiting to exploit any leeway we give them.</p></speech>

Of course it closed down its loopholes in the Finance Act 1999, but it was not directly as a result of the check-the-box system.  The paper commissioned by the Department of Finance on the loopholes that were closed down, which Professor Barry identified, with regard to Irish-registered non-resident companies was produced in 1998 but identified the flaws in the changes the Government had made to the Finance Act 1995, how they had not proved effective and how they could not be enforced, and examined how to strengthen them.  It discussed how Irish-registered non-resident companies posed a threat to Ireland's international image and reputation and also mentioned cases before the courts.  All of this emanated prior to 1997.  It discussed the measures introduced in the 1995 Act and made recommendations which were contained in the subsequent Finance Act.  The check-the-box system was introduced in 1997 and this happened in 1998, but it was a coincidence.  The document makes no reference whatsoever to changes in US taxation law, and the check-the-box change, which was the subject of the US Apple hearings, facilitated companies such as Apple in doing what they do legally in both jurisdictions.  The recommendation for the Finance Act 1999 proposed that registration in the State should be a test for tax residency as an alternative to the control and management test for all companies other than those ultimately under the control of a company resident in the State, the EU or another tax treaty country.</p></speech>

I am reluctant to give an off-the-cuff answer because it could have really profound consequences.  That would really be a game changer.  Apple strategists would ask, "Are there alternative locations where we can do better than in Ireland under this new legislation?"  It might move out.  That is the danger.  I would have to think about it very carefully.  I will and would love to do that.  It is the type of question that fascinates me.</p></speech>

It echoes comments we have heard from the IDA and some of our senior Ministers.  In the debate in Ireland we talk too often about the rate, which appears to be quite transparent from Professor Barry's tables and figures, but not enough about some of the other rules in respect of our tax position.  It is interesting to hear the professor's comment that for a small country such as this, any unilateral act could be particularly difficult.  That said, there has been much talk about our reputation following the recent hearings in the UK and the United States.  Does Professor Barry believe there is any genuine reputational damage that would affect the corporate decision making of a large company, or is it something we are a little paranoid about ourselves in terms of what our neighbours are saying or thinking about us?</p></speech>

We speculated for some time about whether the US Senate hearings and reports would cause reputational damage for Ireland.  The US newspaper, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, has had Ireland in its sights for a long time, complaining about Ireland's tax regime.  I spoke to one of its journalists from the US.  It has a stringer in Ireland to whom I often talk, but I was called by a journalist in its US office and had a long chat on precisely this subject.  They told me that the sense they were getting from Silicon Valley was that this was doing us no damage whatsoever.  I talked with the IDA economists afterwards about this and they said that was exactly what they were hearing as well.  That is interesting.  I regard the <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> as a hostile source in that sense, so the fact it was saying that was interesting and certainly indicative.  Yes, I think we might be over-paranoid here about the possible reputational consequences.</p><p>  There are two things to worry about.  One is the companies, and the American companies do not appear to be worried.  However, there are also the international organisations and what they might do.  The fact that Brussels is looking into this, no matter how informally, is probably a result of the Senate sub-committee hearings and the like.</p></speech>

How long realistically will it take them to arrive at that point?  Second, given that we have been so successful so far with the tax system we have in place, and we have adopted a position of low taxes to attract high volume which is clearly the best business model for any business, are there things we should be doing now to position ourselves on the basis that action will be taken on a global scale and that if corporations must pay tax somewhere, we are positioned to be that place, as we have done on the rate?</p></speech>

The perspective of the IDA, and I believe it is right on this, is that we stand to benefit from any changes at the global level.  I am a little sceptical about whether radical changes will happen but the IDA says we stand to benefit because we have the substantive activities here.  Deputy Pearse Doherty was correct when he said that the 1999 changes were not a direct response to check-the-box.  I was simply making the point that they did not respond to check-the-box in a way that would facilitate further tax avoidance.  The fact that we insist that any companies using Ireland have substantive activities here must stand the test of time and will stand to us whenever any changes are introduced at the global level that apply to all countries.  The country that will lose out there is the Netherlands, besides the countries that used to be called tax havens.  Most US foreign investment that comes to Ireland comes through the Netherlands, through Dutch holding companies, for tax reasons.  The Netherlands does not require substantive activities.  We are protected to a large extent in that regard.</p></speech>

Are clear proposals being brought forward that might get cross-party support in the United States, or has it not arrived at that stage yet?</p></speech>

Even then, if they swept everything they would be forced to ask themselves about these changes on which President Obama ran his campaign for the Democrat nomination and on which John Kerry ran his campaign, which are to close off all these corporation tax loopholes, and to ask to what extent it is in their interests overall.  It might bring in some extra tax revenues but, as I mentioned in the IEA talk, the US State Department clearly likes having US multinationals everywhere in the world.  It is a form of soft power, so what if one closes down what we might call these tax loopholes?  Most US investments overseas are funded out of unrepatriated profits.  These are profits that remain offshore.  If they insist that those profits are repatriated back to America and subject to immediate taxation, there are fewer funds to fund US investment overseas and the State Department is unlikely to like that.</p></speech>

There is a gap of a few percentage points to the next country.  The Government - in which I am happy to serve as a backbench Member - puts great stock in the fact that our rate is so solidly banked at 12.5%.  How important would it be for Ireland not to be seen to start an upward movement in this regard?  Would it be acceptable to increase the rate by a certain amount or would corporations see such a move as the ending of something sacred?  Would they be of the view that while Ireland's rate remains the lowest, the authorities here are prepared to increase it?</p></speech>

I referred earlier to the incredible stability of our corporation tax regime over 60 years.  It has really only been changed twice or three times.  That is incredible stability.  If we start tinkering with it in response to short-term considerations, we will lost the benefit of that stability.  It is very difficult to isolate precisely how important is the stability of the regime.  My guess is, however, that it is pretty important.  Again, it is uncertain but there are benefits to retaining the stability of the regime.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-09-17a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="15:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI52013091700009#M01200"><p>In my opinion we need to examine the position with regard to corporate tax because this country is in a dire state and desperately needs revenue.  People who bear no responsibility whatsoever for the current economic crisis are being crucified to the point where it is unbearable.  At the same time there is significant evidence that enormously profitable corporations are paying nothing or next to nothing as a contribution to the states and societies which host and facilitate them.  We need to address that and discover whether we can rebalance matters in a fair way so that those who have a lot will pay more and those who have nothing or close to nothing will obtain some relief.  I am of the view that this is why we are considering the matter before us.</p><p>  The moral-relativist argument put forward by Professor Barry to the effect that it is all very ironic that the Americans or the EU should point the finger at us simply misses the point.  I take it as read that politicians in America engage in grandstanding and that they are hypocritical, deceitful and cover up what is happening in their own country.  However, that does not in any way answer the more substantial question about whether our tax regime is fair and just.  Neither does it indicate whether that regime facilitates aggressive tax avoidance on the part of multinational corporations.  If there has been a shifting of position by Senators Levin and McCain in the US, this may largely be explained as being opportunism and grandstanding on their part.  There is, however, a much more fundamental reason for the shift to which I refer, namely, that they are being forced to address this question.  This arises because ordinary American people and their counterparts in other countries are - faced with the global economic crisis - examining these things and demanding answers in respect of them.  Whether they are American, European or Irish citizens, they are asking "How the hell is it that we are being screwed to the wall when these corporations are making billions and, apparently, paying no tax?"  Is that question not the starting point for a serious discussion rather than pointing to hypocrisy on the part of American politicians?</p></speech>

As already stated, it is spectacularly complicated.  I was using them in the way I would with a group of students in order to retain their interest while discussing a complicated issue.</p><p>  In reply to the Deputy's question, one issue about which Ireland must be concerned is the need to consider short-term considerations versus long-term ones.  In that context, the issue of stability must be important.  We could, for example, increase our tax rate and, presumably, realise higher revenues for some short period.  In the longer term, however, the multinationals might disappear.  At the margins, some would certainly disappear and we might end up with less revenue.</p></speech>

In fairness, he was very objective but he did make one moral value judgment when he stated while it may make sense for larger economies to have higher corporate tax rates, it does not make sense for smaller economies to have them.  That matter is very much open to question and debate.  I wish to put a direct question to Professor Barry.  I was the first person to reveal - via replies I received to parliamentary questions I tabled approximately one year ago - startling facts about how little effective corporate tax is being paid by corporations in this country.  The figures contained in the replies to which I refer and which emanated from the Department of Finance indicate that &euro;70 billion was made in pre-tax profits by the corporations and that - following the various deductions, the application of reliefs, etc. - &euro;4 billion was paid in tax.  This means that approximately 6.2% was paid in corporation tax.  The latter is the effective rate - not 11.1% or 12.5% - and it happens to coincide with EU Commission figures which indicate that our implicit rate of corporation tax is 6.8%.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the browbeating I received for revealing this information and references to the World Bank's measurement for effective rates which indicates a rate of 11.1% for Ireland, has Professor Barry not effectively admitted that I was right?  Is it not the case that the real effective rate - and not one based on that which might apply to a mythical medium-sized company that produces ceramics - in terms of the level of profits made and how much tax paid is more in the region of 6% to 7%?  Is this not borne out by Department of Finance and EUROSTAT figures and by Professor Barry's friend, Professor Devereux, in the second column which, I presume, involves a different calculation?</p></speech>

People should also examine the CTS 3 table, which gives some of the headings under which the taxable profits of &euro;70 billion are written down progressively such that they end up at &euro;4 billion.  That would be under headings such as trading losses, which allows an incredible &euro;21 billion to be deducted from the figure, moving losses around from one part of a company to another, extraordinary losses appropriate to the trade and credible group relief charges.</p></speech>

The Deputy is not doing that, he is calling them taxable profits and saying the profit rate levied on the figure he cited of &euro;70 billion is 6%, but that is not an appropriate calculation.  He has to deduct allowances and so on before he comes up with a number that he can call taxable profits.</p></speech>

It is a purely economic argument; it is not a moral argument.  I am trying to stay away from morality in which I have no expertise.</p></speech>

Professor Barry spoke about closeness to markets and so on as part of the reason for that.  We are part of a very big market, the European Union.  It seems obvious that part of the reason American companies base themselves here is that we are an English speaking country within the European Union and we have a well educated workforce which speaks English.  That is as much an attraction as anything else.</p><p>  I suggest we focus on the large companies, such as Google and so on that Professor Barry mentioned, and the use of new technology, as I understand it.  I was told by somebody who used to work for Google - I would like Professor Barry to confirm it - that is sells advertising from a building on the Quays, its Dublin headquarters, to Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  It makes enormous profits from those advertising sales but a charge is levied by Google Ireland holding company which is not tax resident, and that charge, conveniently, is almost exactly the same as the amount of its advertising profits.  Given that our tax law does not deem that holding company to be tax resident in this country, it does not pay any tax on work that was done here but people in that building on the Quays sell that advertising.  That is tax dodging.  The simple way to close it down is to say those people are selling advertising from here, generating those profits from here and that we do not deem it acceptable that this holding company is not tax liable as a way of dodging tax.  We consider any company that is incorporated here to be tax liable here and we will enforce the 12.5% tax rate in respect of it.  Surely that is the simple easy way to deal with what is a blatant tax dodge.</p></speech>

Google is a brand name.  It is not "Cyborg", the imaginary company that I came up with.  The Google brand name is very valuable.  That is why it sells advertising revenue because it has a spectacularly important brand name.  The intellectual property, in order words, the ownership of that brand name, is owned presumably somewhere in the Caribbean and that brand name accounts for most of the profits that Google earns.  That is the logic of it.  To me, a Dunnes Stores cola is pretty much the same as a Coca Cola, yet a bottle of coke retails for &euro;1 and Dunnes Stores was selling its cola at 20 cent last time I checked.  The value of the difference is the value of the brand name.  I am not going to debate with the Deputy on this because it is not my role to debate it, but that would be the argument as to why things are set up as they are.  I would agree that it is not a perfect world and things could be changed but what is important to bear in mind are things that can be changed at a global level versus things that can be changed at the Irish level.  At the Irish level we are very constrained in terms of the effective changes we can introduce.  If we introduce changes that are damaging to the competitiveness of companies, they will leave and go elsewhere and that is the dilemma we face in trying to think what changes can we introduce.</p></speech>

It has been very useful.  I wish to pick up on the point of the effective tax rate.  It puzzles me when we get a figure from Revenue of 11.9% or the figure Professor Barry produced of 11.1%.  If we assume a corporation tax figure of say &euro;4 billion is paid in Ireland, the difference between the 12.5% and 11.1% cited in the presentation is 1.4 percentage points, which on a base of &euro;4 billion is &euro;56 million.  What we are being told is that there is a gap of only &euro;56 million between what is effectively paid and what would paid at 12.5%.  That is the contention.  The Government is saying that is what Revenue or the Department of Finance says.  Would Professor Barry accept that?</p></speech>

So 1.4% is &euro;56 million.  If we are to believe the 11.1%, we must also believe that &euro;56 million is the amount of foregone corporation tax.  That is what we would have to believe mathematically.  Let us take a made-up example called GIZMO.  GIZMO creates a holding company that is either resident here but non-resident for tax purposes as per Professor Barry's example or resident in the Caribbean.  GIZMO operating company makes &euro;2 billion in revenue in a given year and has operating costs of &euro;1 billion.  Therefore, it has a pre-tax profit of &euro;1 billion.  It also pays &euro;1 billion to GIZMO holding company in royalties for the brand or whatever it is.  GIZMO operating company attracts &euro;2 billion in revenue, has &euro;1 billion in operating costs and pays zero corporation tax.  If I understand correctly, that sort of tax avoidance could not conceivably be included in the effective rate which we as parliamentarians are informed is somewhere between 11% and 12%.  Does Professor Barry agree with that?</p></speech>

There are very generous research and development allowances.  The Deputy is right in that they are under investigation by Revenue to the extent that they may be exploited but that the primary difference between the figures of 12.5% and 11% is that one gets big tax benefits in respect of certain expenditures on research and development.</p></speech>

By the way, there are tens of billions of euro being made here which are almost entirely being funnelled out of the country or just not being paid anywhere and when we figure out our corporation tax, we ignore all of that.  I would like Professor Barry's opinion as to whether it is reasonable of me to say that our effective rate of corporation tax is 11.1% ignoring all the tax avoidance that goes on?</p></speech>

This might well be a first.  It is really the last question that Deputy Boyd Barrett was asking as well.  Let me use the example of a pharmaceutical company.  In respect of the pharmaceutical firms down in Cork, the stuff that goes in one end consists of bulk chemicals, which are very cheap.  The stuff that comes out at the other end are these pills that cost $20.  That does not mean that those factory workers are the most productive workers in the world.  The profit there is the profit associated with the fact that this is Pfizer that has billions in research and development that ran into the sand because out of every &euro;20 billion one spends on research and development in pharmaceuticals, most of that is wasted and never sees the light of day.  It is not really true to say that all the profits are generated in this factory in Cork where what comes in are cheap bulk chemicals and what comes out are very valuable products.  One cannot say this is because those Irish workers are spectacularly productive.</p></speech>

I am just establishing a base that says 11.1% is our effective corporate tax rate ignoring all of the tax avoidance.  My second point is an aside-----</p></speech>

The 11.1% is the revenue generated on the base of the profits that are deemed taxable in Ireland minus certain allowances.</p></speech>

The point I am making, which is conveniently ignored when one talks about effective corporation tax in Ireland, is it is that rate ignoring all the tax avoidance.  On a quick aside because I would not like anybody listening to think that Irish engineers do not add any value, I started off my life as a engineer out of UCD.  While the science for the compounds for these things may indeed come from China, the US, Portugal, Dublin or wherever, there is a huge amount of intellectual property, innovation and value add in high-end manufacturing.  One thinks of the Intel and Hewlett-Packard plants.  This is super high-end, world-class manufacturing with vast intellectual property and value added from Irish engineers.  I am not suggesting that Pfizer, Intel or Hewlett-Packard do not pay any taxes here.</p></speech>

I think that is important because it follows on to the next question.  I would like to see and would love to know whether Professor Barry has seen an analysis of the quantums involved.  As far as I can tell, there are four different types of tax paid and avoided in this country.  I would like to hear Professor Barry's thoughts as to whether these four segments are correct.  The first is corporation tax paid here in full, be it at 11.1% or 12.5%.  I deem the research and development credits to be perfectly legitimate.</p><p>  Segment 2 is an interesting one and consists of taxes paid here in full plus more.  This is something we know the UK is beginning to look at.  An example would be an advert sold in the UK to a UK company with the advertising in the UK but where there has been an exchange on a server sitting in Dublin and, therefore, the profits for that are declared here at 12.5% rather than in the UK at 40%.  In this second segment, we gain from companies paying on revenues from here and abroad.</p><p>  The third segment is transfer pricing.  Let us go back to GIZMO where the holding company may be resident here and the operating company pays &euro;500 million in royalties and then declares &euro;500 million in taxes.  Corporation tax is paid here but not fully and the royalty transfer would not be included in the effective corporation tax.</p><p>  The fourth segment is taxes not paid anywhere.  Apple has discovered this loophole between Irish and US law.  I have the briefing note to the US Senate sub-committee which said that Apple Operations International, which has no employees or physical presence, is managed and controlled in the US and received $30 billion of income between 2009 and 2012, has paid no corporate income tax to any national government for the past five years.  In Professor Barry's opinion, are these the right four segments: normal tax paid; normal tax paid plus a bit, possibly from activity in the UK; part tax paid due to transfer pricing; and no tax paid due to non-residency anywhere or residency for the holding company in a jurisdiction where there is zero corporate tax paid?</p></speech>

One could look at it from the viewpoint of the British tax authorities, the Irish tax authorities and global tax authorities.  One could chop it up any way one wanted.  Let me make one point about this.  As an US company, if Apple's profits accumulating from wherever, presumably somewhere in the Caribbean because it tends to be the Caribbean, are ultimately distributed to Apple shareholders, they must go back to the US.</p></speech>

I am interested in getting the full picture.  We have numbers, for example, 11.1%, &euro;70 billion and so forth.  However, I can find no figure for the X hundreds of billions of entering and leaving Ireland in those segments.  Does Professor Barry know of anyone who has done such an analysis?  It would give us a full picture of the scale of the transfer pricing.</p></speech>

I would not necessarily stand over his final numbers, but he analyses flows through Ireland.  The flows out of Ireland can be easily traced through the balance of payments.  They tend to be repatriated profits, royalty payments and so on.  These are significant components of the services account in the balance of payments.  I am unsure as to how to trace the flows inwards.  Dr. Stewart examines individual companies' accounts and tries to trace their flows, but the Deputy is probably more interested in the aggregate.</p></speech>

I thank the professor for his answers.  Should we take any action unilaterally or should our approach be wholly a multilateral one?  I believe he is saying that the correct approach for us is the OECD's one.</p></speech>

Nothing springs to mind in terms of what we can do to generate extra tax revenues, which is the Deputy's point, without possibly suffering detrimental long-term consequences.  As I told Deputy Doherty, our corporation tax revenues as a share of national income are higher than the average for the OECD and the EU.  This may have changed over the course of the recession, but it was the case for a decade or more before the crisis.  We are not losing out in terms of corporation tax revenues.  We are gaining substantially in terms of jobs, spill-over effects and so on.  There is no silver bullet item that I can point to as a change that we should be considering.  Whatever changes have possible short-term benefits, we must worry about the long-term costs.</p></speech>

It is always great to see him.  The context of this discussion is that nearly all countries have unsustainable debts, the Vito Tanzi thesis and so on.  The US economy cannot face up to even the slightest suggestion that fiscal stimulus might be removed.  It is a Lance Armstrong economy.</p><p>  Tanzi used the phrase "fiscal termites".  We do this all the time.  In the last Finance Act, there was a rights tax break for investments in property.  We conducted that experiment and it was a disastrous form of tax relief.  That we are doing it again concerns me.  Previously, the recipient of the research and development grant needed to spend 75% of his or her time doing research and development.  This level was reduced to 50%.  This seems to be deliberate tax avoidance, in that we will pay people twice what they are doing for the benefit that we are seeking.  Firms were provided an allowance to export to BRIC countries because they were far away, the hotels were not great, there could be riots outside, etc.  It has been proposed to extend that allowance to the US, Switzerland and Japan.  This happens all of the time.</p><p>  People regard the Starbucks and U2 cases as scandals.  There is a universal problem whereby straitened public finances are prone to lobbyists, as has been mentioned.  The back of the Vito Tanzi book mentions that the most profitable person in most US companies is the lobbyist.  He actually gave examples of tax laws being designed that were so complex that the President signing the Bill could not possibly understand them.  Only the person in the corporate law firm who designed them and his or her opposite number in the tax authority could understand them.  Frequently, senior people from most countries' revenue bodies move on to work for these corporations after designing tax loopholes.  I am concerned that we have a problem.</p><p>  I thank Professor Barry for the numbers.  Some 11.1% is not that far off 12.5%.  However, I am concerned by the continuous attempts under every Finance Act to erode the 11.1%.  The termites do not stop.  Tax avoidance is an unproductive industry, in that it moves money around rather than creating anything.  Although Ireland needs the jobs, only 150,000 people or so of the 1.8 million at work actually work in these companies.  Should we be part of an international effort to get a much less complicated system and to stop the gnawing of the fiscal termites?  In Canada, Mr. Kenneth Carter advocated a single low-rate system without deductions or allowances.  This would cut out the large tax lawyer and tax accountant industry and try to restart the Adam Smith capitalism mentioned in one of Professor Barry's papers.</p><p>  The fiscalisation and financialisation of economies in this legislative environment reward many activities that do not have much social benefit.  This is a concern.  Perhaps we do it less than anyone else, but it must be a major OECD problem.  I was in favour of the low rate of tax when the Government was running a surplus.  It was a reward.  Like companies, governments should compete.  If a country can run its governance without needing high corporate taxes, that is a part of the reward for good governance.  Hopefully, the same would apply to personal taxation.  However, that world ended in approximately 2008 when we hit the rocks.</p><p>  We could simplify our code.  We should be a part of an OECD attempt to extend it worldwide.  Tax lawyering and tax accounting are substantially unproductive activities.</p></speech>

On the other hand, one might say that some of these people may have genuine asymmetric information that is valuable to impart to the bureaucracy.  Sometimes changes in the tax codes may be valuable when we get in ahead of the posse.  In financial services I used to think that about the single European passport, as it was called.  We were the second country after Luxembourg to introduce it and it gave the IFSC a boost at a certain time.  Now I would have to go back to see whether or not it was a valuable change to have implemented so early.  I have no idea and I have not thought about it since then.  Sometimes, however, when one gets in ahead with changes in the tax code - because one has received information from business people who are aware of imminent changes - it can be valuable.  That would be the beneficial side of this process of maintaining links with business.  In general, I agree with Senator Barrett's lobbying point.</p></speech>

What are we gleaning from taxpayers and shareholders in America?  Over the years, people have been starting to realise that the figures we are talking about are in billions.  As Professor Barry said, there were a few patents around but they were not that valuable.  In the grand policy scheme, the State Department saw this as an opportunity for American companies to expand globally.  It was like interest-free loans and it served American interests well.  They may have been unhappy about it but there was no big issue.  However, we are no longer talking about a few hundred million or a couple of billion to help American corporations establish themselves.  We are really talking about hundreds of billions that are being secreted away in Cayman Island accounts.  It is starting to seep into the common language of ordinary people that big corporations are making huge funds here.</p><p>  Do we have any information from shareholders?  If I was an Apple shareholder I would wonder when I was going to see my money.  What are taxpayers coming back with?  Is there any talk in the United States about a general amnesty?  That is one way of getting huge funds like this.</p></speech>

It could provide a stimulus for the US Government, while at the same time getting them over many of the problems they are currently discussing.</p></speech>

President George W. Bush offered an amnesty on corporation profits.  It was not technically an amnesty because they were not doing anything illegal, but there was a period during which if they repatriated their profits they would pay a reduced rate of tax on them.</p><p>  This speaks to Senator Barrett's point about the military-industrial complex.  The US multinationals got wind that this window was going to be introduced, so for a few years previously they repatriated less than normal to the US.  Therefore, the stocks they were holding offshore built up.  Then when the window was introduced all those stocks were shunted home.  In the grand scheme of things the window, or amnesty, had no effect because the multinationals gained from the system by learning in advance that it was going to be introduced.

It is not ideal, but if these profits are earned by Apple and are kept offshore, he will not get the benefits in dividends.  However, they will be reflected in the share price because they are genuine profits of the Apple company.  Therefore, one would get value from them as an Apple shareholder.  That is a more general point and has nothing to do with Ireland.</p></speech>

It is not necessarily just a function of the paralysis of the US tax system that I have talked about - it is that this whole interlocking, overlapping jurisdictional regime can have very unusual consequences that are not apparent at first glance.  For example, when profits are ultimately repatriated, the US Treasury benefits more from profits that are repatriated from a tax haven than profits that are repatriated from Japan, for example.  That is because one has to pay taxes on the profits when they are repatriated but one gets a tax credit for taxes paid abroad.  Therefore, if a subsidiary is operating in Japan it pays a high tax, so it owes no tax to the US tax authorities when those profits are repatriated.  When one repatriates profits out of Ireland one gets a tax credit for the Irish taxes paid, but lots more is owed to the US tax authorities.  In that sense therefore, if the profits are ultimately repatriated, the US tax authorities benefit more from profits located in tax havens - to use the term loosely - than they do from profits generated in high-tax regimes.  There are many unanticipated consequences in all of this.</p></speech>

However, is he not understating the strategic importance of Ireland?  Setting aside the tax issue, where else would Google and Facebook seriously go to access the European, north African and Middle Eastern markets other than an English-speaking country?  It seems to me that they would not do so.  Given the nature of their products, it is simply inconceivable that they would try to sell them from anywhere else other than Ireland, England or Scotland.

If we test the Deputy's hypothesis and it blows up in our face we cannot go back and will have lost the benefit of the stability of the regime.  If we are going to test the Deputy's hypothesis we would want to think very carefully before doing so.  I would be risk-averse in that regard.  I believe the cost to us of losing this spectacular stability which we have built up would be significant.  However, that is for the Oireachtas rather than me to decide.</p><p>  On the Deputy's question in regard to where else in Europe American companies would go to sell advertising space, the Deputy will be aware that Irish people are not good at languages and so we have to import into Ireland people with the language skills to do this selling.  The fact that we are an English-language environment is obviously of importance to American companies but it is not in my view the huge advantage that the Deputy portrays it to be.  Dell initially set up here but when Poland joined the EU it moved there, where labour costs are one-quarter of what they are here.  The English-language environment was not significant in that instance.  Also, as young people across Europe tend to be pretty good English speakers, it is a declining advantage to the extent that it is one.  There are genuine differences of opinion on these issues.  I think we can fairly disagree on those things.</p></speech>

This was prior to the availability of the Seanad report.  Since then, we have had formal preliminary investigations into Ireland's sweetheart deals with multinational corporations, which in time will be proved or disproved.  This boils down to something Professor Barry said earlier.  Professor Barry, along with the Minister for Finance and everybody in this room, knows that there are companies incorporated in this State that are non-tax-resident here or anywhere else in the world.  One such company is Apple.  There are many other such companies.  The Department of Finance does not know how many such companies exist but we do know there are a number of them.  These companies do not pay tax anywhere in the world.  I have suggested that there is a way to deal with this.  The fact that they are not tax-resident anywhere else in the world but are incorporated here means they should be automatically deemed tax resident here.  This is allowed.  It is what we did in 1999 with other companies.</p><p>  Professor Barry said we need to be careful.  He and the Government have stated that it is not Ireland that is the problem; rather, it is an anomaly in the tax code in America, which is true.  However, there are two tax codes involved.  It takes two to tango.  It is Ireland's tax code and the American tax code.  Professor Barry stated that he does not believe the Americans will change their tax code.  He is probably correct in that regard.  However, Ireland does have the ability to deal with this on its own.  We can change our tax code.  It must first be acknowledged that Ireland can deal with this.  It can deem a non-tax-resident company incorporated in Ireland liable for tax here.  The question that arises is whether we should we do this and whether we want to do it.  </p><p>  On the question of whether Ireland is a tax haven, setting aside the OECD criteria, which do not really exist, in people's minds it is a tax haven.  If we acknowledge that we can change the rules to allow Apple Operations International, AOI, to pay taxes in Ireland because it does not employ anybody here or does not pay taxes anywhere else in the world but we decide not to do so, then what we are doing is allowing multinational companies to locate here and use Ireland to avoid paying taxes.  That is the reason people believe, rightly or wrongly, that Ireland is a tax haven.  Most companies on the high street pay their taxes.  They cannot access the consultants who have access to the Minister for Finance or his officials to write the tax code for them.  They pay their 12.5% taxes.  The question is, can we do something about this?  Professor Barry stated earlier that America could change this situation overnight.  Ireland also could change the position in relation to the company mentioned overnight.  If we do not change this overnight, which I know we have the power to do, are we facilitating tax avoidance on a grand scale in our tax code?</p></speech>

We have the ability to scrap all of our laws and to adopt American law.  This means multinationals would then not be able to exploit any gap between our laws and American laws.  Would the Deputy support this?</p></speech>

However, that is one way of closing it.  As long as there are differences between the tax laws in jurisdictions, high-paid lawyers will find ways to exploit them.  The only real way of closing down this opportunity is to adopt American tax law, which none of us support.  Let us say we closed this down significantly.  Multinationals, which are located in 180 countries worldwide, will continue to seek to identify differences between US tax law, which is the one with which we are most concerned, and other countries' tax laws which they can exploit.  If Ireland no longer offers them the opportunity to do so they will seek to identify those countries which offer significant opportunities.</p><p>  I referred earlier to the introduction in Britain of the patent box and to the Netherlands keeping an eye on what we do.  Singapore and Ireland are in strong competition.  There will be other countries that will not have totally closed down the opportunity for multinationals to operate between the cracks, which is what they do.  We could do it but it would be hugely detrimental to us and the companies would go elsewhere and exploit the cracks between those other jurisdictions' tax code and that of the US.  Why would we do that?  Why would we shoot ourselves in the foot?  At national level, we claim to support what the OECD is trying to do - that is, addressing this at a multinational level, which, as I stated earlier, we stand to benefit from.  Obviously, in trying to do the right thing, we have to take into account the interests of the country.</p></speech>

Ireland was certainly not the first country to provide such credits and I am not sure if those available here are more generous than those provided elsewhere.  These tax credits are primarily responsible for the gap between the 12.5% tax rate and the figure of between 11% and 12% which was cited.  One makes the calculation that there is a gross taxable profit in Ireland.  At that point, the research and development tax credits kick in and one then arrives at a net taxable profit on which the tax rate is levied.  Deputy Boyd Barrett's figures are different.  He referred to certain costs being deducted from taxable profits.  This means one deducts these costs from profits to arrive at a figure known as taxable profits.  We started with a figure of &euro;70 billion and the Deputy then referred to a number of costs that are deductible from this figure.  Irrespective of whether these are valid costs, they are, I presume, legal.  They are deducted and the number one ends up with is profits that are taxable in Ireland.  When one applies the corporation tax rate to this figure the number one arrives at is not 6% but closer to 12%.  I would need to examine the numbers.</p></speech>

It is difficult to split the two.</p><p>  Listening to Professor Barry's reference to the number of people who had to be brought into the country to fill posts in certain companies, I noted that we do not have the relevant policies evaluated when we discuss amendments and so forth to the annual Finance Bill.  We could be giving a substantial number of tax breaks to intervene in labour markets in other countries on the basis that, as Professor Barry noted, we have neglected language teaching.  This is part of general policy evaluation which does not appear to take place for tax breaks.</p><p>  This year, the Finance Act included a tax break to aircraft leasing companies for the construction of hangars to house aircraft.  The airline industry informs us that it is extremely profitable and Ireland performs very well in this sector.  What is the point of providing a tax break in this area if one does not evaluate what one receives in return?  This is a recurring issue.  Professor Bill Kingston, who is a colleague of both Professor Barry and mine, is so despairing of this practice, particularly since the rescue of banks at considerable expense to taxpayers, that he describes it as the end of Schumpeterian capitalism.  In Professor Kingston's view, one will have so much lobbying that hardly any productive activity will take place.  This is a strong way of putting the argument.  I am worried, however, that firms are diverting resources into this area rather than producing goods and services.</p><p>  Members will raise some of these points tomorrow when representatives of the Revenue Commissioners come before the joint sub-committee.  Professor Barry's treatment of the issue has been extremely interesting and the three hours have passed quickly.  I thank him for appearing before us.</p></speech>
