He is joined by Ms Sharon Greaney, who is a senior auditor in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Alan Farrell and Mary Lou McDonald.  The minutes of the meeting of 9 March 2017 have been circulated.  Are they agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising that are not on the agenda?

I would like to mention an issue that has arisen since the launch and is now in the public domain.  Approximately &euro;800 million of loans were sold in private.  They then seemed to be outside normal rules and procedures.  Will the Comptroller and Auditor General clarify whether that will be looked at in any of his reports coming up in the near future?</p></speech>

We are working on a section 226 report that will examine the progress made by NAMA with the achievement of its objectives over a three-year period.

That is all I will say.</p> <p>  No. 3 is correspondence received for today's meeting.  No. 343A is a briefing document from the Department of Education and Skills.  We will note that.  No. 346A is the opening statement from the Secretary General.  We will note that.</p> <p>  Category B comprises follow-up correspondence received from Accounting Officers and Ministers arising from previous meetings. Nos. 300B (i-iii) and 331B are correspondence dated 17 February 2017 and 8 March 2017 from the Secretary General of the Department of Defence, Mr. Maurice Quinn.</p><p>This is a follow-up to the appearance of the Department before the committee on 26 January and a subsequent information request.  That was held over from our last meeting.  Having examined the reply, there are a number of questions I believe we need answered.  I propose that we ask the secretariat to draft a letter and if any member wishes to have an input to the letter, he or she should please contact the secretariat.  It was in to talk about the sale of the Government jet in Savannah when it was there at that time.  A number of issues have been brought to my attention which I wish to put in writing to the Secretary General.  If anyone else has something to include in the letter, he or she should contact the secretariat as the letter will be sent in the coming days.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> No. 336B is correspondence dated 6 March 2017 from Ms Niamh O'Donoghue, Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection, providing a breakdown of payments on the free travel scheme.  We agreed to note and publish that.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We might send a reminder to the Secretary General to submit information to the committee that we requested on the Social Insurance Fund or the redundancy fund in terms of amounts that had not been collected.  I do not recall the exact title.  The information is months overdue.</p></speech>

It relates to toll roads so members who have an interest in that can follow it up.  There is also reference to the swimming pool programme and a number of other issues.</p></speech>

I will send them to the secretariat.  A wide range of issues is covered but I am interested in particular in the Department's knowledge regarding the decision of Norwegian Airlines, which changed the way in which it viewed Ireland and came to Dublin Airport.  I really want to dig into when the Department knew.  According to that documentation it was very late in the day, which to me is almost unbelievable.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 344B and 351B (i) to (vii) are correspondence dated 16 March 2017 from Mr. Tony O'Brien in relation to records concerning the meeting on 2 February 2016.  That has been circulated.  Also circulated yesterday was a copy of the documentation released by the HSE under freedom of information.  Both of those items relate to this afternoon's meeting and we will deal specifically with them then.</p> <p>  No. 347B is correspondence dated 10 March 2017 from Professor Philip Lane, Governor of the Central Bank, providing clarification on whether allegations made about a specified credit institution were forwarded to the European Central Bank and also providing an explanatory note on the processes and procedures involved in the transfer of certain assets.  The correspondence is marked "private and confidential: subject to legal professional privilege".  The clerk requested clarification on what the Central Bank means by that but I am now informed that our legal advisers have said we can note and publish that and send it back to the people concerned.  There is reference to the eligible liability guarantee, ELA, scheme and constructive ambiguity is the way they describe how they manage the scheme.  That is a new buzzword in government.  I will let members interpret that as they wish.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-23a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032300002#B01000"><p>Are we getting an interpreter?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-23a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032300002#B01100"><p>I think it is designed not to be interpreted.  That is my view of that letter.  Members are free to follow up the correspondence with whoever has contacted them on the matter.</p> <p>  We now turn to category C correspondence which relates to private individuals and any other correspondence.  Nos. 333C(i) and (ii) are from Mr. Aidan Sweeney of IBEC providing a policy brief to the committee in relation to local authorities.  Is it agreed that we note that?  Agreed.  Members can use it as they wish.</p> <p>  No. 34C is a letter dated 4 March 2017 from an individual raising a number of environmental issues and the lack of joined-up thinking across State and semi-State organisations.  Is it agreed that we note that?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 335C is a letter dated 8 March from an individual inquiring about the status of an OPW examination of cases in relation to land transactions being carried out in 2015 where there was potential for corruption.  The secretariat has contacted the OPW for an update on the case or the results of the examination.  When we get the information, we can forward it to the individual.  Is it agreed that we note the correspondence and hold it over until we get a reply?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 337C is a letter dated 10 March from the National Transport Authority providing a note on the licensing of bus services operated by Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Is it agreed that we note that?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 338C and 340C are from an individual alleging a series of issues in relation to the Garda, the HSE and her workplace.  A number of people are specifically mentioned.  This is a sensitive case and relates to a number of loosely related matters.  The clerk has spoken to the person by phone also.  While we would like to be helpful, it is not within the scope of the committee to investigate the specific matters.  It also appears the individual may be not be clear in terms of how the issues can be best examined.  I propose we write to the person explaining the committee's role but indicating that she should contact the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission if she believes an issue arises in connection with the Garda; that she should contact the Medical Council in relation to alleged medical mistreatment, to which she referred in the letter; and she should contact the Workplace Relations Commission to seek advice on work related matters.  Beyond that, I do not think we can do a whole lot.  Her letter gives rise to wide-ranging issues.  We want to be helpful to the person but it is not a matter for us.  Is it agreed that we note that?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Nos. 339C(i) and (ii) is correspondence dated 14 March from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board responding to a request for a detailed note on the overall estimated cost of the new children's hospital development project.  In the letter, it is mentioned that a memorandum is to go to Government in the coming weeks and that costs will be set out and discussed by the Government.  Following that the committee will receive a more complete response.  Does any member wish to comment?  I believe we should hold off on pursuing the issue for a short time.</p></speech>

Obviously when the memorandum is submitted to the Cabinet and published we will need to have the HSE or the Department appear before the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-23a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032300002#B01300"><p>There is a special board - the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board - as well.</p></speech>

There is confusion as well in terms of some of the issues around who is the Accounting Officer.  We must find out who that is as he or she needs to attend as well as the relevant bodies.  That is an issue a number of members have raised.  We tabled parliamentary questions and got a similar response in terms of a holding statement pending the memorandum being brought before the Government.</p></speech>

All the questions were not answered but we got some helpful information.  We will come back to that once the Government clears it.</p> <p>  No. 341C is dated 13 March and is from the Department of Health in relation to the North Meath Community Development Association.  Members will recall we have had a number of items of correspondence on this matter.  The Minister's office has reviewed the matter and liaised with the HSE which believes it is complying with its commercial obligations.  From the committee's point of view, I believe we cannot take it further, as it is essentially a contractual dispute between the association and the HSE.  I propose we write to the North Meath Community Development Association and advise it accordingly that the committee cannot take the matter any further at this stage.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 345C is dated 16 March 2017 and is from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in relation to the Water Framework Directive.  I propose we forward a copy to the correspondent who raised the matter, who happens to be the same individual who wrote to us in relation to the environmental issues discussed earlier.  We are still waiting a detailed response from the Department following our recent meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 348C (i) and (ii) is from Nursing Homes Ireland dated 16 March 2017 providing a submission to the committee on the HSE response to the committee in relation to residential care costs.  I think members may want to consider this further.  I propose that we have another engagement with the HSE sometime after Easter and that could be one of the issues we will discuss.  Since the committee first met in the second half of 2016 we have had the HSE in to speak on several occasions, including on Console.  Recently, the HSE was in to speak specifically on nursing homes and patients' private fund accounts.  Today, Mr. O'Brien is in to deal with the record of the previous meeting, but the committee in the normal course of events would schedule a full meeting to discuss HSE matters.  We will schedule a meeting and that issue can be included.  We have not had the HSE in to discuss its accounts for the year.  We will set a date for that and deal with the issue then.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>No. 349C dated 21 March is correspondence from an individual raising matters in connection with Bord na gCon accounts.  The individual suggests we get the figures for the first quarter of 2017 when we engage with Bord na gCon.  The secretariat is working on a date for that engagement and we will ask for the latest figures to be available.

It may be a valuable opportunity to share and learn from other committees' experience.  It will be a one-day meeting in the UK on Monday, 12 June.  While I personally cannot attend on that date, if any members would like to avail of the opportunity to attend they should contact the secretariat.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General will be attending separately.  He will not - it is for public accounts committee members and staff.  Anybody interested in attending should let the clerk know who will do up an estimate of the cost of the trip and we can clear that at a subsequent meeting.  </p> <p>  The next item is No. 4 - report, statements and accounts received since the last meeting.</p></speech>

The Environment Fund received a clear audit opinion and has &euro;46 million turnover.  The Travellers Protection Fund, Travel Agents and Tour Operators Bond Accounts received a clear audit opinion but in 2015 it appears that only &euro;10,000 went through the accounts.

I was impressed by it.  That is all I will say.</p> <p>  The next item is the work programme.  There is a draft work programme in front of us now.  Today we have the Department of Education and Skills and the HSE in the afternoon.  The HSE will be here to deal with the record of previous HSE meetings.  </p> <p>  We are scheduling the Higher Education Authority for a meeting next Wednesday and are suggesting 5 o'clock.  We had intended dealing with it this afternoon but because of the HSE issue, we have moved the HEA to next week.  We want to get it in before we meet with the third level institutions.  On Thursday, 30 March we have UCC, Dundalk Institute of Technology and University of Limerick.  On 6 April, we have Waterford Institute of Technology, Dublin Institute of Technology and National University of Ireland Galway.  The meeting with the Higher Education Authority is scheduled for 5 p.m. next Wednesday but it may have to be moved because the business committee is considering the timing of the D&aacute;il debate on our report on Project Eagle.  There is a question of it being taken in Government time which will be next Wednesday evening.  If that is the case, we will have to change the time and make the meeting with the HEA a little bit earlier.  We will know when the business committee finishes its work today.  We will come back to the committee if there is a change of time in that.  We thought it might be on Wednesday morning at 11.50 a.m. but it might be taken in Government time on Wednesday so our meeting might have to move a little bit.  That is 6 April.  </p> <p>  On 13 April, we will have the Department of Education and Skills in to deal with the special report on the residential institutions redress fund and the follow through on that.  Representatives from Caranua will join us for that meeting.  There has been a lot of public discussion about Caranua.  The following week is the Easter break and we are not sitting that week.  The D&aacute;il is not sitting the week after that either so there is a two-week D&aacute;il break.  Do members want to sit that second week and have a meeting to deal with some of our issues or are we happy to leave the two-week break?  I do not detect any gushing enthusiasm for an earlier meeting.  We will move on.</p> <p>  Provisionally we have the Revenue Commissioners set for 4 May.  On 11 May we have the Department of Finance.  There is an issue we have to deal with.  I have gone off script here.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-23a.83" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032300002#D00400"><p>The 2015 appropriation account for Vote 26 - Education and Skills records gross expenditure of &euro;8.73 billion.  In addition, the Department administers the National Training Fund, NTF, which recorded expenditure of &euro;334 million in 2015.  The Vote and the fund are managed together within an overall spending limit which is set by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p> <p>  On the income side, receipts into the Vote as appropriations-in-aid totalled &euro;549 million.  Over 93% of this, or &euro;513 million, comprised employee pension contributions and pension related deductions from teachers&rsquo; and other education sector employees&rsquo; salaries.  Receipts into the fund, totalling &euro;370 million in 2015, come mainly from a statutory training levy collected on the Department&rsquo;s behalf by the Revenue Commissioners as part of employers&rsquo; PRSI contributions.  </p> <p>  The gross Vote expenditure was spread across four expenditure programmes, as shown in the graph now on screen.  Note 3 in the appropriation account gives a more detailed breakdown of each of the programmes.  As the graph shows, the preponderance of expenditure was in the first, second and early years education programme, at 71%, followed by the higher education programme, at 17%.  Over 87% of the &euro;6.2 billion voted expenditure on first, second and early years education relates to the pay and pension costs of teachers, special needs assistants and non-teaching school staff.  Other substantial areas of spending included in the programme are capitation and other grants to schools and the cost of school transport.  This programme also includes spending on residential institutions redress, about which I have reported separately, and which the committee has indicated it will examine in the coming weeks. </p> <p>  Expenditure under the higher education programme was &euro;1.5 billion.  This consists mainly of grants to third level education institutions of &euro;922 million, channelled through the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and student support grants totalling &euro;414 million.  The original Vote Estimate provided for student support grants of &euro;332 million, down from &euro;372 million in 2014, representing a reduction of around 11%.  The outturn for the year was 25% higher than originally provided and was funded substantially by a Supplementary Estimate provision of &euro;78 million.  The committee may wish to note that student support grants are administered nationally on behalf of the Department by the City of Dublin Education and Training Board, CDETB, under the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, system. </p> <p>  Expenditure on capital services in 2015 was &euro;655 million, made up of &euro;577 million in building and equipment grants across the education sectors, &euro;66 million in payments under public private partnership, PPP, agreements and the balance of &euro;11 million in administration costs.  Forward capital commitments under contracted PPP arrangements at the end of 2015 amounted to an estimated &euro;478 million, as indicated in the notes to the account.  When recurrent commitments under the PPPs are included, the total legally enforceable commitments amounted to an estimated &euro;1.34 billion.</p> <p>  Almost all of the &euro;330 million spent on skills development under the Vote represents funding provided to SOLAS, the further education and training body.  SOLAS income in 2015 was &euro;591 million which included the grant funding received from the Vote and funding of &euro;279 million from the NTF. </p> <p>  The overall grant funding provided to the 16 education and training boards, ETBs, is not evident from the appropriation account.  The boards were established in 2013 following the dissolution of vocational education committees, VECs.  In addition, they took on certain training functions of the former F&Aacute;S.  Excluding the student support grant funding provided to CDETB that I referred to earlier, over 90% of the combined income of the boards, which is estimated at around &euro;1.5 billion in 2015, originates from the Vote or the NTF.  The first, second and early years education programme covers ETB teacher and other salaries and school capitation grants.  SOLAS provides funding to the ETBs for further education and training and finally, building and equipment grants paid to ETBs are financed from the capital programme. </p> <p>  About a month ago, I published a special report on financial reporting in the public sector.  In that report, I highlighted a general problem around the late finalisation of the ETB financial statements for 2013-14.  These were the first financial statements for the new boards.  A number of the new boards had difficulties putting the required reporting arrangements in place across the revised areas of operation.  At present, statements for the 2013-14 period of account for Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB remain uncertified.  The 2015 financial statements for 11 of the ETBs have been completed and presented to the Oireachtas and the audits of three ETBs for 2015 are at various stages of progress.</p><p>Two education and training boards, ETBs, have not yet produced draft financial statements for 2015, namely, Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim ETB, and Limerick and Clare ETB.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-23a.86" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032300002#E00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss the 2015 appropriation accounts of the Department of Education and Skills.  We have provided the committee with briefing material and, accordingly, in the interests of making best use of the committee's time, I will keep my opening statement short.</p> <p>  The Department's net voted expenditure in 2015 was nearly &euro;8.2 billion.  Of this, &euro;621 million was capital expenditure.  In addition, the Department's expenditure ceiling included the non-voted national training fund, which had an allocation of &euro;362 million in 2015, providing for upskilling and re-skilling for both of those seeking employment and those in employment.  The Department received &euro;549 million in appropriations-in-aid.</p> <p>  Approximately 80% of the Department's overall budget is accounted for by pay and superannuation.  In 2015, this provided for over 98,000 public service employees and over 44,000 public service pensioners.</p> <p>  The Department's expenditure is subdivided into four expenditure programmes.  Programme A provides for first, second and early years' education.  The overall expenditure in 2015 was &euro;6.2 billion, which among other things, covered pay and superannuation for teachers and special needs assistants, grants to schools, including capitation, costs associated with teacher education and provision of school transport.</p> <p>  Programme B covers skills development, including upskilling and re-skilling that meets the needs of individuals and the labour market.  The overall expenditure from the Vote in 2016 was &euro;329 million, which among other things, covered grants to Seirbh&iacute;s&iacute; Oideachais Leanunaigh agus Scileanna, SOLAS, in respect of further education and training.  It also provides funding for support of the European Social Fund and European Globalisation Adjustment Fund's activities in Ireland.</p> <p>  Programme C supports learning, research and innovation opportunities in the higher education sector.  Expenditure in 2015 was over &euro;1.5 billion, covering grants to higher education institutions, superannuation costs, research, student support and related costs, international activities and grants to the Higher Education Authority.</p> <p>  Programme D covers capital services and supports the planning and provision of appropriate infrastructure for learning environments through the Department's building programme.  The total expenditure in 2015 was &euro;655 million which covered the costs of building, equipping and furnishing of schools, higher education capital costs and costs associated with public private partnerships.</p> <p>  The Department was voted a Supplementary Estimate of &euro;175 million towards the end of 2015.  This made provision for an increased allocation of special needs assistants, increased superannuation payments in the schools and institute of technology sectors, an additional allocation for higher education student support and provision for summer works scheme.  The Supplementary Estimate also took account of a projected shortfall in the level of receipts to be brought to account in 2015.</p> <p>  I am conscious the issue of timeliness in the submission of accounts and financial statements is a matter of concern to the committee.  It was flagged as an issue in the Comptroller and Auditor General's recent special report.  The report acknowledges the background to these delays, including the pressures which resulted from the public service moratorium, the significant organisational change which has taken place in the ETB sector and the particular complexities which pertain in the university sector given the significant amounts of non-Exchequer funding.</p> <p>  This is an issue which the Department is taking seriously.  We have been engaging with sectors on measures to improve reporting capabilities, including filling critical vacancies.  In our engagement with our bodies, we have strengthened our emphasis on the importance of timely submission of accounts.  We have also stressed the importance of communication and engagement with the Comptroller and Auditor General's office to ensure a collaborative approach to addressing issues which arise.</p> <p>  More widely, we see our response to this issue as part of an overall effort which the Department is undertaking to further develop and implement robust and consistent governance arrangements across the education sector.  Our aim is to ensure utilisation of public funds is achieved within a framework of high standards of performance, accountability, compliance and oversight.  A management board committee on sectoral governance and accountability, which I chair, was established in 2015.  This committee provides overall guidance on the enhancement of governance arrangements across the education sector.  This has included enhancement of audit oversight in certain sectors, as well as ensuring enhanced compliance-reporting structures are in place specifically to address the timely clearance and certification of financial statements.</p> <p>  The committee also reviews work on governance enhancement across the education sector, for example, rolling compliance reviews being undertaken by the Higher Education Authority, roll out of the financial services support unit at primary school level and work to review the code of practice for the governance of education and training boards.  The management board committee is complemented by a principal officer sectoral governance network, which includes principal officers with responsibility for public service bodies.  An internal audit education sector forum has also been established.</p> <p>  A specific sectoral governance unit has been set up in the Department.  This unit provides support to the management board committee and principal officer network, as well as undertaking work to support the enhancement and standardisation of governance and accountability oversight across the Department.  This has included rolling out of the first phase of a programme of governance compliance reviews involving the Department's non-commercial bodies.</p> <p>  This is an area we will continue to focus on, having regard to good practice and developments in governance generally, including issues which have been identified by the Committee of Public Accounts as part of its work programme.</p></speech>

Will people please turn their mobile phones to airplane mode?  Even when phones are on silent, when they are receiving calls, e-mails and so forth, they can still interfere with the recording systems.

I will start with pay, given it is such a large percentage of the Department's voted expenditure.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report highlighted how administrative staff salary overpayments at the year-end were &euro;394,000 in 262 cases.  This is almost treble what it was in 2014 when there were overpayments of &euro;113,000 across 84 cases.  Are there particular circumstances which give rise to this level of overpayment?</p></speech>

This is part of the overall shared service for payments in the Civil Service.  We are still in the relatively early years of this shared service and we continue to have difficulties with the timing of informing and updating PeoplePoint and the Payroll Shared Service Centre.  It is really around the information flows and enhancing those to the largest extent possible.  We have been working on this in partnership with the shared services.  This has been assisted by the publication of the circular on public service bodies and the recovery of payments from staff, which sets out the administrative arrangements for the overpayments made to staff working in various public service bodies made by PeoplePoint.</p> <p>  Overpayments in 2016 provisionally stand at &euro;335,000 with a total of 135 cases.  We have been working on those and we have recoupment plans in place for all 51 of those.  We are working on the rest now.</p></speech>

What is the situation with those and the other 50 odd mentioned by Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;?</p></speech>

The issue about payments also has to do with the flow of information about people being on sick leave, taking career breaks or incremental days.  Those are the sorts of issues that can arise between the PeoplePoint system and the payroll-shared services system.  We have to get the flow of information as accurate as possible.  I am not seeking to find fault with the shared services; it is a shared issue between ourselves and them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-23a.94" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1304" speakername="Noel Rock" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032300002#F00400"><p>It sounds like a natural enough evolutionary process.  I notice there are other overpayments as well, including supplementary pension overpayments.  At year end it was &euro;2.6 million, which is similar to the 2014 figure of &euro;2.8 million.  There were 320 cases found when the Department's superannuation section carried out a review of pensioners aged over 65 who are in receipt of the supplementary pension.  Why did they receive supplementary pension payments when they would also have been in receipt of a State pension?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-23a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032300002#F00500"><p>The previous question was about Department staff directly.  This question really concerns teachers, primarily, who are also on our payroll.  We operate the biggest payroll in the State.  We have, I think, just over 100,000 payees.  The supplementary pension is a top-up pension paid by occupational pension providers in the period between retirement and age 66 to public servants who paid class A PRSI in order to ensure that they are not disadvantaged.  It is a rule of the pension scheme that a supplementary pension should cease or be abated as appropriate when a pensioner applies for and comes into receipt of the State pension.  This fact would have been documented to pensioners.  The advent of new pension legislation in late 2012 facilitated the sharing of information between this Department and the Department of Social Protection.  In late 2012 and early 2013, the Department conducted an analysis of those pensioners over 65 who were in receipt of a supplementary pension.  On completion of this analysis and a follow-up exercise, about 320 teacher pensioners were identified as being in receipt of a supplementary pension to which they were no longer entitled as they were also in receipt of a State pension from the Department of Social Protection.  Payment of the supplementary pension ceased as soon as possible and the overpayment calculated.  The gross overpayments amounted to &euro;2.7 million, however, net of statutory deductions they were likely to be in the region of &euro;1.5 million.  We have been putting arrangements in place for that to be rebated.  Now we share information with the Department of Social Protection to ensure that it does not recur.</p></speech>

We were not in a position to have detailed data sharing in place with the Department of Social Protection.  As soon as the new pensions legislation was passed, we were able to get the information from the Department of Social Protection.  Prior to that, we were relying on returns from individuals.</p></speech>

Again, there was a similar figure in 2014 when there was an overpayment of &euro;3.3 million and 3,835 cases.  I understand there are recovery plans in place for all these overpayments.  In effect, is the Department saying there is nothing it can do to prevent these overpayments, and that it is an accepted part of the system that it will overpay a certain amount and then have to recoup a certain amount?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-23a.105" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032300002#F01500"><p>Nearly, but not quite.  We accept that overpayments will always occur for certain reasons, but we are seeking to minimise their extent.  They can be generated by both external factors, outside the control of the Department, and by internal factors.  A typical example of an external factor would involve data submitted by managerial authorities.  This Department acts as a paymaster on behalf of managerial authorities of over 3,700 schools.  They have voluntary boards of management so we are dependent on them submitting the data required at the right time and so on.  There are issues there.  For example, if a person is no longer employed and a school is no longer in receipt of an acting up allowance, we need to be told on time and there can be a slowness there.  Another example of overpayments that have occurred in recent years is when there have been major policy changes with insufficient time being allocated for the implementation of policy decisions.  There is a range of different factors.</p> <p>  In terms of internal ones, not just to blame external factors, there could have been a payment of salary on the incorrect point on a scale, payment of an incorrect allowance and of course there could human error.</p></speech>

The full realisation of that will take some time, so we are not really into planning the standing down of the authority, although that would certainly be something.  I do not know whether we plan to stand it down or maintain it as a continuing body.  There is a lot of needed development under way.  There are the PPPs, the traditional builds, the sale of buildings by DIT, building and so on.  There are also capital requests for further development on the site.  I do not think the development agency is really reflecting on whether it might not be needed because the outlook is very busy for a good five to ten years.</p></speech>

In terms of other capital expenditure and the disposal of capital assets, the Department transferred control of 15 schools, valued at &euro;128 million, to school authorities in 2015.  Will Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; explain how that works to the committee?  Does the Department still retain ownership, as distinct from control, of these schools?</p></speech>

Under that model there is a trust involved jointly between a religious order and the education and training board, formerly the VECs, or the community schools.  The predominant model was the denominational school model.  We have effectively stopped that model for new schools.</p> <p>  The model we have now is that the Department sources the land and enters into a lease agreement with the patron.  It may be land for a brand new school being established, in which case there is a process to decide on patronage, but equally it may be a school moving or expanding and needing a new piece of land.  We would normally buy that land now.  In exceptional circumstances the denominational body may have land they wish to provide but that is becoming very rare now, so we normally buy the land.  We, therefore, have ownership of the land for the future.  </p> <p>  In terms of releasing the interest in land that was previously held, that would generally occur where a school building is not in use any more and may no longer be needed.  Generally, the Catholic Church or another church body would have ownership of it.  The Department would have an interest, a lien, because of its investment and would get some repayment from the owner to release that interest.  It would typically be fairly small.  Typically, these cases occur with buildings that are no longer in educational use.  Sometimes we waive that.  Often we waive it if the building is going to continue in community use.  We would generally only seek payment if the building is being sold on for further use or if it is entering into commercial use.  Generally, we would not seek repayment of moneys where it was going to stay in local community use, unless it was a high figure.</p></speech>

I might move on to something that is a topic of interest for me in particular, if the committee will indulge me.

Typically, the Irish Research Council is involved in postgraduate fellowships and doctoral support and funding would depend on the time of the commencement of the work, but it has to allocate and commit to an individual or a group of individuals over a number of years.</p></speech>

Doctoral students and postgraduate students are a large group of my constituents, so I often interact with them around these grants.  They are a tremendous support but I am curious about the future plans for, and the current execution of, them.  Are there any plans for further administrative support?  One of the key things that comes up is that people are often waiting months on quite modest bursaries of &euro;16,000 per annum.</p></speech>

I could not say how many people are working on the IRC but I think it is two or three.</p> <p>  I was not aware of any delays in processing.  The processing of payments is one thing, but the IRC also has a very peer-reviewed approach to deciding what gets funded.  The Deputy might be referring to that.  That is at the heart of the work of the IRC and that is undertaken in a very professional, academic way.  The Deputy might be referring to the time to come to a decision in that regard.</p></speech>

I might do that if Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; does not mind.  To zoom out, in terms of higher education grants in general, I noted from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on this that the original Vote provided for student support grants of &euro;332 million which is down about &euro;40 million, or 11% from 2014.  What contributes to this?  Are demographic factors effectively is causing it to come down?  I was somewhat surprised to see it come down so much in a year.</p></speech>

I have appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, although not in this particular session, on a number of occasions regarding Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI.  We had a hearing on it two and half or three years ago.  SUSI is operating very well.  It is processing applications in line with its objectives.  Obviously, it is very difficult to get that flow of information completely right, but it has been bringing back the time from which people can apply to as early as possible.  It has been processing those quickly.  Partly as a result of that, grants and fee payments are being processed more speedily.</p> <p>  The manner of releasing tranches of money to individuals was reviewed and revised and was brought forward a bit because of the pressures on individuals in the first term.  It pays slightly higher amounts to individuals in the first term than it did previously.</p> <p>  Similarly, having regard to the financial position of the higher education institutions, the timing of payments to those has been revised a couple of times.  We have tried different ways of doing that.  We are trying to maximise the appropriate way to transfer money from SUSI to the institutions.  We are particularly conscious of a few issues.</p><p>One is that not every recipient of student support completes his or her course.  Particularly in first year, there is an issue about completing the first term.  We have to be careful about that.  Also, people want to have their grant protected so that if they attend only half of the first term, they have protection in place if they seek to commence another course.  Issues such as that arise.  It is a matter of making sure we have appropriate arrangements in place.  There is a complex set of different arrangements that we put in place to bring that forward.  Particularly in the context of the Supplementary Estimate, we brought forward the payments to institutions given that higher education is in a very tight funding position.  We did not want to be under-funding from SUSI into the higher education sector.  We wanted to make sure that we were funding appropriately.</p></speech>

I appreciate that.  I thank the Chairman.  It is rare that I use up more than my allocated time at this committee.  It is fair to say the number of complaints concerning SUSI has gone down substantially in the past 24 months, in particular.  Therefore, the Department is to be commended on that work and on the work in general.  Having looked at the report, I noted there are very few anomalies and flags raised.  I thank Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; for his answers to questions.  Most of them were on timing issues, to be frank.  Broadly speaking, the Department's work is to be commended.</p></speech>

The first issue relates to the amalgamation of the VECs into the ETBs and the big change of which that was part.  They were effectively new State bodies which were amalgamated State bodies from the ETB.  That was the first issue.</p> <p>  On the second issue, concerning amalgamation, where we were amalgamating two and sometimes three former VECs into ETBs - both of the ones that were talked about here were actually three VECs coming together - they would have had different financial systems and so on.  We had reduced staffing as a result of the amalgamation so we have been working through, with the Comptroller and Auditor General, the form and manner of the accounts.  We have been working through the updating of the systems and we are putting in place a shared financial services system, which is under way in planning, as well as a shared payroll system.  We are working that through.</p> <p>  For the ETBs that were particularly challenged, we have prioritised additional resources.  They are seeking to address this.  The particular one that has not completed the initial set of accounts has had to do a manual check through all its work.  It is working through that manual check at the moment.  It hopes to complete that in the next short while - we are talking weeks here - and it will move immediately to a manual check of the payments for the following year.  It is an 18-month account followed by a 12-month account.  The ETB is very conscious of the need to do that.  To be fair to that ETB, the VECs that make up that ETB actually had been fairly efficient in returning their accounts previously so it is not that they comprised an inefficient organisation coming in; it is just the mixing of the new organisation having regard to the staffing.  Particularly in Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim, there was a long-term sick-leave issue in the leadership of the accounts.  There were a number of different factors that gave rise to the issue.  That is not to say that the ETB is complacent about it.  We are certainly working very closely with it and, indeed, the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.</p></speech>

In 2015, we got a Supplementary Estimate.  We actually got a commitment earlier in the year that enabled us to allocate the money, which then was confirmed in the Supplementary Estimate at the end of the year.  The Supplementary Estimate for the summer works scheme was of the range of &euro;50 million in that year so we were able to fund activities under the scheme.  The summer works scheme is a programme that we had to curtail a little bit in the depths of the downturn but we have been able to allocate around &euro;40 million or &euro;50 million per year in the past couple of years.  It is an important way for schools to be able to work through and plan their own refurbishments.  Unfortunately, we never have sufficient funds to fund every request under every one of the categories.</p></speech>

On the capital side especially, there can be occasions where we can get some additional one-off funding.  The advantage of Supplementary Estimates in the capital space is that they do not have continuing costs, which are a continuing ongoing cost.  It has been the case that we have been fortunate enough to have Supplementary Estimates in the capital space on a number of occasions.  For example, it could give rise to us being able to bring more schools to construction than we would initially have been able to bring to construction.  The summer works comprise another example.</p></speech>

Other typical fraud issues would have been where schools might have over returned the number of pupils which caused an over-allocation of teachers and so on.  We have taken two major steps in this regard, the first was to put in place a primary pupil database as well as a post-primary pupil database so that no more than one school can claim for one individual.  Every child has a personal public service, PPS, number which minimises the chance of overpayment for capitation or over allocation of teachers.  The second is to enhance the audit arrangements for schools and we are commencing a financial services support unit for the primary sector to enable it to have a support service to help in its financial provisions and eventually to put in random audits of primary schools.  We are taking extensive steps to ensure that the frauds do not occur.</p></speech>

We face this difficulty across the board in the education sector.  If somebody has engaged in a sufficiently large fraud that would be referred to the Garda or to human resources and industrial relations processes.  The school would have to repay any over allocation.  We would have to be careful if there was a penalty system in place not to penalise allocations which support the children in the school.  The allocation of non-pay funding to schools is very tight.  We had to reduce capitation several times during the downturn and we have not been in a position to seek to increase it since.</p></speech>

Why was the Department not tax compliant in respect of these payments?</p></speech>

It arose in two areas, one of which was home tutor payments which were made directly by the Department to home tutors.  They were subject to pay as you earn, PAYE, pay-related social insurance, PRSI, and universal social charge, USC, but the Department had been making the payments on a gross basis with the tutors required to make the returns.</p><p>The second one related to board and committee members.  Payments were made by the Department to such individuals on a self-employed basis and subject to a deduction of professional services withholding tax.  However, they should have been treated as office holders and subject to PAYE, PRSI and USC.  There were differences in interpretation which we worked through with Revenue.  We obviously had to repay the money to it, but it did not impose a penalty.</p></speech>

Revenue officials visit and discuss issues with us and can start audits arising from these visits, if Revenue so wishes.  We have a detailed internal audit service in place which carries out a range of audits.  We have an independent internal audit committee chaired by a person external to the public service - a retired accountant.  We work through these areas.</p></speech>

Home tutors have since been put on the payroll operated by the Department such that tax issues are dealt with automatically through the payroll system.  One of the engagements we had with Revenue was to address this issue in order that it would no longer arise.</p></speech>

This relates to financing for youth employment initiatives.  The level of youth unemployment is still relatively high compared to European standards.

I stress that, as the programme was adopted in February 2015, the deadline for claiming the 2014-15 allocations is end-2018.

It is not at the discretion of the Minister to increase expenditure under the fund but at the discretion of the Government.  Under the expenditure rules, to increase the level of that expenditure other expenditure by the Exchequer would have to decrease.  It is not bonus money available to us to be spent on education and training.  It would be great if it was, but it is not.  Therefore, jointly with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we have issued a discussion paper on the national training fund outlining options for increasing funding for further and higher education and training.</p><p>Funding relating to the national training fund is referred to under that.  We are considering the potential for increasing that.  Any increase in taxation would not be caught under the European rules for increasing expenditure more generally.  If the level of tax was increased, it would be additional expenditure which the State would be allowed to undertake within the European rules.  That is my understanding.  We are consulting on that, but if we were to spend more on the national training fund now, it would just take down the rest of our voted expenditure.  It would circle off.</p></speech>

In 2008, the core grant for WIT was &euro;40,134,565.  In 2016, the core grant was &euro;26,000,460, which is a very substantial cut in core funding over that period.  The level of student enrolment has remained static but the funding has been cut from &euro;40 million, essentially, to &euro;26 million.  Could Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; talk to us about the funding for institutes of technology and his understanding of the percentage of pay as against core funding in respect of institutes of technology?  Is it a problem?</p></speech>

Therefore, as I understand it, the absolute reduction is not as absolute as that set out by the Deputy.  He is talking about the core grant.  There is now increased student contribution.  That is not to deny a significant reduction in the funding of higher education.  We understand that this is a difficulty and a challenge.  We obviously had to reduce expenditure during the difficult times-----</p></speech>

The student fees in 2008 for WIT amounted to &euro;10.203 million.  The fees in 2016 amounted to &euro;6 million.  The total funding in 2016 for WIT was &euro;32 million.  In 2008, it was &euro;50 million.  What Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; just said certainly did not happen in Waterford or Carlow institutes of technology.</p></speech>

Does Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; know the percentage of pay as opposed to core funding in institutes generally?  I can give him the figure for Waterford.  It is 87%.  Does it not trouble him, as Secretary General, that such a high level of the core funding goes towards pay, even though the institutions in question are staff-heavy?  Is the figure of 87% of concern to him?</p></speech>

Clearly, people are the business of higher education institutions, and pay levels for people are a key part of running an institution.  We have an ECF number for each institution.  WIT, from what I recall, is about four or five staff members above its ECF level.  We are concerned that it is slightly above its ECF level.

It is always encouraging when the Comptroller and Auditor General furnishes the committee with a clear audit opinion.  I seek elaboration on a few matters.

I refer specifically to whether there is any scope for innovative finance mechanisms in terms of the European Investment Bank or public private partnerships.</p></speech>

My understanding is that all of the submissions to be made under the capital review are to be published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  As I am talking in advance of the publication I must be a little careful.  However, in our capital implementation generally we are seeking to be as innovative as possible.  Public private partnerships, PPPs, are one way to do that and the European Investment Bank is another assistance.  In fact, the European Investment Bank assists in public private partnerships.  We have a number of PPP projects under way.  The fifth bundle of the schools PPPs is under construction at present and obviously the Grangegorman-----</p></speech>

That is under construction at present.  We have a commitment to two big developments in higher education.  One is a &euro;200 million bundle of higher education PPPs and the second is Grangegorman, where we are hoping to advance arrangements very speedily.  We have undertaken an exercise with higher education institutions relating to future funding of capital developments.  We put a call out to them regarding areas for which they would wish to have funding.  We will examine those in the context, hopefully, of the Government deciding to give us additional funding under the capital review or, possibly, in the context of the &euro;200 million programme of PPPs to which we are committed.  The European Investment Bank is one of the primary funders under the PPPs, so that is a good way to access funding.  The European Investment Bank is also a funder of developments in the university sector, which is very useful.  It enables them to borrow in addition to the commitments they get from the State.  It also can replace other areas of Exchequer borrowing in our capital plan.  We always work closely with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform so that some of the borrowing for the schools or other developments may be funded by the EIB.  That would be organised centrally by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We would not be directly involved.</p> <p>  A further area of innovation, and it is one we are very conscious of, is the balance in funding where it occurs, particularly in higher education and in the university sector, but not uniquely.  There can be elements of philanthropical investment, so the full cost need not have to be borne by the State.  A building might be 50% funded through private sources, so the State investment is not the full investment.  Obviously there can be good returns for the State in that regard.</p> <p>  There are a number of different ways in which we are seeking to be innovative.  I would not rule out any other options in the future because it is an area we seek to keep under review.  If there are other ideas and ways in which we can access different funding or assist institutions in accessing different funding, we would be very supportive of that.  Obviously we must be careful about indebtedness in the sector.</p></speech>

The Department does not wish to limit itself and it is encouraging that it is using innovation to obtain funds.  With regard to the further education and training courses, outside of apprenticeships, what mechanisms are in place to ensure we are getting best value for money given the large amount we spend on these courses?  We should bear in mind that we are asking businesses to pay more in this area.</p></speech>

We established SOLAS as a funding and regulatory authority for the further education and training sector.  That was with a view to enhancing the responsiveness of that sector, to have central planning in place and to have local autonomy in terms of the role of the education and training boards, ETBs.  We brought the former F&Aacute;S training centres under the ETBs and gave the training centre responsibility to the ETBs.  A number of reviews are under way on different aspects of further education and training expenditure by SOLAS.  The first, which is nearing completion, is a review of the post-leaving certificate courses, PLCs, provided in the ETB sector.  That is being undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and there will be recommendations.</p><p>I think SOLAS may have the report but it has not made recommendations to us on the way forward.

I have not seen it but I heard about initial outcomes from it.  It is being, or is about to be, finalised.  SOLAS has been working on developing its relationships with the ETBs in moving towards a more performance-based framework of funding.  It is trialling some arrangements with some of the ETBs about what capacity there is to move in that direction.  There have been movements in terms of funding mechanisms to try different streams and aspects of funding to move things around.  Obviously, we are dealing with a lot of public sector employees so there are limits.  However, there is some capacity that is used to tender for provision of services.  Combined with that, a lot of work on outcomes is under way.  A training programme participants annual survey by SOLAS is under way to look at completion rates and so on.  We are also looking at arrangements to put databases in further education and training in place so there can be follow on regarding the effectiveness of provision in order that we can see not just from returns from people but also from looking at Revenue records on an impersonal basis and social welfare to see where people are six months or a year on from having a completed a course.  We are doing the same thing in higher education and, indeed, with the same information in primary and second level education, we can get flows the whole way through so we can follow a typical learner's progress because, obviously, we would not share the individual information.</p></speech>

The main interaction is the one between businesses and further education and training institutions and higher education institutions.  We have established a regional structure so that we can enhance the dialogue at regional level between employers and institutions in further and higher education.  We have published a discussion paper about investment in further and higher education.  I am not aware of responses having been received.  To be fair, there is a range of businesses.  They range from SMEs up to the big multinationals.  There is a recognition of the need to have sufficient funding in place for further and higher education and training.  I did not talk about the apprenticeship developments but those are under way as well.  It is a challenge for them.  To be fair to them, in our dialogue with them, some of them have been supportive of considering increases in the national training fund, NTF.  Listening to what they have been saying, they would like to see commitments from the State at the same time.  This is the first year in a number of years where we have been able to enhance the budget in higher education with the additional &euro;35 million we received in the budget.  Businesses would like to see a mechanism where there is balanced increased investment by the State if they are to put in increased investment.  There is a third element to that, particularly the question around whether there is increased support in higher education from the learner's point of view.  The Cassells report is under consideration at the moment by the Joint Committee on Education and Skills so we are looking forward to seeing the response to that.  It is a balanced range of different areas.</p></speech>

It is a very ambitious action plan.  I think there are 139 specific actions in it with timelines and identification of responsibility.  What will be the main obstacles and challenges in delivering that?  I wonder how multidenominational patronage will work out.  I think five to eight schools per year have that because we know that 90% of schools are Catholic.  I do not think that will be enough because 500 multidenominational schools are envisaged by 2030 and I do not know how we will achieve that target.  That is a particular area in which I am interested.  Could Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; tell the committee in general terms about the action plan for education because it is to be commended?  How achievable is it given the challenges and obstacles it will meet?</p></speech>

We are working on the basis of quarterly reporting on activities and on the basis of an annual report on actions.  We find it very valuable to be able to plan in a joined-up way for the education and training sector.  It is effectively a plan for us and our national agencies combined and we are seeking to do it in partnership with them.  There is a wide range of different aspects across all areas.  One of things we are trying not to get lost in, although it is important, is the issue of resources being the only thing.  Yes, there is a dependency on resources to expand provision but everything does not depend on additional resources.  We must look at how we can work resources; be more efficient, which is the business of this committee; decide to stop funding areas; change funding; and seek to increase funding having regard to the resources available to us.  It gives us a coherent way to seek to do that.  There are different challenges in each of the different sectors.  There are challenges for the Department and the national agencies in terms of prioritising.  We would operate a number of overlapping strategies within the action plan.  An example of that would be the national skills strategy, whose actions are embedded in it, or the literacy and numeracy strategy.  We have a number of those.</p></speech>

There are a number of different ways in which we are seeking to address that.</p></speech>

New schools are being established and a process is in place where a new school is established and the local population - the parents whose children are in or about to go to school -  is consulted on that.  We can look at having regard to that and other criteria regarding what the patronage of newly established schools will be.  In primary education, while there will continue to be some, we do not expect that an extensive number of new schools will be established because the primary school population will begin to decline in 2019.  The post-primary school population is-----</p></speech>

The peak birth year is already in primary schools and the decline will be from the 2020-2021 school year onwards.  That is not to say that other things cannot happen.  Immigration will change and so on.  The peak year for post-primary education is 2025-2026 so we are looking at huge expansion in second level education.  We have established about 30 new 1,000-pupil second level schools and we will have many more.  Many people here will be aware of those in their own constituencies.  They are not just in Dublin.  They are across the board.</p></speech>

There are two other ways in which we are seeking to enhance multidenominational provision in addition to new schools.  One is what was called divesting arising from the report of the forum on pluralism.  A number of areas were identified and we seeking to negotiate in those areas for existing schools or school buildings that might not be in use or other public sector buildings to be transferred to our ownership or leased to us to enable us to open schools.  We have succeeded in about eight or ten schools in that regard.  I have the precise figure but I do not have it to hand.  We have initiated a further process where we are seeking to engage with the ETBs, communities and existing school patrons to see if there are possibilities for patronage change.  We are trying in a number of different ways.  It is a challenge because we do not own the school buildings.  The school buildings are owned by the local communities.  Regarding support for change in the community, if one takes a community that might have five schools, each of which might contain 20% who would like a change, it means that there is no majority for change in any of the five schools.  However, in the area as a whole, possibly a total of a single school population would wish to change.</p><p>This is down to negotiation in communities and so on and we see a potential valuable role for the education and training boards in having an involvement so there is not a perception of a top down approach from the Department in communities.</p></speech>

They are particular issues around the times of the year and the times of the day that schools are in heavy use.  They all operate on an energy efficient basis.  Our specifications are going up and up and, therefore, the requirements on new schools are increasing all the time.  We use the summer works to fund upgrades for older schools.  We have a small section in the planning and building unit which works on ensuring the planning is as up to speed on all these issues as possible - we have a few experts - and they are incorporated into the guidance for buildings.  For example, we trialled the use of different aspects of energy efficiency.  Some worked and some did not in a school context.</p></speech>

If I follow this up separately, will there be documentation available?  I am thinking of a scoil l&aacute;n-Ghaeilge in Galway.  It cost a fortune.  That is not the Department's fault because it related to the compulsory purchase of the land.  It must be the most expensive school in the country.

Retrofitting is a more challenging area, which can be done under the summer works.  Due to demographics, we have had to prioritise expansion of schools and the need to have a school place for every child.  We have put significant expenditure into the summer works scheme and so on but there is still a huge demand for further investment.</p></speech>

This is one of the few countries that turned its education and training system towards STEM and ICT at a very early stage, especially in the further and higher education sector.  We had an expert group on future skills needs, which engaged in planning in sectors.  We had huge investments in ICT and STEM from about 17 or 18 years ago onwards and turned our system in that direction.  We have a very high proportion of STEM graduates compared to other European countries.  We published a skills strategy last year and are establishing a national skills council which we will put in place in the near future.

It was clearly acknowledged at that event that there was a lack of training in necessary skills.  It was a very positive event in which prizes were awarded for first, second and third places in the leaving and junior certificate examinations.  It was clear from speaking to the men and women on the ground that there was an absolute failure in policy at Government level to provide the necessary skills.  While I am glad that Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has indicated that this is now being done, it is a reaction to the failure to do so in the past.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

How can the Department stand over a system in which a certain number of hours are allocated to a school which then faces Solomon's choice as to which child it will select for assessment?  When schools are at their wits' end, they will avail of a private assessment and recoup the money.  Where does the amount paid to the private sector show up in the Department's books?  I understand the Department is in the middle of a review of the service.  Is that information correct?</p></speech>

The aim is to have a tiered service delivery model of casework in working with individual learners or their teachers and parents and also system work to improve all outcomes with learners in order that there will be provision of advice and support.</p></speech>

Am I wrong in stating that until now the role of the service was to provide an assessment for schools based on numbers and that one or two assessments were provided each year, leaving schools with a Hobson's or Solomon's choice, whichever term one prefers to use, to make?

It is not primarily to provide individual assessments.  That is one aspect of what it does.  In relation to individual assessments, I can discuss the matter, but I do not consider it to be the primary role.  The primary role is to assist schools in working with children and where it is not possible for them to do so, assessments are undertaken by NEPS.  The discourse on NEPS has been primarily about the assessment of individual children.  That is not an appropriate description of the complexity of its role.</p></speech>

A certain number of assessments were allowed per annum.  I ask Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; to answer that question.</p></speech>

To bridge the gap Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; outlined, schools were then left to use the private system, which meant ringing a psychologist with whom they were not familiar, paying &euro;500 or &euro;600 and recouping the money from the Department.

This year we are increasing the number of NEPS psychologists by ten as part of the DEIS plan.  These are psychologists who will be assigned specifically to DEIS schools.  In addition, there are about 11 vacancies being filled.  In total, therefore, by the beginning of the next school year in September, we expect to have an additional 21 educational psychologists in the system.</p><p>Recruitment has taken place for that through the Public Appointments Service.  A panel is in place and they are now undergoing Garda vetting.  We expect those psychologists to be in place over the summer.  That is the situation on the supply question.</p><p> The Deputy is correct that in the past there was a right of appeal by a parent to the NCSE in a situation where there had not been an allocation to a child in respect of his or her special need in the low incidence category, such as autism - disabilities which were in the special education review committee report from the early 1990s - and where there was an allocation of a set number of hours in response to a particular disability category.  What we will have is where schools are getting an allocation, it is based on a profile, and within that profile there will be an allocation for complex needs which is akin to what now describe as low incidence.  Each school will have an allocation and it will be a matter for the school to deploy that allocation within the resource.  If the school is unhappy with its allocation, it can lodge an appeal.  There will be an independent appeals process in place for that.</p></speech>

That was the case under the old model as well.  For instance, where an allocation was made and perhaps a parent was unhappy with how it was being handled by the school - sometimes the school might have had an allocation of hours but the school may have used shared teaching and other things to do that - the parent might approach the principal first.  That will remain the case.</p></speech>

At the moment there is a review of the SNA scheme which the National Council for Special Education is leading.

The parent is told NEPS has a role relating to one aspect and special education has a role in another.  The Department must appreciate that it makes life very complicated for stressed parents, and they are all stressed when they have to deal with these issues.  It makes life very complicated.</p></speech>

There would be a lot of concern and we would understand that in trying to change the system from what we had.  A lot of people, including parents, would have talked to us about the inadequacies in the current system.  Obviously, changing that creates uncertainty so we have met with all the education partners repeatedly on this and they are broadly supportive. Groups such as the National Parents' Council have been very supportive of this.  At the moment, the special education section combined with the inspectorate and NEPS and the NCSE are doing a series of information sessions with schools to explain how this is changing.  There was one in Croke Park this week for primary and post-primary schools, and there will be one next week in Limerick.</p> <p>  To pick up on the earlier point about NEPS role, it will continue to have a role on resource teaching even under the new model but the role will be different.  It will be more supportive of schools.  Instead of NEPS spending time doing assessments, that time can be used more profitably assisting schools, working with pupils and teachers to support their needs.</p></speech>

Parents who could afford to spend the &euro;500, &euro;600 or &euro;700  were able to get a NEPS assessment in the private sector and return to the school and it was accepted.  That was fine for those who could afford it, but how about all those who could not.  Where was the equality in that system?</p></speech>

People who could afford it could procure that assessment and then come in to school and say they wanted five hours a week or whatever it might be.  The idea now is that the school would be given an allocation so it should create equity.  It is not about an ability to pay but about identifying the children with the greatest needs and how can we best meet them.</p></speech>

We are willing to be challenged on that, but what we do not do is respond to requests from patrons of new schools.  We decide on the need for a new school and we are open to engagement from anybody to explore those issues.  Things can change and patterns of movement in and out of cities change.  We do talk to Educate Together all the time.</p></speech>

A lot has been covered already but I have a few questions.  One of the most startling things was the percentage of the budget that relates to pay, as in so many Departments.  It is 80%.</p><p>On a topic related to pay, I wish to ask about a 2001 Labour Court recommendation by the then chairperson, Mr. Finbarr Flood, that local training initiative co-ordinators, LTIs, should have a pay relationship and be linked proportionately to the community training workshop managers.  It was never implemented despite that the LTIs and community training centres effectively perform the same function.  Both of these come under the remit of the education and training boards, ETBs, and are funded and part-governed by the ETBs.</p></speech>

That hearing would have taken place when these matters were funded by a different Department.  We took the transfer in.  Of course, we are willing to respond but I am not aware of that particular industrial relations matter.</p></speech>

How is the Department handling that within the primary school network with regard to the funding and the grants available for autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units?  Is the Department meeting the demand that has been submitted to it?  In terms of the follow-on to post-primary level and the demands on parents to find an appropriate place in the post-primary network, how is the Department facing that challenge?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-23a.457" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032300002#R00600"><p>I might make an overall comment about special education first.  We are spending &euro;1.7 billion in 2017 on special education.  In 2007, we were spending about &euro;800 million.  There has been a huge commitment from the State under various Governments to enhancing expenditure to meet the needs of those with special educational needs.  We are always seeking to try to make it as effective as possible with our SNA review, our new model and the various arrangements we have to support school transport.  Balancing that with what we were talking about earlier in higher education, there has been a huge amount of investment in special education to try to meet the particular needs and try to be as helpful as we can to this group.  We have to acknowledge that in all of the discussions we have.  The issue for us is also about the effectiveness of the expenditure.</p> <p>  Coming back to the specific issue about ASD units, we obviously work with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, on ASD units.  It tries to advise and plan on where there is a need for ASD units to go.  Typically in new builds and new post-primary schools, we put in ASD units as we are doing them.  Typically, the NCSE and ourselves negotiate with primary schools and post-primary schools about the demand.  There is always a difficulty, especially at different times of the year when there is an uncertainty about where demands arise.  I am aware of different cases or groups of cases in which there are challenges.  This has been debated at the Oireachtas committee on education and in the context of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill.  I and Mr. Tattan have discussed it with the Minister for consideration.  We are looking through the issues around ASD units and the demand at second level to try to get an evidential basis for that demand and to see if it is being met.  We believe the system is responding, but we need to double-check that having regard, as Deputy Connolly said, to information that is coming.  We have to be responsive.  We are hearing there are not sufficient places in certain areas.  We are looking at that and at how we can meet that demand-----</p></speech>

Will the witness elaborate very briefly on some of the conceptual ideas the Department is working with?  It would put at ease many of the concerns parents have in terms of availing of space within a relative and easily accessible geographical spread.</p></speech>

However, that is not an absolute.  We have to be careful about that.  We try to have an integration policy.  We try to have the various supports in place as integrated as possible.  We have put a huge amount of effort, in partnership with the NCSE, into ensuring that in terms of teacher allocations, rather than it being a decision made externally to a school, we give sufficient resources to the school to manage it and be responsive in a local context.  We have a review on SNAs at the moment.  I am not sure what the outcome of that will be, but we have hugely increased our investment in SNAs.</p> <p>  We want to encourage children to stay in mainstream second level education.  We want to work with schools to put ASD units in place to enable that to be the case.  With the NCSE, we are working with all schools to ensure that can be the case.  It can be difficult in individual cases to find places at different times.  That is one of the reasons we have a specific proposal in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill to give the power to the NCSE to place a child with special educational needs in a school.  That is an important proposal because we want to get through the difficulty of schools arguing, to a certain extent.  We do not want to do that.  We are obviously also working with Tusla.  It has the responsibilities of the former National Educational Welfare Board with regard to children accessing schools generally.</p></speech>

I turn to higher education, which was mentioned by a number of speakers, and the expert report on same.  Section 2.3 of that report has a startling headline.  I think it sums up the entire report.  The headline reads, &quot;The Contribution of Higher Education to Ireland's Development is Now Threatened&quot;.  It points out, &quot;Core funding per student in Ireland fell by 22 per cent in the seven year period to 2015.&quot;  It goes on to state:</p><blockquote>There is a real danger that all four of the key channels identified above will no longer function well.  While this arises primarily because of the limitation on resources, the funding problem is interacting with other trends in ways that need to be understood.</blockquote> <p>That report recommended that expenditure should increase to &euro;2.4 billion by 2021 and to &euro;2.8 billion by 2030.  It was obviously well debated in the context of the budget, but the allocations within the budget have obviously not met what was set out.  Does the witness accept the figures that were put forward in terms of what has to be achieved?  More importantly, what is his view on the pace of the implementation of attaining those figures, given the timelines that have been set out?</p></speech>

It is a combination of looking at the possibilities from the State, from the private sector and from the learner.  So-----</p></speech>

That was as a result of the Minister pushing and being committed, in partnership with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Government as a whole, to increase investment in further and higher education and training.  I believe it is a very important aspect, and we are equally pleased with it, that the Minister published the consultation paper on the proposed Exchequer-employer investment mechanism on 10 March.  That is a really positive step forward in demonstrating the commitment of Government to the importance of human capital within further and higher education and training.  We are pushing on with the advances and we need further commitments, but there is not just one side of the equation.  We have to look at options and be open to different ideas in ways that have a joined-up approach across the various interests to realise this-----</p></speech>

I accept there was a funding increase, but what was allocated this year was not what was called for.  The witness said the Department and the Minister made a call.  They did.  There were funding reductions in the seven-year period up to 2015.  We also saw increased enrolment in those years as well.  Those were achieved by internal efficiencies, cost-cutting and so forth.  What will suffer and regress if the Minister and whatever Government of the day do not commit to what was set out, given what the witness responded to Deputy Madigan on the question of the primary school figures decreasing?</p><p>We have seen the demographics for the projected 26% increase in full-time enrolments in higher education up to 2030.</p></speech>

In the past few years, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs developed an early childhood care and education programme which also falls under the remit of the Departments of Health and Education and Skills.  People in the early childhood sector find they fall between three stools.  In the Action Plan for Education 2017, one of the key themes is the increased quality of learning in early years.  The Department states:</p><blockquote>We will continue to actively support the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to improve the quality of early year&rsquo;s provision.  We will support the implementation of S&iacute;olta and Aistear (the early years quality and curricular frameworks).</blockquote> <p>The quality frameworks will be supported with training for mentors and training and upskilling of the workforce.</p><p>The recent furore at budget time when a small amount of money, relatively speaking, was given as an additional allocation to the early years sector shows the level of ignorance that still exists in this country.  There are people in this sector who are championing a programme of education and they were belittled by those who were arguing against that allocation of funding and trying to pigeon hole them as simply childminders.  I know Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; would know that those working in this sector are pioneering education there.  I would hope that the Department of Education and Skills would be an advocate for them and that it would speak about this sector coming within its remit.</p><p>In regard to the commitment in its action plan to deliver quality learning, the majority of people the Department is assisting are working for the minimum wage and my question is whether this is acceptable.  I also addressed this question to the Secretary General of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs when he was before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Is it acceptable that the level of pay for staff who are being asked to implement Government policy initiatives in early education is so divergent from the pay of primary school teachers?</p></speech>

We do not fund that sector.  In my position as Secretary General and Accounting Officer, it is not appropriate for me to give an opinion.</p></speech>

This is really important for the future of Irish education and has the potential to play a significant role.  A section of our Department supports the quality provision in the sector embedded in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We have a group of inspectors in the Department of Education and Skills funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs doing early years inspections on a systematic basis for the first time.  We have supports, again led by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, for children with special educational needs in the sector for the first time in the past year following dialogue between ourselves and the Department of Health.  An increasing amount of support and resources are going into the sector.</p> <p>  There is a need to change and upskill over time.  That takes investment and we are working with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in that regard.  We hope to see significant changes over time in the effectiveness of education generally as a result of having the two year preschool experience in place on an universal basis.  We are really positive about that.  We do not shy away from working with the stakeholders across early years education in that regard.</p></speech>

Those pioneers and champions of early years education have stood outside the D&aacute;il on two occasions in the past 12 months, seeking an admission by Government of their role.  I have made the point that they have fallen between stools, because, as Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; said, it not under his remit.  When I put the question to the Secretary General of the Department of Children and Youth affairs, he said that we are only assisting a sector that is effectively private but both Secretaries General are asking them to implement Government policy.  The people in the early childhood sector are working for the minimum wage.  I will continue to raise their concerns because they are the first rung of the education ladder for our young children.</p> <p>  I also wish to focus on the anticipated fall off of admissions to primary schools.  Will somebody square this circle in terms of the national planning framework that is being discussed at present and a projected population increase over time?  Areas of development and growth are being identified.  One of the major headaches for the Department for Education and Skills during the period of the noughties was the proliferation of prefab schools due to the population explosion.  I have been in the Department of Education and Skills' fine offices in Tullamore where one sees the chart of the hot spots.  In terms of getting ahead of the curve and working with the Department in anticipated population growth areas, given that Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; believes there will be a population fall off in primary admissions, what role has the Department of Education and Skills had with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government at this stage?</p></speech>

It is not so much that prefabs to extend schools is the issue, rather making sure that when there is a new area for development, there are sites for schools, perhaps one or two primary schools and a site for a post-primary school.  That is what we are seeking to achieve and we have much better framework in place in partnership with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government to achieve that</p></speech>

We tend to look there rather than to new schools, but in the context of demand for multi-denominational primary education, and indeed not just multi-denominational, the Irish medium is in the same space.  We look at a combination of factors at any one time and take account of all of those issues.  There have been cases where we have sought to put schools onto land owned not by religious denominations, but the private sector.</p></speech>

It is very stark.</p> <p>  We are doing that in conjunction with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, with its estimates across the public sector for the number of pensioners in the public sector and how that will be funded.  Reports have been published by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on future numbers of those who will be subject to public sector pensions.  The high number of pensions was one of the reasons given for putting new pension arrangements in place.  The pension-related deduction was put into place for public sector workers because of the scale of the pension demand going forward.</p> <p>  We have workforce planning under way with regard to the number of employees in the number of sectors and the funding available for schooling, both further and higher.  The schooling issue is primarily dependent on the number of pupils and the further and higher issue is dependent on the level of funding.  The levels we have entering further and higher educational training and the proportion of the population which goes on is dependent on the resource.  A very high proportion of the population goes on to further and higher educational training.</p></speech>

A very fine piece of work has been done there and will be developed over time.  Parts of DIT will be moving onto the campus and then buildings will be freed up.

A number of those are rented, so it would cease the rents, and a number are owned by DIT directly.  I do not think there is a huge number of buildings, but the plan would be for DIT to sell them to finance the move for increased capacity on the main campus.  I do not think a final decision has been made about the future of Bolton Street and whether it might remain, given its proximity to the Grangegorman campus.  The aim for the other main buildings is for DIT to move from them, free them up and sell them.  It depends on the progress on a number of different factors, and DIT would have to work with us on that, but the idea is for it to provide financing for the new buildings.</p></speech>

In section 6.5 on page 39 of the appropriation account, he deals with, under the redress scheme, the issue of the contingent liability.  Many payments were made up to the end of 2015.  There are still some outstanding and categorised as a contingent liability.</p><p>My question relates to amounts that are expected to be paid by the institutions to the State.  Does the Department have a corresponding figure for a contingent asset?  How does the Department account for what it hopes to get but has not yet received?

Who arrived at the decision that this amount is not due to the Department?  The Department has come to that conclusion; it is not just an accounting issue.  The accounting follows the decision.

I heard what Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; said earlier about how that occurred.  I have some further questions on that process.  Different categories of people will seek home tuition.  There are people who actually opt for home-schooling.  There is another category of people who find themselves in a situation where their children are out of school, often for fairly complex reasons.  They have to go off and find themselves teachers.  Invariably, they are at sea.  I have come across several parents in that category, including those with a child with special needs leading to behavioural issues, etc.  They have to go off and source a teacher for themselves.  They often ask me where they should look.  Does the change in the categorisation of home tutors have any impact in changing policy in that regard?  Obviously, the presumption was that the obligation was on the tutors themselves as almost sole traders, but now they are something different from that.  Does that impact on the changing policy?</p></speech>

It has not changed the policy.  We see the home tutor scheme as being an interim support while people are getting back into schooling in some fashion.  We see that as an interim measure.  We do not have a panel of teachers available to provide home tuition.  We have not taken the route of developing a panel.  That is correct, is it not?</p></speech>

What the new payment arrangement for tutors has done is relieved the parents of the administrative burden of making the payments to the tutor and the Department has taken on that administrative burden through the payment of them through the payroll operated by the Department.</p></speech>

I refer to the commercialisation of some of the school buildings, for example, in the context of after-school activities.  I have no problem with after-school activities.  Some of them, such as dyslexia classes, are educational.  Sometimes those involved are charged commercial rates for the use of classrooms in circumstances where the activity is educational in nature and is of educational advantage.  Is that driven by Department policy or would the Department caution against it?</p></speech>

We would encourage them to have access to other funding but we would not set down that they must charge commercial rates for activities on school premises.  We very much support the concept of school premises being used by the communities outside of school hours.  Schools, including caretaker staff and so on, need to support the use of buildings.  It is not just a matter of a building being there to be used; there is infrastructure around it.  People would not normally be there in the evening, and so forth.  Schools have to pay somebody to come in to monitor the use of the building or to facilitate access.  That may be why a school engages in that activity but it is not something that we regulate.</p></speech>

This is not particularly prevalent, in terms of after-school use, but it strikes me that there is something perverse about a school charging commercial rates for educational initiatives that actually benefit the school and I think the Department should caution against that.  Such initiatives should be encouraged and I am not suggesting that those running the after-school initiative should not have to pay for a school caretaker but they should not have to pay a commercial charge.</p></speech>

Where does choice come into play in terms of patronage, the Irish language and so forth?  In north Kildare, for example, there is demand for a gaelchol&aacute;iste but the Department keeps insisting that the demand be demonstrated, even though it has been demonstrated over decades.  It was demonstrated by the opening of a school in Lucan which is fully subscribed.  Where does choice fit into the decisions that will be made in terms of the allocation of resources?</p></speech>

We cannot expand funding for places, where there enough places available already, for the purposes of choice.  We did that to a certain extent up until 2007 or 2008.  Given the pressures on the budget now, however, allowing a school to go from two streams down to one stream and building a new school next door is not an efficient use of Government money.  In simple terms, it is inefficient to fund for three streams but only have two in use.  However, it is never as simple as that and that is why we want to allow schools to reconfigure in the primary space.  If there is a demand for more Irish-medium or multi-denominational spaces, the best option is for a school to switch.  That way, we do not have to put in the investment again.  That is why we have this exercise with the ETBs.  In the particular case of north Kildare regarding the gaelchol&aacute;iste and an Aonad in the ETB school, that is under active consideration at the moment.  The case is very well made and we have committed to actively examining it.  I do not see that particular case as one involving huge costs.  Hopefully we will be able to sort that one out, given that the demand is shown and there is an expanding number of students in the area.  It is where there is a declining or static number in an area that we have a difficulty.  We just cannot duplicate provision when provision is so limited.</p></speech>

What way does that work?</p></speech>

Our policy was that we did not want to purchase those schools because we felt that we had already invested in them.  We have had some co-operation and in some cases, a minimal amount of money could be paid for a long-term lease.  That is our preferred approach and we are seeking to advance that in our discussions.  We cannot buy back schools that we already partially own but even schools where we only have a small ownership, our preferred position is not to have to buy them back.</p></speech>

I presume that over the years there has been a reduction in legal challenges against the Department.  There was a plethora of such challenges in the late 1990s and early 2000s from parents seeking appropriate education for their children.  Is it safe to assume that has reduced dramatically?</p></speech>

I am not aware of any single one where a policy intervention would be an appropriate measure.  However, we have regular updates that we examine within the Department to see where the trends of legal actions are going.  For example, we would have quite a number of challenges in the pay area, in terms of the steps we took on pay during the downturn.  Hopefully, some of those will be resolved in pay agreements going forward.  That is an example of one area.

That case did not succeed.  We had one where Secular Schools Ireland - if I have that name wrong I will clarify it in writing -  took a case against us in relation to a process for determining patronage.  We had ruled it out of the process because it did not agree to the criteria.  It won its case, saying that we had not made it clear that it had been ruled out because it did not agree to the criteria.  We are now making it doubly clear that if a body does not agree to the criteria, it is not included.  When the Department is entering a new space, issues arise and there are legal challenges.  We have to learn and develop processes to deal with it.</p></speech>

We are scheduled to begin our afternoon session at 2.30 p.m but  I am proposing that we move that to 3.45 p.m.  It is a late start and I know it is inconvenient for members but Government business has collapsed in the Chamber.  The Government wants to bring forward a Private Member's Bill, with the agreement of its proposer, who is Deputy Alan Kelly.  Obviously, Deputy Kelly is here, attending this meeting.  He is entitled to hold his time slot but that will mean that the D&aacute;il will have to suspend for several hours and deal with his Bill later on.</p></speech>

The institutions themselves can engage in the regional clusters that the Higher Education Authority, HEA, has established so that they can work together to respond to employer needs rather than work against each other.  The primary way for the State to intervene is through the performance dialogue with the institutions.  This has now been initiated and under way for a couple of years.  The HEA has a consultation in progress in this area which is examining performance-based funding and so on.  Aspects of that issue could arise in that context.</p></speech>

If a course is on in Dublin and then is put on in Galway, that is a very specific thing.  One would think demand would be there for the two different areas.  The issue is really when neighbouring institutions put on competing courses.  There is an opportunity to address that sort of thing in the performance dialogue.</p></speech>

Can the witness give us the figures as they are?  In regard to the public private partnership, PPP, programme which is covered on page 20 of the Department's accounts, there is approximately &euro;500 million of commitments to the seven projects listed.  The note on page 21 indicates that they all include design, build and financing.  Is the witness able to give us the financing cost in terms of the APR or interest rate for those bundles?  Some of these projects were negotiated a few years ago.  Can the witness contact the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, or the National Development Finance Agency to see whether that &euro;500 million can be refinanced?  Although most of those agreements are in place for 25 years, there should be an opportunity for them to be bought out or refinanced at different stages during the lifetime of the contract.  If the NTMA is able to borrow at extremely low interest rates, I would hate to think the Department is paying 5%, 6%, 7% or 8% interest which the State does not need to be paying.  A 1% saving on that &euro;500 million amounts to &euro;5 million.  If a 3% or 4% saving could be made, it would be significant.</p></speech>

Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; may be able to answer this himself.

This may include protectable IP and know-how.  They can make provision for higher education institutions to have a system for the sharing of income from commercialisation within the organisation, including with the relevant researchers.  It is international practice that researchers may hold shares in spin-out companies.  The national protocol makes it clear that higher education institutions should have policies and procedures in place that minimise or manage potential or actual conflicts of interests.  They have to work within the overall framework.</p></speech>

I can accept the logic because one wants to encourage innovation, research, etc.  The Secretary General has said that there is a national guideline, namely, the national protocol, and that each of the institutes would have their own guidelines.

I have heard what  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; said and I get the issue of encouraging researchers to start up companies and commercialise some of the work.  Is a distinction drawn between researchers who have no input into governance, management and oversight and those who do play a role in this regard?  Does the Secretary General see that it is important to make this distinction?  Does he view the role of the head of research in an institute to be demanding?</p></speech>

It is a matter for governing bodies to oversee if there is a conflict between being in the chain of responsibilities for research funding and having a potential interest in the relevant company.

The information I have been given is that the president of the institute has a role as a shareholder in many of the companies.  Surely there has to be an arms-length distance between president and institute.  It was said that there was no difficulty with the head of research being in such a position and I disagree fundamentally with that but the president is entirely different and this needs to be examined.  There is an alternative review, although I am not sure that is the best way to deal with it.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; understand the concerns?  They have been put to me and I have a duty to put them to him.  Issues of governance and best practice are raised when the president of an institute is also a director and shareholder in a spider's web of companies co-located in the institute which benefit from research grants, and where there is not an arms-length relationship between the institute and researchers who are working for the institute.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; have any concerns at all about this?</p></speech>

In this case we are not aware that there is a cause for concern.  The institute told us what it was doing and that this was the first step it was taking.  It wished to check the situation and put in place a process.  When they come to us at a later stage we will look at it.

A school in Donegal carried out a direct build which came in under budget and ahead of time.  What cost analyses and what ongoing monitoring does the Department do on these?

On the first question, we initially do a public sector benchmark and aim to review PPPs for a number of years afterwards on a rolling basis, to determine if they provide value for money.  We cannot fully complete the review until the 25-year process is finished but we start reviewing the effectiveness of each PPP after approximately ten years.  I do not believe that is done elsewhere and we are seeking to be the first public sector body to do it.</p></speech>

That is as much as I know.</p><p>This afternoon we are dealing with matters relating to the appearance of witnesses from the Health Service Executive, HSE, before the Committee of Public Accounts on 2 February 2016.  At our meeting two weeks ago, certain matters were raised relating to Grace, the case of abuse that was the focus of RTE's &quot;This Week&quot; programme of 5 March 2017.  These matters apparently conflict with evidence given by the HSE to the Committee of Public Accounts on 2 February 2016.  The committee has asked the HSE to correct the record, if necessary, and to explain the reason for the apparent conflict arising from the programme.  I am glad a delegation from the HSE has joined us today to do so and Mr. O'Brien is welcome.</p><p>This is not an opportunity to reopen consideration of all matters discussed on that occasion.  I have received a copy of the statement proposed to be made and I am satisfied that it confines itself to the purpose of the meeting.  Having regard to the fact that a commission of investigation has been established by the Oireachtas, the Grace case must be regarded as <i>sub judice</i>and is effectively under a judge to examine at this point.  I repeat that we are not here to reopen the Grace case and the Oireachtas has established a commission of investigation to deal with it.  We are not a parallel commission of inquiry or examination of the Grace case.  I must be very clear about that.  It would not be in order to go beyond the very limited purposes of this session and put forward questions to witnesses, except to the extent to which they relate directly to the statement made and they are clearly necessary in order to clarify the context of today's statement.  In these circumstances it is my responsibility, as Chairman, to seek to ensure that questions asked are consistent with the purpose of the meeting, genuinely seeking clarification, and do not in any material way otherwise encroach or impinge upon the functions of a commission of investigation.  Accordingly, I expect members who may wish to ask questions to clearly identify the part of the statement from last year to which the question relates and the reason they believe clarification is necessary.</p><p>Before going any further I welcome Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE, who is here along with Mr. Ray Mitchell and Mr. Dara Purcell.  I thank them for coming and I acknowledge that a commission of investigation has been established.  They may have been within their rights not to come in view of the fact that the Oireachtas has established that commission of investigation.  We appreciate them coming before the Committee of Public Accounts to deal with matters raised at a previous meeting.</p><p>I advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Before asking Mr. O'Brien to make his opening statement, I should indicate that the sequence for questions will be Deputy Cullinane, Deputy Catherine Murphy, Deputy Madigan and then Deputy Connolly.  I will confine each Deputy to a ten-minute slot because it is not fair on other members if people go on at length.  If questions are not covered in the slot, there will be another opportunity to come back in.  I will be rigid on that time limit today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-23a.709" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017032300002#RR00600"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee.  I am joined by Mr. Ray Mitchell and Mr. Dara Purcell, who are not witnesses but who will assist me with the documentation.  I have reviewed the transcript of my evidence to the committee on 2 February 2016 as requested.  I note the clarification from the Chairman to the effect that the focus of my contribution should be only on those areas where the record needs to be corrected.</p> <p>  In the interest of garnering as much information as possible to respond to the committee, I initiated an examination of the two matters referred to by the Chairman in his letter to me.  Whereas this examination had not fully concluded when my initial letter was sent to the committee on 16 March, in the interests of providing as much information and clarity to the committee as possible, the examination continued after my initial letter was sent.  Consequently, the committee will note that I sent a second letter to it on foot of further and better information.  I have sought to expand on those aspects of my contribution where issues were raised by the members of the committee as per the Chairman&rsquo;s letter.  I have limited my reply to the specific issues identified by the Chairman and I will focus my contribution on those matters.  Arising from my review of the transcripts, there is one other matter, while not raised specifically by the committee, that I wish to include in this response by way of providing additional clarity.  I wish to stress that the evidence provided by me to the Committee of Public Accounts on this matter has been given with the utmost of good faith and with the sole purpose of assisting the committee and its members in as much as I possibly could at those individual sittings.</p> <p>  As I highlighted to the committee on a number of occasions, the evidence I provided at three sittings in 2015 and 2016 on this matter was somewhat restricted for reasons outside my control.  Given that neither of the two reports - the Devine and Resilience Ireland reports - had been published at that time, I was attempting to answer questions and provide information to members while constrained by the fact that I could not speak openly on matters.  This, as Deputies are aware, was to avoid interfering with a live Garda investigation.  Consequently, words or phrases chosen by me during questioning by members to explain matters would not necessarily have been ones that I would have chosen had I had complete freedom to discuss the information contained within both reports.</p> <p>  I will turn to the question of liaison with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na since 2012 on the matters concerned.  The HSE has been aware since 2011 of live Garda investigations into a number of cases relating to this former foster home.  Since that time, HSE staff at local level have been involved in ongoing engagement and liaison with senior members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who have been leading the investigation into this matter.  Liaison and engagement between the HSE and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na involved many forms, including meetings, the exchange of relevant correspondence and the provision of additional information and files to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as live investigations proceeded throughout 2012, 2013, and 2014.  By way of example, the Conal Devine report was provided to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in July 2012 to further assist it with its ongoing investigations at that time.  In April 2013, HSE staff at local level were advised by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that they would retain files pertaining to Grace as there were, at that point, three further investigations being conducted as a direct result of the investigation into the case.</p><p>Later in August 2013, further files were sought formally in relation to these investigations.</p><p> Furthermore, throughout the years 2014 and 2015 there was considerable contact between AGS and the HSE------</p></speech>

That is what I mean.<br/><br/>That contact, in 2014 and 2015, through Resilience Ireland, was part of the &quot;tracing and look-back&quot; inquiry of the other 46 service users.  Part of this contact involved the development of an agreed protocol whereby no contact would be initiated with the families of the 46 service users until An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, AGS, had completed its interviews.  The HSE continued to receive updates on the live investigation from many channels, including AGS, local health staff and also through other official channels.<br/><br/>For the information of the committee, a schedule of engagements between local management and AGS, from 2011-2015, was enclosed with the letter as Appendix 1.<br/><br/>The committee will also be aware that the Dignam report, paragraph 3.3.5, confirms ongoing liaison and engagement between the HSE and AGS where he states the following:</p><blockquote>There was clearly ongoing contact between the HSE and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in which members of the Inquiry Team were centrally involved.  For example, on the 27th March, 2014, Ms. O wrote to the relevant Superintendent in relation to a meeting arranged for the 1st April 2014, the purpose of which was stated to be &quot;to ensure that all relevant information available to the HSE is provided to Garda&iacute; in the context of the known investigation which you are currently undertaking in the context of a foster ... family in [named location].</blockquote> <p>At the commencement of the committee meeting on 9 March 2017, the Chairman referred to media reports indicating that communication between the HSE and AGS commenced in 2015.<br/><br/>As to the full extent of HSE-AGS liaison and engagement on this important matter, certain media reports over the past number of weeks have been incomplete.  The genesis of the media reports was information provided in response to a freedom of information, FOI, request.  The request was quite specific and sought, &quot;all correspondence between the HSE Social Care Division and the HSE Director General's Office and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the subject of the publication of the Conal Devine and Resilience Ireland Reports&quot; from December 2014.<br/><br/>As set out in the schedule mentioned above, the liaison and engagement with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na between 2011 and 2015 was through the HSE's local office.  This correspondence did not come within the scope of the FOI request and therefore would not have been included in the material released.  Had the requester included the years 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 and included HSE services at local level the information sought and provided would have allowed a more complete picture of the situation, and could have avoided some incorrect media headlines.<br/><br/>While much of the media coverage dealt with HSE contact with AGS surrounding the publication of the Devine report, for completeness it is important to state that the HSE, while aware of ongoing live investigations surrounding the former foster home, did not seek formal clearance to publish the two reports until February 2015.<br/><br/>The convention and standard practice throughout the HSE and the former health boards was that such reports would not be published while live Garda investigations were under way, in order to avoid interfering with AGS processes.  In the case of the Devine report, given that the HSE was made aware that live AGS investigations were under way, convention and standard practice was followed by the local HSE.<br/><br/>For specific reasons, in early 2015 the HSE chose to depart from this convention and standard practice in relation to these matters and, notwithstanding knowledge of a live AGS investigation, decided to proceed towards publication of both Devine and Resilience.  This decision was progressed for the following reasons: the HSE's awareness that AGS investigations were at that stage well advanced; the Resilience Ireland &quot;tracing and look-back&quot; inquiry report was close to completion and the considerable benefits of publishing both reports together; and an awareness of a significant public interest in the publication of both reports.<br/><br/>In this context, following considerable deliberation on the matter, on 24 February 2015 the HSE requested in writing that our legal advisers commence, on our behalf, the process of publication of both reports through formal engagement with AGS and other relevant bodies including the Information Commissioner and Wards of Courts Office.  In this regard, our legal advisers wrote to AGS on 6 March 2015 informing them of our intention to publish both reports in April 2015.  AGS responded to the HSE, through our legal advisers, on 14 April 2015 requesting us not to publish the reports.<br/><br/>Conor Dignam SC in his report, at paragraph 2.5.4.7, notes that in many cases reports should not be published if AGS are of a view that publication is likely to interfere with investigations.  He says, &quot;It is correct and proper, therefore, that the HSE and, indeed, the Minister, should afford considerable deference to the views of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na when deciding whether the Reports should be published or not and it will properly be the case in very many, if not almost every case, that if the Garda&iacute; are of the view that a matter should not be published because it will interfere with a criminal investigation then it should not and will not be published by a public body.&quot;<br/><br/>At paragraph 2.5.4.0, Dignam notes that AGS would likely have taken a position against publication of these reports even if the HSE had sought approval at an earlier stage.  He states:</p><blockquote>However, it is only fair to point out that matters were not straightforward.  It is likely that even if the HSE had asked the Garda&iacute; at an earlier stage the Garda&iacute; would have expressed a concern at the impact on ongoing investigations.</blockquote> <p>Turning to the second area, the reference to the persons involved in the decision to leave Grace in the former foster home, in responding to questions I was doing my utmost to provide as much clarity as possible on this matter.  However, I was somewhat constrained as to the extent of information that I could provide on the basis that AGS had not - at that time - provided approval for the reports to be published and the risk of interfering with a live Garda investigation.  I was also conscious of not prejudicing individuals who may be subject to a HR process.<br/><br/>On many occasions during the course of hearings before the PAC, I highlighted the fact that I was constrained as to how much information I was in a position to provide at that time.<br/><br/>In responding to the specific question, I took into consideration two relevant sections of the Devine report, sections 4 and 5, in particular, section 4.4.15.  Consideration of both sections is important in order to have a full understanding of the significance of each person's role in the key decision events in 1996, in particular, the case conference that occurred in October 1996.<br/><br/>Section 4.4.15 on page 32 of the Devine report sets out the detail of the October 1996 case conference; those involved in same - numbering five people, the decisions made and the actions to be undertaken on foot of those decisions by the responsible professionals - numbering three people.<br/><br/>The information, as set out in section 4, confirms the decision that Grace was (a) to remain in the foster placement, (b) to continue in her day service, (c) responsibility for her care was to transfer to the adult disability services, and (d) a new key worker - from adult disability services - was to be assigned to her case as she would no longer be in the care of the foster care team.  The case conference also decided that any change in her circumstances would be reviewed by the adult disability services and that, significantly, they would progress making Grace a ward of court, the implementation of which was to be followed up by the new key worker.<br/><br/>What is important to note here is that of the five-person case conference, three people had an important dual function: (a) participation in the decision to leave Grace in the former foster home, and (b) carrying out a series of eight actions that needed to be taken in order to make the environment safe for Grace to remain there.<br/><br/>The following sections in the Devine report, that is, page 32 onwards, identify how these key actions were not followed up by some of the three individuals who were tasked with making Grace's environment safe.  In effect, this meant that the young woman was not made a ward of court, nor was her care appropriately followed up.  She remained with the family until she was removed in 2009.</p><p>When I mentioned &quot;a three-person panel, for want of a better word&quot; - that is on page 9, paragraph 8 of the transcript of 2 February 2016 in response to a member's question - it was the three individuals who had this important dual function: decision role and implementation of actions.  For the sake of clarity, this refers to H7, H3 and H12.<br/><br/>I went on to say: &quot;This was made by a three-person panel, for want of a better word, and those three persons are no longer in the public service to be clear about that.&quot;  It is the same section of the transcript.<br/><br/>The three persons to whom I referred - H7, H3 and H12 as per the Devine report - had all retired from the HSE on the date that I made this statement.  The HSE payroll system indicates that all three are in receipt of full HSE pensions.  This indicates that all three are retired from the public service.  It was on this basis that I stated, and believed, that the three persons - H7, H3 and H12 - were no longer in the public service.<br/><br/>On foot of the examination that I initiated, I would like to correct the record of the Committee in respect of H3 as follows: H3 retired from the HSE in 2012 and is in receipt of a full HSE pension that is recorded on HSE&rsquo;s pension-payroll system.  It was on this basis that I stated that H3 is retired from the public service also.  I have now established that H3 provides some specialist clinical services to Tusla on a part-time contract basis.  H3 provided a similar service to the former children and families service - part of the HSE until the end of 2013.  On the formal creation of Tusla in January 2014, any relationship between the HSE and H3 would have ceased.<br/><br/>This information came to my attention yesterday, Wednesday, 22 March, by way of the examination process that I initiated.  This examination was not straightforward as H3 possesses a number of payroll numbers, both pay and pension, across two organisations, within a financial-payroll system that is not sufficiently integrated to allow the many payroll numbers to be attributed to one person.  In light of information that I now have, I wish to correct the record of my information to the committee dated 2 February 2016 at page 9.  H3, while retired from the HSE, is currently in public service on a part-time basis in Tusla.  I wish to apologise to the committee for not being in a position to have had more complete information at the time in February 2016.<br/><br/>As stated by me during the course of that meeting:</p><blockquote>There are many people who were involved in different ways in those processes.  One of the features of this is the disagreements that occurred at different times as to what should have occurred and different people were on different sides of those disagreements.  Some of those people are still working in either the HSE or Tusla.</blockquote><p>That is from page 13.<br/><br/>I further commented at the same meeting: &quot;There are people who are referenced in those reports in many different ways who are currently employed either in the health service or in Tusla, as I said earlier&quot;.  In stating this, I was acknowledging that there are other people who were involved in aspects of decisions around Grace, both in 1996 and at other times, who currently work in the HSE or Tusla and who may face disciplinary action now that both reports have been published.<br/><br/>Finally, I refer to level of funding to the voluntary provider.  During the course of my opening statement last year on page 6, I discussed levels of funding for the voluntary provider for the years 2009 to 2015, inclusive.  The budget for the voluntary provider involved was set out together with a comparison of the percentage increase or decrease in budget relative to the percentage increase or reductions across the area and nationally.  Following the committee meeting, the figures were disputed by the voluntary provider in question.  As part of an engagement with that organisation, I gave a commitment that I would undertake an independent external review of funding to which it was agreeable.  This independent external review by Deloitte is now nearing completion.  That concludes my opening statement.</p></speech>

What Mr. Tony O'Brien is telling me here today is that there were standard procedures and processes in place in the HSE that while a live investigation was ongoing, it would not publish reports of that nature.  In other words, what Mr. O'Brien is telling me is that it was the HSE which made the decision up to April 2015 not to publish the report.  It was not because of any advice from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Would that be fair?</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien says that in the middle of 2012 his Department had received the report.  From the middle of 2012 up to February 2015, no action was taken to publish the report.</p> <p>  What I am hearing from Mr. O'Brien is that the reason for that was because he was adhering to standards, processes and procedures within the HSE.

In February 2105, the HSE got advice from its legal team.  In March 2015, the HSE wrote to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  In April 2015, the HSE got the advice.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien is not answering the question I am putting to him.  He has made it clear that the HSE only triggered that process in terms of getting advice from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in February 2015.  From the report landing on the HSE's lap in 2012 up to February 2015, the reason for not publishing a report was not any advice from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but was, as Mr. O'Brien said, down to standard procedures in terms of how these matters are normally dealt with.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

At many times I sought to explain - the Chairman may have been present - that I would find it much easier if I were in a position to give the committee the reports.  I would not have to be seeking to explain things that I knew and the committee did not.  At that point in time, there was a live, in-writing, repeated-many-times objection from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in response to advices from it which had been sought at my initiation.  There was no question at that point in time that I could publish them.  The comments I made were contemporaneous and relevant to the dates in question.

Who was actually on this panel; was it H7, H3 and H12?  It does matter because it is about who actually made the decision or was on the panel that made the decision.  Originally it was said that there was a three-person panel, none of whom remained in the public service.  Obviously we know different now.  This week it was amended to a five-person panel and it was claimed it only referred to three persons who had a dual function.  I am not clear about that.  Can Mr. O'Brien name those in question?  He may well have made reference to it.  It is at variance with the people who have been identified in the Devine report.</p></speech>

What I am telling the Deputy now is exactly consistent with what I told the committee then.  While I know it is difficult, because I was part of that conversation and Deputy Murphy was not, and I recognise that, the persons that I referred to as a three-person panel "for want of a better word" were those persons whom the Devine report identifies as having responsibility for carrying out the eight actions.  It is very clear from a reading of the Devine report that those are H7, H3 and H12.</p></speech>

He relied on the information within the system, which is not a reliable mechanism given that, as he told us, a different staff number is allocated each time somebody has a new engagement.  Is the system capable of searching for a name?  I know there can be duplications in names but it certainly seems to be a very flawed process if one just looks at an original payroll and at whether somebody has retired.  It should be presumed that there is a possibility of re-engagement, particularly if people have retired early, for example.</p></speech>

I asked a separate set of personnel to carry out more recent searches and they have uncovered better, different information.  One of the complications is that we did not have the agreement of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to provide the key - that is to say, the document that sets out who H3 actually is, or H7 or H anybody else - to Tusla until January of this year.  That was another complicating factor.</p></speech>

It seems that those significant shortcomings were then put into cold storage, by virtue of the fact that there was a Garda investigation, of which they were not the subject, although they may well have been an ancillary part.  That prevented the HSE from taking the individuals through a disciplinary process.  Does that not put other clients at risk?  It may well be best practice from the point of view of the personnel but is it best practice in respect of the subject?  I am asking about this in a general way, not necessarily in connection with Grace but in terms of a process being flawed.  How can the organisation possibly act on something if it takes that particular approach?</p></speech>

That is problematic at times, I agree.</p></speech>

I wish to refer to Mr. O'Brien&rsquo;s opening statement.  He referred to the fact that he did not want to interfere with the live investigation being conducted by the Garda.  Is he aware of the correspondence with Commissioner O'Sullivan, dated 23 December 2016, and a letter concerning deputy commissioner Eugene Corcoran dated 15 July 2016?  They have a different version of events from the one made by Mr. O'Brien in his meeting of 2 February.  They both state clearly that the Garda has no objection to the publication of the relevant reports in circumstances where the interests of the affected parties and-or the overall public interest require it.  Mr. O'Brien has corrected the record in relation to some matters in his report but he might just give us his views on that please?</p></speech>

It referenced a letter that had been sent earlier to Conor Dignam by another senior officer, Eugene Corcoran, which was on 15 July 2016.  We have provided it to the committee as part of the FOI file, which was never given to the HSE until it was attached to the letter of the Commissioner, but even after the letter of 15 July we were still receiving written correspondence from elsewhere in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continuing to request us not to publish the reports.</p></speech>

In the letter dated 23 December the Garda Commissioner referred to the fact that the Garda position had not previously been expressed to the HSE with sufficient clarity.  As noted by the Deputy, that is a nice way of saying one part of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was stating one thing to Mr. Conor Dignam, while another was stating the opposite to the HSE.</p></speech>

I forwarded it immediately to the Garda Commissioner with a request that she provide me with the definitive position.  I believe we have given that correspondence to the committee.  It led to the letter dated 23 December and, in turn, to meetings in early January when redacted versions of the reports were cleared for publication.</p></speech>

When Mr. O'Brien gave evidence in February 2016 it was in the context of a general question by Deputies who were asking questions about what happened to the people who made these decisions and where they went afterwards.  I have read the transcript and that was the general context.  In that context, I am asking Mr. O'Brien the same question today because he has now identified somebody in terms of a panel that did not exist.  He has confirmed three persons that he had in his mind and he is not looking at the inquiry which indicated that H7, H4 and H6 made the decision to leave Grace in the home.  Where are these people working now?  That is my simple question to Mr. O'Brien.</p></speech>

We need to have confidence in the HSE, obviously, under Mr. O'Brien's jurisdiction.  Mr. O'Brien is not an island.  I accept that he cannot know everything that went on in the HSE historically.  I accept errors can happen.  Obviously they should not, but they can.  I accept that Mr. O'Brien is relying on others.  He is managing a massive organisation, the largest employer in the country.  Mr. O'Brien must have confidence in the information being provided to him at all times, particularly when he comes before the committee.  In fairness, Mr. O'Brien is so often before committees here that he is here almost every week.</p> <p>  We are here analysing the statement Mr. O'Brien made to the committee and the subsequent statement he made.  On the previous occasion Mr. O'Brien was here, there was a delegation with him which included Mr. Pat Healy.  This committee made requests that Mr. Healy be here again today for the purposes of accuracy on what happened at the last meeting and the statement Mr. O'Brien made, which, obviously, was influenced by Mr. Healy because Mr. Healy is responsible for that area.  Mr. Healy also was not out on radio a couple of weekends ago when Dr. Cathal Morgan, who is an excellent individual and who, in fairness, is only new into the job, was put out.  Why is Mr. Healy not here today with Mr. O'Brien?</p> <p>  The issue for me is that this is the person responsible.  They are a team.  Mr. Healy reports to Mr. O'Brien.  In order to get the accuracy required on the information that we need, surely, given the request by the Chairman, he would be here with Mr. O'Brien.  Why is he not here with Mr. O'Brien?</p></speech>

All the correspondence reaffirmed that.  The last time I was here - the time that we are now talking about - I came in here with a team with less than two days notice and we answered questions for hours and hours and hours, and some of those words are now being parsed over.  I was not going to bring anyone in here at 15 hours notice to answer questions about anything because that would simply be daft.</p></speech>

What was asked on that day by this committee has been complied with to the spirit and the letter.  In the past day, we made a supplementary request but it was not the original request.  That is all I am saying.</p></speech>

It was necessary for Mr. Healy to be here.  I think most of those present believe that.</p> <p>  In fairness, Mr. Healy, working through Mr. O'Brien, accepted responsibility for the fact that information came out that was inaccurate and that needed to be corrected.  We all know that.  That is fair enough.  There is no doubt in acknowledging that.</p> <p>  I am sticking strictly to the evidence.  As a result of the evidence which was given here and the evidence given by Mr. O'Brien in a subsequent letter which was subsequently amended, has Mr. O'Brien confidence that the information - I will narrow it down - being provided to him by this HSE division has always been given to him in an accurate fashion at the time at which it was given?  I am not getting into the terms of the investigation.  I am asking a deliberate question because this is the Committee of Public Accounts.  This is about the linear consistency of information being given to Mr. O'Brien.  That is what I am asking about, not the actual information.</p></speech>

I felt there had been a failure, but I did not think it was an act of badness.  In relation to the apology that was never given to Grace and those who cared for her, as I outlined in my evidence, I met all of the people involved.  It was an extraordinary series of mistakes, but, having looked at them in the whites of the eyes on the Friday before coming here on the Tuesday, I accepted that it had been "monumental cock-up".</p></speech>

Why do we not follow it up?</p> <p>  On the Garda side of things, I might be able to help Mr. O'Brien.  Deputy Josepha Madigan went through the chronology of letters to and from legal people, etc.  Mr. O'Brien is saying that on 24 February there was a process whereby the HSE wrote to the solicitors to ask about engaging in publishing the report.  Was there correspondence some years earlier from the Garda stating there was no reason this report should not be published in the first place?  Yes or no.</p></speech>

At that stage, they were happy that it would be proceeded with and proceed to publication.  What happened subsequently was that they went into live investigation mode.</p></speech>

I will leave it at that.</p><p>Can I get back to the date of 24 February?  Prior to my contribution, Deputy Catherine Connolly was going down a road I would like to go down a little further.  There is considerable interest in the dates of 5 and 6 March.  I accept that there could be a one in 365 chance of it being the day after.  Deputy Josepha Madigan referred to this also.  I do not believe the issue of the two dates is the really important one.  I believe the events of 6 March happened because of the article in <i>Sunday Independent</i>on 22 February.  That was also around the same time Deputy John McGuinness raised the issue of the disclosure in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  That is what prompted the writing of the letter on 24 February.  There is no credible reason for there being such a delay in asking the Garda whether the report could be published.  This should have been a request that was ongoing, or one being made all the time.  Because it had taken this length of time, all of a sudden, the heat was on in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and it was coming from the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  In fairness to both the print and broadcast media then and now, we would not be sitting here were it not for them.  They have done us all a good service.  That was the motivation.  Mr. O'Brien said quite diligently and proudly that he had not received the information on the disclosure until 10 March.  I will check the record, but I am sure it was 10 March.  If I am wrong, I will apologise, but it was around then.  The fact is that these two happenings occurred literally just before the HSE decided to ask the Garda whether the report should or could be published.</p></speech>

It was for that reason that I asked him to initiate a process of dialogue with the Garda S&iacute;ochana to do one of two things: ideally to get us into a position of publication, or at least to be clear why we could not publish.  That was the trigger.</p></speech>

The issue in relation to the health committee, what was happening in this committee, the stuff that was appearing in the media after a period of years, these all pressurised - that is the only way it can look here - the HSE into finally asking the Garda.

I understand on 5 March a disclosure of non-publication of the report was issued to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The next day the HSE wrote to the Garda seeking to publish the report.  At that stage, the report in question was the Conal Devine report.  My concern on this is that subsequently, when the HSE gave evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts and was questioned on procurement issues surrounding the report, the HSE said there were no procurement issues.  When Dignam later reported, he said there were considerable issues around procurement.  I am concerned about a process where we are spending public money and, in a very sensitive issue such as this, looking to get independent advice which is very clear and objective.  Does Mr. O'Brien believe there were procurement issues surrounding that?</p></speech>

The information we provided was that the procurement complied with the EU directives, that is true.  However, as the Dignam report pointed out, there was not provision in the HSE's internal procurement regulations to avail of those directives.  Consequently we have accepted the conclusions of Mr. Conor Dignam SC, that it would be appropriate to ensure that what had been custom and practice was properly reflected in the internal regulations.  He also accepted that the circumstances in this case were such as to amount to exceptional circumstances within the meaning of the procurement policy and the National Financial Regulations Act of the HSE, thereby permitting a derogation from normal procedures.  He then says:</p><blockquote>It does seem to me that the HSE was justified of derogating from the normal process and in those circumstances was not obliged to engage in a tender process.  Indeed I agree with the HSE submission that such a tender process would probably have been inappropriate and unworkable given the subject matter.  There was therefore no inadequacy in relation to complying with the relevant procurement rules, arising from the fact that the contract was not the subject of an open tender.  One can readily see why such a process would have been wholly inappropriate.</blockquote> <p>He also says later on, and I cannot quote the precise words right now, in relation to Dignam that it represented fair value for money. </p></speech>

There is a difference between non-publication and staying on the shelf.  This is important.  There is a general view that somehow the report was suppressed.  It was not published but it was provided to the Garda S&iacute;ochana which to my mind does not equate to suppression.  Deputy Kelly and I have just had a discussion on the sequence of events, what triggered the process by which I asked Mr. Healy to initiate contact between our solicitors and the Garda S&iacute;ochana to seek its agreement to publication, agreement which at that time was not forthcoming in any event.</p> <p>  I would go back to what I said in the opening statement.  It was primarily because the Resilience Ireland report was drawing near.  We were also finding that in the absence of publication, there were a number of processes that we could not proceed with.  That would include HR, as we discussed earlier.  In particular, issues were arising in the political space where it would clearly be in the public interest for us to be able to provide those reports.</p><p>For that reason, we sought the agreement of AGS.  There was much engagement over the course of that summer, including the provision by our solicitors of suggested redactions, to which An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na did not agree at the time.</p></speech>

In terms of the outflow of moneys in the HSE, was it a significant sum for the Resilience Ireland and Conal Devine reports?</p></speech>

I accept that.  However, one imagines it is a significant amount of money for both reports.     </p> <p>  With regard to the regulations within the HSE and transparency, it is hard to see how Mr. O'Brien can say procurement rules were followed.  Let us be clear.  There was a departure in the process within the HSE.  This is all about a process and it is very important for this committee, with respect to a public body that is obviously required to adhere strictly to tender rules, to ensure the spending of public moneys, particularly in such a sensitive area, is objective and independent.  That is important.  It is the rationale for tendering.</p></speech>

I need to be clear.  This is not the way I would have wished for it to proceed.  When I looked back at it, I found that it was in compliance with the directives and that there were exemptions that could be availed of.  There was a great deal of custom and practice in the HSE from the outset with which it was consistent but not the written regulations which the HSE had adopted.  We now have a different procedure in place.  Through open procurement, we have established panels.  Some of this has been reported to the Committee of Public Accounts on previous occasions.  If there is a requirement for short notice and urgent acquisition of investigative capability, there are pre-procured panels and processes by which that can be done.  They mirror some of the processes in place for medical cases.</p></speech>

If somebody is taking that route, obviously it would be prudent to carry out a risk assessment and conduct various discussions if a significant report is to be produced, if it is sensitive and certain exemptions need to be availed of.  However, what appears to be happening is that Mr. O'Brien is presented with a situation where he has a result - two reports - and is now trying to make the process fit the regulations.</p></speech>

It was consistent with what was then custom and practice.  From my view, having looked at it prior to this and more recently in the context of the Dignam report, it was consistent with the exemptions available under EU directives but they were not translated into financial regulations.  However, in this space we have fully accepted the recommendation made in the Dignam report and such practices will not occur in the future.</p></speech>

We have gone through an open procurement process to establish panels of investigators.  It is what is known as prequalification.  It was done in a way that was absolutely consistent with public procurement requirements and on an open basis.  We now have panels established from which we can rapidly draw in a manner that is totally consistent both with value for money and procurement requirements, while also taking account of the fact that sometimes these things must be done in an expeditious and speedy way and sometimes in a way in which one cannot publish a specific tender notice for a particular set of circumstances.  It would not have been appropriate to do so in this case.</p></speech>

That is my concern.  The HSE should be able to identify for the committee if there are tender issues or if it did not comply with its regulations or did not have a certain level of transparency which it should have had but which it now has as it has changed the regulations.  It should be made clear to the committee at that juncture.</p></speech>

That is the way it will be in the future.  We have changed a series of processes in this regard.  The last time we were discussing this issue with the committee in February last year we did not get into the procurement process in a significant way because the Dignam report was already in train.  The view was taken to let it conclude.  We have accepted that recommendation.  Prior to the conclusion of the Dignam review, we had already started the process of putting in place appropriate panels of investigators.</p></speech>

To go back to the Resilience Ireland issue, in the interests of fairness, Dignam says under the heading &quot;Procurement&quot;:</p><blockquote>I do not believe that there is any basis in the documentation for finding that the party eventually engaged, Resilience Ireland, or any of its personnel, lacked independence.  However, I believe, on the basis of the documentation, that the procurement process adopted by the HSE cannot be seen as having been adequate ...</blockquote> <p>What we are doing is making sure the processes are adequate but without an inference that there was any lack of independence on the part of Resilience Ireland based on that finding from Dignam.</p></speech>

Did that mothball the prospect of initiating a HR process - not necessarily in the Grace case - that would deal with it?

I will quote from the transcript of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not know if the secretariat can get it up on the screen; I signalled earlier that I would raise this.  The first question he asked is "Who made the decision to leave Grace in the foster home?"  It is a very clear, explicit question.  Page 88 of the Devine report talks about H7, H6 and H4 being the three individuals who made the decision.  Does Mr. O'Brien accept the question Deputy Deasy asked was "Who made the decision to leave Grace in the foster home?"  He then asked about the whereabouts of those individuals who made the decision and whether or not they were still in the public service.  The Devine report talks about H7, H6 and H4.  Does Mr. O'Brien accept that?</p></speech>

When Deputy Deasy asked Mr. O'Brien who made the decision to leave Grace in the foster home, it was very clear exactly to whom he was referring.  Mr. O'Brien said he had read the report.  If he had, he would have known that the only reference to, in particular, the actual decision in October was H7, H6 and H4.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien was asked earlier whether H7, H6 and H4 were still in the public service, specifically H6, and he said he was not minded to answer.  He then said he would be guided by the Chair.  I ask the Chair to ask Mr. O'Brien to answer the question because it is important that it be answered today.  Mr. O'Brien has acknowledged that H3 is still working with Tusla and acknowledging that H6 still works for Tusla, if that is so, would not identify the person in my view.  I ask Mr. O'Brien to answer the question as it was put to him when he last appeared before the committee.</p></speech>

I let Deputy Cullinane know that I will do that.  If one looks at paragraph 4.4.15, it describes in greater detail the case conference on 24 October and goes beyond the "H" references in the other paragraph, so let us be clear that the meeting had participants other than the three Deputy Cullinane listed.  Also, to be clear, the interaction with the Deputy to which Deputy Cullinane has referred was quite difficult.  When one follows the transcript, it is quite difficult because of the number of interruptions and the question appeared to change quite a lot as we went through.  I was very mindful of that when rereading the transcript.  I am very clear that what I was explaining to the committee - in circumstances where I could not use any H numbers or share the document - who, in my opinion based on reading the report, I had the greatest concerns about.  A reading of the transcript will bear that out.  However, if the Chair is of the opinion that I should tell the committee where H6 works, I will.</p></speech>

He has at least clarified the original question he was asked by Deputy Deasy, notwithstanding Mr. O'Brien's contention that he had a view that the Deputy was talking about other people or at least that Mr. O'Brien had different people in his mind, which is hard to understand.  Anyway, we have dealt with that now.  I have two simple, direct questions for Mr. O'Brien before I conclude, as I want to let other people in.  I still find it hard to understand and it beggars belief that so much time passed from the point the Devine report was furnished to the HSE and the time Mr. O'Brien says today a decision was made in February 2015 to put in place or in train a query to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to whether the HSE could publish the report.  It is incredible it was not done before then.  From 2012 to that date, the report sat on a shelf.  The reason it sat on a shelf is because the HSE let it sit on a shelf.  That chimes with what many people allege, which is that there was a cover-up within the HSE, because they cannot understand why the report was not published.  Mr. O'Brien says the report was not published because of standard practice but that is not what he said when he was before the committee in the past.  I want him clearly to answer the question as to why he did not seek the advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to March 2015 and why the report was left sitting on a shelf for that time period.</p> <p>  My second question relates to the funding issue that was asked about recently.  My understanding is that there has been no contact within the local office of the HSE and the service providers.  If that is inaccurate, can Mr. O'Brien point out the level of interaction and engagement with the local office and the service providers in question with regard to funding and whether there is still an outstanding issue or dispute regarding the funding?  Specifically, I ask about the contact between the local office and the service providers.  Those are two clear questions and I will finish on that.</p></speech>

I preface that by saying it is not accurate to say the Devine report has sat on a shelf.  It was provided to the Garda at the time and the recommendations within it were being implemented even while it was not published.  As I told the Deputy earlier in respect of the period before the approach to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in February 2015, the HSE was doing exactly what it and the health boards had previously done in situations where there were live Garda investigations.  It is often described as "first principles" that one would not expect to publish a report which might have an adverse bearing on a Garda investigation.  I remind the Deputy, if I may, of the extracts I quoted from the Dignam report which described that approach in particular in the context of the advice received as a perfectly reasonable one.  Also, the view was put forward that if any earlier request for the written advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had been made, it was reasonable to suppose that exactly the same response would have been received.</p><p>When I gave evidence here in 2016, I was referring to the reality, which is documented, that from the point at which I initiated proceedings to get the formal advice of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it was strongly objecting to the publication of the report.</p></speech>

I want to give Mr. O'Brien leave to answer the question.  With all due respect, Mr. O'Brien offers up as an excuse as to why the HSE did not contact An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na prior to March 2015 the excuse that if the HSE had asked, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would have said "no".  The HSE did not ask and that is the point.</p></speech>

He said that one of the reasons was that if he had asked - he then cites references to a third party - it would have said "no".  What I am saying is that this is an excuse because he did not ask.

Was any special provision made for Grace after all this?  Was any extra money, therapy or psychological help provided to her because of the trauma she had been through?  Mr. O'Brien does not have to answer.  He might tell me it is not relevant today.</p></speech>

Let us be clear.  I am aware from the discussions I have had with the service provider of the extent it has gone to ensure that Grace was very appropriately looked after.  The question is whether the costs incurred by the service provider were appropriately met by the HSE.</p></speech>

My question was whether given what the HSE knew about what Grace had gone through when she was finally removed in 2009, anybody in the HSE said "Oh good Lord, good Jesus, we need to do something here.  We need to provide extra care - extra help."  It is a "yes" or "no" question.</p></speech>

The correspondence refers to a meeting on 13 March 2012 with AN2, who would be a senior official locally.  It states that there was a meeting with AGS where it was advised of the HSE wish to have the three service user cases reviewed to determine whether further actions were necessary.  There were various discussions about that and there was follow-up correspondence requesting details of HSE staff who had yet to make statements to AGS on the index case so there was correspondence related to matters that were the subject of the Devine report.</p></speech>

Does that not invite a judgment on my part?  I am not attributing fault when I speak about the process being delayed.  I am simply talking about a delayed process here now.  Grace was removed in 2009.  We had our first report, separate from an internal review, in 2012.  We are now in 2017 and the disciplinary process "may" start.  Is there not an inbuilt self-serving idea that if there are sufficiently long delays for one reason or another, no disciplinary procedure will be possible?</p></speech>

I can tell the Deputy that where significant adverse occurrences have occurred more recently, certainly during my time, we have seen much swifter processes.  I would cite the example of &Aacute;ras Attracta in that context.  That would be the standard I would wish to see.</p></speech>

Deputy Kelly mentioned the whistleblowers.  I can tell him what page this is on.  Mr. O'Brien is quoted on page 44 of the transcript.  I think it is important for us to do this publicly.  I am quoting Mr. O'Brien's words:</p><blockquote>It is clear that the whistleblowers have done a significant service through their protected disclosure in 2009, which has led to the Devine and the Resilience Ireland reports, led to the removal of Grace from the setting that she was in and ultimately led to the removal of Ann.  I am absolutely certain that they have done significant service.</blockquote> <p>Does Mr. O'Brien stand by that?</p></speech>

I can say that this is a series of cases with more than one whistleblowing event.  I think it would be foolhardy to use the retrospectoscope to try to figure out what might or might not have happened if there had not been whistleblowing back in 2009.</p></speech>

The whistleblowers have been fairly damning in their description of the HSE.  They feel that they were ignored, set aside, undermined and their professional credibility called into question.  That was their experience of dealing with you.  How does Mr. O'Brien respond to that?</blockquote> <p>To be fair to Mr. O'Brien, I am highlighting that section of the transcript for three reasons.  First, I want to ensure that what the whistleblowers have done for Grace and for the process is on the public record.  Second, it is relevant in the context of Mr. O'Brien's remark about not looking back retrospectively.  Third, I want to highlight what they have suffered over the period of time from 2009 onwards.  Is there anything to apologise to them for?  Again, Mr. O'Brien does not have to answer if he does not want to.  It is entirely up to him.</p></speech>

I was very clear.  I said that the three persons about whom I had most concerns - I had three people in mind based on the information I had at that stage - had left the service.  I was not correctly informed about one of them.  I was equally clear that a range of other people who were also involved were still employed in the public service.  In that case, I was clearly referring to the HSE and Tusla.  It actually took me quite some time to get back to saying it.  Another Deputy gave me the opportunity to complete my answer much later on in the proceedings.  At no stage did I ever give this committee a reassurance that nobody involved in this process was still working in the public service.  I think there is a view that I gave such a reassurance.  The transcript simply does not bear that out.</p></speech>

He continued:</p><blockquote>I know the Deputy will allow me to do so.  I referred in my first answer, when the Deputy asked me for what I was apologising, to a specific decision that was made to leave Grace in the foster home in the 1990s.  This was made by a three-person panel, for want of a better word, and those three persons are no longer in the public service to be clear about that.</blockquote> <p>We have gone through all of this.</p><p>I can see Mr. O'Brien was interrupted but he clearly gave a message following on from the lead-in that the people who made the decision were no longer working.  We know that is not accurate for the one he corrected today.  We now know it is not accurate for the second person who has been identified and a question remains over how many others there are for whom it is not accurate.</p></speech>

I sought to be clear in my opening remarks and I want to be absolutely clear.  The term "panel, for want of a better word", is me saying "panel is not the right word".  Okay.  There were five people involved; three of them had a decision-making and implementation function.  The Devine report makes clear that there was not sufficient follow-through on the agreed actions.  Having read the report and re-read it in the interval between 10 a.m. on Friday morning and 12 noon on Tuesday, which was the amount of notice I had on that occasion, the view I formed was those were the three I would have had most concerns about.  When I asked the question of my staff, "Where are those people?" the assurance I was given was that they were retired.  They were retired but that was not the whole story; one of them had been rehired on a part-time basis and that is what I have corrected today.</p></speech>

I will not get into it because they have asked all the questions I would have.  I do not think it adds up.  It seems that evidence was given and as a consequence of that evidence, retrospectively an argument has to be put forward.  Looking at the Devine report, it does not add up for me and, I believe, for all members of the committee.  We have outlined that fairly clearly.</p> <p>  I want to go into four different areas, staring with procurement.  I acknowledge that Mr. O'Brien is answering questions on matters, some of which preceded his time in the role and some of which did not.  In 2015 the committee received a disclosure.  Mr. O'Brien came in.  He came in in 2016 again.  He told the committee initially that there was no issue regarding procurement.  He told the Minister for Health there was no issue regarding procurement.  Now, in fairness, Mr. O'Brien has come and outlined in some detail that there were issues regarding procurement.  I am paraphrasing in saying that if he had his way again, things would be done differently.  Is that fair enough?  They would have been improved.</p></speech>

I am just summarising.  In fairness, procurement simply did not work 100% the way it should have in the past.  My concern, which is for another day and not for this, is that there is a cultural issue here.  If it happened here, it obviously happened across the board in other cases, where work or investigations had to be done quickly.</p></speech>

That is very honest of Mr. O'Brien.</p> <p>  Let us consider what Dignam said about the report.  In 2009 the HSE set up the Devine inquiry to investigate the case of Grace, omitting the other 46 allegations.  The Dignam report stated "the adoption of Terms of Reference by the HSE which led to this focus, means that the approach adopted to the Inquiry by the HSE was inadequate in all the circumstances."  These inadequate terms of reference were designed by the designated person from the serious incident management team in line with procedure.  This person was referenced previously in other evidence; his name is Ger Crowley.  He helped set up the terms of reference for the Devine inquiry into the Grace case and was centrally involved.</p> <p>  He then retired from the HSE and set up Resilience Ireland.  That organisation then got a contract to do a desktop review of the 46 others left out of the terms of reference of the Devine inquiry for which he was already involved in setting up the terms of reference.  He subsequently retired, which is fine, and then was part of an organisation, as a director.  He got the contract to do the work.  He recommended a further review, that is, visiting the other 46 cases.  Then, subsequently, his company got the contract to do this work.  However, the Dignam report found that there was no reason not to get three quotes.  Of course, the argument Mr. O'Brien made and will subsequently make after answering this question, I am sure, is that this was because the HSE was in a hurry etc.  While the HSE might not have got three quotes - Mr. O'Brien outlined the culture that existed - did it get even one quote for the work?  The Chair should note this is directly related to the evidence given at the time.</p></speech>

However, Dignam found that the person involved, Mr. Crowley, was the person appointed by the serious incident management team to deal with this disclosure and he was actually centrally involved.  He therefore knew about the other cases.</p> <p>  At the time the evidence given here was that Mr. Crowley did not have a central role.  According to what Dignam was saying, he not alone knew there was a case - a disclosure - but he also knew about the other cases.  For a start that evidence seems to be different.  How does it happen that the person, who was centrally involved and who had knowledge of this, suddenly ended up with the contract to go and visit the 46 other cases?</p></speech>

In a previous meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts there is a difference of evidence, which is why we are here today.  The original evidence came from an earlier meeting and there is a chronology.  At meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts in April 2015, Deputy John Deasy said, "At a workshop held by Mr. Crowley in September 2014, he said that Mr. Healy had phoned him directly in May 2014 and asked him to write the policy."  This related to the new safeguarding policy, among other things.  Mr. Pat Healy replied, "That is a different issue and concerns safeguarding policy."  He did not deny that that phone call happened and that it was procured in this way.</p> <p>  I was very much taken by what was said on discipline and, in fairness to Mr. O'Brien, there was a level of genuine frustration in his answers at being limited in what he could do.  He was probably furious yesterday at having to send in a subsequent letter.  If there were no illegal issues after July-----</p></speech>

The Deputy will see that there are redactions in what has been now published.  They were agreed line by line by the publishers, ourselves and a team representing An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at national and regional investigative levels.  That is why there is an interval between the correspondence from the Commissioner and the publication date.  They had to agree what was to be published and then put in place a process relating to all those who were named.  Having regard to the particular circumstances of many of the clients who were affected, they also needed a more accessible version.</p></speech>

There were many events in which many people were involved and in any disciplinary investigation it would be necessary for those individuals to access the totality of the report.

I agree that what Mr. Dignam says is what happened but that did not amount to publication.  It did not allow person A to see what was said about person B or to see the totality of the report.  Publication is a different standard altogether, whereby the entire report would be put into the public domain, and that was the issue that needed to be squared.</p></speech>

Commitments were given there.  Questions were asked about an apology.  Apologies were given and acknowledged in that meeting.  They all happened.  Mr. O'Brien apologised to the committee.  He was asked if he would go and meet with the whistleblower as part of that.  I am asking if the meeting took place because it was part of the process here and - I ask this straight-up - if an apology occurred on that date or if Mr. O'Brien asked anyone to apologise, whether that person refused.  If so, why?</p></speech>

I advised the committee that there was a prior arrangement to meet the whistleblower, although we had run on so long that the arrangement had to be rearranged.  We intended to meet near to here.  We met very briefly but not in a substantive way.  We arranged to meet near to where I work and near to where the whistleblower works.  We had both of those meetings.  A range of concerns was expressed by the whistleblower about things that occurred in their area as far back as 2009.  I am not the type of person who ritually apologises.</p></speech>

Where we still need a process to determine some of those things, I am not going to ritually apologise for things when I do not know the ins and outs of what actually happened.  I know what the whistleblowers are saying happened, and I am not questioning their sincerity at all in saying this, but there is no point in me ritually apologising if I am not certain of what happened.</p> <p>  They certainly have grounds for concern, grievance and when I get the report, if it is clear to me that the service provider was either not properly supported in giving the care I know it provided to Grace, or was in any way discriminated against with regard to funding as a result of being a whistleblower, or even before being a whistleblower, raising concerns about the activities of various persons, I will have no hesitation in apologising, and it will be a sincere and real apology, but not a ritual one.</p></speech>

We are in the Committee of Public Accounts and concluding in the next minute or two.  We meet many whistleblowers as members of this committee.  When it comes to evidence, we would not be here on this level except for the evidence put forward by the whistleblower about one of the most disgraceful things that has happened in our State.  We simply would not be here today except for that person.  It is one of the most disgraceful things that has ever happened and has shocked the nation, and was the responsibility of an organisation of which Mr. O'Brien is now head, even though it happened long before him, and we accept all of that.  While I accept Mr. O'Brien's issue on ritual, I believe that there is an onus on someone in the HSE to apologise for the manner in which that person has been treated over the past several years.</p></speech>

There are legal provisions that protect whistleblowers as well.  To put the last question in context, when Mr. O'Brien was here the last time, he said he looked forward to meeting with whistleblowers and discussing issues with them.  This conversation has all been in the context of his direct evidence on that, in case anyone thinks we were straying into commission work.  We were directly confirming the evidence given by Mr. O'Brien that this actually subsequently came to pass.  That is why we have had that line of questioning.</p> <p>  On behalf of the Committee of Public Accounts, I thank Mr. O'Brien and his colleagues for attending and participating in our meeting.  There are one or two items of correspondence that they said they would get to us in the coming days.  We would ask to receive those within seven days.  The Committee of Public Accounts will submit the full transcript of this evidence, together with the witnesses' accompanying correspondence, to the commission of investigation in seven days' time.  I know they will facilitate us by meeting that timetable.</p></speech>

We are passing it on without comment and without conclusion, as we got it here today.  We will send it on to the commission.  The Committee of Public Accounts is making no conclusion, good, bad or indifferent on what happened here today.  We are not doing a report on it.  We are just passing information on.</p></speech>
