We attended on 1 July 2014, when I made an opening statement and, as such, I will not take up too much time with today's one.  We will briefly go through the main provisions of the heads of the Bill and set out its purpose.  If anyone has any issues, we will try to clear them up.  If anyone seeks further information or the committee, for the purposes of its report, wishes to know something we do not have with us, we will provide it at a later stage.</p><p>  The draft general scheme of the Horse Racing Ireland (amendment) Bill 2014 has been approved by Government.  In accordance with procedure, the draft scheme has been published on the Department's website and forwarded to the joint committee for pre-legislative scrutiny.  The Department appeared before the committee on 1 July and the committee has met a number of other stakeholders since then.  The horse racing industry makes a significant contribution to employment and the economy.  It is estimated to underpin 14,000 jobs, &euro;1.1 billion in economic output and exports to the value of &euro;205 million to 37 countries in 2013.</p> <p>Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, is a commercial State body established under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.  HRI is charged with the overall administration, promotion and development of the industry.  The 2001 Act sets down the mechanism under which State support is provided to HRI.  HRI provides funding for integrity services to the racing regulatory body, RRB.  The Turf Club, including the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, a private body, is designated as the RRB and is charged with carrying out these functions under the current legislation.  HRI has provided between &euro;5.5 million and &euro;7 million per annum to the Turf Club in respect of integrity services over the past five years.<br/>In 2012, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine commissioned Indecon International Consultants to carry out an independent review of certain aspects of the horse racing industry.  The Department facilitated a wide stakeholder consultation process as part of the review.  Written submissions were sought from interested parties and forwarded to Indecon for its consideration.  The resultant report examined the legislation, governance structures, funding and management of the industry, including the streamlining of functions assigned by legislation to HRI and the RRB, and made a number of recommendations in this regard.<br/>The report contained recommendations aimed at providing a more viable and sustainable horse racing sector.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, announced his acceptance of the Indecon recommendations and his intention to introduce amending legislation to facilitate the introduction of the changes recommended by Indecon.  Arising from the Indecon report, HRI and the RRB established a streamlining task force with a view to achieving efficiencies and to achieve a minimum of 10% reduction in costs, as identified in the report.  Consultants Smith &amp;amp; Williamson were appointed by the task force to act as facilitator in these discussions.  Smith &amp;amp; Williamson prepared a report that contained 18 recommendations, which it estimated would give rise to &euro;1.8 million per annum in savings.<br/>In preparing the draft general scheme of the Horse Racing Ireland (amendment) Bill 2014, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine engaged in discussions with HRI and the RRB about the recommendations in the Indecon and Smith &amp;amp; Williamson reports over a considerable period.  The draft general scheme of the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2014 was circulated to a number of Departments and to the Attorney General's office for observations.  A number of observations were received and these were accommodated in so far as possible in the draft general scheme.  That has been forwarded to this committee for legislative scrutiny and we have been through much of that already.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine obtained Cabinet approval on 3 June for the draft general scheme and to proceed to the pre-legislative scrutiny phase.<br/>I will briefly touch on the main provisions.  The draft general scheme of the Horse Racing Ireland (Amendment) Bill 2014 builds on recommendations of the Indecon report and is intended to strengthen governance and transparency within the administration of horse racing, to clarify the respective roles of HRI and the RRB, to improve accountability and control over State funding and to streamline the administrative functions of the two bodies.<br/>In regard to governance, it is proposed to reduce the size and alter the structure of the HRI board to improve efficiency and accountability and increase ministerial representation on the board, in accordance with the Indecon recommendations.  In the context of that recommendation, Indecon would have looked at international best practice and taken that on board.  The functions of the RRB will be maintained and strengthened and, in particular, the draft general scheme includes an enabling provision permitting the Minister to authorise RRB personnel to carry out functions under the Animal Remedies Act.<br/>The general scheme provides for a single streamlined administrative structure within HRI for registration, financial and other functions of HRI and the RRB without compromising the integrity functions of the RRB or its property rights to income derived from the registration of hunters' certificates, for point-to-point racing and the licensing of participants in racing.  In this context, I should make it clear that there will be no change in so far as the organisation of point-to-points is concerned.  The organisation of meetings, the issuing of hunter certificates and the acceptance of horse racing entries and declarations will continue to be managed by hunt clubs.  The registration functions, that is, the registration of hunter certificates and trainers, will reside along with other registration horse racing functions in HRI.<br/>The scheme provides for enhanced control and accountability with explicit provisions empowering the Minister to issue directives to HRI, requiring HRI to comply with codes of practice and permitting the Minister to withhold funding instalments from HRI and Bord na gCon if he is dissatisfied with their strategic or other plans.  It provides for the accounts of the RRB to be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and published and for the CEO of the RRB to attend at Oireachtas committees as required.  Key provisions include those relating to improved governance - changes to the HRI board's size and structure to improve efficiency and accountability.  The HRI board currently comprises 14 members - a chairman and 13 ordinary members.  The Minister nominates only the chairman and one other member of the board, the latter to represent the interests of horse racing in Northern Ireland.  All other members of the board are nominated by representative organisations.  The Indecon report suggested that this has resulted in low levels of Government or ministerial control over the process of decision-making by the HRI board.  It is proposed that the number of ordinary board members be reduced from 13 to 12, with an increase in the number of ministerial appointees from one to three.  The representation from the RRB on the board of HRI will be reduced from five to three, a proposal with which the RRB does not have a difficulty.<br/>HRI currently has 26 board committees, which are important in supporting the main work of the board.  The Indecon report suggested that none of the existing committees focused adequately on the particular needs of the betting sector or on employee requirements.  Against this background, the general scheme provides for the creation of two new statutory committees to represent those employed in the sector and the betting industry in addition to the two existing committees that deal with the issues of media rights and race fixtures.  The scheme also provides for a standard five-person membership of all four statutory sub-committees proposed under this legislation.  Those committees are the race fixtures committee, the industries services committee, the betting committee and the media rights committee.  The scheme also provides for HRI to appoint the chair of the race fixtures committee.  Under the current legislation, the latter committee is chaired by an RRB director of HRI.<br/>The retention by the RRB of responsibility for integrity functions and for the licensing of racecourses, jockeys, valets and other participants in racing is maintained.  At local level, the issuing of hunter certificates, management of horse racing entries and declarations for point-to-point races will remain with the local hunt clubs.  There is no change there.  Amendments to the rules of racing will be subject to consultation with HRI in the context of budgetary arrangements.  I must stress that HRI will not have any <i>imprimatur</i>over the rules of racing but it is considered appropriate for the sake of good order to have some level of consultation where rules which could have an impact on budgetary requirements are to be changed.  The Bill also includes an enabling provision permitting the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to appoint persons or classes of persons to carry out all or any of the functions of authorised officers under the Animal Remedies Act 1993, subject to such conditions as the Minister deems appropriate.  This provision was included at the request of the racing regulatory body.<br/>The general scheme also provides for greater clarity on the functions of HRI, including the power to issue directives setting rules and procedures relating to its functions.  There is a lack of clarity in the current legislation regarding responsibility for the administration and financial management of the Irish horse racing industry.  The scheme provides for a single streamlined administrative structure within HRI for registration, licensing, financial and other functions of HRI and the RRB without compromising the integrity functions of the RRB.  This will require data sharing between HRI and RRB.  This streamlining measure includes the processing, but not ownership, of income from the licensing functions and registration fees for hunter certificates and trainers from point-to-points which are currently administered by the racing regulatory body.  This will eliminate any need for duplication between HRI and the RRB, particularly in regard to certain administration aspects such as the registration of hunter certificates and the registration of point-to-point trainers or handlers.  I stress that this relates only to the registration functions.  It will also pave the way for increased efficiency in the administration of areas such as finance, IT, payroll and pensions.  In the case of point-to-point meetings, however, fees for issuing hunter certificates, fixtures and entries will remain firmly with the local hunt clubs, as will responsibility for arranging such meetings.<br/>I will speak briefly about control and accountability.  The scheme provides for improved ministerial control with explicit provisions empowering the Minister to issue directions to HRI and requiring HRI to furnish information on the scope of its activities, including compliance with codes of practice or other Government policy documents, to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine when requested.  There is no explicit obligation in current legislation requiring HRI to comply with the requirements of the code of practice for the governance of State bodies or for the RRB to report to HRI, and this deficiency is being addressed.</p> <p>There are insufficient provisions in the current legislation, in respect of the procedure for making payments to HRI and to Bord na gCon, to allow the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to withhold financial support if he is dissatisfied with the strategic and other plans submitted to support any funding proposals or their implementation.  It is proposed to provide explicit permission for the Minister to withhold funding instalments from HRI or Bord na gCon if he is dissatisfied with the strategic and other plans submitted.  Funding may also be withheld where HRI or Bord na gCon have failed to provide information requested by the Minister or where they have failed to comply with a direction of the Minister.  Similarly, the racing regulatory body shall be required to furnish information to HRI on its activities when requested to do so.  This information may be taken into account by HRI in determining the annual budgetary requirements of the RRB.<br/>The accounts of the RRB will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General and published.  The chief executive of the RRB will be obliged to attend Oireachtas committees as required.  There is also a provision permitting the Minister to require HRI and the RRB to agree procedures to ensure compliance with Government codes of practice, guidelines or policy documents as well as in respect of the provision of financial and other information on any matter funded by HRI.  The scheme empowers HRI to make various deductions from prize money in accordance with HRI directives.  This is essentially a reflection of current practice.  HRI cannot make changes in the directives governing deductions for charitable funds administered by the RRB without the prior agreement of the racing regulatory body.  This provision is intended to protect the <i>status quo</i>because the RRB funds a number of very worthy charities from these deductions and we would not want to make any changes without full consultation.<br/>I am aware that we have discussed some of these provisions previously and if members have any questions, I would be happy to deal with them.</p></speech>

This is a worthwhile discussion because when they were before us, they were probably providing answers to questions we did not have at the time.  We are much better briefed now that we have met the stakeholders.  I wish to raise a number of questions based on the presentations we heard earlier.  I ask the officials to bear with me because I hope my questions are in order.</p><p>  In regard to head 2, the Turf Club pointed out in its submission that point-to-point meetings are not mentioned in existing legislation and questioned the need for their inclusion in this Bill.  The method of registration currently entails applying to the hunt club for a hunter certificate, which is then registered with the Turf Club.  Am I correct that the process incurs two different fees?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014100800005#D00400"><p>Yes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/949" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014100800005#D00500"><p>The administration of entries to and fees for point-to-point meetings will continue to be handled locally by the hunt club.  Will Mr. Gleeson clarify how much prize money will be made available for meetings?  On the suggestion that the funds available to the Turf Club would be taken into account, does that include funding streams from commercial interests and areas outside of integrity services?  Does it take into account historic moneys or savings on the part of the Turf Club or the hunt committee?</p><p>  The racecourses suggested that it would be useful to have a proxy representative on the board.  Does Mr. Gleeson envisage difficulties with such a suggestion and does the Department have an open mind on it?  If their representative was unable, due to other business, to attend a board meeting, the racecourses would not be represented at the meeting.  I ask for clarification on the industry services committee.  Board representation was one of the main issues raised by every group we met.  We have a challenge in dealing with that issue.  If everyone is represented, the board could become quite large, but if we decide to choose some organisations but not others, each of them could make a valid argument as to why it should have full representation.  The Turf Club referred to the UK Horsemen's Group, which is an umbrella body.  Could the industry services committee play an equivalent role?</p><p>  Head 4(1) inserts a Schedule which refers at 7.(1)(f) to stable employees.  Head 6(2) inserts an amended section 20 in the 1994 Act which in subsection (3)(c) deals with people directly employed in the industry but stable employees are not explicitly named.  The jockeys made a compelling case that they should not be lumped in with people who are directly employed, such as stable staff, because they would not necessarily face the same issues.  I am conscious that thousands of people are employed as stable staff and want to ensure they are explicitly represented.  The anomaly between the two heads might be investigated.</p><p>  In regard to head 5, the Turf Club took the view that it went beyond the Indecon and Smith &amp;amp; Williamson reports.  It also pointed out that stall handlers and photo finish staff are under HRI and suggested this meant it would be able to bring in those staff if questions arose around rules of racing.  Is that the case and, if so, can Mr. Gleeson suggest a way around it?  The Turf Club indicated that it was keen for this area to come under its responsibility.</p><p>  The Turf Club also proposed that the racing regulatory body be funded directly by the Department on a multi-annual basis, or at least retain a minimum of financial independence.  The first part of that recommendation would go against the principles set out in the heads.  Does Mr. Gleeson see any possibility of implementing such a funding structure and what argument would he make against funding the body directly through a separate stream?</p><p>  I ask for clarification on the media rights committee.  Can the committee bring in people from the outside who are not board members and was that the case in the past?</p><p>  A number of concerns were expressed about how the HRI might issue directives.  The racing regulatory body asked why they are called directives rather than terms of trade or something similar.  It argued that the meaning and legal status of a directive is unclear and that there cannot be two rule-making bodies for the sport.  Can further clarity be provided in the regulation in regard to directives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014100800005#D00600"><p>We have discussed the legislation comprehensively with the stakeholders.  The biggest issue for stakeholders is the make-up of the board, which is being reduced from 13 to 12 members, with the Minister to appoint three members.  I suggest that we make a recommendation to the Department on this issue because some of the stakeholders feel they are being left out of the system by not getting a place on the board.  I welcome Mr. Gleeson's comment that Indecon had indicated the number should be reduced from 13 to 12.  Does he envisage the board being increased by two to 14 or 15 members in order that all stakeholders can be represented?  This is an important industry and everyone should have a say on the board of HRI.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014100800005#D00700"><p>The Members asked a number of questions and I will try to address all of them.  The first question related to point-to-point meetings and how they will operate.  We are very sensitive to local input and volunteerism in point-to-point meetings.</p> <p>We are aware that is a highly sensitive issue and we think there are sufficient safeguards in the general scheme to protect that.</p><p> I wish to indicate how point-to-point racing works at the moment.  HRI provides about &euro;1.5 million to point-to-point racing.  That goes towards the provision of prize money.  There is a grant of about &euro;2,500 per fixture as I understand it and &euro;500,000 goes to the National Hunt Club for integrity services at point-to-point events.  I wish to focus on the change with regard to point-to-point racing.  The only change in the HRI role on point-to-point racing proposed in the general scheme is that the registration functions of hunter certificates and participants in point-to-point steeplechase races will be carried out along with all other registration functions within HRI.  That is entirely separate from the issue of hunter certificates and the acceptance of horseracing entries.</p><p> Those functions have always resided with the local hunt clubs and the funding associated with those functions resides with the hunt clubs.  That is the issue of the certificates and the acceptance of race entries.  There will be no change in that.  From the perspective of the person on the ground organising a point-to-point event there will be no visible change.  We are talking about streamlining a registration function.  The fees from the registration functions will be streamlined into an administrative system in HRI with no change on the ground.  There is no change in the issue of hunter certificates, the acceptance of horse race entries or in the arrangement of those point-to-point events.  That is a very important point to clarify.</p><p> The Deputy also spoke about the funding.  Perhaps the question of the direct funding from the Department can also be dealt with here.  It has always been the case that we have had a cascade of funding from the Department to HRI to the Turf Club.  HRI is a State body established for the purposes of administering horseracing.  It is entirely appropriate to have this cascade of funding to other relevant bodies from HRI.  We would not consider it appropriate to change that.  Within that, of course, we must be careful to protect the independence of the integrity function.  The general scheme provides for a number of checks and balances.  The first is through the composition of the board as proposed.  The board has three Turf Club members, three ministerial nominees and a broad range of representatives of the racing sector.  An important balance is struck in the composition of the board to ensure that integrity functions are carried out correctly.</p><p> In the context of seeking funding from HRI - this is &euro;5 million, &euro;6 million or &euro;7 million of taxpayers' money - HRI will be able to take into account funding streams to Turf Club deriving from its statutory functions regarding integrity and only in regard to those statutory functions.</p><p> We need to consider what structure we have at the moment.  We have a very unusual governance structure here.  We are not starting with a blank page.  We have a State agency which administers racing and what is essentially a private body.  The private body for the purpose of this legislation carries out certain statutory functions.  In the context of carrying those statutory functions it is called the Racing Regulatory Body.</p><p> In its private capacity the Turf Club may well carry on all kinds of activities.  It may run racecourses, it may rent gallops, it may establish hotels and it may have interests in commercial enterprises.  That is not what we are discussing here.  All we are saying is that when determining how much taxpayers' money the racing regulatory body needs to carry out integrity functions provided for by statute, we must take account - it would be bizarre not to take account - of funding deriving from the exercise of those functions.  To be crystal clear about this, the Turf Club's private funding in its capacity as a private club is not affected here at all.  We are only talking about taking into account the funding deriving from the statutory functions it carries out here.  That is a very important point.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned proxy members of a State board.  While it is possible to do that, personally I do not think that is appropriate.  I believe that if a person is appointed to a State board, it is a very serious position.  We need continuity and an appreciation of what went on at previous meetings.  For the sake of good order I think an appointee to a board is an appointee to a board.  I would be absolutely opposed to the idea that when one engages in something as serious as participating on a State board that one could bring a proxy along.  It is not like voting at a company's shareholders' meeting; this is a different kind of engagement.  Board members engage on a range of policy issues that require continuity from meeting to meeting.  That is my position on the question of proxies.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned the industry services committee.  Indecon recognises that many strengths derive from having a representative board.  Equally when we look at international best practice generally and not just among State agencies, there is broad recognition that smaller boards tend to function more effectively.</p><p> What we have included in the general scheme is not arbitrary.  It is based on an exercise conducted by Indecon involving broad consultation and an examination of international best practice.  What is in our general scheme is reflective of the conclusions that Indecon reached.  It is always the case with a representative board that everybody wants to be represented; that is inevitable.  So we try to strike an appropriate balance between representation and effective running of a board.</p><p> The industry services committee is a new vehicle, representing jockeys, stable staff, permanent staff and staff in the industry.  The representation mechanism there is that its chairman will serve on the board.  There is representation for jockeys and qualified riders, persons employed in the horseracing industry and persons employed directly in the horseracing industry.  That group will have its own committee for the first time.  It will elect its own chairman, who will serve on the board.  So there will be representation on the board for those people.</p></speech>

They are intended to be comprehended in the wording that is there.  However, I accept there is an inconsistency between the two heads.  We will ensure they are specifically referenced.  Obviously if that is part of the report emanating from the committee we will take it on board.</p><p>  The Deputy asked me a very specific question about stallholders.</p> <p>The provision in the 2001 Act on stallholders has not changed, with regard to the provision and maintenance of mobile track equipment including starting stalls, photo finishes, camera control equipment and any other such equipment agreed from time to time between Horse Racing Ireland and the racing regulatory body to provide the racing regulatory body with photographs, films, sound recordings and other connected materials or the data generated.  The functions relating to stallholders have also resided with Horse Racing Ireland and there is no proposal to change this.</p></speech>

The Turf Club stated it is not ideal because photo finish staff as well as stall handlers are included and if an integrity issue arises it cannot question them.  Is this the case?  Is this a potential anomaly?</p></speech>

It is how it has always been done and was provided for in the 2001 Act.  It is a new word but a reflection of current practice and it is not our intention to change it.</p><p>  I have dealt with the question of the financial independence of the racing regulatory body.  With regard to the cascade of accountability and whether the racing regulatory body should receive funding directly from the Department, I do not believe it should.  No change is proposed in this regard in the draft scheme.  In any delegation of functions from a Department on the establishment of a State agency there is a cascade of accountability.  What we have provided for here is a strengthening of existing provisions but no fundamental change in the cascade and this is appropriate.</p></speech>

Other than that some people irrationally think 13 is an unlucky number does it make a significant difference if the board has 13 or 14 members rather than 12?  An argument can be made for each of these.  Board members are nominated by interests, apart from the three nominated by the Minister.  We recently had a farcical situation where a board had 19 or 20 members but only five people wound up making the big decision because everyone else had been put outside the door for one reason or another.  How wedded is the Department to this magic 12 or is it a give or take figure?</p><p>  One quarter of the seats on the board will be given to a group called the Turf Club which carries out statutory functions under the Act.  This Turf Club is a self-perpetuating private body which does not have open membership, and it is not possible for anybody who wants to get in to do so if he or she is not chosen by those who are already in it.  In the interests of openness, transparency and citizens' rights, which are all things we aspire to in a properly functioning republic, would it not be appropriate to oblige the Turf Club to have an open system of membership before it is given statutory functions and three seats on the board?  How can the Department justify giving a private body whose membership is self-perpetuating, in other words existing members invite new members, and from which ordinary people are excluded if they are not part of the great and good clique and invited by the membership, are given statutory functions and three seats on the board?  How can the Department justify this, given the present thinking on good governance, openness and citizens rights?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014100800007#F00700"><p>Much work is being done by the Association of Irish Racecourses.  One of the proposals is that Horse Racing Ireland will be omnipotent with total control of everything.  Many people at the Department do not understand that the HRI is a runaway train with regard to charges, and I have made this point before.  It was stated that point to points will be examined.  At least with point to points if we are charged we know what we are getting and there is an end result.  Ordinary folk give up their Saturdays and Sundays to work on a voluntary basis at point-to-point courses.  We know money is invested in trying to improve them.  If Horse Racing Ireland has the financial management of all aspects of Irish racing there is a concern it will examine the finances of racecourses.  HRI has ownership and control of racecourses and allocates programmes and fixtures.  How much more power will be given to this body?  We should circumscribe some of its powers.</p><p>  I gave many examples and was amazed by the reaction of many ordinary people trying to breed horses, particularly with regard to national hunt.  Not everybody is successful.  They cannot all go to Goffs to bid &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million.  Many people there are glad to get something for &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000.  The next minute, they are loaded out with charges.  I am concerned that giving HRI all of this power will create a runaway train where one will not have any choice and there will be no haggling.  It will lay down the law.  The sinecures within it are not too bad.</p><p>  The racecourse beside me in Kilbeggan is very well run and a tight ship.  According to the proposed section 10(1)(m) negotiation of all income from media rights will be given to Horse Racing Ireland.  The media rights do not belong to Horse Racing Ireland but to the actual racecourses.  Why should Horse Racing Ireland poke its nose in?  Where will it end?  If there were no media rights there would be no races.  If Sky was not putting in a few shillings there would be no prize funds.  Until now Horse Racing Ireland and the Association of Irish Racecourses have been jointly involved in the negotiation of media rights.  Will Horse Racing Ireland subsume all of this function to itself?</p> <p>Racecourses have struggled through very difficult times, survived and carried out improvements, although I acknowledge that this came with State investment.  It has been for the benefit of ordinary patrons and people who are not multimillionaires; very often, pensioners can avail of a reduced rate in going to the courses.  The Association of Irish Racecourses has indicated its concern, although it acknowledges that Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, has a function in negotiating income from media rights belonging to that body.  It also has legal rights to negotiate income derived from third parties, which takes in racecourses.  In the 1994 Act, such a process was vested in the racecourses under section 61.  I hope that what has happened up to now will continue, with at least joint consultation being evident.  It is extremely important.  What is the witnesses' view and will they provide an assurance that racecourse interests will not have their interests dispensed with?  HRI has much strength with regard to fixture allocation for racecourses and so on.</p></speech>

I take on board the comments regarding payments and fees going through HRI before being passed to the regulatory body.  HRI has a statutory function to promote racing and the regulatory body has a function to control racing, and there may be times when the bodies would clash or have different interests.  Could the potential be minimised that HRI would restrict funding for integrity services in a way that would inhibit the integrity of racing?  Will the witnesses comment on how the Bill will balance those ideas?</p><p>  With the definitions given in head No. 2, the Turf Club has asked that "integrity service" would be amended to included integrity services provided away from racecourses which are not specifically related to the running of particular races or fixtures.  What is the Department's view on such an amendment of the definition?  It could be quite important.  There would be an obligation on the regulatory body to consult with HRI around the rules of racing.  Consulting would encompass taking in views but there would be no obligation to implement such views.  Could this be clarified?</p></speech>

We are not starting from a blank page with horse racing in Ireland and we are dealing with a long tradition of 150 years of the Turf Club, which has performed integrity functions in a way that has brought a degree of credit to the industry in Ireland, which is very highly regarded.  Since 1994 we have developed a State body for developing the industry as apart from being a sport, it is a very important industry that provides 17,000 jobs, with exports exceeding &euro;200 million and output of &euro;1 billion.</p><p>  The general scheme would not confer new functions on the Turf Club and these are the functions it has always had.  For a considerable period, it has had the functions on the basis of statutory provision.  The general scheme would bring the Turf Club within a tighter governance structure, so its finances can be examined in the context of determining what kind of funding is required for integrity processes.  I take the Deputy's point of principle.  The Department does not control the internal processes of the Turf Club and it does not intend to do so.  Nevertheless, we are not starting from a blank page and we have a well-established structure which has served the industry well.</p></speech>

One could say that this is the way it is.  Other elements of the Turf Club are being changed, including finance reporting and so on, as the world changes and it is not the same now as it was 150 years ago.  That was much more paternalistic.  In 2014, it is inappropriate that a club with a closed membership - it is by invitation only - is being given statutory functions when one line in a Bill could force it to make the membership application process more open.</p></speech>

It is not an arbitrary figure and is based on recommendations by Indecon.  Its work was based on a series of consultations and the examination of best practice.  That is the basis on which we picked the number and how we decided the proposed composition of the board.  The committee will have its own views on the composition and size of the board and we will have to consider any alternative view arises in the report from the committee.  The figure arose from work done in examining the question very deeply.</p></speech>

To be clear, we are not starting with a blank page.  HRI is the State agency which has been established to administer and develop the horse racing industry.  It has been established since 2001 when it replaced the Irish Horseracing Authority.  In terms of media rights, there is no provision to change them, with one exception, the sole exception being that the media rights committee will now be at liberty to bring in non-members of HRI to advise it.  This is based on the recognition that one might require particular commercial, media or other expertise to inform media rights.  The number of members of the media rights committee is increasing from three to five to accommodate potential additional members.</p><p>  The Deputy is correct that there is a joint approach to media rights between the racecourses and HRI and that will not change.  Racecourses are still represented on the HRI board.  As I understand it, the racecourses own the media rights but on the basis of an agreement.  It was considered that, from a national perspective and the point of view of developing an industry and getting the best bang for one's buck, the media rights should be negotiated as a collective.  Nothing has happened in recent times to change that view.</p><p>  The Deputy spoke about the HRI charges.  I understand the charges have been reduced by 10% this year.</p></speech>

In fact, the streamlining provided for in the Bill should result in reducing the overall cost of administering the horse racing industry.  It could well allow scope for a further reduction in charges to participants in horse racing, which would be a desirable outcome.  However, these are matters for HRI, not the Department.  It is a day-to-day operational matter, but the framework laid down in the general scheme should allow for a reduction in administrative costs which could certainly manifest itself in reduced charges to the industry.</p><p>  Deputy Thomas Pringle asked about the financing and the protections for the integrity function and the independence of the integrity function.  I have already spoken about the general checks and balances in terms of the composition of boards and so forth.  However, there is a unique feature in this legislation.  When the RRB negotiates its budget with HRI and if there is a fundamental disagreement on the budget, the legislation provides for an arbitration procedure.  That is a very unusual provision.  In any other circumstance I would almost say it is inappropriate, but it is included specifically in recognition of the need for absolute independence in terms of integrity.  First, there is a representative board which obviously has a say in the negotiation of budgets.  There are three RRB people on the board, three ministerial nominees and representatives from across the spectrum of interests in horse racing.  There is also the specific arbitration clause which has always been there.  If there is a disagreement between RRB and HRI in the budgetary negotiations at the start of the year, an arbitrator can be called in.  That provision has always been included, but it has never been invoked.  It is inevitable and probably appropriate that there will be tension between two negotiating bodies when budgets are being negotiated.  That is to be expected and probably a sign of a healthy process, but we have this arbitration provision.  It has never been used, but it is still in place.</p></speech>

It comes back to what Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said.  This is a very unusual situation where what is essentially a private body has a range of statutory functions.  What is being discussed is providing very broad, strong policing powers for a private body, around which there are sensitivities.  First, there has been no change to the definition.  We consider it appropriate that the Turf Club have these powers around the tracks and in the context of applying integrity to racecourses.  Where work is required outside these parameters, we have the Garda and departmental investigators who frequently work cheek by jowl with Turf Club personnel to examine matters such as breaches of animal remedies regulations.  They have all of the necessary powers and authorisations to do what the Turf Club is seeking to do outside the tracks.  It is a balancing act.  Is it appropriate to expand the remit of the Turf Club beyond the tracks?  I have some doubts about the wisdom or even the legal propriety of giving a private body these very strong policing powers outside its strict remit, as provided for within the regulations.  This is something we considered and what I am saying reflects the view of our legal services division.</p></speech>

In practice, the reality is that when things happen off-track, they are generally done in collaboration with the Department.

The entire process has been enlightening not only for members but also for members of the public who are watching these proceedings and those who made submissions.</p><p>  Mr. Gleeson indicated that before the pre-legislative stage, he had had a number of meetings with various bodies.  Will he identify these bodies?  How many meetings did he have with HRI and how many meetings did he have with the Racing Regulatory Body?</p><p>  With regard to the Indecon report, as Deputy Martin Heydon said, there is no mention in it of point to point meetings, yet it is an integral part of the legislation.  There is a change in this legislation.  Mr. Gleeson has also mentioned that there is no need for change with regard to the regulatory body's role in stall handling, photo finishes and so forth, and that it does not have a role in bringing in those persons whom it might wish to query.  Such a change would be very helpful in the regulation of the body.  Perhaps he might change that provision to bring it more within the role of the regulatory body.</p><p>  There will be 13 members of the board.  They include four members appointed by the Minister, the fourth member being the chairman of the board.  Will Mr. Gleeson clarify if that is the case?</p> <p> I agree with Deputy Penrose that media rights will be a huge aspect of funding for the racing industry into the future.  Media rights have been legally proven to be part and parcel of the ownership of racetracks.  I ask that a change be made to head 6(3)(2).</p></speech>

Can the Department, before the legislation is brought before the D&aacute;il, consider replacing the word "may" with the word "should"?  There is a fear that conflict between the HRI and racecourses may arise some time in the future, particularly for racecourses not owned by the HRI.  There should also be outside members rather than members of HRI, if possible.</p><p>  It is strange that while the Racing Regulatory Body must engage in consultation, HRI can issue directives on the rules of racing and integrity.  Can we change that situation?  Is it possible for the Department to ensure the HRI must consult as well as issue directives?  If so, instead of one telling the other what to do, both would have to consult.  </p><p>  Part of the intention of this Bill, following the Indecon report, is to achieve streamlining and savings.  I asked the HRI about such matters, but it could not indicate how many people would be let go or where savings would be made.  Can the Department indicate where savings will take place and how long the process will last?</p><p>  We still have not received 2013 annual report from HRI.  Is the Department happy with that situation?</p></speech>

His question is not really appropriate.  We have an Indecon report looking at the whole industry.  I accept the Deputy's question on consultation and directives, in which he sought for their meaning to be clarified.  We are dealing with the general operational rules of racing, which is the overarching direction that racing should take as a directive.  Everybody works within this - HRI, the regulatory body and anybody else.  The directive also concerns animal welfare, betting, propriety and lots of other things.  I agree with the Deputy that it needs to be clarified, but I do not think his query about the annual report is relevant to today's discussion, with all due respect.</p></speech>

Mr. Gleeson used a fascinating phrase when talking about point-to-point racing.  He said that for all intents and purposes there would be a perception of no change.  Normally, politicians talk about perception and people on the other side of the table talk about reality.  I can see there may be no perception of any significant change, but change will come about as a result of this scheme.  Why is the point-to-point sphere and sector in the scheme at all?  The sector is working well and without it we would not have National Hunt industry.  The sector is not broken so I am not sure why we are attempting to fix it.  I ask Mr. Gleeson to comment further on the matter.  </p><p>  Integrity, services and the regulatory body have already been covered.  The Racing Regulatory Body gave us a very powerful presentation a month or so ago at which its representatives asked very serious questions about ensuring its independence into the future.  Can the Department be categorical, from the point of view of the integrity body, in stating that there will be no change?  Can it confirm that the RRB will retain its full powers and flexibility, as heretofore?</p><p>  If I was the Minister presiding over and assisting, by way of financial support, an industry as big as the Irish horse racing industry, then it would be very neat and tidy, from my perspective, to have all power and responsibility channelled into the HRI.  The move would simply make my job much easier.  However, the current balance between the HRI and the regulatory body works quite well and I would not like to see it rebalanced to any significant degree.  Therefore, I am supportive of what the previous speaker said.</p><p>  I ask Mr. Gleeson to reflect again on the whole issue of the point-to-point industry.  Perception or not, there will be a change, and I am worried that it might have an impact on how the point-to-point sphere currently works in terms of volunteerism, local meets and the spirit of country enterprise, which is at the core of its success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Gleeson" time="11:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014100800010#J01600"><p>I thank both Deputies.  First I will deal with the question on point-to-points and the lack of reference to them by Indecon.  To be clear, we had an Indecon report that made a broad range of recommendations about the administration of horse racing, governance, finances and a number of other issues.  After Indecon, a committee comprising members of the Racing Regulatory Body and the HRI was established.  They commissioned Smith &amp;amp; Williamson to compile a report on how the administration of the system might be streamlined.  Although it is true that there is no explicit reference to point-to-points in Indecon, it is implicit in the whole idea of streamlining.  There is an explicit reference to point-to-points in the report by Smith &amp;amp; Williamson.  What we have proposed in the general scheme is precisely what was proposed in that report, which is to move the registration functions - and only the registration functions - to HRI, which already has registration functions across a range of other areas.</p><p>  I can confirm to Deputy Bradford that I used the word "perception".  The reason for doing so was that there is a perception that what is happening here will interfere with volunteerism and with the way point-to-points are run at local level.  I shall remove the word "perception" now and state that there will be no change to the running of point-to-points at local level as a result of what we are proposing here.</p></speech>

It means that the money handed over - which does not go back to local hunt clubs anyway - will now be handled through a single administrative stream.  The funding for the local hunt clubs, which is done through the issuing of certificates and taking in of fees from participants, will be handled in the same way as it has always has been.  It will stay with the hunt clubs in the same way it always has done.</p> <p>There will be no change to the running of point-to-points as a result of this general scheme.  I have removed the word "perception", which I think the Deputy was worried about.</p></speech>

First, the Racing Regulatory Body is solely and independently responsible for establishing the rules of racing.  In the context of establishing the rules of racing, my understanding is that it consults with various bodies anyway, because that is a sensible thing to do in any process.  That does not mean it is bound by those bodies.  There is a specific provision in the general scheme that when it is amending the rules of racing the RRB should consult with HRI.  HRI has directives across a range of its own functions.  They exist anyway; that is the reality.  The directives are circumscribed in the general scheme to the functions of HRI.  The directives should not impinge on the rules of racing, and if there is consultation one way when the rules of racing are being amended, it would not be impossible to provide for some sort of a consultative procedure the other way if directives are being amended.  I point to the checks and balances that are inherent in the HRI structure.  We have the Turf Club, ministerial nominees, and a broad range of representative organisations on the HRI board.  When we talk about HRI doing something, we are talking about the board doing something.  It is the board that has authority to do these things.  The board is structured to allow for a balance of representation, and the checks and balances are in there.</p></speech>

When we have concluded this process, in all its complexity, and we have come up with a Bill that will hopefully provide a framework for things to work better, people will still have to work together and get into the detail of operating and administering horse racing.  I just want to make that point.  This Bill does not answer all the questions.</p><p>  On the issue of streamlining, I am reading a piece from Smith &amp;amp; Williamson.  It discusses shared IT services, a single income stream, and a shared registration system.  It discusses a joint payroll and HR function.  There is a list of areas here where Smith &amp;amp; Williamson recommended that there should be streamlining.  We are not providing for all these things in the legislation, but we are providing for a single income stream, which will be a contributor to this overall effort.  If one has two buildings and two administrative systems located a mile and a half from each other on the Curragh, it is self-evident that if one streamlines those in some way and if one provides for a single accounts system, IT system and HR system, there will be savings.  Those savings will accrue to the industry because none of the parties in this are in it for themselves.  None of these bodies are profit-making, so any financial benefits to HRI and the Turf Club, one can reasonably assume, will ultimately be felt by participants in the industry.  I do not think there is any doubt, and while I might have difficulty in quantifying precisely the savings that will accrue from the streamlining, it is self-evident that there will be savings.  </p><p>  These are issues to be managed between HRI and the RRB following this legislation.  It will be a good thing, because there is uncertainty about this at the moment.  It seems that when we have got through this process, when the legislation is on the Statute Book, people will still have a job to do.  They will still have to engage in the best interests of horse-racing, and I expect that they will do that.</p></speech>

The Racing Regulatory Body will have three members on the board.  There is a strong governance structure there and it does provide the checks and balances needed to ensure that these sub-committees function reasonably well.  That is a relevant consideration.</p></speech>

I think - and I believe Deputy Heydon will agree with this - there should be a recommendation that if the board is restricted to 12, the standing committees would, where possible, have non-members from the representative organisations as a feed-in and that the chair of each committee would actually be a member of the board and do his or her job accordingly and represent the relevant committee on the board in the interests of streamlining.  I do not think the Deputy would disagree on that as a recommendation that may emanate.  I must be careful what I say will happen, but I can anticipate that may well be one of them.</p></speech>

It would make sense if everything associated with the race - everything before the horse goes into the stall, everything during the race, and everything afterwards - were associated with the regulatory body.  There are two parts: the starting of the race, with the stall-handlers and so on, and the photo finish.  It would be common sense to bring them all in under the regulatory body.</p></speech>

I would like to introduce my colleagues, Ms Teresa Griffin, CEO of the NCSE, and Ms Mary Byrne, head of special education at the NCSE.  I intend to address three main areas: the reasons change is necessary, an outline of the proposal for a new allocation model, and the implementation process for the model.</p><p>  The NCSE submitted a wide-ranging policy advice paper on special education to the Minister for Education and Skills in May 2013.  One of the issues raised in that paper was our concern that the current schemes for allocating more than 11,000 learning support and resource teacher posts to schools were inequitable and that a different allocation model should be developed, one based on the profiled need of each school without the need for a diagnosis of disability.  I accepted the Minister&rsquo;s invitation to chair an NCSE working group to develop a proposal for a new model, taking account of factors that identify educational profiles of schools and the recording of outcomes for students with special educational needs.</p><p>  The working group comprised people with a wide range of expertise and experience in special education, including parents, teachers, principals, inspectors, the Education Research Centre, ERC, and NCSE council members.  The central focus of the group&rsquo;s work was at all times on meeting the learning needs of students with special educational needs.  We took great care to ensure the proposed new model was informed by national and international research findings.  We are satisfied the model takes into account many complex factors identified by research as contributing to a school&rsquo;s need for additional teaching support.</p> <p> We also engaged in a widespread consultation process with the education partners.  This involved more than 22 meetings.  There was recognition of the complexity and sensitivity of the task as well as general consensus on the need for a more equitable model, one which included levels of achievement societal context and significant needs and which did not rely on a diagnosis of disability.  The working group proposal was published last June. </p><p> There are good reasons the current allocation model should be changed.  I will cite three such reasons.  More than 5,000 learning support teachers are allocated to all primary and post-primary schools to help students with learning difficulties on the basis of the number of class teachers in the case of primary schools or the number of students in the case of post-primary schools.  This means two schools with the same number of students enrolled will get the same level of learning support even though one school could have ten students who qualify for learning support and the other school could have 75 students.  This is both unfair and inequitable.</p><p> More than 6,000 resource teachers support students with a diagnosis of disability.  We know there can be long waiting lists for a formal professional diagnosis of disability.  While on the waiting list, resource teaching support cannot be provided to a student's school.  Some parents circumvent public waiting lists by paying large sums of money for private consultants to diagnose their children.  We believe a child should not have to wait for additional teaching support because his or her parent cannot pay for diagnostic services.  The current system can reinforce disadvantage because children from less well-off families have to wait longer for a diagnosis of disability and supports in school.</p><p> The third reason I cite for the need for change is that many professionals have told us they feel obliged under the current system to assess and label children with a disability, even when an assessment may not be indicated for health or social care reasons, to ensure a school gets additional resource teaching hours.  We know these labels can stay with the child for life.  We also know there is a spectrum of ability within every category of disability and the label, by itself, does not necessarily inform a child's teaching and learning needs.  The professionals have told us this time could be better used to provide necessary professional treatment, intervention and therapeutic support for the child.</p><p> The NCSE believes that changing the system should not wait for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act.  The proposed new model recommends one scheme to allocate all 11,000 additional teachers to support the inclusion of all children with learning difficulties and special educational needs.  Approximately 15% of these would be allocated to ensure every school has upfront resources to enable it to be an inclusive school and to support any early intervention and prevention programmes.  The remaining 85% of teachers would be allocated in accordance with each school's educational profile.  The educational profile would be based on the number of students with very complex special educational needs, the results of standardised tests in reading and mathematics, and the social context of each school.  Under this new model, there would no longer be a distinction between learning support and resource teachers.  They would instead all be known as support teachers.</p><p> The working group also proposed that existing support services for students with special educational needs should be combined into one unified inclusion support service for schools.  The working group is confident its proposed model is a better and more equitable way of delivering teaching resources for students with special educational needs.</p><p> The implementation of the proposed new model would bring real benefits to students, their families and schools.  For example, students would no longer have to wait for a professional diagnosis of disability before being provided with additional teaching support in schools.  They would no longer have to be labelled.  The new model is breaking the link between the need for diagnosis and the allocation of teaching resources.  Parents would no longer have to pay for private consultants and schools would have greater certainty about their teacher staffing levels which would enable them to plan for appropriate further training where necessary.</p><p> We have advised the Department of Education and Skills to consult further with parents, teachers, and other education partners to ensure their views are taken into account.  The Department is currently engaged in a further consultation process with the education partners and has set about collecting information necessary to examine the feasibility of the proposed model.</p><p> Our proposals are in keeping with many of the proposals in the recently published Better Outcomes Brighter Futures: the National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

The Special Needs Parents Association is a voluntary registered charity run by parents for parents which exists to support all parents of persons with special needs and disabilities, irrespective of age or diagnosis.  We strive on a national level for improved treatment, education, welfare and acceptance for our children.<br/>Since its establishment in 2010, the SNPA has been actively involved across Departments and with other agencies and organisations to further our mutual goals.  I am also the chair of education sub-committee of Inclusion Ireland and I am on the board of directors of Inclusion Ireland and the Genetic and Rare Disorders Organisations to further that aim.  In a previous presentation to this committee on 7 November 2012, the SNPA referred to the current resourcing model and its inadequacies.  It stated:<blockquote>The special educational resource allocation system administrated by the NCSE under Department of Education policy is currently based on diagnosis.  SNPA would like to see an alignment of the model of special education resource allocation with the needs-based approach being proposed in the area of disability service provision.</blockquote>In 2013, following the consultation on special education provision and subsequent publication of the NCSE report, Delivery for students with special education needs - A better and more equitable way, in 2014, the SNPA was again invited to participate in a consultation on the new model for teaching allocations on behalf of our members whose children span the broad spectrum of disabilities and special educational needs.  We are encouraged by the development of such a proposed new model and support it in principle as it reflects much of the input of SNPA members who contributed to our verbal and written submissions to the NCSE.<br/>The proposed model is complex in so far as it is a whole new vision for special educational allocations in a mainstream school setting and we appreciate it will take some time for stakeholders, including parents and public representatives, to gain an understanding of the overall vision as it is incomparable to the current system in which many inequities have been identified due to its prescriptive nature.<br/>Notwithstanding the potential of a new model for allocating additional teaching supports and the increase in the number of resource teaching posts, the overall provision of hours over recent years has led to a 15% reduction in resource teaching hours across the board since 2011.  The Special Needs Parents Association cannot stand over a new model whereby the reduced pool of resources is seen as a baseline from which the new model will be implemented.  The 15% reduction must be addressed in the upcoming budget.  As the implementation of the model will involve a major change in how teaching supports will be delivered and a shift towards self-management of those supports in school, educators, parents and pupils must have assurance that the overall pool of resources will be available to deliver a system to meet the educational needs of children presenting and that children with learning difficulties at the milder end of the spectrum, in particular, will not lose out in the long term due to pressure as a result of historic reductions to special teaching supports which have not been reinstated.</p> <p>The full implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 has not been realised a decade on, thus undermining the once envisaged framework of rights for children with special needs.  The Special Needs Parents Association, SNPA, would request that the Department of Education and Skills sets out a timeline and costings for the full implementation of outstanding parts of the Act and that the development and implementation of the new model will be in line with the Act with particular reference to individual educational plans. <br/>The following observations are based on feedback from parents about the NCSE working group report.  The Special Needs Parents Association is fortunate to have a diverse profile of parent members, among whom are parents who work in the current special education system as well as having personal experience of supporting their own child through the education system and parents who have detailed knowledge of the educational and social challenges associated with a broad range of learning difficulties and disabilities. <br/>I will touch on aspects of the model that Mr. Stack presented.  I will deal with the allocation of additional teaching supports to schools.  The current methods of allocating teaching supports to schools and individual children have served many children well, but it is recognised that anomalies and exclusions exist when using a system of allocations based on diagnosis and numbers of pupils and teachers without regard to the need for such allocations on an individual and school level.  SNPA supports the implementation of a model based on needs and in line with reforms currently ongoing in the children&rsquo;s disability services - progressing disability services for children and young people -<i></i>but would add caution that any new model be properly tested before being fully implemented and that a further and final consultation period be planned for a later date once work on outstanding finer details in the model framework have been completed. <br/>Mr. Stack broke down the observations on proposed new model in respect of the school educational profile into three component parts.  With regard to complex special educational needs, the descriptors for complex special educational needs need to be robust.  The current descriptors of the NCSE working group report use the word &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; on two occasions and this would need a definition in order to have transparency and a clear understanding of what level professionals and parents identify behaviour in particular as extreme.  It is our understanding that the NCSE, NEPS and HSE are currently consulting each other on the development of clear descriptors to identify students with complex educational needs and these should be subject to a further consultation period once drafted. <br/>On the question of standardised test results, parents have indicated concern over the use of standardised test results in developing a school profile.  This comes from experience of their children who have high STEM scores 8-10, but have significant impairments requiring teaching and other supports.  In pages 40 and 41 of the NCSE report, it outlines the many caveats that were considered and recommendations 7-8 have addressed this concern.  The Department must ensure that resources are available for accessible teacher training and that NEPS or the proposed inclusion support service, ISS, have the staffing resources to support schools to process and analyse test results in a timely manner, minimising the administrative burden on teachers.</p></speech>

Once the weightings model that Mr. Stack has described is further finalised, we would seek further consultation on the weightings model as we think all stakeholders are concerned about various aspects of the weighting model.</p><p>  The schools that would be facing a significant reduction in support teaching numbers as a result of calculating both the baseline component and the school profile should be allowed a significant transition period in order to allow for staffing adjustment in line with the reduced numbers.</p><p>  In recognition that the Department would move from a diagnosis based system, we have addressed an issue with the Department that it looks to its other schemes that currently require a diagnosis in order to access different ranges of supports, including special class provision, and certain assistive technology autism units.  We have flagged the Department on what systems it may need to look at to coincide with a non-diagnostic based system.  That applies to access to scribes at second level and examination supports.  </p><p>  On the inclusion support service, SNPA would like to see that the new body be developed and incorporate the national education psychological service, NEPS, the behaviour support service and the special education support service.  We believe that one integrated model of educational support working on a geographical basis, giving in-school support and outside school support with the ability to network with disability network teams, thereby providing a whole school package of supports, is the direction to follow.  We would like to have an input into the group that is looking at the framework for the inclusion support service.</p><p>  A proposal that goes beyond the model is that the Department of Education and Skills would look at the feasibility of establishing an independent education appeals office which would carry out the function of processing the appeals for every educational scheme in the Department of Education and Skills and not restricted to the current model and appeals system that has yet to be established.</p><p>  In conclusion, the process of change is always challenging for parents, schools and all involved in the educational sector.  SNPA would like to see a periodic review of the model once it is rolled out.  We support a model based on needs and run in conjunction with the health services and the disability service for children under the age of 18 years.  We understand that in order to have successful educational outcomes for children with special needs, they are intrinsically linked to the provision of therapeutic interventions to support their development, particularly in relation to communication and behavioural support.  Both of these are often the greatest barriers and in some instances, the teacher does not hold the keys to opening the door.</p><p>  It is beyond the remit of the committee to discuss issues in relation to the health sector and disability services support, but we know from a recent report from Inclusion Ireland that we are probably at 50% of the level of speech and language therapists required to provide an adequate service.  I understand from teaching bodies they have a focus on the therapeutic interventions that would support the teachers to be able to deliver a proper education to children with special educational needs.  I ask members to take it up with the relevant Ministers.</p></speech>

It is always desirable that schools with the greatest need for additional supports have a mechanism whereby those supports can be accessed.  It is also desirable that equity prevails and that the school with the greatest needs receives the greatest level of support.</p><p>  Staffing and financing schools to reflect the additional resources required for children with special or additional needs is a complex process.  There is a very real fear among principals and teachers nationwide that the proposed new model could be used to further reduce special education needs allocations to primary schools.  It is imperative that the 15% reduction in resource allocation to primary schools imposed in recent years is immediately restored and that this be used as an initial alleviation for schools who will be losing staff.  In addition, there is an increase in the school-going population, probably increasing by 2% every year, and one has to factor in that the limit on the number of teachers supporting special needs pupils has not increased because of the cap on that figure.  Effectively, the number is down 20% on where it would have been without those reductions.</p> <p>The Irish Primary Principals Network would like certain observations and recommendations to be noted.  We believe the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 should be fully implemented.  It is hard to believe the Act was first introduced ten years ago.  We are still waiting for it to be fully implemented and enacted.</p><p> I would like to deal with a few of the concerns that are affecting principal teachers around the country before setting out what we consider to be the benefits of the proposed model.  The school profiling element of this model has caused deep concern.  Many principals, particularly in rural and smaller communities, are worried that the gathering of personal information could damage the school-home relationship.  Given that this information is already held by the Central Statistics Office in one form or another, one would have to ask why it was not gathered from that source rather than from schools.</p><p> Principals are also concerned to have been told that if they do not survey parents, they are entitled to come up with a guesstimate that they consider to be an accurate reflection of the current position.  As future resources and audits will be based on those guesstimates - it might be one's best professional estimate, but it is still an estimate rather than a fact - there is a high level of unease among principals.</p><p> I would like to mention three areas in which clarification has been sought by principals.  Will high-performing schools be punished for efficient use of available resources and lose some of their current allocation?  Is profiling guaranteed to deliver a more equitable distribution of resources?  Can the NCSE and the Department guarantee that profiling will not lead to the establishment of school league tables without regard for complexity of need and social context?  This is causing a certain amount of concern.</p><p> Many schools will inevitably lose supports as a result of school profiling and the establishment of a baseline allocation.  When many schools examine their profiles, they feel the proposed baseline allocation of 15% is much too low.  Even though they might agree in principle that the reallocation or redistribution of resources is to be admired.  The numbers of many small rural schools have already been affected by changes in the pupil-teacher ratio.  Such schools, which are being asked to be inclusive, are finding it difficult to come to terms with the possibility of losing their supports.</p><p> Everyone around here will know that all politics is local.  If a school is losing resources, it will not be happy with the new model.  This is what we are hearing back on the ground.  Smaller rural schools, in particular, are afraid they will no longer enjoy the supports they availed of in recent years as they brought pupil scores from 20 to 30, from 30 to 40, or from 40 to 50.  This is a major concern for them.</p><p> We fully accept that the new model has many benefits.  The streamlining of the allocation process will bring benefits.  It will introduce greater equity to the system.  Large numbers of Traveller children, newcomer children and children with complex needs will have unhindered access to adequate supports.  As teachers, parents and principals, we fully support the elimination of the labelling of children.  If that can be done, we will be delighted.</p><p> It is proposed to provide for automatic access to necessary supports without the requirement for a diagnosis.  However, a diagnosis will still be required for SNA support.  That will be a dilemma.  We would have loved the SNA system to be structured in line with this.  A package of supports, including the services of a National Educational Psychological Service psychologist if one is available, is provided in schools.  It is not just a support teacher, a SNA or a class teacher.  We hope there will be an increase in the number of psychologists.</p><p> We welcome the decision to start using the term "support teacher".  We have been looking for that for nine years, since 2005.  We do not feel there should be a distinction or separation between learning support and resource teachers.  In the last year, teachers have been passing themselves on the road going to and from different schools.  We are delighted that this is coming to an end.</p><p> Overall, we welcome the thrust of the new proposals.  Consideration needs to be given to the implications and impact of the proposal with regard to profiling.  There is a vacuum at the moment because schools are looking at the 15% allocation and nothing else.  They are filling that vacuum by saying "we are going from two teachers down to half a teacher".  That will have a knock-on effect.  The bottom line is what is best for the children in our schools.  That is where our concern will be.</p></speech>

In particular, I thank the National Council for Special Education for the work that has gone into these proposals.  I would like to follow up the presentations by asking a few questions.  Can the representatives of the National Council for Special Education give some more information on the sort of timeline that will be required when this is being introduced?  Is it expected that all of this will be introduced at once?  Ms Dempsey mentioned the need for testing.  How does she envisage that this will be done?  Does she think testing will be required across the board before this is introduced?</p><p>  It has been indicated that the baseline allocation will be 15%.  Can the witnesses outline how they expect the allocation to break down between the three components that will considered when a decision is made on a school's application - the level of special educational need in the school, the social profiling of the school and the standardised testing?  In general, what type of balance are we talking about at this stage?  Mr. Goff of the Irish Primary Principals Network mentioned the social profiling element of this process, which is the subject of a great deal of concern among teachers.  I know from talking to principals, in particular, that they are worried about the profiling they have been asked to do in recent weeks.  They have been asked to say how many people have medical cards and to provide financial details.  The vast majority of the people to whom I have spoken are not in a position to access that type of information.  They do not feel it is fair to ask them to get it.  Most of them guessed what the correct details might be.  One principal told me he had given an honest assessment even though he suspected his school might have got a higher allocation if his estimates had suggested there is more disadvantage in the school.  It is very unfair to ask principals to engage in this profiling.  They are being put under pressure to adjust their guesses in a way that might bring their schools closer to the disadvantaged category.  Other than asking the school principals to act in this way, is there any other way of establishing these facts?  As I have said, I do not think it is fair to do it in this way.</p></speech>

I commend the working group on the model it has proposed.  It certainly has a great deal of merit.  When it was initially published, I spoke to the Minister about the timeframe that might be used to roll it out.  I was a little surprised to hear her say she does not think it will be ready for next September, and that it might even take until September 2016 to prepare it.  The more I read about it and the more I became familiar with it, the more I accepted the need to press the pause button.  A great deal of work has yet to be done on certain aspects of this proposal, such as the weighting system.  The descriptors will have to be put in place.  The issues with regard to the surveys that are currently being undertaken by schools will have to be resolved.  We must ensure the weighting system that has been proposed is well thought through.  The third highest weighting in the weighting system relates to the social context of the school.  Concern has been relayed to me about the information that will be gathered as part of this process by means of surveys or guesstimates.  Who will have access to that information?  Maybe that could be clarified here today.  What will happen with the information when it is gathered?  There is a reluctance on the part of some parents to provide this information.</p> <p> On the move away from allocating resources on the basis of diagnosis, we are all aware of the merits of the proposed new approach and the difficulties associated with the current system.  Ms Dempsey referred to consulting other Departments on the need for a diagnosis to access additional supports.  The Department must examine this matter internally.  Some capitation grants, for instance, are allocated on the basis of the number of diagnosed students in a school.  A school is allocated a baseline capitation grant and receives increased capitation for every student who has a learning difficulty.  If we move to a system where a diagnosis is not required to secure additional resources, which we would all welcome, we must avoid circumstances where diagnoses are delayed as this would have an effect on schools' funding and finances that goes beyond the current model.  The Department must take this factor into account.  Was it taken into account in the deliberations on the proposed new model?</p><p> Budget 2011 included a commitment to increase the number of National Educational Psychological Service psychologists to 210 from the current figure of 173.  As a significant number of these are on maternity or sick leave, I do not know how many of NEPS psychologists are currently working.</p><p> I welcome the proposed new model.  Once detailed discussions of the proposal have concluded, there would be merit in having further consultations, particularly in respect of the waiting system and descriptors.  Overall, I commend the report, which proposes a model that is much better than the current model.</p></speech>

I welcome the principle underpinning the proposed change and the objective it is hoped it will achieve.</p><p>  I commend the two previous speakers on their contributions.  There is nothing worse than politicians engaging in opportunistic party politics on the issue of special needs education.  The most unedifying spectacle I have observed as a politician has been people playing with the fears of the parents of children with special needs.  It was horrendous to see this and in commending the two previous speakers I am not suggesting that either of them has done this. </p><p>  I attended a briefing given some months ago by the National Council for Special Education in the clock tower of the Department of Education and Skills.  I raised the absence of STen scores at junior and senior infants level and representatives of the NCSE addressed the issue.  </p><p>  I concur with Deputy Jonathan O'Brien on the timeline.  All of us want the new model to be introduced sooner rather than later.  A two tier system has emerged in the allocation of resources for special needs education.  Parents who have sufficient resources to pay for a private assessment can jump the queue and obtain resources, which influences the overall allocation of resources to schools.  While we all want the new model implemented, schools are already overloaded with change because the previous Minister was extraordinarily dynamic and introduced many changes in the education system.  Change is always difficult.  I sit on the fence on whether we should rush to implement the new model before September 2015, as per the current objective, or whether we should aim to have it implemented the following year.  I do not have a definitive view on that matter. </p><p>     Ms Dempsey referred to a 15% reduction in resources for children with special needs.  I understand this is a reference to the decision to withhold some resources until enrolment has been completed in September and subsequently distribute them on the basis of enrolment numbers.  I ask the representatives of the National Council for Special Education to clarify the matter.  I have always championed the need to maintain existing levels of resources for children with special needs and I was forthright in commending the previous Minister on holding the line on this issue during very difficult times.  The number of special needs assistants stands at 10,575, the same number in place on the day the Government took office.  The number of resource teachers stands at 10,600 and the figure was increased in the previous budget.  I ask for clarification regarding the 15% reduction in resources to which Ms Dempsey referred. </p><p>  As a former member of the Irish Primary Principals Network, I have the highest regard for the work the network does for school principals.  I do not often make comments of this nature but it is important to praise every bridge as we cross it.  During my time as a school principal, I held the IPPN in the utmost regard especially for providing assistance and resources to school principals to upskill.  </p><p>  While I accept that profiling is difficult, we must accept that it is already in the system.  DEIS schools have engaged in profiling since Adam was a boy, so to speak.  I have been contacted by three school principals from my constituency expressing concern about the issue of profiling.  It was interesting to note their profile - I ask the witnesses to excuse the pun - as they were from schools with an unusually large allocation of resource teachers and special needs assistants.  It is a fact that some schools provide a much more hospitable environment for children with special educational needs than others.  Some schools keep a distance and do not encourage parents of children with special educational needs to enrol their children, while others are extraordinarily hospitable and have made into a fine art the provision of education to children with learning needs and the creation of a favourable environment for them.  By any comparison, these schools are top-heavy with resource teachers and special needs assistants.  I am not suggesting for one moment that the allocation to these schools is overstated.  The reason for the higher allocation is that they have provided a more hospitable environment which has resulted in them having a higher enrolment of children with special needs.  One can understand, therefore, that such schools are concerned about profiling.  I certainly understand from where the three principals who contacted me are coming.  They are, however, missing the point because profiling is only one element in the proposed new model, which features two further criteria.  Moreover, the Department will not seek the level of detail that has been suggested by some sources.  The profile will be, I believe, broader than some principals realise.  The Department must provide some assurance to schools that they will not lose resources as a consequence of providing a profile.</p><p>  I ask the witnesses from the National Council for Special Education to comment on the current position regarding English as an additional language support hours.</p><p>  I am intrigued by Mr. Goff's comment that a diagnosis will still be required for the allocation of a resource teacher.  I ask him to clarify the matter as I has not given any thought.  Would it not be counter-productive to require a diagnosis for the allocation of one resource and not for another?</p><p>  It is great that teachers will no longer be required to crisscross between schools.</p><p>  I presume the new model will have a positive impact on demand for NEPS psychologists.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

Will they confirm that the proposed new model would eliminate the practice whereby more affluent parents have been able to secure professional guidance and assessment and thereby jump the queue?</p></speech>

I also welcome the proposed new model for the allocation of resources.  I understand the new model would be cost neutral as it would be based on current numbers and would not result in the creation of new posts.  Is that the case?</p><p>  On the rationale for not relying solely on the medical model, is it the case that some students who may not have a medical need will require assistance?  If the waiting times for obtaining a medical assessment were significantly reduced, would that have an impact on the proposal?  I am aware that concerns have been raised about social profiling, specifically on the possibility of making allocations on socio-economic grounds.</p> <p>Would you have any suggestions as to how schools could go about that?  I know Mr. Goff raised concerns about how that would be estimated and how it would be done.  There are pupils with a medical diagnosis of a condition who may also have a high or above-average STen score and that often would have an impact on the number of resource teaching hours they may be allocated.  Also, is there any research or data that indicates that this particular method would have more positive outcomes?</p></speech>

In my experience, it is probably the first time at a committee hearing that all of the stakeholders have broadly supported what has been proposed, which is good.  Has Mr. Stack, as part of the further consultation, which is to be welcomed, heard anything that would suggest the method could be modified or is it too early in the process to suggest that?</p><p>  Mr. Goff has expressed the concern of members of his organisation that the proposal could be used to reduce resources.  Has there been any analysis on whether it would result in the provision of less resources, the same level or more?  Could it result in greater resources being required?  </p><p>  Are there any implications of the use of the new term "support teacher"  for people who are currently working in this area - there are two types of work - and are there any implications for job descriptions?  </p><p>  I am also interested in clarification on the 15% reduction.  Is it a case of the numbers remaining the same and the number of students increasing thereby resulting in an effective 15% reduction?  Is that really what we are talking about?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.120" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="13:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014100800008#G00300"><p>I welcome all of the attendees.  My understanding is that we are trying to get better, fairer outcomes using existing resources for children with special educational needs.  If that is the goal, that is very welcome.  However, I have an initial question and perhaps Mr. Stack will have the answer to this.  Does Mr. Stack know the number of teachers at second level who currently do not have any special educational needs training despite the fact that they have children in their classrooms with special educational needs?  We are trying to implement a new model without a diagnosis or an assessment, without the little bit of teacher guidance a conversation with a psychologist would give, and with a majority, I suspect, of second-level teachers having absolutely no special educational needs training at all.  This weekend, I spoke to a person involved in a school in Galway city.  This school is considered to be a very high-performing school.  It has 56 teachers none of whom have specialist training in autism, Asperger's syndrome, ADHD and so forth.  What are we doing?  Teachers are exhausted.  One teacher described a child in his class who spends the whole day playing with a key-ring.  The child is instructed to take out a piece of paper and put it on the board.  The child needs someone to help him take out the piece of paper.  He has to be prompted.  This child does not have a special needs assistant, SNA.  Teacher education and up-skilling is fundamental.  I am sure Mr. Cottrell and Mr. Goff would accept this.  Have we any figures on the matter?  Today I have set about tabling a parliamentary question on that issue.</p><p>  The model refers to 15% up-front resources and 85% based on the school educational profile.  Where does a child with a very specific learning need, difficulty or syndrome - such as ADHD, autism or Asperger's syndrome - or challenging behaviour figure in that 85%?  I have grave concerns about very demanding parents, although I understand why they are demanding, putting pressure on a school and their children getting more resources than the child with a very definite need who needs a lot of personal attention.  Where do these children figure in this?  The standardised test is taken into account.  What else is?  Syndromes exist and learning difficulties exist independent of social class.  I have done research on this area myself.  Ultimately, the question I am asking is how effective is the policy of inclusion if we do not have basic teacher training.  I have a final question.  With this new model, and I understand it is well-intentioned, are individual education plans, IEPs being wiped out?  I think it is good - I was watching and listening to Mr. Stack on the monitor upstairs - that people are not waiting for a child to be diagnosed before doing something.  However, what if the child's underlying difficulties are not understood by the teacher?  That is a critical question.</p></speech>

The questions I was going to ask have already been asked, in particular by Senator Healy Eames.  If there is no assessment and no diagnosis, is it for the principal of the school to decide who gets what resource teaching hours?  Are we now putting the onus on the principal to make an assessment of the child's needs?  I wonder how principals will react to that.  As Senator Healy Eames has already stated, parent pressure is a big issue.  Are parents now going to be blaming the principal of a school for allocating to Jack more resource teaching hours than Billy?  How is that to be managed?</p></speech>

Plenty has been asked that we need to reflect on and we will do that.  There are two parts to this.  There is the new model and its rationale.  There is also the implementation or the operational issues.  The positive responses so far about the model are very encouraging.  I think it is almost unanimous that we need to move to a new model.  The legitimate question has been raised of whether we do it tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.  Further, the question of what t's need to be crossed and i's need to be dotted has been asked.</p><p>  I cannot give the Senator a number on how many teachers at second-level or post-primary level have appropriate training.  However, we have published a guide for parents.  Question 2 and its answer might be helpful.  It asks if school principals and teachers are equipped to make decisions about a child's education that previously required a report from a psychologist or other professional.  That question is answered although I will not go through that answer in detail now.  However, this kind of matter has been dealt with by the working group.  We say that the model proposed is the model on which to build the house and the foundations have been laid. </p></speech>

Teachers in schools are already engaged in assessing, on an ongoing basis and in a number of different ways, their students' learning needs.  They also use their professional judgment on how best to use resources in schools.  We would hope this good practice would play an important part in the proposed model, if it is accepted.</p> <p>However, we have recognised in our papers that schools will need additional guidance in that regard.</p><p> We have identified the area of professional training and development of teachers as perhaps the most important element in all of our policy advice.  This applies in the most recent paper and in an earlier paper on how children in general should be supported in schools.  We have said consistently that the teacher and the quality of teaching in the classroom are probably the most important things in a child's education.  In the documents we have set out a framework for the professional development of teachers and our recommendations in that regard.  A central concern of the National Council for Special Education is the need to have in place an appropriate framework of professional development for teachers.</p><p> In looking at children's needs in schools and identifying and assessing those needs to determine the level of support required in schools, we envisage schools would receive support from the National Educational Psychological Service.  NEPS has already issued guidelines around the continuum of support and how children should be supported in schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Griffin" time="13:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014100800009#H00200"><p>I will echo Ms Byrne's point.  In each of our policy advice statements we have identified teacher training as absolutely crucial.  However, we need to manage expectations.  This proposal is about how to allocate the resources and the use of those resources.  It cannot answer every issue.  It is simply a mechanism to determine if there is a better way to allocate the resources that are available to the school system.  It stems from an equity issue more than anything else.  Our supports paper, published in May 2013, had 28 recommendations and this change is simply one of them.  For example, in respect of the work of individualised education plans and so forth we have recommended that schools should be required to develop learning plans for students.</p><p>  There was a question on timelines.  The question of timelines is very much a matter for the Department at this stage.  The Department hosted a process of consultation last week involving several partners.  The assistant secretary said that September 2015 would be the earliest date.  That is literally one year away and the change must be introduced at the beginning of a school year.  The Department listened to people's concerns and advice but, as far as I know, no decision has been taken on a timeline.</p><p>  The issue of piloting was brought up.  The working group advised the Department to take time to listen to people's concerns.  One concern of the National Council for Special Education is the need to support children with special educational needs, ensure they are supported well in schools and that they receive the right amount of supports.  We have no wish to send an absolute shock to the system and we do not believe this should necessarily be a shock to the system.  There are over 11,000 teachers at the moment in the system.  Whether they have received much training, they are in place at the moment and they are working.  It is about a fairer distribution of these teachers.</p><p>  There are three components to the baseline.  The working group made a recommendation to the effect that at the top the most weighting should be given to children who had very complex needs, followed by the results of the standardised tests and then the social context.  Those are the three components.</p><p>  Some concern was expressed last week - those of us on the working group were aware of it - on the survey and the use of the survey and estimates.  It is fair to say that a good deal of time was spent around the table trying to establish whether we could find another way rather than putting out a survey to schools.  Teachers were represented on the working group and it was a matter of concern for us.  Actually, the feedback from partners following our consultations was that it was very important for the voice of the principal to be heard when describing the social context of the school.  Partners were strong about the need for this voice to be heard.</p><p>  One question that arose was whether there was one source of information that could give us this information independently and objectively.  There was a concern about what would happen if a person from one school did not exaggerate but someone from another school did and this was tossed around.  Anyway, the reality is that because of the mobile nature of students they are not simply linked to the demographics of a given area.  In many cases there is only one school in an area but in the case of many urban and city schools children travel.  One example might be a fee-paying school in a disadvantaged area.  If we considered the demographics of that particular area, the school might get many supports but it may not necessarily have a large number of children who need those supports.</p><p>  An extraordinary amount of time was taken over this.  We were advised by the Educational Research Centre that surveying would be an appropriate way to get data.  It is not an ideal way but it is a valid way.  When the ERC has examined the exercises over the years on DEIS schools, the survey has stood the test of time, even with all of its difficulties.  Obviously, we were aware that there would be concern.</p></speech>

The NCSE does not have access to that information and at the moment the Department does not have access to that information.  It is with the ERC and the centre has the original DEIS programme information as well.</p><p>  Reference was made to moving away from diagnosis.  I take on board absolutely the issue of the need to align with other Department of Education and Skills schemes and to consider the impact on other departmental schemes.  We emphasised to the Department that it should take time to consider the matter and I know the Department will do so.  I will pass on the comments about the need to increase resources for NEPS to the representatives of the service.  I imagine they will be delighted to hear that the committee believes support for NEPS needs to be increased.  I will pass it on to the Department as well.</p><p>  Reference was made to the 15% reduction and I wish to clarify the matter.  Previously, if a child had a severe and profound learning disability and was attending a mainstream school it would have been unusual.  Anyway, the child would have received five hours per week additional resource teaching hours.  Some years ago, because of the financial difficulties of the State, that was reduced to four and a half hours and then four hours and 15 minutes.  This is the 15% reduction that was referred to.  However, to provide some reassurance - I imagine the Department will provide this information - when our original paper was published in 2013 there was approximately 9,600 resource and learning support teachers.  The figure is now above 11,000.  Therefore, even though the number per child has been reduced, the actual number of teachers being allocated by the Department to the NCSE for us to allocate to schools has actually increased substantially.</p><p>  Ms Byrne will address the question on English as an additional language.</p><p>  There was a question about special needs assistants.  I emphasise that the terms of reference were specifically with reference to teaching support and therefore we did not examine the linkages with SNAs.</p><p>  There was a question on whether it was a cost-neutral model and whether it would have more or less resources.  This was a proposal for a better way to allocate whatever level of resources were available.  It did not take the level of resources into account.  The idea was actually to try to find a better, more equitable and fairer way to allocate resources, whatever the level.  The NCSE does not control the level of resources; that is a matter for the Minister.</p><p>  Reference was made to support teachers and the implications for job descriptions.  The emphasis should be on whether support teachers will have an appropriate level of training or access to an appropriate level of training rather than a description stating that they need X amount if they are learning support staff or Y amount if they are resource teachers.  We have emphasised in our overall recommendations that every teacher who is acting in this role should have additional training made available to him or her.  We believe that is very important.</p><p>  Is there any outcome data in the existing set-up?</p> <p>There is very little outcome data when one looks to analyse it.  The research is very clear that there is no single best model.  It provided the principles that informed the working group's proposals.  </p><p> One of the working group's recommendations was that there should be some reporting on impact.  A figure of 11,000 teachers out of approximately 60,000 is a very significant level of support that is being provided for children with special educational needs.  It is very important for parents, schools and ourselves in the NCSE to know the impact this is having on the education of children with special educational needs.  Is it the right support?  If it were having no impact, for example, that would be a real worry.  We would like to collect that data and that is one of our recommendations.</p><p> Senator Naughton asked a question about the waiting time for diagnosis.  If this were reduced, would this have an impact on our recommendation?  Probably not, because a diagnosis in and of itself does not actually inform a school's or a child's real needs.  It gives broad indicators, but there is such a spectrum of ability within every category of disability.  All the research is telling us that it is the wrong basis to use for the allocation of resources.  Children have very complex needs.  A child who has many different conditions could just miss out on every single one of the cut-off points.  This is a better and a fairer way of doing it.  </p><p> There was some concern that schools will have nothing, which I would like to clarify. The NCSE absolutely believes in assessment for children.  If we take professionals away from having to spend all of their time assessing a diagnosis, they will be able to assess for teaching and learning.  That will provide much better quality information to schools.  </p><p> Deputy Conaghan asked if jumping the queue will be disallowed.  It will not be needed for the child to access resources. It does away with the concept that a diagnosis of disability is needed in order to gain access to supports.  The supports will be given to the school.  Parents may wish to have a child diagnosed - many parents would like a diagnosis to know how they can best help their child - but that is a separate issue.  The benefit of this model is that, in school, the child will not have to wait for two or three years in order to access the supports that he or she needs.</p></speech>

One concerned English as an additional language, EAL.  In our consultations it was put to us that the social context element should include children with English as an additional language because schools felt it would be very important that those children would be included in building the profile of the school.</p><p>  Another question was asked about junior and senior infants classes, which would not have standardised test results available.  We are trying to build a profile of the school, so we would have, or would hope to have information about junior and senior infants pupils who have complex needs.  In relation to standardised tests, we would be picking the instances in the school where those tests are done, like second class, fourth class and sixth class, and we would be using those results to build a profile for the rest of the school and that would include the junior and senior infants cohorts.  </p><p>  In addition to the point that Ms Griffin made about us emphasising the importance of assessment, one person asked if this would wipe out individual education plans, IEPs.  On the contrary, it places great importance on planning for children in schools and we have recommended that, at the end of the year, schools might provide some information on how the targets that were set in the plans for children were reached.  It thus places an importance on individualised planning for children.</p><p>  One person asked about a child with very high medical needs who might do very well on the standardised STen scores, but might still have learning difficulties in other areas.  It is important for people to understand that our proposed model is about how we get the resources into schools.  The school can then decide what the needs of the children are.  There is nothing in our model that precludes a school from identifying that a child needs particular support in an area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.133" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lorraine Dempsey" time="14:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014100800010#J00300"><p>A few of the Deputies raised the issue of affluent parents 'queue jumping' - I believe that was the expression.  This came up in the report on special education provision in 2013, and the phrase 'affluent parents' has been used quite regularly since then in relation to assessments.  It is a misnomer, because all parents from all socioeconomic groups were trying to find methods to privately fund assessments.  It was not just affluent parents.  The St. Vincent de Paul was actually helping individual parents to pay up to several hundred euro for psychological assessments, because the parents knew that the overall impact on their family of their child not getting support in education was significant.  It was not just rich parents who were trying to obtain private assessments and paying for them.  It was all parents.  I would like to put that notion to bed.</p><p>  Senator Healy Eames and one of the Deputies asked about special needs assistants and diagnosis being needed.  It should be clarified to avoid confusion, especially for any parents who might be reading the transcript or listening in, that a diagnosis is not needed for an application for SNA support.  The needs of the child, though, and the care needs, have to be expressed in the reports and assessments that are sent in with the application.  There are children who will never have a diagnosis for the conditions that they have.  They are children who would be classed as having syndromes without names.  There will never be a diagnosis, yet they might have significant physical care needs, for example.  A diagnosis is not actually needed.  In some respects we are now looking at a system of teaching allocations where diagnosis will not be needed either, thus taking away pressure.</p><p>  Deputy O'Brien made reference to the fact that while we are potentially moving towards systems in education, and actually moving towards systems in health, where a diagnosis will not be necessary in order to access supports, it is important that there are still pathways to diagnosis for children.  Although diagnosis will inform teaching to some degree, children should be viewed as individuals.  Their needs should be assessed, not necessarily whether they have autism or ADHD.  Those specific diagnoses have been used to put our children into boxes and if they do not tick the box on the form they get nothing.  We have always advocated for moving away from the box-ticking.  </p><p>  Deputy O'Brien referenced several diagnoses.  In order to get to grips with what this proposed model is, it is necessary to take off what I would refer to quite frequently as 'disability blinkers'.  Do not look at the specific diagnosis, but look to the range of needs within diagnoses.  Every child is an individual.  Parents will recognise that when they get more familiar with the system.  Hopefully communication with parents and educators about what this will mean for their children will alleviate some of the concerns.  We are moving from a system where the child has a label and he or she gets X number of hours towards a system where the child's needs are being met.  He or she may not necessarily get a prescriptive number of hours and that is something for everyone at this meeting to understand.  That special allocation may not be a specific number of hours.  It may instead fluctuate throughout the school year depending on the child's needs.  It may be two teachers working together within a classroom or working with that child in a group of children.  It is a fluid system whereby the schools themselves and the teaching team will hopefully be able to assess the varying needs of the children and how those needs fluctuate depending on different difficulties that arise with the individual children.  No children remain static, and their needs never remain static.  We hope that the model will allow for that flexibility to meet our children's needs.</p><p> On teachers not having that extra level of special educational training, a study found that about 50% of the overall teaching body - 60,000 teachers - did not have additional special educational needs training.</p> <p>This is a cause of concern.  Some teachers will learn when they have good teaching support teams around them, that is, peer learning within the school environment.  The teaching profession already assesses children's learning needs, so this other assessment will not be entirely new.  As regards assessment tools, being able to differentiate the curricula further and meeting the challenging needs of some children, there should be ease of access for teachers to training and an examination of how it is delivered, especially to part-time teachers.  For example, there could be more web-based training.  Training in respect of special educational needs, for example, behavioural support, could also be rolled out to special needs assistants.  I am not referring to direct education or training, but SNAs currently do not have the luxury of receiving any training that would help the entire school body to meet the children's needs.</p></speech>

Everyone needs extra resources, but if a school does a good job and its scores increase, will it be punished by having resources removed?  Removing resources from a school that has been effective is a major blow psychologically.  This should be kept in mind, as it can be demoralising for people.  There are few workplaces where the better one does one's work, the fewer resources one is given to do the same work next year.  There may be such places, but I have not encountered them.</p><p>  I welcome the model.  Great work has been done in this regard and I commend the group, but I will make a couple of points.  It is a breakthrough in terms of equity, with "equity" being the key word.  The model should be extended to include not only children with special needs, but also children facing socioeconomic issues - those in the DEIS programme - Traveller children and children with English as an additional language, EAL.  New Zealand has combined aspects and put together a framework.  Under its weighting system, a child with autism might be considered the same as, for example, 2.5 non-autistic children, and a child with no English might be considered to be an additional 0.5.  In this way, a school with 200 children might have a total allocated resource base of 275, with the extra 75 stemming from the additional weighting.  Perhaps this suggestion could be considered.  We do not want there to be differences in allocation between different aspects of school life.</p><p>  I acknowledge Deputy Jim Daly's remarks, but we have never encountered anything like the level of commentary and anger on our helpline for principals about their having to ask parents questions concerning sensitive information, particularly in the case of medium to small-sized schools where everyone knows everyone else.  Indeed, the principals might even have taught the parents.  The questions are about social welfare payments, whether parents have mortgages, whether they are living in local authority housing, and so on.  This is not a good idea.  Some people have referred to the advantages it provides and a number of partners may believe it has some value, but I am not sure they would say the same if they had to stand at the school door asking parents these questions.</p><p>  Guesstimation is not acceptable in today's world.  I spoke to the CSO which has not only electoral districts but also small area districts on which it can churn out phenomenal amounts of information.  These typically comprise household groups numbering 300 people.  The CSO can produce information about, for example, the primary earner in a home, whether family income supplement is being received, whether a mortgage is being paid, parents' education levels, and so forth.  The breadth of its information far exceeds what has been collected by the survey.  Perhaps the CSO should be reconsidered in this context.  The senior official to whom I spoke claimed that producing the relevant data would be possible if the CSO were given the brief.  Those data would be based on clusters of 300 people.  Principals have no difficulty with providing or reporting data on educational matters, but whether a family is receiving income supplement or paying a mortgage is not a school's business and asking questions like that damages the trust between school and home.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Goff" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014100800011#K00300"><p>I will make a couple of brief points in response to some of the questions.  Senator Moloney asked who decided who got what.  As Ms Byrne stated, there is a continuum of support.  We assess children from junior infants upwards.  If someone's support is dropped, it creates a problem, as is currently the case in schools.  Many of us operated a support teacher system even before this was introduced.  Having resource teachers for Traveller and EAL children meant that those children could have had four or five different teachers.  We changed that system years ago in order that a single support teacher would support a particular class grouping.  This model is in place in many schools.</p><p>  Individual educational plans are good practice, and teachers would not want to get rid of anything that is good practice.  We need to decide, however, who will receive an IEP.  In many schools, if a child receives resource hours, he or she also receives an IEP.  If a child is under the general allocation model like the old learning support, however, he or she might have a group IEP only.  Schools probably need clarification on who will qualify for IEPs.  A large number is not possible.</p><p>  There is a greater role for the National Educational Psychological Service.  We would love to see it doing what it should have been doing, namely, coming to schools and working with teachers, support teachers and children.  All that NEPS can do under the current system is make a couple of assessments in order that a child might qualify for resources.  In fairness, NEPS is good and I would not quibble with its work.  Some of its staff have come to my school.</p><p>  Profiling and data have always been a problem.  Ironically, I am in a band 1 DEIS school, so we had the information to hand and did not experience the same issues.  The entire system probably should have been examined this time.  The survey questions I answered were those I answered during the mid-1990s on the original survey of disadvantage and in 2005 on the last DEIS survey.  The questions for DEIS schools have not changed, so this would have been an ideal opportunity to examine the entire system, although I know there was a different brief.</p><p>  We do not have a problem with Standard Ten educational norms scores except for the fact they are a narrow measure.  They were submitted originally on the basis that they would be used to examine trends in education, literacy and numeracy levels.  What we are hearing from principals is that it almost constitutes a breach of trust that the scores are being used to examine staffing levels instead of trends.  This is the problem with STen scores, but they are otherwise a good measure of trends.</p><p>  Initial teacher training presents a good opportunity for the inclusion of a significant element of special needs training.  That is where it should be done.  There is major concern about potential continuing professional development as this is only one of the initiatives being introduced in schools.  For example, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will be running a number of CPDs on changing the curriculum.</p> <p>It is not only continuing professional development for one item.  It is the overall package coming in to schools.</p></speech>

I was delayed.  I will get the written transcript from the clerk and read it.  I have no wish to repeat any of the issues touched on earlier.  It is good to see the consensus that there is room for improvement and that it would be much better to have an equitable model that is fair to everyone.  The meat will be in the detail and in knowing how it is applied.</p><p>  I realise the deputation is not in a position to give a commitment on extra resources but the transition from the current model to the new model will be crucial and there will have to be extra resources.  It will be impossible to take teachers out of one school overnight and put them somewhere else, in particular if some schools are going to see a significant drop in their allocation.  There will have to be some additionality, even if it is only on a short-term basis, to deal with the change and to ensure the system can be implemented smoothly.  To ensure a longer term success the Department will have to bite the bullet on the short-term costs.</p><p>  Another crucial issue is the survey.  I accept all the difficulties with the survey approach but, like everyone else, I see no better way of doing it, unfortunately.  One of the difficulties with the DEIS survey is that it is now horrendously and ridiculously out of date, and yet there is an unwillingness to look into it because it would mean additional resources and moving resources and there are always difficulties moving resources from one school to the next.</p><p>  There are schools whose social profile has changed dramatically in the years since the survey and they are being starved of resources because of the social change.  There may be situations in which the principal perhaps was not as creative as she could have been or did not stress the social profile as much as she should have.  Perhaps a new principal came in three or four years later only to be left wondering how on earth the school did not have DEIS band 1 status given the group of children and yet there is nothing the new principal can do to change it.  It will be crucial not only to get the right type of survey in place in the first place but to ensure a real commitment that it will be reviewed regularly.  Otherwise no one will have any faith in the system.  The DEIS programme is fantastic but the fact it has not been reviewed is causing issues for schools and resentment in the system.  It is long out of date.</p><p>  The process of transitioning and ensuring the survey is up to date will be crucial in ensuring this works properly.  These are both resource issues and, therefore, I respect that they are issues for the Minister more than for anyone before the committee.  This will be the meat in respect of whether it works and whether and how it takes off properly as a model.</p></speech>

Everyone is saying we are all in agreement around this table, but it is not a matter of being in agreement as much as getting this right.  Answers are still needed.  Equity is a prerequisite and I expect we should have equity.  We are discussing education as a human right for the child.</p><p>  I am not about to say all is fine and dandy.  I fully accept that every teacher, whether class teacher or subject teacher, is formatively assessing the child all the time and making judgments about the child.  There is a major difference, however, between that and the teacher coming to the conclusion a child is not learning and deciding what to do about it.  That is the question.  Differentiated teaching is an ideal but how does it fit with large numbers in classes?  Let us suppose there is a class of 30 children, including a child with Asperger's syndrome, although we may not wish to call it that, a child with autism, children with challenging behaviour or a child who perhaps is having a difficult time at home.  It is about coming to grips with all that.  I am not about to accept that this is an easy job.  That would be to ignore my entire background.  Without professional development and upskilling for all teachers, the job is impossible.  We are denying the right of children to education appropriate to their needs.  What are the plans for professional development of all teachers, including class teachers and subject teachers?  I accept it should be a prerequisite at teacher training colleges.  That area is improving but there are still many teachers in the system who have not had any such training.</p><p>  Is there any thought being put into videoconferencing?  For example, it could show a classroom with varied needs and how a teacher is responding.  There is a considerable difference between knowing a child is not learning and there is something wrong on the surface and knowing what is underpinning that.  Nine tenths of the iceberg is below the surface and that is the professional support to which I refer.  I do not accept that all teachers are capable of managing without help.  That would be to deny my experience and that of many others.  The question remains.  What are the plans for a mass offering of upskilling?</p><p>  Mr. Goff said he is keen to see NEPS in schools more often.  What are the plans for speech and language therapists to be devolved into clusters to support schools?  I had a child who used to lose three to four hours out of a classroom day by the time she got to Galway for her 45 minutes support and got back to school again.  That is not effective deployment of resources, especially not for the child.  We should consider a model where there is one speech and language therapist for a set of eight schools.  Nothing is as sure as the need for speech and language intervention.  The deputation will have the figures from the profiling.  I look forward to hearing the answers.</p></speech>

The deputation touched on it in the recommendations about the possibility of an independent appeals process if a school disagrees with the decision.  Will the deputation provide more information on that?  Is it something the deputation will tease out in the coming period through consultation?  I am unsure whether the deputation is willing or keen or has any views on the proposal from Ms Dempsey in terms of an independent appeals body for all education.  What is the position?</p><p>  Reference was made to the inclusion support service.  The book goes into some detail on recommendations and so forth.  Will the deputation expand on the inclusion support service and its role, as envisaged, from the implementation process through to how it will operate and who will sit on it?  Proposals have been put forward to the effect that the four bodies would come together and amalgamate.  Does the deputation have any views on the matter?</p></speech>

The committee has often been told that people with more money have an advantage over parents who have to go to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Is there any evidence of that?</p><p>  We have discussed profiling.  Let us consider the examination of the social context of schools.  Could the education and training boards be a resource in this regard?  For example, at one stage the local authority in my area carried out a social profiling of Lucan.  It produced some information that would not have come out otherwise.  We have a large amount of social housing but it is actually private rented accommodation.  It is not what is usually counted as traditional social housing.  Since education and training boards have a local governance aspect, could they assist schools and perhaps take the matter away from the principal, who may take the view that it is difficult to ask these questions?</p></speech>

This comes up often.  I am unsure whether it is being identified more clearly now or what exactly the dynamic is, but I am keen to hear the views of our guests in this regard because they would probably have a better steer on it than most.</p><p>  What has the feedback been from teachers and principals on the use of the STen, standard ten, score in standardised testing?</p> <p>Those that have made a great deal of progress in recent years and that have been particularly successful and performing well in supporting students who need additional supports and, therefore, have improved their test results feel they will be punished and not rewarded under a new system which takes those scores into account, even though they have managed to improve them bit by bit.</p><p> The greatest weighting will be given in the allocation of resources to the special educational needs requirement of a school.  How will that assessment be conducted under the new system?  Who will assess what are the special educational needs requirements of a school?  Will the resources be available to ensure that happens?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.144" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Griffin" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014100800013#M00200"><p>I should have mentioned earlier that the NCSE is working with and holding meetings with the Teaching Council regarding the need for a comprehensive professional development service to be provided in this area.  We have recommended to the Department that upskilling in special education should be mandatory because our previous research has shown that one child in every four learns differently, whether he or she has a special educational need, or is perceived by his or her parents or teachers as having a learning difficulty.  It is not simply that there may be one child with such a need in a school; it could potentially be one in every four children in a class.  Every teacher needs to be knowledgeable about children who learn differently.  We have passed that on to the Teaching Council and we are meeting its representatives in this regard.  I understand that special education is a permanent feature of the initial teacher education, ITE, course and the council is working on a framework of continuing professional development for all teachers.  It will finalise that over the next year or so.  We are, therefore, in the middle of discussions on that.  However, our discussions focus very much on the children who have learning difficulties and special educational needs.</p><p>  With regard to the inclusion and support service and providing additional assistance to schools, one of the aspects that strikes everybody when we take time to look and see where we are now as opposed to where we were 15 or 20 years ago is that many different services have been developed.  There is a national behavioural service, a special educational support service to provide training for teachers with special educational needs and many other different services.  Over the past few  years, there has been a huge turnover in the number of principals.  Currently, many principals have little experience.  While it was fine to have many different services in the system as long as everybody knew who did what, it became clear during our consultations for our May 2013 paper that there is a great deal of confusion about who does what and there were questions about overlap.  One of our recommendations regarding inclusion and support is to bring all the groups and all the functions relating to teacher training, advising schools and so on into one service, which we suggest should be called an inclusion and support service under our management.  By bringing people together, there will be clarity and it will be much easier for school administrators to understand what supports can be made available in order that they do not spend all their time ringing one person to be told it is another person and so on.  That would be an improvement.</p><p>  How we envisage that happening will have to be discussed over the next while in that the Department has to agree that such a service would be a good idea but if there was one place for people to go, which provided a holistic service to the school, there would be less opportunity for things to fall between the cracks, which is an issue currently.  We also envisage that where schools might enrol a child with special educational needs and they do not have experience in supporting such children, there will be a means within the inclusion and support service to provide an outreach service in the school to help the staff support the child.  It would be a good innovation and a good service and it would enhance the ability and capacity of schools to support children with special educational needs, but the details have to be worked out over the next while.</p><p>  There is a much higher incidence of special needs now than five or ten years ago and we have identified three principal areas in which there has been an increased diagnosis.  The first is autism, which is unsurprising given it was only recognised in 1998 and, therefore, one would expect an increase.  There is capacity in the system for 1% of children with autism which is in or around the international prevalence rate for the disease.  The second is speech and language disorders.  This not unconnected with a decision a number of years ago by the HSE to recruit many speech and language therapists leading to an increase in diagnosis.  The third area is generally in the category of a physical disability and includes illnesses such as dyspraxia, which were not looked at a number of years ago.  We asked the professionals in our paper why they thought there was an increase and they said it was due to increased awareness among parents, teachers and professionals that children do not just sit back in the class not learning and an approach can be taken to reach them and help them to learn.</p><p>  The Deputy referred to the use of standardised tests and whether schools will be penalised even if they are performing well.  One of the examples given earlier was a school helping children in the 30th or 40th percentile and bringing them even higher.  It is important to emphasise that the proposal from the working group is that all children who are below average will be counted in developing a school's educational profile.  If a child is deemed statistically to be in STen 1, 2 or 3, he or she is below average.  That is positive because it increases the number of children who are counted because, currently, it is only the 10th percentile of children who are counted.  Every child who is below average will be counted in future and that will assist schools.  It must be remembered that the use of standardised tests is only one aspect.  There are children with complex needs and there are socio-economic indicators.</p><p>  On the issue of ETBs being a resource, we examined almost everything that we could and we were desperate not to add to the administrative burden for schools in the survey.  No matter what way we looked, people said "But".  Ultimately, the working group was persuaded by people wanting the voice of teachers and of principals to be heard.  Although there is a recognition that it is difficult, the Educational Research Centre, which will analyse and scrutinise the data provided, has other quality assurance mechanisms it can use.  For example, if the staff in a school in a socially advantaged area said 90% of its children was in the first or second STen, there is a natural balance to that.  There is also a natural balance in that schools will publish data under the literacy and numeracy strategy.  There are nice balances in the system.  I appreciate the concern people have but it is just one aspect of the overall role.</p> <p> There were people who anecdotally were going to moneylenders to get money.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, cannot stand over a system in which parents are so driven as to borrow money, be it from banks, friends or whomever.  At one point, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul was assisting parents.  Placing parents in such a position is unfair regardless of whether they are wealthy.  Before resources can be allocated, the system requires a diagnosis of disability that is not readily available to all parents.  This is fundamentally inequitable.  In addition, affluent parents can jump to the top of the queue.</p></speech>

A model for speech and language services is in place, as our school has it.  A speech and language therapist attends one day per week.

I would love to see it become the policy, as it is a local arrangement that works well.</p><p>  Regarding the Standard Ten educational norms, STen, scores and whether schools will be penalised, I know of no teacher or principal who will not do the best for the children in front of him and will only worry about next year's resources.  Teachers do not think that way.  One does the best for the child, and whatever the knock-on effect is, so be it.</p><p>  For a number of years, the intake at junior infant level caused problems.  This was not because the children were not diagnosed, because the free preschool year solved many problems.  Certain children could have benefited from a second year, but that was not possible.  The free year is outside this committee's remit, but members need to consider the totality of the situation.</p></speech>

Under the current model, services are delivered on the basis of a child's home address.  However, a part of that model is the recommendation that services be delivered through schools, where appropriate, for children of school-going age.  Speaking as a representative of parents, however, and setting my direct involvement with that framework aside, the resources needed to build this model are not available.  Progressing disability services is based on the same principles as this proposed model, namely, equity of access.  What it is not necessarily about is the delivery of services, as they are resource dependent.  In an ideal world, the model that Mr. Goff has outlined - a speech and language therapist attending a school specifically - makes sense where it is a special school or there is a special class with a cluster of children who require such support.  In the current climate, though, and without the ability to provide enough therapists to give that support, it will not happen.</p><p>  As this is the Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection, the matter is slightly outside members' remit, but people should not always view issues in silos.  Where children with special educational needs are concerned, education and health are intrinsically linked in terms of support and planning.  Government planning and policy must view them this way.  One cannot be considered without the other.  Although there may be good local models, without the resources to support that framework, the new models for disability, speech and language and occupational therapies - occupational therapy is the next most significant therapy provided into schools, along with psychology - will not provide for such local arrangements unless there are adequate speech and language therapist numbers, for example, on disability network teams.  In the view of our parent representative organisation and Inclusion Ireland, which recently issued a report on speech and language therapy services, it is imperative that we adequately resource child disability services, particularly for those aged between five and 18 years where they and their teaching staff are wholly dependent on the inter-relationship.  Without resources, one leg of the stool that is required to achieve successful outcomes will be missing.</p></speech>

I did not have to make its members work hard.  Rather, they wanted to.  The group comprised experts from various fields.  Reference has been made to STen scores, surveys and so on.  We went around the houses in that regard.  We kept reminding ourselves that we were not claiming that this was the best or perfect model, but we do claim that it is a better and more equitable model than what we have now.  It is not perfect and there are t's to cross and i's to dot in its implementation and operation.  Usefully, many of those t's and i's have been raised by this committee.</p><p>  Our model is a starting point.

Amendment No. 1 proposes that the legislation not be given effect until such time as a report is laid before the House outlining how the application for retroactive recapitalisation of the financial institutions will be processed by the direct recapitalisation instrument.  Much of what is in the legislation - or, at least, the spirit of the legislation - reflects a change for which Sinn F&eacute;in has been calling for a long time, namely, a system whereby the burning of bondholders at senior and junior level will take place before member state or EU moneys are injected into any bank.  We are not satisfied with the way the European Union has dealt with this issue in terms of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, and would have preferred to have seen the European Central Bank, ECB, act as a genuine backstop.</p> <p>We recognise that there has been progress but it is a case of too little too late for the citizens of this State who endured huge pressure from austerity, unemployment, disruption of families, emigration and so on.  There is genuine concern that the issue of retroactive recapitalisation is slipping away and I hope my fears and the fears of many are unwarranted.  Many political commentators and economists say retroactive recapitalisation is off the table for Ireland at this point but I hope that is not true.  We must listen to other European leaders when they say it is not a realistic opportunity.</p><p> The Minister addressed the issue of different options that must be considered when it comes to the money injected by the Irish State into financial institutions.  All options should be laid on the table and the most beneficial to Ireland chosen.  In June 2012 a commitment was made but is it enshrined in the law of this State in this legislation?  There is detail on how the recapitalisation instrument will work for future problems in financial institutions here and in other member states but I am dissatisfied by the fact there is no meat on the bones regarding how a retroactive recapitalisation instrument would work in Ireland on a case-by-case basis.  It is mentioned that the board of governors of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, will draw up the rules in due course and I am concerned by this.  Over the past two years there has been a failure to develop the retroactive recapitalisation instrument and there are questions as to how it can be applied to Ireland.  What are the rules?  Is it a blank canvas?  There will be a transfer of assets to the ESM if retroactive recapitalisation is to apply but how will this be costed?  Will we apply retroactively the direct instrument rules that will apply in the future?  Will we try to forecast the effect on AIB, Bank of Ireland and other financial institutions of a scenario similar to 2008 when they went bust?  Will we examine the rules on creditor bail-in, the involvement of the Irish State and so on?  We are in limbo on this issue and it is a crucial area.</p><p> On their return from the relevant European meeting in June 2012, members of the Government tripped over one another to explain to the media how the instrument was a game-changer and a seismic shift and how it would apply.  I am sure the Government now regrets this.  I listened back to the Minister's interview - I think it was with Se&aacute;n O'Rourke on RTE radio - and he spoke of his expectation that this process would be concluded by October 2012.  October 2012 has long passed and there is still no meat on the bones of this issue.  I understand that events have evolved but I am concerned that it is still unclear how the direct recapitalisation instrument will apply.</p><p> On amendment No. 1, it was originally intended that the legislation would not come into effect until it was clarified how the direct recapitalisation instrument will apply to Ireland and whether it could be used as a negotiating tool to ensure the commitment of 2012 is honoured.  It is now October 2014.  On 22 October 2013 the Taoiseach wrote to President Van Rompuy and mentioned that EU partners rely on the stability of the union and eurozone to anchor fragile recovery.  He said the recent stabilisation of sovereign borrowing rates in the union is the product of hard-earned trust and confidence - trust that the banking union will be completed on time and confidence that momentum will be maintained on our shared jobs and growth agenda.  The Taoiseach said these political commitments must be implemented and no time should be lost in building on the decisions reached in 2012 and early in 2013.  He found it necessary to write this letter and call on the leaders of Europe to implement the decision but we are still some way from implementation.  It may be implemented in future but the fact that it has not yet been fleshed out in detail is of concern.</p><p> This amendment calls on the Minister for Finance to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report outlining how an application for retroactive recapitalisation of the financial institutions would be processed by the direct recapitalisation instrument.  It is not time specific as this can only be done when information is available.  This is a crucially important amendment.  The Minister for Finance is entrusted to act in the interests of the Irish people and I think this question must be discussed with Opposition parties.  We must thrash out this issue as the costs to the Irish State have been immense.  There should be a thoughtful process on how this instrument will work and what its value will be if we apply for it.  What is its scope and are we better examining other options for the banks?  I believe we should apply all pressure possible to ensure the full direct recapitalisation is achieved for our pillar banks.</p><p> On amendment No. 2, there has been much discussion in this committee and in the D&aacute;il Chamber in recent times as to whether the Government will apply for retroactive recapitalisation in State banks.  This amendment asks the Minister to commit, in deeds and words, to making an application.  I assume the Minister will accept this amendment as he informed this committee in recent months that the Government will make an application for retroactive recapitalisation of the capital injected into State banks.  This amendment places an onus on the Minister to be true to his word and do what the Irish people expect.  He must look at the possibilities presented by an application for retroactive recapitalisation.</p></speech>

The first amendment provides for a report to be laid before the Houses outlining how an application for retroactive recapitalisation of a financial institution will be processed.  Article 14(2) of the draft guidelines on financial assistance for the direct recapitalisation of institutions sets out the operational basis for an application.  The detailed modalities for any retroactive recapitalisation shall be established in the relevant decision by the ESM board of governors.  Article 14(1) states that such decisions shall be made on a case-by-case basis so it will not be possible to provide such a report in advance of an application.  Further, the method of processing will be decided by the ESM board of governors and it would not be possible for me, as Minister for Finance, to ascertain that in advance.</p><p>  The second amendment seeks to oblige me to make an application for retroactive recapitalisation in November 2014 but it will not be possible to make an application while the instrument is not in place.  It is not in place yet but we expect it will be in November.  The decision on an application subsequent to that is a matter of timing.  I do not think it should be rushed and in that context it is not appropriate to tie my hands as this amendment seeks.  As I have stated on a number of occasions recently, we will consider all options in respect of the State's holdings in banks and the determining factor will be which option achieves maximum return for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

A member state will be able to make an application and there will be no waiting period similar to that which obtains in the context of the direct recapitalisation instrument.  The position is that the ESM board will receive an application and then decide the modalities it wishes to apply.  Is that how the system will operate?</p></speech>

This is a new power it is being given to directly recapitalise banks in certain circumstances.  The governors will decide the methodology and the conditions that will attach when applications are made.  However, it is not set down in primary legislation.  As the relevant legal power will only be attached to the ESM treaty in November, we are obliged to wait and see.  In general terms, the Deputy's interpretation is correct.</p></speech>

There will be no rules, as such, and when a member state makes an application, there will be no indication of how it will be viewed, benchmarked or adjudicated on.  It will be a case of making an application and then negotiating on it.  This means that different rules will be able to be applied to different states.</p></speech>

Beyond this again there will be access to the ESM.  In general, the assets will continue to be bailed-in until the hole in the bank's finances is filled.  If it is small discrepancy, the bail-in may stop with the junior bondholders.  If the discrepancy is bigger, the process will move on down the line.  There is a hierarchy in place and it will only be when the end has been reached that the fund will kick in.  At that point, the ESM board will set out the modalities and circumstances.</p></speech>

However, my question relates to direct recapitalisation.  Unless the Minister can provide some information to the contrary as a result of his discussions with his colleagues, there is no suggestion the modalities which would be applied to a retroactive recapitalisation application would be similar to those for the direct recapitalisation instrument.  I refer to the waterfall model to which the Minister has referred and which will be applicable to any member state once the system comes into operation.  We would have to use it as a basis for the type of retroactive recapitalisation support the State should have received in the case of AIB, for example.  When the waterfall model is followed, what will remain is the quantum of money that will be on the table.  There is no suggestion this will be the case because, as the Minister indicated, the board of governors will deal with the modalities when making its decision.  Will that actually be the case?  If it does prove to be the case, let us be honest and say the quantum of money which is likely to come back to the State from that type of procedure is quite small when compared to the actual amount spent in recapitalising the relevant institutions, particularly if we are obliged to go through the process of burning bondholders and creditors, involving the State up to a certain point and then going to the ESM.</p></speech>

Of course, I am speculating, but I am doing so on foot of the rule which states decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis and by mutual agreement.  In such circumstances, the case must be presented in the first instance and then the decision can be made.  In the case of the unknown bank in an unknown country seeking money from the ESM, the governors might decide that it was not even eligible to apply.  That could be one set of circumstances.  However, we are speculating about future events at a time when the primary modality is not yet in place.  That modality will not be in place until November, but we do know the detail of it because it was discussed at several ECOFIN Council meetings.  The Irish side succeeded in keeping the issue of retroactive recapitalisation within the regulations at these meetings.  That is as far as matters have progressed.  As a result of the fact that decisions will be made on a case-by-case bais, there will be no general set-up of rules in place <i>ab initio</i>.</p></speech>

I draw the Deputy's attention to Article 14 - retroactive application of direct recapitalisation - which states:<blockquote><br />1. This guideline is established without prejudice to existing ESM and EFSF programmes in which financial assistance has been provided to ESM Members who recapitalised their institutions, which could be replaced in part or in full with a retroactive application of direct recapitalisation following a decision by the ESM Board of Governors, on a case-by-case basis, by mutual agreement.<br />2. The detailed modalities for such replacement shall be established in the relevant ESM Board of Governors decision.</blockquote>This article is clearly designed for programme countries, particularly Ireland and possibly Portugal.  I do not believe it is applicable to Greece which has different arrangements.</p></speech>

We know what such recapitalisation means or we at least have a very good sense of it in terms of the structure and the point at which people step into the breach.  It is very clear that the waterfall system is laid out in the guidelines.  My original question was related to whether the retroactive application of direct recapitalisation was related to the retroactive application of that instrument.  If the latter is the case, it will be a case of states being obliged to negotiate their way through the waterfall system.  While it will be the responsibility of the ESM to decide whether a member state's application should be approved - there will be leeway in this regard - the question which arises is whether we will be bound by the waterfall or tiered structure under discussion.  I am interested in its retroactive application.  In Ireland's case it would be-----</p></speech>

If funding is channelled through the sovereign, it is indirect in nature.  That is the significance of the use of the word "direct".  If AIB is the example we are discussing, it must be stated it is a solvent bank which is trading profitably.</p> <p>For the first half year it made &euro;450 million or &euro;460 million.  Therefore, they do not need any more capital because they have sufficient core tier 1 capital and other forms of capital as well.  Obviously, there is no suggestion of some kind of waterfall test applying because it is not a bank that is in trouble.  The ESM would assess the suitability of direct recapitalisation for a bank like AIB and we will have to decide whether it was in our best interests to pursue it.  We know from the initial discussions that it would not be a grant-in-aid but an exchange of AIB shares for money if the application were to succeed.  We must decide, first, whether it is worthwhile doing it in monetary terms or can we realise more by a careful sale of AIB shares in tranches into the market over a period of time, and, second, we would have to assess whether we would be at a disadvantage if the major shareholder in one of our main banks was an institution in Luxembourg whose primary function was to raise money on the capital markets and act as a backstop for the euro.  It is a Federal Reserve type of operation rather than primary banking.  These are all considerations that must be taken into account.  </p><p> The situation has changed dramatically.  The Deputy used the word "game-changer".  The statement made by Mrs. Merkel was actually a game-changer because the very statement itself improved our credit position.  We can date our re-entry into markets from that statement.  It was quite a significant statement and it had quite a significant impact.  Now things have moved on.  The Deputy quoted what I said on Sean O'Rourke's radio programme.  I do not know whether I said that but I assume he is quoting me accurately.  By the autumn of that year my primary concern was negotiating directly and remotely a deal on the promissory note.  I said a lot of things which made sense in Frankfurt but they were not necessarily clear messages at home, but we succeeded in negotiating the promissory note deal as the year went by.  I do not know the context in which I said that comment but if I said it I said it.</p></speech>

All of us on this committee understand the crucial importance of our being able to be back into the markets at low interest rates, but the game-changer paraded by the Government at the end of June was that there would be a game-changer in people's lives in that we would get back the money we had put into these broken banks.  That was the game-changer.  It was spelt out by the former T&aacute;naiste,  Deputy Eamon Gilmore, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny.  It was more cautiously suggested by the Minister when he made the point that it would have to be an asset transfer and when pushed on whether it would be the full quantum of money, that is, the &euro;21 billion in the case of AIB or the current value, he was far more cautious and that is his position as Minister for Finance.  However, he even he spoke about the quantum of money that was coming back to this State that would enable us do a number of things in terms of managing our debt interest, reducing our overall debt or freeing up money for investment.<br/>That was then and now we are more focused on where we are going in terms of our banks and particularly this instrument.  The Minister spoke about AIB not needing additional capital and that may well be the case.  Hopefully it is when we see the results of the stress tests.  I would not imagine that the idea of this retroactive recapitalisation instrument would be to look at AIB's position today in terms of the waterfall test.  My impression is that what the board of governors of the ESM would do is turn back the clock to the point in time where the Irish State stepped in and capitalised the financial institution and then it would focus on that point in time and on the bank, which was in need of capitalisation, and say that if they were to apply the recapitalisation instrument that is available to us now, how would that apply to AIB, and if that is the case, is that the quantum of money that is on the table in and the <i>quid pro quo</i>there is the equivalent shares of the financial institution?  Is that type of scenario we are looking at?  What we have in terms of the guidelines is very sparse.  We have outlined them and probably gone through a few times in terms of the rules and the modalities that will be made up in an application that will be spelt out at the decision of the ESM.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked how was I occupied?  I was occupied in making sure that the commitment made in a press statement was translated into article 14 of the guidelines and I have succeeded in doing that.  He will recall that in the middle of that negotiation when the German, Dutch and Finish Finance Ministers got together in Helsinki they put out a statement, a loose translation of which would be "No way, Jos&eacute;".  We had to get that off the table and we took it step by step to the point where we have article 14 now.  That is a mandate for retrospective recapitalisation by the ESM.</p><p>  We have gone through what will happen when an application is made in terms of a decision on a case-by-case basis, modalities and all the rest of it, but the issues now for me are will it be worthwhile or can I do better in the markets.  The Deputy said the game-changer is when the Irish people get their money back.  It is my fullest intention that the Irish people will get their money back.  We have got back more than what they put into Bank of Ireland already.  When this commitment was given I am not sure what AIB was valued at  but looking back on it I would have thought it was not worth more than &euro;3 billion or so - that is a checkable figure - but now it has been independently valued at &euro;11.5 billion and that was before it showed the profits it showed on the half year which surprised the markets in a very positive way, and I would suggest we could mark it up again.  The total amount now is about &euro;200 million. </p><p>  I have talked to various colleagues informally.  The outgoing Finance Minister in Sweden told me that in respect of  their banking crisis that occurred in the early 1990s that they only sold the last tranche of the shares to the market last year and that they recovered two and half times what they had put in.  That is in nominal terms, he had not indexed it.  I took his advice and he said not be in hurry, to hold on to them, that the our economy is growing, that we have got two banks and that they will be very valuable when they are in a duopoly situation in an economy that will be growing steadily over the next period.  I want to be totally and completely frank with the Deputy.  That is one consideration.  </p><p>  The other consideration is the difficulty of the negotiation and I will tell the Deputy the reason for that.  All the eurozone countries have contributed to the ESM fund, some of it by cash and some of it by guarantee.  When the commitment was made our bond prices were way out but  yesterday our ten-year bonds were trading at 163 basis points, and that puts us inside Portugal, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, Slovenia and some of the eastern countries.  One has to ask what method of negotiation I can use to convince those countries that Ireland needs additional help to make it more sustainable in the market when we are trading so low and so far inside them.</p> <p>I am not saying I am resiling from it, but I can see that because our situation has improved so much, it will be more difficult to convince colleagues, and anyway, the market alternative might be better.  I am going to pursue this line and I will pursue the market alternative as well.  We have brought it to the point at which we have the legal authority under Article 14, and we will see what is spelled out in November and if there is an accompanying statement around the November event.  Then it is a question of timing as to when we apply.  There may come a point at which it is not worth pursuing it and we may do better by pursuing the alternatives.  The point about the game-changer is correct.  It is when the taxpayer gets his money back.  That is the game-changer.</p></speech>

If I can continue, I will finish it and the Minister can respond.  First, I refer to the way the ESM is set up and the quantum of money that is there - &euro;60 billion for direct recapitalisation.  The amount involved in Ireland in the case of AIB, Bank of Ireland and Permanent TSB is in the region of &euro;30 billion, and that is just the retroactive element.  The ESM direct recapitalisation is set up for all of the eurozone banks, so to suggest that Ireland could get a large share of that seems fanciful to me at this stage.  In hindsight, the real game-changer was not the agreement in June 2012; the game-changer came a month later, when Mario Draghi stepped in and said he would do whatever it took to save the euro.  That was the real game-changer for Ireland and the eurozone and, largely, that is what has brought stability to the financial markets.  It is a major contributory factor in the low cost of borrowing for Ireland and other countries.  That, to me, is the game-changer.</p><p>  There are some basic questions to which we do not have answers - for example, whether the ESM will be willing to pay over the odds for shares it might acquire in any of the Irish banks.  That is not written down anywhere, so clearly, if it is only paying what one would get elsewhere on the private markets, then one must ask what would be the benefit of selling to the ESM.  There is no evidence of that.  It is very clear now that the June 2012 agreement was over-egged by the Government.  I think the Ministers all believed, in good faith, that there would be a shift in policy, but that did not happen.  The really significant change came the following month, and that was what calmed the markets.</p><p>  The Minister succeeded in getting the Article 14 provision on retroactive recapitalisation into the guidelines.  I assume that was largely done at the behest of Ireland, and that has kept the door open.  The Minister is working away at it, but in view of what he said today and what he said before the summer recess, the T&aacute;naiste's comment that there are various ways to skin a cat and what the Minister said about possibly of selling a stake in AIB, before we have any clarity whatsoever on retroactive recapitalisation, if the Minister genuinely believed there was a real prospect of it, he would not be openly talking about selling a stake in AIB - he would get clarity first on whether it would be a real possibility for the country.  I do not ask the Minister to give up by any means.  He should apply and we should find out where we stand one way or the other in the coming months.  If there is a refusal then we should move on, and the Minister can focus on developing a proper banking strategy for the country and examine what he can get from the markets by way of selling a stake.  Personally, I would not support selling a stake in AIB for some time, as it is early days in its recovery.  That is my observation.</p><p>  I am not saying the Minister has given up.  I do not ask him to give up.  He must keep working on the issue.  However, there will come a time - relatively soon - when he will have to put it up to our European colleagues by making a formal application.  Let us find out where we stand.  I can see no prospect that they will give Ireland &euro;20 billion or &euro;25 billion of the &euro;60 billion that is available for a retroactive issue when the banks are currently capitalised.  The money for that purpose was paid years ago.  As the Minister said, the economy is recovering and the cost of borrowing is low.  To me, the real game-changer was what Mario Draghi said in July 2012.  That is my opinion.  The Minister must bring the situation to a head in the coming months by applying, and at least then we will know where we stand.</p></speech>

The question Deputy McGrath asked was whether it would be valued at the present value.  Obviously, we would argue that the money provided would be based on future value, with a reasonable estimate of capital gains over a period until the point of sale.  Another way to do it might be to say that whatever capital gains one realises, we would have to get 50%, 60% or 70% of it.  There are various models once one gets down to the detail.  I thank the three Deputies for their observations.</p></speech>

I have a few more questions for the Minister, but I just wanted to get clarity in order to fully understand the situation.  The ESM would buy shares and sell them on, and we would get the money back.  What the Minister seems to be saying, without making allegations, is that he will decide as the situation progresses whether it is better value for us, in terms of getting a better return on what we put into the banks, to sell the shares to private investors, or if we could get a better deal by applying to the ESM and seeing whether that is the best way to maximise our return.</p></speech>

I thought I heard the Minister say something on that in response to Deputy Doherty.</p> <p>While the modalities, to use the Minister's term, or the terms and conditions that might apply to any application for direct recapitalisation will be discussed case by case by the board of governors, did he suggest, and that is the way I read it, that in so far as we can have any clue about the modalities that might apply, there may be clues in the rest of this Bill in terms of the various requirements, including the cascade, the threat to eurozone stability, that we have exhausted our own resources and capacity to do it, that we have gone to the senior bondholders and so forth, and that those sort of conditions are likely to be what will be considered by the European Stability Mechanism in deciding on an application for retroactive recapitalisation.  Is that what the Minister said?</p></speech>

They might decide to send an application to a sub-committee and let it come back and advise them.  There are different ways of doing things, and we will not know the actual decision-making process until the first case goes before them.</p><p>  I have a note which might be of benefit.  On 10 June 2014 the euro area member states reached a preliminary agreement on the operational framework for the ESM's direct recapitalisation instrument.  Their draft guideline on financial assistance for the direct recapitalisation of institutions clearly establishes the scope of eligibility criteria for an operational process of direct recapitalisation.  The provision for retrospective recapitalisation provides for a decision on a case-by-case basis.  From our point of view that provides a broad degree of flexibility of interpretation.  Demanding more detail would most likely have resulted in a more restrictive retrospective instrument, which would not have been in our interests.</p><p>  On the amount borrowed from the European Union, programme funding was provided for the purpose of stability support.  It was not earmarked for particular purposes and it is not valid to say otherwise.  The amount of bank recapitalisation under the programme was &euro;17 billion, and that was provided within the overall programme envelope of &euro;85 billion, including our own resources of &euro;17.5 billion.</p><p>  There is another note which might be of interest.  It is important to recognise that the ESM's direct recapital powers is part of a broader EU response to breaking the link between banks and sovereigns.  It must be viewed in conjunction with the banking union measures, particularly the bank recovery and resolution directive, the single supervisory mechanism, the single resolution mechanism, and the single resolution fund.  The figure of &euro;60 billion was the figure agreed upon in the context of an ESM fund whose principal function is to lend to sovereigns, not banks.  As the Deputy knows, the ESM has a maximum lending capacity of &euro;500 billion.  Given the way the rating agencies treat these matters, if the &euro;60 billion for DRI was fully used up, the remaining lending capacity would be less than &euro;440 billion and would in fact be closer to &euro;330 billion.  It is a relatively small fund if we think of a fund for supporting a currency.</p></speech>

A series of countries are involved, with the AAA rated countries saying to keep the figure down.  The countries that believed they might need to avail of it were trying to drive it up.  It was settled on &euro;60 billion, but with all the other initiatives that were taken, the big game-changer, to use that word, is that the European Central Bank under Mr. Trichet would not allow the bail-in of assets under any circumstances once shareholders and small bondholders were passed.  The big game-changer is that there are now new resolution regulations on the basis of the waterfall Deputy Doherty described.  The ESM fund is so far down the waterfall it is difficult to envisage circumstances in which money would be used for direct recapitalisation.  If one's bank was banjaxed to the point where the shareholders, the junior bondholders, the senior bondholders, corporate depositors and personal depositors of &euro;100,000 are totally burned-----</p></speech>

We would be at the point where sensible people would say that we must liquidate this thing the same way as I liquidated IBRC-Anglo.  The only way to get out of this is liquidation.  There is no point in bailing in to rescue something because it is dead.</p><p>  When we go down the process, in my view the likelihood of direct recapitalisation being drawn down is well down the hierarchy.  We will have a better idea when we see how the European banking system comes out of the stress tests, and we should have that information at the end of October when we will have a picture of the strengths of European banks.  Since the stress tests were announced, banks throughout Europe have been raising core tier 1 capital on the private market and repairing their balance sheets, so it is likely that the results will be quite positive.</p></speech>

There was a big fight over the &euro;100,000 limit and so on.  The bail-in is welcome but it is 8% of liabilities, with the state's 5%.  Then we have all the conditions about the extent to which it may threaten the stability of the wider eurozone and the debt sustainability of an individual state.  After that bail-in, which is welcome but limited, the next port of call is back to Joe Bloggs on the street and, as I read it, and I would welcome the Minister telling me I am wrong, all the conditions are to stop it getting to the ESM and to put the citizens and the state on the hook big time as the next step in the cascade, with a fairly high threshold to move on to the next stage in the cascade.</p></speech>

The sovereign resolution funds in year 1 are sovereign resolution funds but then there is an agreement to mutualise them over a period of time when one is beginning to get access to one's neighbour's resolution fund.</p> <p>As they mutualise the funds, the taxpayer goes out of the equation.  Until they are fully mutualised, there is a potential taxpayer liability but when they are fully mutualised - after the period of time - then the taxpayers' liability will be very remote.  It will only be when the mutualised resolution funds in future are insufficient for the bailing in of a bank that one will move on to the European Stability Mechanism, ESM.  It has become very much the final backstop and most sensible people who consider the waterfall and the hierarchy would say there will be a decision point before one gets to the ESM that one would be better off were one to liquidate the institution.  While one really will not know until one sees the first case study, I could not now describe for the Deputy the circumstances in which some bank somewhere in the eurozone will end up being directly recapitalised by the ESM even though all the powers are there.  However, it is important to have those powers because even if they are never used, their existence steadies the market.</p></speech>

It refers to the purpose being "to mobilise funding and provide stability support under strict conditionality, appropriate to the financial assistance instrument chosen, to the benefit of ESM Members which are experiencing, or are threatened by, severe financing problems, if indispensable to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and of its Member States".  My question is in the context of retrospective or retroactive recapitalisation, which is the key possibility for Ireland under this legislation.  Ireland probably does not meet those criteria at present but at the time when the banks were recapitalised when the crash happened, it certainly would.  In a follow-on question, could one have a combination of launching or selling the banks with private investors, as well as ESM investment?  Obviously, the objective of the Government is to get back for the taxpayers the money that has been invested.  As for IBRC, by the time it was liquidated, &euro;32 billion of taxpayers' money had been fried and the damage was done.  Is there a question of the ESM possibly taking a minority shareholding in a bank?  In such circumstances, one could have a board that would not be dominated by the ESM.  Is the mechanism sufficiently fluid and flexible whereby one could have a suite of options including going to the market, the Irish public buying shares and using the ESM in such a way that the taxpayers could get all their money back as quickly as possible, while also being cognisant of the goal of getting the best return for the taxpayers?  I ask within the context of Article 3 and the fact that Ireland met those criteria at that moment in time when the banks were recapitalised.</p></speech>

The first point raised by the Deputy with which I would like to deal is that &euro;31 billion of taxpayers' money was burned or fried in Anglo Irish Bank.  That is not true as Anglo Irish Bank was refinanced through the promissory note, which basically is an IOU.  Consequently, money was not put in.  What had happened was that the IOU incurred ongoing liabilities for the taxpayer and the Deputy will recall that just after the change of Government, the liability was &euro;3.1 billion every March, stretching out into the middle distance.  That was the liability.</p></speech>

The Government paid the money in the first year because it fell due when we went into government in February 2011.  The first demand came in and we paid it, as we did not know what would be the market reaction if we did not.  The Government did not know what pressure would be put on - the usual pressure from Frankfurt - so it paid it in the first year.  The Government refused to pay it in the second year and refinanced it through Bank of Ireland.  Thereafter, the Government did the promissory note deal and at that time, &euro;25 billion still was underpinned by the promissory note.  As we had refinanced just over &euro;3 billion with Bank of Ireland, the overall amount was &euro;28 billion.  All of that was refinanced by writing Government paper and lodging it in the Central Bank.  The promissory note was a novel instrument but it did not have a market value.  However, the Irish paper the Government created and which is in the Central Bank is now what is underpinning the loan and the Government will be obliged to service it for a long time.  Nevertheless, the repayment schedule is way out.</p></speech>

That is mythology.  The replacement was Government paper, which is held by the Central Bank.  It is holding &euro;28 billion and has the piece from Bank of Ireland that can go on the market straight away.  It would be obliged to do some restructuring with the other stuff, were it to sell it.  However, that also can be done and the NTMA would do that.  However, the point is that netting out, that money now is available at approximately 1%.  The charge on it at present is slightly less than 1%.  Consequently, it is a myth to state that the way things have worked out at the end is that Anglo Irish Bank cost the Irish taxpayer &euro;30 billion, as it did not.</p></speech>

The point I am making is very simple, namely, it was necessary to borrow taxpayers' money.  The promissory note deal arose and there are major savings to the Irish taxpayer but over a long period of time, effectively the Central Bank bonds will be released onto the market and will be held by third parties.  I am not taking from this but the point I am trying to make is that had the option existed much earlier with Anglo Irish Bank, it might have been more beneficial to the Irish taxpayer overall.  I do not disagree with the Minister but simply am making the overall point that the time at which one liquidates something obviously is critical.  The Minister made the point earlier that when one is looking at the cascade, there will be a point whereby the earlier one can liquidate, the better overall.  I make the same point in respect of Anglo Irish Bank.  Either way, the deal that was negotiated is a major saving to the Irish taxpayer and is a great deal but the point is that over time, in respect of the capital sum that had to be borrowed, it basically is taxpayers' money.  Obviously, it will be refinanced and so on and has far less immediate impact on the taxpayer on an annual basis.  Over time, however, one would prefer if Ireland was not obliged to borrow the money to put into Anglo Irish Bank.</p></speech>

Money was not borrowed to put into Anglo Irish Bank.  The Anglo debt was underpinned by a promissory note, which basically was an IOU.</p></speech>

The debt was there and even though it was not reckoned within the table of national debt, the markets always added &euro;31 billion onto the Irish debt because they knew this liability was hanging out there.  It is only a presentational thing to state it was converted into debt.  However, what replaced the promissory note was Irish Government paper and as Deputy O'Donnell rightly observed, the Irish Government paper must be sold back into the market on an agreed schedule or profile.  The disadvantage in this regard is that at present, the Exchequer pays a coupon to the Central Bank on the Irish paper it is holding and that coupon then translates into excess profits from the bank, which it then returns to the Exchequer.  Consequently, it nets out at less then 1%.  As we sell into the markets, the change will be that the coupon must go to the private investor but the bit that has not entered the debate thus far is that because our interest rates have come down so much and because of the way we are positioned now, the nominal value of the &euro;28 billion has increased by approximately 20% and there is a capital gain of approximately &euro;6 billion now.</p> <p>The Governor and his staff must keep looking at this and asking if we would do better if we sold it more quickly, thereby realising the capital gain.  There are statistical issues on capital gains and one could not normally put a windfall like that from the bank into one's Exchequer figures.  One would probably have to take it off the top of the debt.  On the other hand, the bank commission decided - and there is no law about it - that its protocol is to return 80% of excess profits to the Exchequer while holding a 20% buffer.  As that is not in law, the commission could decide next week that it will return 85%.  However, I have no involvement in that.</p></speech>

I find in Europe that if one deals technically, one will lose.  If one deals strategically, one gets places.  One always needs to have a number of options.  The idea of settling and saying we will apply now and on their refusal, it is off the table is not the way Europe works.  If one has a demand which a lot of people think is credible, one should let it sit there.  If one thinks they are going to say "No", one should not push them, but the following year, when something else happens, one can say one has a legitimate concern in place which they have not settled with one.  One must keep a number of strategies and plans going in parallel.

The purpose of the meeting is to meet representatives of Concern to discuss the ongoing crisis in Syria.  Obviously, the position is changing day by day and it will be useful to have a discussion with Concern which I understand has been working inside Syria since May 2013.  I note that it is almost a year to the day since members started to discuss the situation in Syria with representatives of Concern.  At the time, the position in the country had deteriorated, given the growth of extremism and the threat posed by ISIS and other groups.  Although the United Nations has passed resolutions, recent reports on their implementation set out clearly that the fundamental obstacles to the provision of humanitarian assistance remain in place across Syria and that the parties to the conflict remain in breach of international law.  As members will have seen on their televisions screens nightly, the situation in Kobani is particularly worrying.  Kobani is a city situated just 3 km inside the Syrian-Turkish border and already we have seen ISIS taking over public buildings there.  Obviously, the major worry in this regard is that there could be another massacre, accompanied by offences such as rape and so on within the region.  I note that 200,000 Syrian Kurds have moved across the border with Turkey and that the situation at the border is extremely difficult.</p> <p>It is particularly difficult for the Turkish authorities, given the history of the region.  Humanitarian relief is a critical component of the international response, with the mass displacement of citizens.  We saw this for ourselves last year when we visited Jordan and the refugee camps on the Syrian border.  The treatment of citizens by ISIS and other terrorist groups in the region is deplorable.  <br/>Ireland has made a very significant contribution to the ongoing work to alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people, having already committed more than &euro;29 million in humanitarian assistance in response to the crisis.  The committee is looking forward to hearing from Concern today about its efforts to alleviate the suffering of the people of Syria.  We met some Syrian refugees when we were in Jordan and spoke to them through translators.  The stories we heard were harrowing and we have heard many more such stories since through the media, including about how ISIS is treating people.  <br/>Before we begin, I ask members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off their mobile phones for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference with the recording equipment, even when left in silent mode.  This is particularly important because the meeting is being broadcast live on the Oireachtas television channel.  <br/>I remind Members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br/>I welcome the representatives of Concern, Ms Anne O'Mahony, director of international programmes; Ms Brid Kennedy, regional director for Asia and the Middle East, and Mr. Peter Doyle.  We will first hear the opening presentation and then have a question and answer session.</p></speech>

I will begin by quoting Navi Pillay who said, "The killers, destroyers and torturers in Syria have been empowered and emboldened by international paralysis."  As the Chairman said, we were here one year ago and the situation has deteriorated considerably since.  There are now over 3 million refugees from Syria who have fled to neighbouring countries, while almost 7 million people have been displaced within Syria.  Of the 3 million who have become refugees, four out of every five are women and children.  These numbers hide the reality of the enormous human tragedy which has unfolded in the past four years.  We hear of untold violence and continuous suffering, so much so that it almost numbs our sensibilities and we do not really hear it anymore.</p><p>  We are appearing before the committee not just to brief members on our programmes but also to request that Ireland use its significant influence to bring urgent diplomatic and political pressure to bear in dealing with the situation in Syria.  We are also meeting the committee days before budget 2015 is announced.  I thank the committee for its support for and scrutiny of the Irish Aid budget which has enabled Concern to do the kind of work I will describe.  We work in an increasingly fraught environment, with simultaneous emergencies and restrictions on the work of humanitarian agencies.  Political leadership which supports overseas aid and respects the international commitments we have made, particularly our commitment to spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid, is crucial.  Budget 2015 will be the first budget in many years when we can demonstrate our genuine intention to get back on track towards the 0.7% target.  I urge the committee to continue in its efforts to protect and promote Ireland's development and humanitarian work.</p><p>  Concern is working in Syria, Lebanon and Turkey in response to the Syrian crisis, providing shelter, non-food items, water, sanitation and hygiene support, as well as education services and protection for those affected by the conflict.  The situation has become increasingly complex with the proliferation of armed groups, the rise of ISIS and military intervention by the western coalition in Syria and Iraq, with a subsequent threat to the humanitarian space.  It is not possible to overstate the level of threat in the region and how it affects our decisions on a daily basis.  The humanitarian needs are, however, increasing owing to the escalating military operations, but the level of funding is actually falling.  The 2014 appeal for Syria is only 46% funded.  Winter is approaching and vulnerable individuals will struggle in the freezing conditions.  Shelter is inadequate and families who once lived in three bedroom, semi-detached houses in suburban Damascus will soon be struggling to survive under plastic sheeting in sub-zero temperatures.  The Chairman mentioned that the committee had met some families on its visit to Jordan.  I met families last year in Lebanon who had to get up every morning to shake the snow off the plastic roofs of their accommodation.  I had many layers of clothing on me, yet I was shivering.  These people are living under plastic, having come from backgrounds similar to our own.  They once had good housing and living conditions, but they are now living in dire poverty.  They are facing into another winter in the same situation and on it goes.</p><p>  The neighbouring countries of Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan have been really generous in accepting Syrian refugees.  However, they are beginning to buckle under the immense pressure.  Lebanon, for example, is one eighth of the size of Ireland.  It is about the same size as counties Clare and Cork combined, but it is hosting over 1 million refugees.  Ireland has a population of over 4.5 million; the population of Lebanon is similar.  How would we respond if 1 million refugees arrived on our doorstep and started to use our facilities, including our health care, education and social welfare systems?  That would place an enormous burden on us, but we are much better off than a country like Lebanon.  </p><p>  As a result of the disproportionate burden being placed on neighbouring countries due to the Syrian conflict, tensions are increasing between Syrian refugees and host communities.  Recently these tensions have escalated and reports of attacks on Syrian refugees, forced evictions, raids and the destruction of refugee property are increasing.  Governments are becoming more restrictive of refugee movements, with new policies aimed at defining more strictly who qualifies as a refugee and tightening the entry criteria for Syrians.  Reports from our country offices in Lebanon detail that the Lebanese border has been closed and while some better-off Syrians are being allowed access to transit points, poorer people are being stopped and refused access without humanitarian selection criteria being in place.  As with all such situations, it is the poor who suffer the most.  They are the ones with no voice and they are being blocked at every turn.  </p><p>  Ireland resettled 90 Syrian refugees in 2014, as well as initiating the Syrian humanitarian admissions programme.  While both initiatives are welcome, these efforts pale in comparison to the scale and gravity of the displacement problem.  The European Union has largely failed to take responsibility in shouldering its portion of the burden of the refugee crisis.  The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, has repeatedly urged EU member states to open their doors to Syrian refugees and noted in January this year that Turkey had received ten times the number of Syrian refugees received by all EU member states combined.  That is a tribute to it and its openness and a poor reflection on us.</p><p>  Women and girls, as in all of these situations, have been incapacitated disproportionately by the crisis in Syria.  Approximately 27% of the female refugee population are under 18 years.  Sexual violence and the harassment of Syrian women have become endemic, including the use by ISIS of sex slaves.</p> <p>Early and forced marriage, harmful traditional practices, lack of access to educational opportunities, family separation and an inability to access basic social services are pervasive in the lives of Syrian women in the region.</p><p> The ability of the United Nations and aid agencies to protect the most vulnerable, namely, women, children, people with disabilities and the elderly, has been severely compromised.  Post-traumatic stress disorder and a lack of psychosocial support are likely to affect an entire generation of Syrian children who will be responsible for rebuilding their country.  The traumas they face will affect their abilities.</p><p> The UN independent international commission of inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic unequivocally stated influential states had turned away from the difficult task of finding a political solution.  Some states continue to deliver shipments of arms, artillery and aircraft, or contribute logistical and strategic assistance to the Government of Syria.  Other states, organisations and individuals support armed groups with weapons and funding.  The weapons they transfer to the warring parties in Syria are used for war crimes, crimes against humanity and violations of human rights.  Recent events in Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq where violence engaged in by ISIS and tensions between refugees and host communities have spiralled emphasises the urgency of finding a political settlement to the war.  If the current situation continues, we face a regional collapse, with global consequences and an associated surge in conflict, displacement, poverty and devastation.  It is vital that all avenues to reinstate the Geneva talks be explored.  While Ireland was not a participant in the last round of talks, our political and diplomatic relations can and should be used to leverage support for the talks as a framework for finding a political solution.</p><p> A long-term strategy forms an essential part of any process which seeks to address the current situation.  As the UN Security Council recognised in Resolutions 2139 and 2165, the protection of civilians is pivotal, while victims of violations deserve effective redress.  We very much welcomed the statement by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, at the 69th session of the UN General Assembly in September on the situation in Syria.  The Minister noted Ireland&rsquo;s support for a political solution based on the principles of the 2012 Geneva communiqu&eacute;; called for the referral of the situation to the International Criminal Court; and urged all parties to comply with the Security Council resolutions which supported increased humanitarian access and relief operations in Syria.  However, statements at the UN General Assembly are not enough.  As we approach United Nations International Human Rights Day on 10 December, we have an opportunity to demonstrate Ireland&rsquo;s strengthened leadership on the Syrian crisis.  We urge that consideration be given to outlining the concrete diplomatic and political actions which Ireland will take to support a viable political solution to end the conflict.  We set out a series of recommendations that would frame a renewed strategy and would welcome the thoughts of committee members on specific actions which could be taken.</p><p> We recommend promoting the mandate of the UN special envoy to Syria to reinstate the Geneva talks and support all efforts to bring influential parties to the table, including Iran and Israel which have been excluded so far.  Efforts to find a durable political and diplomatic end to the conflict must be intensified as a matter of urgency and Ireland must use its voice to bolster this process.  We also recommend supporting and sustaining funding for humanitarian operations through the Irish overseas development aid budget without jeopardising our progress on the millennium development goals; promoting increased access for people affected by the conflict in all areas; and facilitating the expansion of humanitarian relief operations by calling for adherence to the Security Council's resolutions.</p><p> The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade should use his position at the EU Foreign Affairs Council to call for Council conclusions on the protection of civilians in Syria.  Such conclusions should be accompanied by a framework for responding to the upsurge in humanitarian needs resulting from military intervention and supported by a number of EU member states.</p><p> We call for support for countries in the region which disproportionately shoulder the burden of the Syrian crisis, particularly Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, through increased humanitarian and political support.</p><p> Our membership of the UN Human Rights Council should be used to call for a special session on the Syrian conflict.  Ireland must continue to condemn the war crimes perpetrated by all parties to the conflict, including murder, the targeting of civilians, torture, rape and sexual violence, the recruitment and use of children in hostilities and the use of illegal chemical weapons.</p><p> It is fairly common knowledge at this stage that Ireland hopes to win a seat on the UN Security Council by 2020.  This is all part of the leadership Ireland can show in the international arena in dealing with this issue.</p></speech>

These collective centres can be in buildings which were originally intended to be chicken farms but which have been converted.  They provide people with shelter, a sense of physical protection and a home.  Some of the informal settlements are just basic good quality tents.  We also provide water and sanitation for the population.  In addition, we provide education services.  As Ms O'Mahony mentioned in her presentation, the children are the future.  Syria had a 99% education achievement rate before the war.  Now millions of children are at risk of not receiving an education.  If we are to offer hope in the future, we must address the issue of education, as we do through supporting children informally and in trying to get them into the Lebanese school system.</p><p>  We are also engaged in protection work with the support of Irish Aid.  We support men and women working together in the refugee population and the host community.  As mentioned in the presentation, there is much tension between host communitys and the refugee population.  We engage with men and women to examine the traditional issues and the new issues they face to help to break down some of the barriers and stigma encountered which we hope in itself will contribute to mitigating more problems and contributing to peace in communities.</p><p>  We have been registered in Turkey since August 2013 and work very closely with the Turkish authorities which are very co-operative in supporting the Syrian population.  Recently we have focused on water distribution and non-food item distribution to recent influxes of the Syrian population.  We are examining conducting a large-scale education programme, provided funding comes through.</p><p>  Since last year we have been supporting the provision of clean water in Syria.  People like us were used to a good standard of housing and piped water systems.  However, the piped water system has been cut off.  When we made our assessment, the number one priority was to have piped water systems into houses.  This ensures a clean water supply and reduces the risk of attack when people go to fetch water from other sources.  This has been working very effectively.  </p><p>  We also promote good hygiene.  Syria had almost been polio free, but, unfortunately, there was an outbreak last year.  The local authorities had the sandfly population under control.  Sandflies spread leishmaniasis which causes terrible skin problems.  The incidence of this decease increased hugely last year.  However, a defogging system controls the sandfly population and minimises the risk of contracting leishmaniasis.</p></speech>

The scene they have outlined is very frightening and has worsened considerably since they last attended a meeting of the committee almost one year ago.  Until June this year, refugees from Syria who were fleeing from ISIS were being accommodated in Iraq, but that country is now in serious difficulty.  The delegates referred to the increasing tensions between Syrian refugees and host communities in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan.  It is important to acknowledge the pressures on the host countries and recognise what they have done and continue to do to assist persons fleeing Syria.</p><p>  The activities of ISIS which are receiving a great deal of media coverage are a source of serious concern to the international community.  My understanding is that the organisation now controls large parts of both Syria and Iraq, with its offensive being ramped up in recent days.  The town of Kobani, in particular, has been very much in the media spotlight.  Am I correct in saying that if ISIS succeeds in capturing Kobani, it will have established a direct link between its position in the Syrian province of Aleppo and its stronghold at Raqqa?  It is very worrying to contemplate it having full control of a long stretch of the Turkish-Syrian border.</p><p>  The problems in the region are multiplying and, as the delegates observed, the international community has not responded with the urgency needed.  The pledging conference took place almost one year ago amid huge international attention, with a series of prominent political leaders pledging very substantial donations and giving other commitments.  Will the delegates indicate to what degree these commitments have been honoured and what they amount to in monetary terms?</p><p>  The delegates have noted that 3 million refugees have left Syria and that 7 million people are internally displaced.  If, as I understand it, the population of Syria was just less than 23 million one year ago, almost 50% of its people have either had to flee their homeland or are displaced internally.  These statistics paint a very grave picture, to which, unfortunately, the international community has not responded.</p><p>  I am sure colleagues will be in agreement with me that the committee would not have any difficulty in supporting the proposals the delegates have brought forward and presenting them to the Minister.  Are they confident these proposals will be supported by other non-governmental organisations which are doing similar and very valuable work in these countries?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.287" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1136" speakername="David Norris" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014100800005#D00300"><p>I welcome the delegation from Concern.  I am a long-time admirer and supporter of the work it does.  I note the indication on page 2 of the presentation that the 2014 appeal was only 46% funded.  Can the countries which make up the other 54% be named and shamed?  Can it be made public that their leaders have gone in front of the television cameras, as they do in every crisis, promising to give X million dollars but have failed to deliver?  Naming and shaming seems to be a good idea.</p><p>  The West has adopted a very pragmatic approach to Syria and put up with the barbarous activities of the Assad regime for a very long time.  I recall when human rights lawyers were being arrested and tortured and the West did absolutely nothing about it.  ISIS's behaviour is certainly reprehensible, horrible and appalling and must be condemned.  Recording and broadcasting the beheading of people are particularly barbarous because of the sensitivities and feelings of the families and the viewers who see this type of material.  On the other hand, one cannot but remember the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of civilians who were murdered in Iraq by the West  by way of its saturation bombing campaigns, the use of drone aircraft and other abuses.  What has happened to the standards of the West?  Where a group of 25 people is blasted by a drone, that group might perhaps include one person who may be associated with some offshoot of al-Qaeda, but it also will include 24 civilians, including, in many cases, children.  We have all heard the reports of wedding parties being wiped out and so on.  Where is the justice for the people concerned?  Admittedly, one does not see their dismemberment on television, but surely to God they are human beings also.  One cannot kick a wasp's nest and then express surprise if one is stung.  That is what the West has repeatedly done, however, and it has treated the populations of Muslim countries with contempt.</p><p>  I disagree slightly with Ms O'Mahony's view that we should reproach ourselves for having taken in so few refugees in comparison with Turkey.  As a Muslim country and a direct neighbour of Syria, one would expect Turkey to take a larger number.  I agree that we should be accepting more refugees, but we should not beat ourselves over the head about it.</p><p>  Peshmerga troops seem to be the most effective indigenous fighters and the most appropriate people to take on ISIS.  However, they are being hampered by the Turkish authorities because they are seen as an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, PKK, which is denominated, at the insistence of the Americans, as a terrorist group by the European Union.  We like to blather about 2016 and all the rest of it in this country, yet we go along with the denomination of the PKK and Peshmerga as terrorist organisations when, fundamentally, they are freedom fighters.  We then change our position and expect them to fight for us, without providing them with arms.  Surely, if we want them to fight, we should give them the materials with which to do so.  This issue is particularly acute in the town of Kobani where the Turkish authorities are preventing Peshmerga troops from returning.</p><p>  I will end on a positive note with a question about the control of sand flies.  Is Concern involved in replacing the Syrian Government with its programme for attacking sand flies?  This would be immensely practical.</p><p>  I am sure my colleagues will join me in endorsing the recommendations the delegates have presented.  Perhaps we might formally pass them today.  I will continue to fight for the restoration of the 0.7% allocation for overseas development aid.  As I have pointed out repeatedly, because it is a percentage allocation, the actual sum will reduce as our gross national product reduces.  We are simply paying a proportion of available resources.  We can afford to do so and should do it.</p></speech>

It is in the context of this question that we are strongly calling for political action to end the war.  It is a conflict that started off with the minutiae of schoolchildren's graffiti on a wall  before escalating to potentially a global conflict.  Unless we do something urgently to try to control and end the war, we are not attending to our own or anybody else's standards.</p> <p>It will also lead to more human suffering in Syria, its neighbouring countries and potentially in many other countries.  Our strong request is to try to get support at every level - globally, at European level and at national level - to try to end the political crisis.</p></speech>

We rarely look at what happens when the various protagonists are armed and what ultimately happens with the arms.  Often we find, certainly in poorer situations, people get the arms with the best of intentions, but they need to feed their families so they sell the arms to another person.  The arms we might intend to be supplied in one direction can end up in the hands of the enemy.  A supply of arms is not a solution to the conflict.  Getting people around the table, getting the talks back on track and getting people to seek longer-term solutions is a much better approach than sending in more guns that will only be used for more killing, death and destruction.</p></speech>

We are responding to that crisis.  We have a team in southern Turkey and it is assisting refugees who are crossing over from Kobani with sanitation and some household items, hygiene kits and so forth.</p><p>  Deputy Smith mentioned the host communities.  It is a huge strain, particularly on the Lebanon.  When one considers the size of Lebanon compared to Ireland and the number of people living there, the refugee population has increased the population by 20% to 25%, which has put a huge strain on the resources and infrastructure of that country.  It is one of the reasons that Concern, along with other humanitarian actors, is focusing its strategy on assisting not just refugees, but also the Lebanese host population.  For example, we are developing infrastructure for water, sanitation and managing waste.  All of these things are benefiting both the Lebanese population and the refugee population.  We also have some activities to reduce tensions and mitigate conflict between both populations.</p><p>  I can confirm that effectively we are talking about half of the population of Syria being displaced, either internally or externally.  Most of them are displaced internally and there are approximately 3 million displaced to other countries.</p><p>  There was also a question about whether our positions are shared by other organisations and NGOs.  In Lebanon in particular, but also in Turkey, Concern participates in various co-ordination mechanisms, for example, the Lebanon Humanitarian INGO Forum which comprises a number of international NGOs, and we have developed certain positions, some of which we have mentioned here today.  In many cases these are shared positions with many different organisations.</p></speech>

I agree about the destabilising effect this is likely to have.  Apart from being a huge humanitarian crisis and a disaster for the people of Iraq and Syria, it is destabilising for the West as well.  Even the International Monetary Fund, IMF, figures this morning specifically refer to the effect it is likely to have on growth throughout the world, which of course will have an effect on those who depend on aid and would hope to get aid from us.</p><p>  I watched an episode of "Reeling in the Years" earlier this week and it showed footage from the first Iraq war.  It was quite horrendous but now, nearly 25 years later, I am sure they would almost wish to have Saddam Hussein back as things have been so terrible for them.  Now we see what is happening in Syria.  I agree about a political solution, and the Minister has said the same, but the problem is with whom one can have a solution.  It is Hobson's choice on the ground.</p><p>  The bombing is not working.  Military people who know about these matters say that one can stop them with bombs but one cannot secure the area unless one puts people in on the ground.  That was done in Iraq but 25 years later it has not worked.  On one side is Bashar al-Assad, who we thought was a monster.  We had great hopes for the Arab Spring rising but now we are bombing the very people we thought were going to deliver gender equality and the like.  Knowing what to do is a huge political difficulty for the West, even with regard to small matters.  Obviously the humanitarian crisis is huge and needs money.  However, when there is limited money does one divert money from the millennium development goals, MDG, programmes or what does one do?  The world is facing a huge crisis due to the demands coming from everywhere, not just the Middle East, and also the worries about the conflict between the Ukraine and Russia.</p><p>  On a point of detail, I am delighted that the witnesses recognised the vulnerability of the women and girls.  When they say the crisis in Syria is causing this, is the problem in Syria or is it in the refugee camps in Turkey as well?</p></speech>

What is happening to them is appalling.  These were people living in three-bedroom semi-detached houses only a few months ago and they now find themselves being married off in appalling circumstances and subjected to FMG and so forth by people they thought would liberate them.</p><p>  Obviously we agree that a political solution is where our efforts must be directed.  The Minister has already made that point and I am sure the committee members will speak to the Minister about that.  I thank the witnesses for their work and for briefing us today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.310" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014100800006#E01500"><p>The witnesses tried to describe what is happening but there are times when language can fail to convey the horror and reality of that.  This is one example.  We do not have any concept of or feeling for what people must be going through in Syria.  Only for ISIS, Syria would still be off the main agenda because the conflict has been ongoing there for so long.  The ISIS crisis has, in a sense, brought Syria back onto the agenda.  I cannot help thinking that the issues in Palestine continue to be replaced as a further crisis happens with Syria.</p> <p> My other thoughts are about Libya where the exact same things are happening, but they have not come into the public arena in the same way as what is happening in Syria.  To put it mildly, it is very gloomy and there are concerns in this respect .  Our overseas development aid, ODA, allocation is moving further and further away from the 0.7% target.  It now stands at under 0.4%.  I repeat a point I made last week when we had representatives here speaking about the ebola crisis, namely, that we cannot divert money already committed to projects that are extremely badly needed to tackle a new crisis.  We must find other funds to tackle the new crisis.</p><p> Reference was made to co-ordination.  Is there a person with overall responsibility for co-ordinating all of the work being done in these areas?  The last thing we need is an overlap because the needs are so great.  I have met people who were involved in promoting a concept, with which Irish Aid agreed, that of the Jasmine Tent project, which was designed to provide a safe place for women.  I have not heard recently from those involved as to whether the project is moving forward.</p><p>On the issue of refugees, we have resettled 90.  I wonder how they were chosen?  Do the delegates believe, as some of us do, that Ireland could play a stronger role in taking in some more refugees, even if only on a temporary basis, because I am sure everybody will want to return to his or her country of origin at some stage?  </p><p> I thank the delegates for their input.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.312" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Brid Kennedy" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014100800007#F00200"><p>I will take, first, the question on the vulnerability of women and children and if there is anything we can do to improve their position.  It is a key focus of concern in all pf the work we do but especially in the regional response.  The number one priority is the provision of shelter.  In physically providing a shelter it is a physical place for a woman to stay.  I was in Lebanon and Turkey in July.  I met a women in Lebanon who was in one of the collective centres to which I referred.  She told me that she had lost 23 family members in one day owing to shelling and that she had only two distant relatives with her.  Her vulnerability was massive.  We asked how we could help her and she said just by providing a safe space for her where she could be with others and also though the protection programme Irish Aid was funding.  It allows people like her and many other women - girls and boys also - a space in which to express their issues and also what they would like to see happen in supporting them.  Also, it helps to work with men and older male youth to get them to talk about these issues.  Sometimes many of these issues women face are not spoken about.  By getting people to speak about them and having opinions and feelings heard, something can be done about them.  That is a crucial aspect.</p><p>  In the education programme we focus strongly on boys and girls.  Again, we bring out these protection issues within the programme and all other aspects of our work.  We constantly bring up the issue of safety and try to address issues of women's rights.  We refer them to the local authorities and services that address issues and problems women encounter as a result of rape or other such violations.  We are doing a good deal of work in that area.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned that language could not describe what was happening.  It cannot describe the suffering of many refugees and people inside Syria.  The co-ordination of all the work being done in response is being managed at different levels.  In Lebanon there is a co-ordination group in the northern region where the UN bodies and non-governmental organisations, NGOs, are working.  There is also a national level co-ordination mechanism in Beirut.  In Turkey there is a co-ordination mechanism between the OCHA and the NGOs and there is also a regional co-ordination mechanism working out of Amman in Jordan.  All of these feed into one another.  It is not perfect, but it is working at some level.  As the Irish Government provides quite a bit of support for the United Nations, we again urge it to support the strengthening of co-ordination at these levels.</p></speech>

We are all aware of the refugee camps in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan and the pressure they put on the governments of these countries, particularly Jordan and Lebanon which have very limited resources.  The number of refugees at the Zaatari camp increased from 15,000 to 150,000.  The refugee camps in Lebanon are also huge; they have almost new formed cities.  Does Concern work within these refugee camps with the UNHCR in the provision of education services, or do they work outside thoe camps?</p></speech>

That is why we call them informal settlements or collective centres.  The Turkish Government has excellent refugee camps which it is able to manage independently of us.  Therefore, our work is outside the camps in both countries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.315" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/974" speakername="Pat Breen" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014100800007#F00500"><p>That is fine.</p></speech>

In the past few years many of them have used all of their resources to rent space.  They are living in garages, under awnings or in any place they can find and paying ground rent for all of these spaces, with the result that their own resources are being eroded.  Those who initially came across as relatively well off, middle class refugees are hitting rock bottom without support.  The other challenge is that there are also poor Lebanese and now Syrians who are receiving some support who are able to compete on an unequal basis for the jobs available at bottom of the greasy pole.  As such, this is creating new tensions in seeking access to jobs and services.  It is a problem that is waiting to erupt.</p></speech>

When we were in Jordan we were told that this was a civil war, that there was no interim solution and that it would go on for ten years.  Many of the people in question will settle and not return to their homeland.</p></speech>

It is a question of getting people back around the table to try to hammer out some solution to enable refugees to go back.  During the years we have seen many refugees in different circumstances.  Home is the place to be and they will go back home if there is peace and if it the country is in any way calm.  It is undignified to be a refugee.</p><p>  To return to the issue raised by Deputy Olivia Mitchell of the target of 0.7% of GNP, we have seen an economic downturn in recent years.  We have seen an erosion of the aid budget not only in terms of the actual monetary amount allocated, but also in terms of the percentage.  We are looking at all of the fantastic forecasts at this stage-----</p></speech>

We hope the allocation will be tied to a percentage increase and not eroded further.  It would be great if we received some support in defending moving in the direction of achieving the 0.7% target and getting back on track again.  We are in the midst of an unprecedented crisis around the world.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan talked about the limitations on the budget and new money to deal with new crises not easily being available.  The ebola crisis is rapidly getting out of control.  I am going out to the region on Friday.  We are looking at the situation in south Sudan and have big operations taking place in the Central African Republic.  The Syrian crisis is just one more.  There are floods in Pakistan and mudslides in Afghanistan.  The world seems to be a very troubled place and we need to address one crisis at a time to get back on track.</p></speech>

I was trying to bilocate but found it difficult.  I would have liked to have been here for the start of the discussion and appreciate that most of the issues have been discussed already.</p> <p>So many issues are competing for our attention globally that it makes it almost impossible for international agencies and the international community to deal with them in an effective way.  We have discussed this issue previously with the committee.  I do not know if we will achieve much progress in this regard, given the comment by the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navi Pillay, quoted in the submission, that "The killers, destroyers and torturers in Syria have been empowered and emboldened by the international paralysis."  The crucial question is how we address this international paralysis.  If the international community is unable to do anything in response to these atrocities, those who commit them will gain power.  </p><p> Questions were raised in the D&aacute;il yesterday about the people who publicly executed individuals.  They wear hoods and masks to avoid being identified.  There was a similar situation in Ukraine where soldiers wearing hoods and masks were able to prevent people from identifying the dead and their personal belongings.  To what extent should the international community be focusing, at the very least, on the creation of a situation where atrocities might lead to retribution at a later stage, whether through the International Criminal Court or elsewhere?  We need to do something about this because otherwise it is going to continue.  We will be dealing with a situation that cannot be controlled and the perpetrators will be the only ones who will be laughing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.323" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014100800008#G00200"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentation.  Ms O'Mahony stated: "If the current situation continues, we are facing a regional collapse with global consequences."  In regard to her recommendations, the Geneva talks opened up the possibility of resolving the issue, but it is difficult to see how that structure could deal with the issues arising, given that it involves Islamic terrorists who have no intention of stopping their advances and terrorism and who will probably export their activities abroad.   On who created this mess, we have to point the finger at the United States and the British for invading Iraq without an exit plan or considering the possible consequences.  Unfortunately, even the citizens of these countries are paying the price.  They appear to have stepped back and are trying to pursue a proxy war, but I cannot see how it can succeed.  We need to look for better leadership, but, unfortunately, there is no sign of this.  We will probably have to wait several years before there is a new administration in the United States and it is far from certain that it will be better at dealing with these issues.</p><p>  I ask Ms O'Mahony for an insight into the atrocities that are taking place, some of which she identified in her submission.  In the past couple of years I visited Lebanon and Jordan with other members.  We visited some of the refugee camps, including, in particular, those located near the Syrian border in Lebanon.  Ms O'Mahony's point about the destabilisation of Lebanon is well made.  Both Lebanon and Jordan are in a vulnerable position.  In the Zaatari camp we met women who were being forced into prostitution because of a lack of law and order.  Security was left to the refugees to provide.  When we inquired whether there were Christians in the camp, the UN personnel told us that there were but that they had to pretend to be Muslim because their lives would be at risk if certain elements within the camp discovered that they were Christian.  I presume that continues to be the case.  We have heard a lot about the beheadings, but I am also hearing from other groups that crucifixion has become a common practice among terrorists in Iraq and Syria.  Women, in particular, are paying a huge price and it is difficult to see how the issue can be resolved.  I am not advocating this, but I can only see it being resolved if the two parties which created the environment in which this mess happened decide to go back to remove the terrorists in the area.  There does not appear to be any indication that such an approach might be taken.  I ask Ms O'Mahony to disagree with me if she thinks I am misreading the situation or I am being overly alarmist.</p></speech>

The only way to address the issue is to rebuild structures.  It is necessary to have peace if one is to rebuild structures and reduce the operating space for terrorists.  We cannot just wring our hands and say the problem is too big to solve.  We have to keep trying to get people around the table to open up the conversation.  It is almost as if terrorism can be managed under a wider umbrella because all of the individuals in question have mothers, fathers and families.  They are human beings, although some of them may not appear to be.  It is a question of closing the space for them to operate.  That is what international will and direction can achieve.  The higher the level of the players around the table, the better.  During the early days of the Syrian crisis there was almost paralysis in the UN security system, with Russia abstaining and no concerted effort being made among leaders.  This created the opportunity for the current crisis to emerge in terms of its size and extent.  People need to get back around the table to hold substantive talks.</p></speech>

We hear about a wide range of atrocities in the media and through the refugees we encounter on a daily basis.  They include people losing their livelihoods because whereas previously they had jobs and could afford to live a comfortable life, their standards of living have collapsed.  The fear factor has escalated enormously, especially in the past few weeks when the air attacks started.  Foot soldiers fighting on the ground created considerable fear, but when this is combined with aerial attacks, it creates enormous fear among a massive population in Syria.  In addition, the practice of beheading adds to these fears.  I understand that while the beheadings are sometimes targeted, often they are random.  People can be picked from the street, mediaeval style, and communities are told that a beheading is being carried out and that they must come to watch it.  This instils considerable fear.  In some ways, those who left for Lebanon, Turkey or Jordan are the lucky ones, as many others are unable to leave because they do not have passports, are too poor to travel or have disabilities or other incapacities.</p> <p>They have incapacities, disabilities and so on so they are not able to travel.  They are living within a restrictive, fearful environment.  We know of girls and women who are being raped.  We know of punishments because certain rules are not complied with.  Beatings are regular so the fear factor in terms of murder, rape and violence is part of everyday life in many parts of Syria.  It is not just confined to one area; it is throughout the country.</p></speech>

That is a humanitarian-type visa.  I understand that is how one of the schemes works.  I am not sure how the other one works but we have to recognise that we have taken leadership in that regard, which is to be welcomed.  It would be great if we could do more, but Ireland is leading by example in having such a programme available for Syrians.</p></speech>

In that case I thank all the witnesses for coming before the committee this afternoon.  I thank Ms O'Mahoney, Ms Kennedy and Mr. Doyle for their contributions and updating us on Concern's activities within Syria and the recommendations they have brought before the committee.  We have no problem supporting those recommendations, and we will write to the Minster after today's meeting with a view to the Government supporting those recommendations.  They are very reasonable recommendations and they will go some way towards our contribution, outside of our financial contribution, to supporting a peaceful solution in the region.</p><p>  We will have the Minister in here in the coming weeks when I am sure this issue will be still on the agenda, as the situation deteriorates on a daily basis in Syria and in the border region with Turkey.  Obviously, we should never forget about the humanitarian situation which Concern deals with, particularly its role in dealing with health, education and other areas, and providing fresh water within Syria also.  We commend it on that and we commend its volunteers who are out there putting their lives in danger on a daily basis.  It is something we should never forget, particularly when we consider the fate of the British taxi driver who broke off his Christmas holiday to help these people.  We should never forget the volunteers who are putting their lives in danger.</p><p>  As Ms O'Mahoney said, other issues will arise.  There is the ebola crisis in west Africa and the deteriorating situation in south Sudan where everybody is talking about the famine that will happen there, and we cannot stop it.  We will revisit those issues in the coming months and we hope to see all the witnesses in the near future.  I thank them sincerely for coming before the committee and briefing the members on the humanitarian situation.  We will be dealing with other issues in Syria, including the political issues, with other groupings.  We hope to have some journalists, United Nations representatives and Government representatives before the committee in the coming months.  We had a most interesting discussion and it is always a pleasure to hear about the good work Concern is doing in these areas of conflict.</p><p>  We will now go into private session for the remainder of the meeting.</p></speech>

On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Professor Gavin Barrett from University College Dublin who will assist the committee in its consideration of this matter.  I congratulate Professor Barrett on his recent appointed to the position of professor.</p><p>  The format is that I will invite Professor Barrett to make some brief opening remarks, which will be followed by a question and answer session with members.  I draw Professor Barrett's attention to the fact that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to this committee.  However, if they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity, by name or in such as way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I invite Professor Barrett to make a brief opening presentation.  </p></speech>

In examining the European Commission's proposal and commenting on the Commission's response to the joint committee's reasoned opinion, I am not in any sense acting as a representative of the Commission.  What members will hear is simply a third party opinion on the proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of a European public prosecutor's office, EPPO, from someone with some knowledge of this area of the law.  I hope my opinion will be of some use.</p><p>  As members are aware, the idea of a public prosecutor's office at European level has been under discussion for more than 20 years and under serious discussion for at least 13 years.  The European Commission published a green paper on the topic in 2001.  The proposal for a European public prosecutor's office is not the only game in town, however, as regards prosecutorial co-operation at European level.  Eurojust was formally established in 2002 and already co-ordinates such co-operation.  We have, therefore, more than a decade of European level prosecutorial co-operation.</p><p>  The prospects of going beyond current co-operation in this area by creating a more powerful European level body were boosted by the coming into force of the treaty of Lisbon at the end of 2009, in particular, Article 86 of the treaty which provides that, in order to combat crimes affecting the financial interests of the Union the Council could, by regulation, establish a European public prosecutor's office.  These regulations have now appeared in the shape of the EPPO proposal.  It was obvious, even from a reading of Article 86 that this proposal has considerable potential for co-operation. </p><p>  The proposal must be adopted by unanimity.  Ireland and the United Kingdom have an opt-out and opt-in by virtue or our protocol in thus matter and provision has also been made for the issue to be bumped up to the European Council in case of any discussion.  Other aspects include the special enhanced co-operation procedure in this area.  The proposal was clearly expected to give rise to potential for controversy and has done so.</p><p>  The proposal to establish a European public prosecutor's office was published on 17 July last year.  Since then, it has been winding its way through the European Union's legislative procedure.  On the one hand, it is moving through the Council of Ministers, where it was debated in October 2013 and March 2014 without any conclusions being reached, and, on the other, it is proceeding through the European Parliament, where it has been voted on and reported on in the relevant committee.  It was also debated in a plenary session in March 2014 when a resolution was passed calling for reasonably extensive amendments.  That is the current position in respect of the proposal.  </p><p>  Apart from what is taking place in the Council and Parliament, another game or procedure is taking place simultaneously.  I refer to what is occurring in national parliaments under the subsidiarity mechanism.  As members will be aware, under Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union and Protocol No. 2 - the subsidiarity protocol - national parliaments get to operate the yellow and orange card procedures, in other words, they police compliance with the principle of subsidiarity.</p> <p>We can come back to the procedure but essentially under Article 6, national parliaments get eight weeks to send to the presidents of the various European institutions reasoned opinions on why they consider the draft in question does not comply with subsidiarity.  Each national parliament gets two votes.  With 28 states, that is 56 votes in total.  Generally, when reasoned opinions represent at least a third of all votes - that is 19 votes in total - the draft has to be reviewed.  In other words, it gets yellow-carded.  The threshold, though, as regards Justice and Home Affairs, JHA measures is lower than that.  It is only a quarter.  That is why the draft European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO regulation was regarded as having being yellow-carded even though only 18 votes were actually cost against it.  It earned reasoned opinions from Cyprus, the Czech Republic, France, Hungary, Ireland, Malta, Romania, Slovenia, Sweden, Holland and the UK.  This was a total of 18 votes when only 14 were needed.  </p><p> Purely for the purposes of reminding ourselves, the Oireachtas submitted a reasoned opinion in October of last year.  In that report, which was drafted and proposed by this committee, the Oireachtas expressed its opinion that the proposal did not comply with the principle of subsidiarity for three reasons.  The first was that it considered criminal law to be primarily a national competence and the investigation and prosecution of all fraud, including that against the EU, to be primarily a duty of national authorities.  Second, the committee  took the view that the Commission had not adequately considered the option of strengthening existing or alternative mechanisms and had merely assumed that an EU level measure was the only way of moving forward.  Third, the committee considered that more emphasis should have been placed on improving co-operation between organisations like Eurojust, the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF and the member states and so on.  Also, the argument was made that the Commission had not demonstrated that member states were taking inadequate action against EU fraud.  </p><p> The Commission confirmed that the subsidiarity control mechanism had been triggered on 6 November.  It issued a communication on 27 November 2013.  The reply to the Oireachtas, in particular, had two limbs to it.  One was the letter sent to the Oireachtas on 14 March, the other was the communication sent on 27 November 2013.  The letter was supposed to deal with matters that did not raise subsidiarity concerns at all.  The view was taken that objection A, the competence objection, raised by the Oireachtas did not raise a subsidiarity issue.  It was addressed nonetheless.  It simply made the case that it did have competence in relation to this, that it was an area of shared competence essentially and that under Article 86 it had been given the power to adopt the European public prosecutor's initiative.  There is more to the letter than that but that is the essence of it.  Objections B and C in the committee's reasoned opinion were addressed more generally in the context of a communication directed at all of the parliaments in the European Union.  </p><p> In the committee's communications with me, it has raised five concerns.  With its permission, I will go through each of those five concerns in turn and try to address them.  </p><p> The first area of concern that the committee mentioned was the decision of the Commission to place the first point of the reasoned opinion of the Oireachtas  outside the scope of subsidiarity.  In other words, to treat competence as not raising a subsidiarity issue at all.  Our concerns here can be limited to the extent that the competence question was addressed.  It just said this was not a legitimate subsidiarity question and that it does not belong in a subsidiarity review.  </p><p> This raises the issue of what is subsidiarity.  It would not have been too much for us to ask the Treaty drafters for a workable European-level definition of the principle that national parliaments are supposed to apply but we actually do not have that.  Perhaps the reason we do not have that is that differences between the member states meant that there was never actually consensus as to what subsidiarity means.  We do not have a comprehensive and authoritative, let alone universally binding, working definition of subsidiarity.  All we have are Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union, TEU and Article 5 of the subsidiarity protocol which are fairly thin definitions, with the Article 5 definition stating that in order for subsidiarity to be complied with, the aims of the measure cannot be sufficiently achieved by the members states and then - a positive part - by reason of the scale or affects of the action, that it can be better achieved at Union level.    </p><p> Procedural guidance is given in Article 5 of the protocol.  For instance, it says that draft legislative acts need to be justified and they need detailed statements and some assessment of the proposal's financial impact and so on and so forth.  It is rather detailed procedural stuff.  Beyond that, that is pretty much it as regards guidance regarding the meaning of subsidiarity.  No spontaneous consensus has emerged between national parliaments on what subsidiarity means.  Does it include competence or not?  That is the issue the committee wants to raise.  Actually, the point can be argued either way.  </p><p> The actual structure of the treaty provisions distinguish competence, subsidiarity and proportionality.  One would expect, if that was the case, that in fact competence actually is a different issue to subsidiarity.  That would be the end of the matter in that regard.  Furthermore, logically, keeping subsidiarity and competence separate is more conceptually neat in the sense that if the European Union does not have any competence then it is not necessary to consider at what level that competence is going to be exercised.  On the other hand, in reality, legality, subsidiarity and proportionality questions all do tend to get intermixed.  Some writers on the topic feel that even theoretically they are hard enough to distinguish.  One argument is that if there is no competence, then it is not possible to say that the European Union is going to be more efficient.  It can therefore be said that the subsidiarity test has failed.  An argument can be constructed that competence issues are subsidiarity issues.  Certainly, there is at least one writer in the area,  Kiiver, who actively encourages national parliaments to raise competence issues.  It can be seen that the Commission does not agree with that, so the committee will collide with the Commission if it continues raising competence issues.  However, maybe that is no harm.  It is a matter for the committee and arguments can be raised in either direction.  However, it is possible to see the way the Commission feels.</p><p> The second area of concern was the general response from the Commission.  This question really relates to the substantive response of the Commission.  There is the competence issue which I have already looked at.  The second objection of the Oireachtas concerned inadequate consideration of alternative or existing mechanisms.  In response to this, the Commission considered that in its November 2013 communication.  The reasoning was fairly extensive in that regard.  It stretches over approximately three pages.  There are a number of interesting features to that.  One of them is that it agreed that it should take into account its own impact assessment report.  That was something the committee mentioned in its own report.  Some states would not agree with that because impact assessment reports are not always translated.  Some states object and say they cannot be used to defend a measure on subsidiarity grounds.  The Commission very much takes the view it can do that.  It, essentially, in relation to existing or alternative mechanisms, restated its position.  It pointed out the impact assessment report, the explanatory memorandum and the accompanying legislative and financial statement of the Commission and, essentially, did not go beyond that.  It basically restated its position and said that was answer enough.  Interestingly enough, in terms of looking at comparative efficiency, it denied the need to look at the situation in individual member states.  It argues that looking at action at the level of member states generally and that being generally inefficient was enough.  It went in to some statistical detail in that regard.  It looked at, in particular, statistics that had been produced by OLAF showing that national criminal proceedings were taking too long and the levels of successful prosecutions were too low.  Therefore, there was a quite detailed response in that regard which relied very much on statistics. As regards the alternative mechanisms at European level, the Commission relied heavily in its communication on the inherent limitations of those mechanisms.</p> <p>The Commission relied heavily in its communication on the inherent limitations of those mechanisms.  Basically, it noted that the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, is limited to administrative investigations, noted no prosecution is necessary after an OLAF investigation and that Europol and Eurojust have no powers to conduct or direct investigations.  Basically, that was how the Commission answered the various objections.  There is a little more to it than that but that is most of what it had to say on the matter.  It is an extensive answer to the Oireachtas.  Some of it is simply a restatement but some of it goes further into statistical detail.  There is approximately three pages of justification.<br/>Area of concern No. 3 expressed by the Oireachtas was how the Commission considers a reasoned opinion.  The committee noted in its communication to me that the Commission appears to have the final say in what does or does not breach subsidiarity and, if so, asked about the benefits of issuing a reasoned opinion.  It is something of an existential question: what are we doing here?  Procedurally, how does the Commission consider a reasoned opinion?  To a certain extent we should see things from the Commission's point of view.  It has limited time and resources.  Procedurally, it is not unreasonable for the Commission to seek to gather together similar responses from the various parliaments and answer them <i>en masse</i>with a general communication.  I suppose I can understand the Commission doing that.  At the same time it is important that the job be taken seriously and that adequate work be put into coming up with the response, but I am unsure of the committee's view in this regard.  It is a reasonably extensive response stretching over several pages.<br/>The question of the Commission having the final say in what does or does not breach subsidiarity was raised.  Ultimately, the Commission does not have the final say in respect of what violates subsidiarity.  Subsidiarity is a legal principle and its meaning, ultimately, is a matter for the Court of Justice of the European Union to decide on.  Article 19 of the Treaty on European Union states that it is up to the EU Court of Justice to ensure that in the interpretation and application of the treaties the law is observed.  Under Article 263 it is possible for a review action to be brought before the Court of Justice.  If someone believes subsidiarity is being violated, whether a member state, an institution, or, in certain circumstances, a private person, then the matter can be litigated before the Court of Justice.  Above all for the purposes of this committee, under Article 8 of Protocol No. 2, section 7(4) of the European Union Act 2009 and Seanad and D&aacute;il Standing Orders, this committee can initiate a process requiring the Government to bring the matter before the Court of Justice.  If the committee believes sufficiently strongly about the subsidiarity issue and that the Commission is wrong in this regard, then it can initiate the process of bringing the matter before the Court of Justice to get the court to consider whether the Commission was right or wrong.  I am unsure how strongly the committee feels about it, but it remains an option at the end of the day.<br/>Realistically, on the other hand, the Court of Justice has tended to be rather hesitant in being over-elaborative in its approach to subsidiarity.  Realistically, the Commission has a good deal of power in deciding whether subsidiarity has been breached.  This has several consequences.  The committee could simply accept the Commission view and seek to influence the Commission within the parameters of that definition.  As an alternative approach the committee could dispute the Commission's interpretation on the meaning of subsidiarity and, if necessary or if the committee so wishes, take that dispute as far as the Court of Justice.<br/>The committee raised another issue about the consequences of this and set out a rather lengthy objection.  It was always anticipated that the procedural consequences of objecting to a reasoned opinion or a yellow card would be relatively weak.  In deploying the yellow card procedure, basically a parliament secures the entitlement to get the matter reviewed.  Then it can be maintained, amended or withdrawn subsequently.  In a sense the subsidiarity mechanism is narrow in that it only focuses on subsidiarity.  It is weak in terms of what a parliament can get the Commission to do.  However, one approach the committee could adopt in this respect is to try to compensate for the institutional weakness or the weakness of the consequences of a subsidiarity warning by trying to push the boundaries of subsidiarity.  Does it include competence?  Then it could put in competence objections.  Does it include proportionality?  Then it could put in proportionality obligations.  Does it require more detailed justifications above what a parliament has received?  Then the committee could ask for more detailed justifications and object if it does not get them.  In other words, a parliament could try to compensate for the weakness of what it can demand from the Commission by broadening the scope of the procedure.<br/>Committee members should ask what the benefits of issuing a reasoned opinion are.  Certainly, it means the committee is forcing the political system to engage in a debate and forcing the Executive to listen and justify itself.  Issues would be raised that would not be raised otherwise.  Certainly, when the early warning mechanism was not in place and the Court of Justice was the only means of enforcing this procedure, issues such as those being raised by the Oireachtas simply were not raised.  What is happening here is that national parliaments are carving out a role for themselves at European level.<br/>On the other hand, let us consider the European role of every committee in the Oireachtas.  The committees could have many European roles.  Committees can examine secondary legislation, such as statutory instruments and determine whether they are being properly used.  Committees can call a Minister to appear before them and ask him or her to be accountable for what is going on in Council meetings.  Committees can ventilate issues at national level and produce reports or engage in political dialogue at European level.  There are a range of things committees can do in respect of European matters.  Committee members must decide for themselves where to focus their efforts at the end of the day.<br/>I believe the subsidiarity issue is worth devoting a certain amount of time to.  I am pleased that the committee issued a reasoned opinion.  It will be broader because when the treaties are revised - they will be revised in due course - the subsidiarity gate will be widened.  Committees will be expressly given broader powers to consider issues going beyond subsidiarity.  Even now, the committee can give subsidiarity as broad a definition as it wishes and argue that these considerations need to be take into account.  Were I in the position the committee is in, that is how I would seek to argue subsidiarity.<br/>Area of concern No. 4 relates to whether there is any further recourse once the Commission makes its decision.  The short answer is: yes, there is.  In fact, there are several methods of recourse.  First, let us not forget Protocol No. 2.  Ireland has an opt-out with an opt-in in respect of all justice and home affairs matters.  If the committee really does not like this particular measure, it can push for us not to opt in to it.  That is the first recourse.  We do not have to adopt this measure if we would rather not.<br/>In evidence given before this committee on 16 October the relevant officials in the Department of Justice and Equality indicated that it has been decided that it would be best for Ireland for the time being not to opt in to this particular measure, but that if appropriate adjustments can be made then we might opt in afterwards.  In terms of where they go from now, committee members should be aware that there is a debate to be had on whether we opt in or opt out.  I do not believe there is any great difficulty, ultimately, and if appropriate adjustments can be made, for Ireland to opt in.  However, the committee may take a different view in that regard and if so, it should push for Ireland not to opt in.<br/>What else can the committee do?  Ireland is taking part in the debates on the adoption of this measure, although it is not guaranteed that we will opt in to it.  We are in a unique and privileged position in this regard.  The committee should seek to influence the Minister.  If there are particular things the committee wishes to see in this proposal members should get the Minister before the committee before she goes to Europe and indicate that they are keen to see these things in the measure in question.<br/>If the committee really believes that this measure violates subsidiarity, notwithstanding the Commission's responses, then it should initiate the Article 8 procedure.  Once the measure is adopted - the committee should be quick about it, because there is a two-month procedure - the committee could get the matter brought before the Court of Justice.  The committee should note that the Oireachtas can instruct the Government to bring the matter before the Court of Justice.  The committee should note further that the process of instruction begins in this committee.  The committee makes a report and recommends it to the Oireachtas.  There is a range of options open to the committee.  The fact that the Commission has rejected the committee's opinion in this regard does not mean that it has no further recourse or that there is nothing else to do.<br/>I will set out my view on area of concern No. 5.  The committee indicated that the Croatian Parliament had stated that the Commission was giving preference to the legal rather than the political interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity and asked whether I would explain legal and political subsidiarity.</p> <p>A couple of points  occur in regard to this.  The first is that subsidiarity is a legal principle at the end of the day.  It is defined in Article 5 of the protocol.  It might not be a very adequate definition, but it is a legal principle.  Second, it is very vaguely defined in those provisions.  As a result of that, there is an ongoing debate as to what subsidiarity actually means, and that debate is in part there because the European Court of Justice refuses to get involved.  It is being driven by national parliaments at the moment, although it is a legal debate, so there is a political aspect to it.  I presume that is what the Croatian parliament was getting at.  What they were essentially saying in accusing the European Commission of adopting a legal approach in relation to it, was that the Commission was taking the same lenient, generous, restrained and deferential approach to what subsidiarity means as the European Court of Justice has been taking for years.  The Croatians were saying that was not good enough for them, they want there to be a tougher, harder and broader definition in relation to subsidiarity </p></speech>

It relates to a &quot;common declaration on the proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office ... signed in their own name by members of national parliaments of the European Union&quot;.  We did not attend this meeting in Paris as it happened.  The communique maintains that &quot;the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor's Office, to reinforce the fight against financial crime affecting the European Union's financial interests, which is made possible by Article 86 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, should be supported and should fully take into account the positions and fundamental principles supported by the national parliaments&quot;.<br/>The communique continues: <blockquote>The proposal for a Council regulation on the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office ... was largely debated within the national parliaments and was the subject of a 'yellow card' procedure in respect of the subsidiarity procedure, 14 chambers having judged that the proposal doesn't comply with the principle of subsidiarity.<br />The signatories of this common position consider that the European Public Prosecutor's Office, EPPO, should be established under a collegial structure, composed of national members drawn from their respective judicial systems.  The EPPO shouldn't have exclusive competence, but shared competence with the judicial authorities of the Member States, combined with a general right of evocation.  Several key provisions of the proposal for a regulation, such as the judicial review of EPPO's investigation and prosecution's acts, the admissibility of evidence and the rules on prescription periods are lacunar and must be subject to a more thorough work.<br />It should be emphasised that the work of the Council of the European Union under the Greek Presidency is heading in the right direction and that it is desirable that the work continue under the Italian Presidency.  Ongoing negotiations should have to ensure the independence, the efficiency and the added-value of the EPPO.</blockquote></p></speech>

I do not believe that kind of initiative would have been taken if the subsidiarity early warning mechanism was not there.  There is therefore a kind of penumbra of other things that are going on as a result of the subsidiarity mechanism.  We can look forward to national parliaments seeking to throw their weight around a bit more at European level, as well they should, in relation to various matters.  An issue for this committee is then to consider how it can throw its weight around a bit more.  One way I would suggest is that ideas count at European level.  This is an idea that has been put in there.  I do not know if that idea will be adopted but at least it is out there being observed and listened to all across the EU.  If we compare the reasoned opinion that was offered by the Oireachtas with other reasoned opinions, it was a significant document, but it was also relatively brief.  I wonder if we could throw in more ideas.  Where would we get those ideas from?  The inter-parliamentary exchange, for instance, other opinions are being put up there, and there is a wealth of ideas and suggestions and cross-fertilisation that could be used by the various parliaments, including this one.  Resources are very tight but there are some ways in which that can be compensated for by using the ideas of others.</p></speech>

I would also encourage the committee to liaise with other committees.  It is possible to make joint submissions with other committees.  There is a whole range of possible responses that can be made.  There is an increasing number of relevant bodies in addition to COSAC, the conference of the committees of the national parliaments of the EU member states dealing with European affairs.  There are bodies in the fields of common foreign and security policy and monetary union, for example.  There are increasing avenues to co-operate with other European parliaments.  The strength of togetherness is particularly necessary in order that this Parliament benefit from it, because resources are so tight.</p></speech>

That facilitated the Commission's response by way of a communication.  I suspect that the Commission would say that there is already a degree of shared competence in this regard because, they would say, the enforcement of the EPPO proposal will be done via the various national systems, for instance delegated public prosecutors in the various member states.  Review of the validity of the actions of the EPPO will also be carried out by the national courts and so on.  I suspect that will be the Commission's argument.  Perhaps, though, there is room for negotiation on whether more shared competence could be fostered.</p></speech>

We do indeed get invitations to many different meetings and clearly we would particularly wish to be represented only where the meeting is going to produce some sort of common position like this one.  Is there a way of knowing in advance, so we could prioritise giving limited resources and time?  My second question is whether most committees that are active at this level tend to send the chairperson or a specialist designated from within the committee? Clearly, continuity is better if the same person goes all the time.</p></speech>

I would fully agree with Senator Bacik on the need to box clever in relation to this.  No matter how strongly it feels, there is no point in the Oireachtas issuing a reasoned opinion in relation to a measure when there is not the slightest hope that it is going to accumulate the necessary number of votes in order for a yellow card to be issued.  What the committee wants to be doing is finding out information, and the best way of doing that is via the Monday morning meetings.  I believe all of the EU member states' parliaments, including the Oireachtas, have a parliamentary representative based in the European Parliament offices in Brussels.  That representative will be able to give the committee a heads-up on what looks likely to get a yellow card, and then the committee needs to get the Oireachtas involved.</p> <p> I would also advise members to take a look at IPEX, the EU's interparliamentary information exchange website.  It is a goldmine of resources from different member state parliaments, most of which are much better resourced than our Parliament.  While the Oireachtas does have its own legal adviser, many other parliaments have a range of advisers specialising in particular areas.  The committee could ride on the back of that expertise and avail of those arguments and the information that is there.</p><p> I already referred to COSAC and the various other committees.  The European Parliament, too, is very interested in this type of co-operation with member states.  Members should not forget the individual committees within the European Parliament, which would welcome engagement with this committee.  Indeed, it is those committees which facilitate the parliamentary representatives by providing them with office space and other resources in Brussels.</p></speech>

Indeed, I would be most surprised if their powers were not extended in the next treaty revision.  I fully expect a broadening of the range of issues in which national parliaments are expected to engage.  The European Union needs as much democratic legitimacy as it can get its hands on.  Moreover, the European Parliament has been given as many powers it can have.  In fact, it has powers that make it almost the equivalent of a national parliament at European level.  In terms of parliamentary developments, there is only one way for this to go, and that is increased powers for national parliaments.</p></speech>

On behalf of the joint committee, I thank Ms Logan for her attendance here today.  I will invite Ms Logan to make a brief opening statement, which will be followed by a question and answer session with members.  Before we begin, I draw Ms Logan's attention to the fact that witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to this committee.  However, if they are directed to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or persons or entity, by name or in such as way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should also be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Ms Logan to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I will touch on how my experience and background as Ombudsman for Children, as well as the manner of my nomination for the position of chief commissioner, could provide positive models for public appointments and the independent operation of statutory agencies more generally.  I will note some of the upcoming priorities and milestones for the commission in the immediate and medium terms, which will be important to ensure the Commission's ability to operate independently and in full compliance with the UN Paris principles and effectively operationalise its broad range of enhanced legislative functions.</p><p>  Having in place an effective human rights and equality architecture in Ireland is an important requirement of the Good Friday Agreement.  More fundamentally, the human rights and equality infrastructure comprises a crucial institutional element of the commitment by the State to uphold the "dignity and freedom" of every individual under our Constitution and the diverse range of international, European Union and Council of Europe human rights and equality treaties Ireland has agreed to be bound by.  In undertaking their separate mandates, the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission have played important roles in the protection of the rights of some of the most vulnerable groups in Irish society.  In recent years, the human rights and equality infrastructure has undoubtedly faced considerable difficulties.  This occurred at a time when the financial crisis and austerity measures created hardship for people in a way that raises pressing questions of human rights, justice and equality.  In what I believe is a departure from this challenging period and a fresh start for the new commission, I am extremely pleased and honoured to have been nominated as chief commissioner of a new commission.</p><p>  I would like to take this opportunity to clarify one aspect of a press release that was sent out yesterday.  I would like to respectfully mention that today's meeting is not a confirmation hearing, that the commission is not a State board and that this is not a ministerial appointment.  I ask the committee to forgive me for being so explicit but it is important, in the context of the current public debate, for people to understand what is happening here today.</p> <p> My nomination as chief commissioner follows an open competition.  It was a transparent and rigorous process run by the Public Appointments Service and it included a series of two separate interviews by a group of international experts in the area of human rights and equality.  This process, coupled with the appointment of the existing members of the commission by an independent selection panel, marks a significant change from previous practice for the appointment of the commission.  The final stage of the appointment of the commission will follow a resolution by the Houses of the Oireachtas and President Higgins will formally appoint the 15 member commission.  Crucially, not least given the ways in which public appointments have dominated public and political debate in recent weeks, I believe the transparent nature of this process is of critical importance to establishing the credibility of the new body with members of the public and the diverse range of various stakeholders, including statutory agencies and civil society.  I am eager that the legislative foundation of an independent appointment process will be mirrored by a constructive and positive relationship and engagement between the commission and the Department of Justice and Equality.  I am pleased to report that I have had a very positive meeting with the Minister for Justice and Equality who has assured me of her support for the commission and with whom members of the commission will meet later this month.</p><p> As Ombudsman for Children and an independent officer of the State for the past ten years, my relationship with the Department of Health and subsequently the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was very positive and there was no interference whatsoever with the independence of my office.  I fully expect a similar relationship with the Department of Justice and Equality in my role as chief commissioner and I am confident, having met with senior officials, that this can be achieved through investment in a respectful working relationship.</p><p> I wish to underline the importance of the independent functioning of the commission as the Minister and the Department consider their implementation of the recommendations of the Toland report.  While this report contains many important recommendations for the improved functioning and transparency of the Department, I am concerned that the calls for enhanced oversight and governance of external organisations should take account of the enhanced independence provided for in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act.  The new commission will have its own Oireachtas Vote in 2015 and will be accountable through its director, the Accounting Officer, to the Committee of Public Accounts.  In addition, it will be accountable for its statutory functions through its annual report to the Oireachtas, thereby making the commission effectively accountable to the Oireachtas.  This is a further significant and welcome departure from the previous legislative framework and it is vital that the developments arising from the Toland report should not undermine these positive developments.</p><p> This leads me to the upcoming renewal of the accreditation of the commission as Ireland's national human rights institution under the UN Paris Principles by the international co-ordinating committee, which determines access to UN committees.  I will work hard as chief commissioner to ensure that the new commission will be accredited as an A-status national human rights institution as a matter of priority under the UN Paris Principles and will remain a strong and active member of the European network of national human rights institutions.  In a recent resolution on national human rights institutions in its September session, it is noteworthy that the UN Human Rights Council recalled the "importance of financial and administrative independence and the stability of national human rights institutions".  The council noted that national human rights institutions should not face any form of reprisal or intimidation, including political pressure or unjustifiable budgetary limitations, as a result of performing their mandates.  I am eager to ensure that the commission is granted A-status accreditation and to demonstrate that with the new legislative framework, including the independent appointment of the commission, the Irish Government is beginning a new chapter in its relationship with its national human rights institution, which could potentially act as a model for what is required by the UN Paris Principles.</p><p> As chief commissioner, I am eager to develop the links between the commission and the various Oireachtas committees by ensuring that the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, regularly meets with parliamentary committees as it undertakes its legislative functions.  In particular, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has recommended, in the context of its observations on the 2014 Act, that on the parliamentary side a dedicated committee be established to examine equality and human rights matters with structural links to other committees.  While this recommendation has not yet been taken up, I believe that such a parliamentary committee is key to further embedding a culture of human rights and equality within the political processes of law-making within the State.  The commission would be very eager to collaborate with and inform the work of such a committee.  Of particular interest to committee members may be that the relationship between national human rights and equality institutions and parliaments has been elaborated upon in 2012 within the international Belgrade Principles.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention.  We very much welcome the opportunity to engage on a regular basis with this committee.  I have been in this job for only five days but I can assure the committee members that the feedback I received from individual commissioners has been very positive.  They know they are supported by this committee and they are excited that we are operating in a jurisdiction with a cross-parliamentary committee and individuals who are committed to the human rights and equality agenda.</p></speech>

The commissioners engaged with us on their appointments as there was an issue relating to how they were to be appointed.  It was very important that the Executive be seen to be at arm's length in the process.  This all-party Oireachtas committee undertook to meet the commissioners designate and we were very impressed with them - at the time we said we "gave them fair wind".  We have had positive interactions with the commissioners and their predecessors on numerous occasions.</p><p>  Ms Logan mentioned a parliamentary committee designated for human rights issues and this is something Senator Zappone has raised here.  I think I can speak for all committee members when I say we are interested in the proposal and are working to progress it.  The idea is that this committee would become a new committee and change its name to the committee on justice, human rights, equality and defence.  That is Senator Zappone's proposal and it has been discussed here on numerous occasions.  The issue is how committees will interact and this was touched on by Ms Logan in terms of structural links - we have examined this too.  It is a work in progress and we may seek advice from the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.</p></speech>

She spoke of austerity measures and the financial crisis and much hardship was created, raising pressing questions on human rights, justice and equality.

Regardless of the political context, the public context is important.  I feel the commission must bring human rights to life in a way that connects with communities - my most recent experience as Ombudsman for Children was working with the Roma community on the inquiry into the two children who were taken into care.  It is clear to me that some communities have no idea that human rights exist or that there is an equality framework.  We have much to do on promoting awareness and an understanding of human rights but there is a greater public appetite for social justice in Ireland since 2008.</p><p>  The commission has much work to do to connect with the public and let them know the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission exists.  People need to know that there are occasions when the commission can assist.  There is a strong legislative framework and some new statutory functions.  The commission is very interested in the positive duty described in section 42 of the Act as this is a new and welcome provision.  The legislation provides a new articulation of statutory powers and it features the word "encouragement".  The spirit of the legislation has changed - it wants to be connected.  I want the commission to connect with the Irish public to enable people to understand what is a violation of human rights.</p> <p>We have seen historically that it has taken some victims of abuse or mistreatment years to even fully understand that they have been mistreated.  I am very keen that the commission should be active in educating the public about and in promoting human rights.</p><p> The second part of the Deputy's question related to human rights.  There has been a focus on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ICCPR.  We are about to enter into a new phase of international monitoring and the UN Committee on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights will be beginning its process in early December.  Representatives from the commission will attend a pre-sessional hearing with that committee.  I assure the Deputy that the commission will not be shying away from issues relating to economic, cultural and social rights.  What I can say is that ours is a 15-member commission and it is still early days.  It is difficult, from a thematic point of view, to bring priorities to the table today because we have only entered into a very early stage of developing our first strategy.  What I am mainly doing, therefore, is talking about a way of working and an expression of intent by the commission in terms of how it is going carry out its work.</p></speech>

I would argue that we have a long way to go in this regard, particularly in view of recent events.  I refer here to our attitude to members of the Traveller or Roma communities or to how we treat immigrants.  We must move forward and change people's attitudes.  Will the commission have a role to play in the context of bringing about that change?  Many people are hostile to certain minorities in the State.</p></speech>

We have a long way to go.  My experience in the past ten years is that much of what the Deputy describes relates to a lack of information, education and, perhaps, understanding.  The commission has a great deal to do and it will be making a significant contribution.  I also want to work with civil society.  My experience is that one does not sit in one's ivory tower and hope that the position in respect of human rights will change.  That will not happen unless we mobilise the support of civil society, the members of which often have very direct relationships, particularly with marginalised communities.  The members of such communities may never hear about the commission unless it works through and with civil society.</p></speech>

I thank her for attending.  A collective "Yay" was uttered - most appropriately - when we heard about her appointment.  She described the process relating to her appointment in her presentation, which was both independent and very different from those which obtained in the past.  She also outlined her concern with regard to the Toland report and whether it will have implications for the way in which the commission is viewed in the context of its independence.  I agree with her in this regard and I hope what she referred to does not prove to be the case.  Having walked very carefully through the legislative process when the Bill was being debated, I am of the view that the commission's independence has been strengthened considerably and that what has been done will provide the basis for an A status.</p><p>  My first question relates to the challenge of bringing together the two cultures which obtained within the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission and among their staff.  Does Ms Logan have some thoughts on the challenges which might arise in this regard and how the new commission might rise to them?</p></speech>

There were only 12 staff at the commission when I was nominated in July, whereas we now have 22.  Our expectation is that we will have an agreed ceiling of 47.  The Senator is correct: there are two different cultures.  Having met both sets of staff, I am aware that they are very keen to advance and become the staff of the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  I do not want to pretend that the past did not happen.  I was surprised when I met some of the staff, particularly those from the Equality Authority, and discovered how demoralised they felt as a result of events in recent years.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the resilience of the staff who stayed with the Equality Authority and who have agreed to transfer to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  The reality is that I have joined an organisation which needs to be uplifted and given a sense of vision, future, working together and pride.  The staff are very proud of the work they did within both institutions.  However, it has been a difficult few years and I have no wish to deny that.</p><p>  In terms of bringing together conceptually the cultures of human rights and equality, the latter has traditionally been articulated as a negative obligation in the sense that it is the State's duty not to discriminate against particular groups.  The positive duty allows an interaction between public bodies, in particular, and the commission.  In my previous role as Ombudsman for Children, I gained experience in trying to encourage people.  The word "encourage" is used on a number of occasions in section 10 of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014.  On the basis of the well-established foundations the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority have already laid, I would like to develop a really positive relationship with public bodies with regard to trying to bring them with us in the context of the human rights and equality agenda in order to ensure that when citizens interact with them, their experience will be one of being treated with humanity and dignity.</p><p>  I just want to be frank and inform the committee that we have a great deal of work to do.  We do not have as many staff as we need and there is much recruitment to be done.  We will be moving to a new premises that will include staff offices and also a participation space.  The building will have a street frontage and will be accessible to the public.  We will invite groups in and interact directly with rights holders.  The commission will be both active and interactive.  It is fair to state that Senator Zappone recognises that it has not been an easy time for anybody who has served with either of the bodies prior to the establishment of the new commission.  However, the people who are with me now want to stay and are very committed to working for the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.</p></speech>

The Chairman has been extremely supportive and he and I met a number of commissioners designate during the earliest stages of the current process to explore the possibilities in this regard.  In that context, I wish to refer to a couple of the functions the committee would be seeking to have conferred upon it if it were to be given a human rights mandate.  We have put forward a proposal on this matter and, as the Chairman indicated, it is currently before the Houses.  I would welcome it if Ms Logan were to comment on any of the specific aspects of that proposal in terms of the functions involved, which include to review and scrutinise legislation for any human rights issues; to report back to the D&aacute;il in time for its report in order to influence the process; to, perhaps, advise the Dail and other committees in respect of human rights; to receive petitions from third parties; and to conduct hearings into human rights matters.  What we are seeking is to have a human rights mandate added to this committee's remit rather than the establishment of a new human rights committee.  Perhaps Ms Logan might comment on this issue.</p> <p>Ms Logan has indicated her welcome of that.  Does she have any more comments to make on it?</p></speech>

This committee has demonstrated its interest in human rights and equality.  I have not discussed this with my commissioners so I am giving the Senator my own answer on this.  It would be great to see the Irish Parliament extend the remit of this committee to include human rights and equality.  One of the dangers of limiting it to a committee, a point which the Senator has addressed, is the question of interaction with other committees.  In defining the role for one committee, we do not want to box it in a sense that other committees do not see human rights and equality as a cross-cutting theme underpinning any of their work.  Certainly, the positive duty provided for in the new Act is encouraging all public bodies to consider human rights and equality compliance.</p><p>  The UN committee mentioned, in its concluding observations, that it would be very useful for the Oireachtas to debate the issue.  From the commission's point of view, it would be a welcome opportunity.  We want the Irish Parliament to see the commission as a resource.  I know that we are in a lucky situation.  My two colleagues in Northern Ireland and Scotland only yesterday sent out press releases expressing concern about the repeal of the Human Rights Act in the UK and the possible undermining in Northern Ireland of the Belfast Agreement.  We are in a happy position in Ireland that we have an open-minded Parliament whose Members want to engage with this broader human rights and equality agenda.  Certainly, there is a greater public appetite for that engagement.</p></speech>

An example would be when Ireland goes before a particular UN committee in terms of a convention, as happened recently in terms of civil and political rights, and there is no formal engagement by the Oireachtas Members in that process.  It is usually done by a particular Department bringing together information from other Departments and then the Minister goes in front of the committee.  Legislators have not participated in that process, which is the reason we decided in the Seanad Public Consultation Committee to engage as legislators to look specifically at that committee and send a report from the legislators to it.  That is an example of where such a review is not happening and law-makers are not engaging in an explicit way in a review of our obligations under UN conventions.  Perhaps that is happening a little more in terms of the constitutional obligations but in terms of international treaties there is a big gap.  This is why we are pursing it.</p></speech>

The issue of housing is a fundamental human right.  As we develop as a commission, as we educate and hopefully contribute towards building capacity, the terminology of human rights and equality may not be used but the issues are human rights issues.  It would be welcome for the committee to consider extending its capacity beyond the reach of this committee.</p></speech>

In terms of the presentation by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to the UN Human Rights Committee, Ms Logan referenced the views of that committee, and I followed that with a great deal of interest.  She suggested that we probably should have a dedicated debate on that in this Parliament because what we are talking about here is our international human rights reputation.  Our committee should discuss making the call that we have a parliamentary debate on that.</p><p>  Traveller ethnicity was one of the issues raised.  Our committee has produced a report and recommended that the State recognise the ethnicity of the Traveller community.  I would like to get Ms Logan's thoughts on that and what she plans to do in her role in the time ahead.</p></speech>

It is in the concluding observations of the ICCPR committee.  It is an issue that has been collectively agreed upon.  There is consensus in terms of human rights and equality for the recognition of ethnicity of Travellers.  That is why these issues need to be brought for debate to the Parliament.  It has been a recommendation of the ICCPR and it is worth pursuing.</p></speech>

Ms Logan has raised this issue and I am sure she will have noted that there has been a marked increase in focus on it in Parliament.  It was the subject of a Private Members' motion last week that extended over two nights.  It appears we are nearing the point where, collectively, everybody is agreed that this system needs to change dramatically.  I would like to hear Ms Logan's thoughts on that system.</p><p>  Ms Logan will know that the former Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, would have asked that the asylum seeker system and the prison system would be under that office's jurisdiction and the new Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall has also called for that.  This fits into Ms Logan's recommendation that various committees in the Oireachtas work together on human rights and equality.  For example, in this case it would involve the committee that I chair, the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, working with this committee to advance a common objective.  I would like to hear Ms Logan's thoughts on that.  I presume that part of her engagement with the Minister is to get updates on where these matters are at and how they are progressing.</p></speech>

These issues are well publicised.  As Ombudsman for Children, I, in my first annual report, called for the inclusion of asylum seekers to offer redress as part of the existing mechanism.  A good deal of research has been published on direct provision.  The commission is concerned about it.  We will publicly make a statement on this in November and publish some of the work that has been undertaken.  What we are trying to do is to complement or offer something new to the debate.  There appears to be growing consensus and political interest in the issue of direct provision.</p><p>  My concern in regard to any of the comments that have been made in front of international committees that there is no evidence of what is happening in direct provision leads me on to the Deputy's second comment.  The reason we do not have what is described as evidence is because there is no redress mechanism.  There is no proper independent mechanism of inspection of what is going on.  There is no proper mechanism of redress for either the children or the parents in direct provision.  The evidential element is difficult.  I do not think it is correct to say that there is no evidence.  We have not put in place a framework to allow those families and children to tell us exactly what is happening in the way that any other parent or family would be afforded in Ireland.  At a fundamental level, a mechanism of redress and at the very least inspection and redress through the Ombudsman is very important.</p></speech>

I am pleased that the Chairman intervened.</p><p>  I have two final questions.  Ms Logan will be aware of the equality budgeting campaign which comprises a group of civic society organisations which campaign that we carry out an equality impact assessment of budgets and Government policy in terms of how they would impact particularly on the most disadvantaged in society.  I would like to get her thoughts on that.</p> <p>Ms Logan outlined in her presentation that the human rights and equality framework and infrastructure on the island were premised on the promise of the Good Friday Agreement.  One of the missing components is a charter of rights across the island and in particular a commitment to amend the Constitution to reflect and enshrine certain additional rights for citizens.  That fits into the campaigns in which others have been involved on issues that have been raised at the Constitutional Convention.  </p><p> I would welcome hearing Ms Logan&rsquo;s thoughts on these two matters.</p></speech>

Some civil society members have already contacted me to let me know about it.  I am a little late for this year&rsquo;s cycle, but the issue was raised.  It was one of the ones discussed at our plenary session last Wednesday and members of the commission are very keen.  Much work has been done internationally and it is possible to human rights and equality proof budgets.  That is certainly something in which the commission will be interested.  The Deputy must forgive me for missing this budget cycle, but he can look to us next year, as the matter has already been raised with me.</p><p>  On joint working across the island of Ireland, we are hosting the next meeting in November.  I have contacted Mr. Les Allamby, the newly appointed Northern Ireland human rights commissioner, and that meeting will take place in November.  I am not yet in a position to provide an update on the charter, but I do know joint work has been ongoing on social inclusion and poverty matters.  Both committees have met Ms Patricia O&rsquo;Brien, the UN representative in Geneva, and there has been ongoing work between the joint committees, but I am not yet up to date on how advanced the work is on the charter.</p></speech>

We have been well served by females in ombudsman roles.  Both Ms Logan and the other Emily, Ms O&rsquo;Reilly, have distinguished themselves in their respective roles as Ombudsman and Ombudsman for Children.  In doing their jobs in the way they did they both managed to highlight the importance of their roles.  I wish Ms Logan well in her new undertaking and I am pleased to hear and see her.  I am sorry that I was not present from the beginning of the meeting, but I have read the presentation.  </p><p>  It is most important that the commission develop links with various Oireachtas committees.  We have a weak parliamentary system, about which we must be honest.  One of the flaws in our democracy is that what Government wants, it gets.  The old line from Gilbert and Sullivan that I always voted at my party&rsquo;s call and never thought of thinking for myself at all is one of the problems in our democratic system.  One of the ways this can be challenged and, I hope, changed over time is by important bodies such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission engaging with various committees, including this one.  That would help to enhance the commission&rsquo;s independence, a very important value that must be jealously guarded, but it would also assist committee members, be they in Government parties or not, to ask important questions of those in power.</p><p>  I very much welcome the question that was asked and the response on the direct provision system.  It must be an issue that should be right up the priority list.  The idea that we can treat people as second-class citizens, as we are doing, on the basis that they are not yet citizens, is simply incompatible with any sane or sensible concept of human rights.  I will ask a question, but I am entitled to make a statement.</p></speech>

I encourage Ms Logan and wish to ask her a couple of questions, apart from the question on the direct provision system.  </p><p>  There is an ongoing debate about prostitution.  I compliment Senator Katherine Zappone on playing a leading role in producing the committee report that is now with the Government.  It is an issue I have taken up also in this term and my first term as a Senator.  The question is how we should look at prostitution and whether, as part of tackling human trafficking, it is necessary for us as a society to criminalise the users of persons involved in prostitution.  That is a human rights issue of first importance.  I do not see how we can have a culture that respects human rights and human dignity when the purchase of one person by another in that way can be tolerated as a mere matter of contract.</p><p>  I accept that Ms Logan cannot take on every issue.  These are very early days for her and she has yet to prepare her programme of work.  I am also aware that she will return to the committee.  Does she see this issue as one that is likely to cross her desk?  There is some evidence of progress.  Some of us met the EU anti-trafficking co-ordinator yesterday.  An input from the commission might very well be of assistance in driving the issue.</p></speech>

Specifically, on the thematic issue raised by Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen, I ask him to bear with me as I do not have an answer for him today.  Obviously, it is an important human rights issue, but I would like to have an opportunity to talk to the commission about the issue before discussing the commission&rsquo;s position on it.  I am happy to respond directly to the Senator on the matter.  However, I am not as free as I was as ombudsman to speak in my own right and I have not yet had an opportunity to discuss the matter.</p></speech>

I think Ms Logan will agree that her job is not just to promote best practice in equality matters or defend the equality of all citizens and, as we have just discussed, people who are perhaps not yet citizens, but, in addition to vindicating human rights and the concept of equality, is there not also a need to create a culture of respect among the public for human rights?  I have particular concerns because in some ways in this country we are becoming a more divided society where all people do not have the same values.  This creates a difficulty in terms of where we locate our sense of what constitutes authentic human rights.  Ms Logan mentioned the Constitution in her presentation as our primary and most authoritative source for what constitutes authentic human rights.  I have a concern that is shared by many about the role of international human rights agencies.  I was extremely unhappy with the behaviour of the UN Human Rights Commission recently and the comments of Sir Nigel Rodley, in particular, about Ireland&rsquo;s abortion laws.</p></speech>

I am not making any charge against any person, nor am I criticising any person for his or her personal conduct, but I am entitled to disagree, for example, with a Government decision, with the action of a politician, a person in a leadership role or a public person who makes a public statement and to criticise that statement.  Perhaps I might put it this way - I am very critical of the recent statements of Sir Nigel Rodley.  He criticised Ireland, for example, for its laws on abortion when these laws proceed from our constitutional understanding of what human rights say about the right to life of every human being from his or her beginnings.  It seems UN agencies are radically in danger of overstepping their remit.</p> <p>I am asking Ms Logan, and hoping for confirmation, that the work of the commission will proceed in respect of what is in the Irish Constitution.  We have major discussions and debates between people of goodwill in society but there are now different points of view about the stage at which a human being should be welcomed into the human community, and their rights as such should be respected.  It is appropriate that I flag my concern that certain international human rights bodies appear to be off on a frolic of their own in such a way as they do not appear to respect our constitutional understanding of authentic human rights.  </p><p> In whatever way is possible I ask that Ms Logan's commission would first respect the diversity of different points of view of people of goodwill in our society on various issues and, second, that there would be as a starting premise respect for the full requirements and provisions of our Constitution and that we would not end up stressing some aspects of the Constitution and wishing that other aspects were not there because they may not suit a majority media consensus at a given time.  I am certainly not asking Ms Logan for a detailed answer to that, nor do I think it is unfair to raise the issue.  It will be bad for the cause of promoting human rights if international agencies are pushing controversial issues in a way that goes far beyond their remit of protecting the accepted, agreed content of human rights.  I hope that Ms Logan's commission at its outset would be determined, whatever the views of individual persons on the commission, to push back against that out of a sense of professional integrity but also respect for the diversity of opinions in our society, and the provisions of our Constitution.</p></speech>

I was watching the live feed and I was struck by the litany of abuses and the lack of accountability in the past of the State for societal and institutional practices that led to the widespread abuse, mistreatment and neglect of women and children.  I am very familiar with that, as Ombudsman for Children.  The session was much more shocking because it was a ten-year appraisal of what had gone on in Ireland.  Generally speaking, people were disturbed, concerned and shocked at the violations of human rights and to have heard it expressed in a UN human rights committee was not just embarrassing.  It was shocking as an Irish citizen, not just as chief commissioner, to hear about our demonstrable history and the way we have treated women and children.</p><p>  I will not specifically comment about that individual but I will say that as a commission I assure Senator Mullen that we respect diversity of opinion in Ireland.  We have diverse opinions as a commission.  We have a healthy level of debate.  The purpose of the commission is to respect and respond to the views expressed in Ireland.  We will not ignore those views but we will adequately represent where there are differences.  My view is that they should be adequately and publicly communicated.</p></speech>

I fully agree with Ms Logan in the context of the UN gathering.  There have been shocking events in every country, not just in Ireland, and this was coming after ten years, but when non-governmental organisations are working hard to present a truthful account of issues and when it is put to the chairperson of a committee, a recognised human rights expert, that embryology textbooks attest to the beginning of human life at conception, and when the response is sneering to the effect that Irish embryology textbooks state that, that is not good enough, and that is what Sir Nigel Rodley said.  I am not asking Ms Logan to jump in with me in making an accusation.  That would not be fair on her, but I ask her to-----</p></speech>

The issues the Senator is raising are extremely important and it may be possible to have a specific meeting on those issues at a later stage.  It is not fair, and the Senator said this, to have a detailed discussion on those issues now.  This was a preliminary engagement with the chief commissioner designate.  We might discuss, and I have been open with everybody here, the possibility of the Senator raising those issues at a later stage, formally and with notice, to allow us have a proper debate on those.</p></speech>

Our job, if we are to respect the fundamental principles of human rights, includes respecting diverse opinions.  I should state to the Senator that in my presentation, I included respect for the constitutional framework.  That is a conversation we will continue to have at the commission but we also respect the international oversight by the United Nations and in this particular circumstance, I recall the Minister for Justice and Equality herself noting how women's rights and children's rights had advanced because of that international oversight.  I think it is possible to achieve a balance.</p></speech>

It is about leading the commission and leading on the strategy.  We are about to enter into the first phase of the strategy and it is about bringing together the two organisations with a single vision as the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  It is about linking internationally, with the Northern Ireland commission and with the four jurisdictions.  We also will have a new Accounting Officer and as a lot of new administrative functions will sit with the director, I think the commissioner is very much externally focused.  I will be looking strategically at what is happening, as well as trying to connect with civil society, trying to keep my finger on the pulse and to know when and what we should be doing as a commission.  As for the way in which I wish to do this, I am reminded of the final meeting I had between the Minister for Justice and Equality and that Roma family.  The Minister offered to the mother of the family in question anything for that individual family and the mother, in a highly dignified fashion, replied she would like Ireland to treat Roma people in ways that are more humane.  That is what I am interested in doing, namely, bringing dignity to communities through the vehicle of human rights and equality.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome from the Commission for Communications Regulation, Mr. Kevin O'Brien, chairperson, Mr. Jeremy Godfrey, commissioner, and Mr. George Merrigan; and Ms Katherine Licken, assistant secretary, Mr. Fergal Mulligan, Mr. Patrick McCarthy and Mr. Patrick Neary from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.<br/>I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that, by virtue of 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise that any submission or opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>I propose that the committee hears from ComReg first and from the departmental officials second.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I invite Mr. Kevin O'Brien of ComReg to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

I am happy to meet with some of the committee's new members for the first time.  As mentioned by the Chairman, I am joined today by my colleagues, Commissioner Jeremy Godfrey and Mr. George Merrigan, who is director of the market framework division in ComReg.  While ComReg obviously is an independent regulatory body with a statutory mandate, we work closely with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I am hopeful that the presence of both the regulator and the Department here today will be helpful to members in discussing developments in the communications market in Ireland.  We are happy to answer any questions members may have about the matters raised and look forward to the discussion.  We have prepared a presentation on the key developments in the broadband and mobile markets and I believe this has been made available to members.  It also will be displayed on the screens.  I had intended to mention later on how the consumer today is using applications that industry develops for us all the time.  Just last night, I downloaded the Houses of the Oireachtas app to my phone and so I believe this is a place that very much is availing of the modern technologies that obviously we wish to bring to the benefit of all consumers.</p><p>  I will begin with an overview of ComReg.  As members are aware, ComReg is the national regulatory authority for the electronic communications and postal sectors and was established in 2002.  We manage Ireland's radio-frequency spectrum and the national numbering resource and we regulate premium rate services and the emergency call answering service, among other activities.  We focus on ensuring that users derive maximum benefit in terms of choice, price and quality and that there is no distortion or restriction in competition in the electronic communications sector.  We seek to ensure that radio spectrum is used efficiently and effectively in meeting both economic and social objectives.  We seek to ensure that efficient investment in infrastructure occurs and that innovation is promoted.  The way in which we regulate is very much defined in European and Irish law, with a significant role played by the European Commission under the directives.  In this regard, ComReg implements evidence-based regulatory measures to stimulate competition and to drive investment in particular areas such as the broadband market.  It is important to note that we do not direct operators in the marketplace and nor do we approve operator budgets.  Rather, we act as a referee to attempt to ensure a fair and competitive marketplace.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.490" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014100800003#E00500"><p>Yes.  The slide on display gives a high-level overview of the communications market today.  We have an active and vibrant communications market.  There is a rapid pace of change with operators continually making available new products and new applications.  On the slide now on display, members can see some of the statistics that capture marketplace trends.  We have a high penetration of mobile phones and smartphones are becoming increasingly popular.  We consume digital content in a myriad of ways.  The marketplace has become much more competitive with approximately 50 active operators.  While basic broadband generally is available to all households, the current step change is in the shift to high-speed mobile and fixed networks.</p><p>  The next slide in some ways represents progress over the past 18 months.  When I spoke to the committee on these issues in March 2013, we were at the beginning of Eircom's roll-out of next-generation access.</p> <p>As of a few weeks ago, Eircom has passed 1 million premises with its high-speed fibre product and it has a target of 1.6 million by the end of 2016.  It is worth mentioning there are approximately 2.3 million addresses in the country.  At this stage, Eircom's stated ambition is to get to 1.6 million with the high-speed service.  The UPC network with which many of the members will be familiar now passes 850,000 houses in the country, with 90% of these being offered high-speed broadband.  The committee will be familiar with the entry of Sky into the marketplace.  A long-time provider of satellite television, Sky now offers retail broadband services.</p><p> BT not longer sells directly into the residential market but it plays an important part in investment behind the scenes where it reuses a lot of the Eircom infrastructure.  That BT platform in Ireland is now offering a service to 65% of households.</p><p> Members will be familiar with the proposed joint venture between Vodafone and ESB, which was the subject of legislation passing through the Oireachtas a couple of months ago.  The stated ambition of Vodafone and ESB is, in the first phase, to provide a service to 500,000 homes outside of the Dublin area and into more regional and rural areas.</p><p> Members will be familiar with ComReg's spectrum auction in late 2012.  The auction raised over &euro;840 million for the Exchequer.  Importantly, there were four winners of spectrum at that stage, resulting in a competitive landscape and allowing those operators to move to start to roll-out 4G mobile networks.  Something significant that was finalised a couple of months ago was the merger of 3 and O2, two of the mobile operators in the marketplace.  It will be interesting over time to see the results of that merger.</p><p> As I mentioned, 4G has commenced.  Already, there are 300,000 4G subscriptions in play in the country.  The final point on this slide relates to Wi-Fi.  How consumers digest broadband is changing.  They are doing it much more on the move, with smart devices.  The growth in public Wi-Fi hotspots reflects this change in how we consume telecommunications services.</p><p> I will hand over to my colleague, Mr. Jeremy Godfrey, to present a number of slides on the fixed-line sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.492" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jeremy Godfrey" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014100800004#F00200"><p>This is my first opportunity to give evidence to the committee.  I thank the committee for that opportunity and assure it that I, like my colleagues, will do my best to assist the committee in its work.</p><p>  The next slide shows how broadband penetration has grown over the years in comparison with the EU average.  As the committee will see, the penetration has grown fairly steadily.  It has now reached 67%, which is a little below the EU average but which is fairly typical.  By comparison, Italy is at 68% and Spain is at 69%.  In fact, one third of the EU member states are within three percentage points of Ireland.  Ireland is a fairly typical marketplace.  In general, penetration is driven by demand rather than by the supply side.  It is highly correlated, for example, with developments such as PC penetration.</p><p>  Another way in which we look at the success and how the market is operating is how competition has delivered improved prices for consumers and an indicator of that is the communications sub-index in the CPI.  That sub-index mostly comprises telecommunications services, both fixed-line and mobile.  One will see that over the past two years - this chart begins in 2012 - the CPI in general has grown by approximately 1% whereas there has been quite a substantial drop in the communications sub-index, which has been driven by the aggressive competition.  As Mr. O'Brien mentioned, there have been new entrants into the broadband market in that time.  There has also been some aggressive competition in the mobile market.  Typically, now we are seeing broadband and voice bundles priced at &euro;40 per month or a little more, with some fairly aggressive offers for new customers such as discounts for the first six months.  The market has worked fairly well in bringing down over the past two years.</p><p>  The next slide shows how competition and investment have led to an increase in broadband speeds: the red block at the top represents the highest speed services - ones with greater than 30 megabits per second, Mbps; the green one represents  between 10 Mbps and 30 Mbps; the blue, between 2 Mbps and 10 Mbps; and the grey ones at the bottom are the ones that are less than 2 Mbps.  The biggest trend one sees here is the growth in the higher-speed service as a percentage of services sold in Ireland.  One will see that the red block took off at the beginning of 2013.  That coincided with the launch of Eircom's next-generation access, NGA, service.  Half of the growth in that percentage since then is due to Eircom and half of it is due to those having higher speeds on the cable network.</p><p>  Mr. O'Brien spoke of how some of the players in the market have their own infrastructure and some use others' infrastructure.  The next slide shows how the different platforms or underlying technologies are being used.  At the bottom, the dark blue box and the golden line just above it are both technologies that make use of the Eircom copper network.  The gold line is the higher-speed NGA version where the copper is combined with fibre - the fibre goes to a cabinet and the copper goes into the premises.  The blue box is the older generation of technology where the copper goes all the way back to the exchange.  The golden one is a higher-speed service; the blue one is a lower speed service.  One is beginning to see how there has been migration in that platform, from the blue to the gold.  At the retail level, the blue and gold services are not only sold by Eircom; they are also sold by other providers.</p><p>  The green box in the middle is the cable network, which is now a high-speed network.  At the top, there are a number of wireless technologies.  I should say that the light blue one, which is described as mobile broadband, represents dongles that one plugs into one's laptop or computer.  Those with smart phones also can get fairly high-speed Internet but those are not included in these figures.  This refers to wireless mobile broadband.  The grey at the top is the fixed wireless operators.</p><p>  Finally, on how the marketplace has become more competitive, one can see that Eircom still remains the market leader, but with considerably less than a 50% market share in broadband.  Vodafone and Sky are both players which largely operate by reselling the Eircom copper network and they have taken quite a lot of share in the past couple of years.  The other big player is UPC on the cable network.  The competition amongst all of those players has both driven investments in higher-speed services and the reductions in prices we noted previously.  With that, I will hand back to Mr. O'Brien to talk about mobile.</p></speech>

There is a greater than 100% penetration rate, which means the vast majority of citizens have a mobile device.  Therefore, there is high take-up.</p><p>  The slide shows stability over a number of quarters.  The blue area represents mobile phones per person.  The red area is where mobile SIMs are used for mobile broadband, which Mr. Godfrey mentioned is an important way in which we get broadband in parts of the country.  Finally, on the top, there is what we call machine-to-machine use of the mobile network.  For example, this could be where a vending machine talks from a remote area to a central point about the amount of stock it contains.  We see an increasing amount of such activity through the mobile networks over time.</p><p>  The next slides captures market share.  There are two interesting points to make here.  First, one will note familiar household names in the large pieces: Vodafone in red; O2 in navy; Eircom, which retails in the mobile space as either Meteor or eMobile, in green; and 3 in black.</p> <p>The tops of the columns depict the smaller market shares held by Tesco Mobile, Lycamobile and certain others.  That category consists of what we call mobile virtual network operators, or MVNOs.  They are companies which do not own networks but rent minutes or capacity from the network owners which they resell.  MVNOs have a small share of the market.  The interesting thing members will see before the final column on the right is the impact of the merger I mentioned.  The navy and black join together as 3 after the merger with a much larger market share.</p><p> The next slide concerns mobile costs for the consumer.  What we have seen over many years now and captured on the chart for the last two quarters is a continuing decline in revenue per customer for the mobile operator.  That means an improvement in price for the consumer.  Pre-pay and post-pay are both set out and the green line in the middle captures the average paid per subscription for mobile services.  While people are using more and more data and somewhat less text and voice, they are paying less in overall terms for the service they get.</p><p> The next slide captures in statistical form one of the behavioural changes of which we are all aware.  On the left, the number of texts per user is set out.  This has declined over time.  On the right, the increased use of data for mobile broadband users on the mobile broadband network is set out in red.  Data use by smartphone users is set out in green.  We are using more and more data which is interesting in terms of consumer behaviour as we move to apps, including communication and social media apps, and away from traditional texting.  This has major implications for operators and the type of networks they must build to meet this need.</p><p> The next slide concerns mobile coverage licence conditions.  I emphasise that it is licence conditions.  We have always observed that operators provide coverage far exceeding the conditions included in their licences.  There is an historic evolution in the slide.  The first line - 2G GSM - relates to the original mobile phone licences from the mid-1990s.  These were voice and text only services and a specific type of technology with certain roll-out requirements.  A number of the licences are no longer in place.  These licences were auctioned in 2012 and are being reused by operators under different conditions.  It is important to note that the 2G network and those 2G licences with roll-out obligations resulted in national networks being built.  The 3G licensing stage and the auction in 2012 took place against a backdrop of networks which were already largely in place.  What occurred was a change within the network.  Coverage is measured as a percentage of population.  Operators have always exceeded their licence conditions in this regard.  ComReg verifies that operators meet their licence conditions and we have done this through drive tests.  We are planning significantly extended drive tests into the future.</p><p> I mentioned earlier that 4G roll-out is happening.  On foot of the 2012 auction, operators have more spectrum and spectrum licences have been liberalised, which is a European requirement.  It gives more space to the operators to use different technologies.  There are a couple of statements there from operators about what they will offer to the consumer with 4G.</p><p> My final slide looks a little bit to the future.  We expect to see continuing aggressive competition.  The week before last, we put out an information note in relation to the early stage of the next potential spectrum award process.  Other spectrum bands are becoming available and we are at an early stage of consultation in relation to what those could be.  What we will see in coming years is ComReg making more spectrum available to the marketplace to allow operators to offer more and more services.  In relation to the merger I mentioned earlier, one of the requirements of the European Commission in approving it was for 3 to make certain commitments to alleviate certain concerns.  One set of commitments 3 made was to allow more virtual mobile operators into the marketplace.  The two operators who have come forward are UPC and Carphone Warehouse.  They are not yet active in the market but they are preparing to enter it as virtual mobile operators.</p><p> Colleagues from the Department will talk to the committee about Government intervention in rural areas, but I note that well-flagged future interventions are planned.  A final comment from ComReg for the purposes of the presentation is to note that we have not really talked today about what we do on consumer empowerment and upholding consumer rights.  It is an important part of our work and we will continue to do it.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleague Mr. Fergal Mulligan, programme director for the national broadband plan, Mr. Patrick McCarthy, who is responsible for the national broadband scheme, and Mr. Patrick Neary, the technical director for the national broadband plan.  I do not intend to dwell on some of the statistics as ComReg has taken us through them very comprehensively.  I have passed around copies of my presentation.</p><p>  By way of scene setting, consumer demand has rocketed not just for broadband services, but for proper high-speed broadband services.  That is the real conundrum and challenge facing industry and Government in terms of investing to meet the demand.  It is useful to be aware of certain statistics to understand why this is so important.  Online consumer spending is approximately &euro;6 billion this year.  There is a statistic - it is another part of our brief - that 70% of that spend is going overseas.  It is something we must address as part of the national digital strategy.  That is why we have a trading-online voucher scheme and other measures to get citizens and businesses online.  The projected online spend by 2020 is &euro;20 billion, which shows where consumers and businesses are moving.</p><p>  There has been huge growth in traffic over all of the networks, which is not just a phenomenon in Ireland, but rather is an international one.  It is being driven in particular by video services over various platforms, not just television.  It is a challenge and Ireland is not alone in having to meet the demand for high-speed services.  Every country faces it.  Many of the online services consume far more bandwidth than was previously the case.  We have surpassed all expectations in terms of the bandwidth being consumed.  There is barely a job anywhere that does not rely on ICT.  Clearly, it is a hugely important area.  It is a key priority for the Government.</p><p>  The national broadband plan has a serious ambition which is that 100% of premises in Ireland will have access to high-speed broadband and that all citizens and businesses can access high-speed services regardless of location.  No matter where a person or business is based, there will be access to future-proofed, high-speed broadband.  We have set a minimum benchmark of 30 Mb to be available to all.  That will be a minimum with an ability to scale up to meet demand as we have seen how the growth in demand has posed particular challenges.</p> <p>The broadband plan aims to achieve that through two means.  The first is commercial investment - helping to accelerate commercial investment and helping the commercial sector to invest more.  As we have seen, ComReg is saying that commercial investment of approximately &euro;2.5 billion is taking place involving the various commercial operators.  When we launched the broadband plan in 2012, we thought the State would have to address approximately 1.3 million of the 2.3 million premises in Ireland.  Thanks to the accelerated investment by industry, the area that the State must address has shrunk by about 50%.  In 2012, Eircom committed to addressing one million premises.  It has now committed to addressing 1.6 million premises, which is very helpful.  There are other operators, which we will come to, who are also investing and making a huge impact.</p><p> The second key commitment, which I am sure members are especially interested in, is the fact the Government has committed to intervene in the balance of those areas where it is-----</p></speech>

There is a typo in the slide: "&euro;2.5 million investment" should read "&euro;2.5 billion investment" by commercial operators.  The Minister has said on numerous occasions that we collectively believe this to be a strong vote of confidence in the Irish consumer and Irish business by the telecommunications sector at a time of particular economic challenge in Ireland.  We spoke about the investment by Eircom, which has increased its commitment from one million to 1.6 million premises by mid-2016.  It passed its millionth premises in September.  We were in Cahersiveen to mark that event.</p><p>  Eircom is reaching parts of rural Ireland that hitherto had very poor quality broadband and are now getting speeds of up to 100 Mb.  Eircom is telling us its roll-out is benchmarked as one of the fastest in Europe and that it is one of the first to use vectoring technology, which allows it to move from 70 Mb as a top speed to 100 Mb as a top speed.  That is making a big impact, and we saw this in black and white in Cahersiveen in September.  UPC has also made great strides.  It was talking in 2012 about more than 700,000 homes having access to speeds of up to 100 Mbps.  That figure is now in or around 730,000 homes which have speeds of up to 200 Mbps, so UPC's speeds are between 100 Mbps and 200 Mbps and it has launched a business package of 500 Mbps.  ESB and Vodafone, as has been alluded to by ComReg, are planning a &euro;450 million investment in fibre to the building, FTTB, with speeds of anywhere between 200 Mbps and 1,000 Mbps.  In phase one, 500,000 premises will be addressed in every county.</p><p>  The spectrum auction is resulting in the roll-out of 4G networks.  One operator told us that, as of yesterday, it has 75% coverage of 4G.  4G offers speeds that are roughly ten times greater than what is available on 3G.  That it is a noticeable change and it will represent quite a considerable change for people living in rural areas in particular, although it has not reached all rural areas.  Vodafone told us that in the roll-out of 4G, what will take it three years in respect of 4G took it 12 years in respect of 3G.  One can see the pace of development has changed very considerably, which is a very welcome development.  Enet, which operates the metropolitan area networks on behalf of the Department, has announced projects of fibre to the home in four regional towns.</p><p>  Wireless operators, who operate throughout Ireland, especially in rural Ireland, are making an impact as well in terms of delivering services in areas where other services are not necessarily providing the product consumers want.</p><p>  We referred to Kerry.  The Telecommunications Industry Federation visited Kerry last month to meet local representatives and talk about the issues of broadband coverage in Kerry.  I suspect it probably could do a similar presentation in every county in Ireland and it probably would be very welcome if the committee was to invite the industry to appear before it to talk about the levels of coverage and the issues it has spoken about.</p></speech>

Eircom intends to pass 42,500 homes and businesses in Kerry by mid-2016.  It has passed somewhere in the region of 24,000 homes with speeds of up to 100 Mb.  ESB Telecoms is investing in the addition of a new fibre ring and its existing network, which will be more than 200 km of fibre optic capacity.  Vodafone has invested &euro;6 million in Kerry in one and a half years and is saying that more than 90% of the population can avail of 4G services.  Clearly, there is more to be done, but a lot is happening and it is important to note those developments and encourage industry to keep going and accelerate even more.</p><p>  The broadband plan is very much a two-pronged approach.  It involves encouraging and supporting industry and committing to a State-led intervention.  The measures we have introduced to support industry include ComReg's multiband spectrum auction, which freed up the spectrum for the 4G roll-out; a ComReg decision on the next generation access arrangement, which allowed Eircom to launch its eFibre services and operators to offer services off that network; and the legislation introduced in March 2014 which will enable ESB to enter the telecommunications market.  We are also taking a series of measures to address barriers to commercial deployment.  Again, local authorities have a key role in this area.  In the process of pulling together the national broadband plan, industry identified barriers to deployment that are affecting coverage.  They included planning barriers, issues with road openings and access to motorways.  We are working with industry and the various State agencies and local authorities to address those barriers and help speed up the deployment.</p><p>  I will take a slight backwards look at where we have invested to date.  The members of the committee will be aware of the metropolitan area networks.  The investment started in 2004.  A total of 88 fibre rings were built covering 94 town and cities in Ireland.  They were developed to increase competition, reduce barriers to entry into the market and reduce costs.  More than 60 operators use the metropolitan area networks today, with more than 1,650 connections to in excess of 600,000 individuals and business.  Most of the operators operating in the Irish market use those fibre rings to improve the quality of service they are offer to customers.  Enet has announced an investment in FTTB in Claremorris, Loughrea, Ardee and Kilkenny.</p><p>  Deputies and Senators will be particularly interested in the national broadband scheme.  It was launched in 2008.  It was a very different world in 2008 where 1 to 2 Mb was considered basic broadband and reasonably adequate.  At that stage, there were large tracts of Ireland which simply had no broadband, and the purpose of the scheme was to increase the coverage area and ensure everyone had at least basic broadband.  What one might call basic broadband then and what one would call it today might be two different things, but people's expectations are far in excess of what one would have been doing in 2008.  We could not have imagined where we would be today in such a short time.  The scheme made basic broadband services available to 238,000 premises in 25 counties.  It has ensured the infrastructure and services, albeit basic services, are in place.  We have been told by 3 that the infrastructure will be used to upgrade to 4G services.  I stress very strongly that there has been no discontinuation of services under the scheme.  3 has assured us it will continue providing services in all the areas, and not only that, it will upgrade the sites to 4G services within three years.</p><p>  As I said, our ambition is for 100% of premises to be covered.  This is infrastructure for the 21st century.</p> <p>This is as important as water, electricity, rail and roads were in previous centuries.  That has been acknowledged by the Government and we have an ambitious programme of investment in high speed broadband so that nobody is left behind.  We did not leave anybody behind with electricity; we should not leave anybody behind with broadband.</p><p> Much has happened since 2012.  The last two years saw an explosion in data demand which was driven by video.  The addressable area for the State has decreased by 50% thanks to accelerated commercial investment, which is good news for the Exchequer.  New state aid guidelines provide that where states invest they must ensure a step change.  That does not mean moving from 2 Mb to 5 Mb; it means that consumers must experience a considerable change in the speed experience.  The guidelines also require fibre to be as near as possible to the end user, although they also note that we must be technology neutral.  We have also introduced legislation to allow the ESB to enter the market.  It is worth noting that new and more effective technologies have come on stream in the last two years, such as the vectoring that Eircom is doing to allow it to provide 100 Mb.  Wireless operators have developed new wireless technologies that are capable of delivering high speeds and other technologies are available to provide better services more cheaply and more effectively.</p><p> We have developed a detailed implementation strategy for the national broadband plan.  Under state guidelines, we are precluded from any area in which the commercial sector is investing, for very good reasons.  This requires us to carry out a comprehensive mapping exercise to define what we mean by next generation broadband and what that means for industry; identify where industry is and where it is going; and measure the gap that the State needs to fill.  That process is coming to a conclusion and we hope to be in a position to publish the maps and carry out a full public consultation towards the end of this year.  That will be a key milestone in this project because it defines, once and for all, the area in which we need to invest.</p><p> In April 2014, the Government announced a more ambitious programme for intervention and, by way of illustrating the scope of ambition for the project, published a list of 1,100 villages across Ireland where we envisaged networks being built in the first instance.  These are, however, just a fraction of what needs to be done and they are not the full picture.  The list allowed people to see that the project was coming to small villages close to them.  Eircom is covering towns with populations of 900 or more, whereas this project deals with settlements with populations of fewer than 900.</p><p> In the past several months we have met with more than 60 operators and stakeholders to discuss their investment plans, expectations and views on the way we are progressing with the plan.  The maps will be published towards the end of this year and next year we intend to publish a detailed implementation strategy which will cover issues including ownership if it is a network build, and whether we own it or the bidder owns it; whether there is one bid or multiple bids; regulatory issues to be considered; and how it should be funded.  Considerable work will be done over the next six months to bring us to a point where, building on the maps, we have a detailed implementation strategy, which we will publish for public consultation with a view to going to tender to provide the services by the end of next year.</p><p> The mapping exercise is complex but it is important to get it right.  Where an operator claims to be providing next generation services we have to be satisfied that it is doing so.  There are multiple operators in this markets, including a myriad of small fixed wireless providers operating across rural Ireland and a number of large providers operating nationally.  We have to examine the market impacts of the proposal because this is a large scale intervention which will impact on the market, probably for generations to come.  We need to consider regulatory, financial, legal, planning and state aid requirements.  A key challenge is that the last 30% is the most difficult to address.  That is why the commercial sector says it cannot go there.  These are the premises outside the towns and villages, on the hillsides and up the by-roads.  Ireland has a population of 33 people per square kilometre compared to 253 people per square kilometre in the UK, most of whom live in towns.  This is a challenge we intend to address, however. </p><p> We must also ensure that whatever service we put in place is future proofed.  By this we mean that 30 Mb is a minimum benchmark.  We do not want 30 Mb to be the ceiling to which a prospective tenderer will aspire but the minimum benchmark so that this is a network build not only for this generation, but also for future generations.  As demand rises, the services should scale up to meet it without having to make further significant investments.  Our motto is do it once and do it right.</p><p> The milestones for 2015 are publishing the mapping towards the end of this year and the outcome of the mapping early next year; publishing the outcome of the public consultation process; publishing the detailed implementation strategy; applying for EU state aid clearance; launching the public procurement process; and ongoing stakeholder engagement.  This plan is important because it will help to attract foreign direct investment; enable education, health and e-government services; support agribusinesses, SMEs, tourism, e-working, smart homes and businesses of the future; and put Ireland to the forefront in terms of our connectivity.</p></speech>

The context of our request for a presentation is the ending of the rural broadband scheme and the investment promised in this area.  We are all aware of the huge increase in demand for broadband services.  As public representatives, every day of the week we deal with businesses which are unable to access broadband services.  This is preventing businesses from expanding in rural Ireland, particularly in areas that need jobs.  The investment has been announced and the larger centres are being catered for in a certain way but we are being told that, from a rural point of view, the rich are getting richer while the poor are getting poorer.</p><p>  As regards mobile phone coverage, anecdotal evidence based on our own use of phones suggests that it has worsened over the last three or four years.  Why has that happened?  There has always been blackspots but they appear to have expanded significantly in recent times.</p><p>  There is no doubt the investment is coming but the problem is that the demand exists now and there is a gap between the present and when the investment will bear fruit.  This is an issue on which we need more clarity.</p></speech>

We hear the same complaints and get parliamentary questions and representations from local representatives.  We are working with stakeholders, including organisations like the IFA, which are telling us directly the difficulties they are experiencing because of a lack of quality broadband.  The purpose of this plan is to address that problem.  In order to implement it properly and to avoid running into difficulties, it will take some time to prepare.</p></speech>

So once new operator data come on stream, we have to add to that.  The maps will be very granular.  People will be able to see right down to their own house as to whether they are in or out, as in whether they are in a black area, which is either an area that is covered commercially or about to be covered commercially, or whether they are in what we call a white area, which is the area subject to the intervention by the State.  That has been a huge technology exercise working with industry to keep updating the maps as the material becomes available.</p></speech>

The step change where we see the market delivering to about 70% of the population with high-speed networks is to be welcomed.  We have had huge progress in the past two years in that regard.  As colleagues in the Department have pointed out, the challenge now is to make those high-speed fixed networks available to everybody in the country.  From ComReg's perspective, we think the Department's ambition is correct.  We believe it is correct to seek to have something future-proofed.  One will always look back and say it was never possible, but one should try to build it once and build it well for the rural areas.</p><p>  Anecdotal is a good way to describe people's comments on mobile coverage.  ComReg gets approximately 30,000 complaints or issues brought to its attention a year.  In the year to date some 17,000 issues by individual consumers have been brought to our attention.  Of those 300 are complaints about mobile coverage.  That is probably slightly more than in previous years, but there are other issues that are bigger for consumers in our experience.  So coverage is certainly a topic.</p><p>  I will make a few comments on what is going on in the marketplace.  As I said earlier, on foot of the auction the operators are now upgrading to 4G; so there are changes to the networks throughout the country.  We have the operators also changing some of their network structures and network share arrangements.  So there is considerable activity at the infrastructural level and that can have implications.</p><p>  There is also some evidence that while a smart phone does amazing things - compared with what we carried out in our pockets ten years ago the utility is fantastic - from time to time questions are raised over smart phones' capacity regarding voice calls.  So there is a technical issue with the hardware which is commented on from time to time.  With 100% of the population expecting to see a voice signal there all the time, 60% with smart phones expecting to see at least a 3G signal there all the time and now 300,000 people expecting to see a 4G signal there all the time, expectations have gone up.  Networks are being built and there is perhaps some limited sense that in certain cases coverage is not what it could be.  However, what we see coming is somewhat limited in that regard.</p></speech>

We mentioned working on barriers to deployment.  One of the work streams the Department has is working with the NRA on access to infrastructure along the motorway - the ability to erect masts and antennae along or adjacent to motorways.  The motorways were built through areas that were previously not built-up areas and would not have had high mobile usage.  That is one of the areas where we believe there is a particular problem and we are working to address it.  Some of the operators are saying - this is where it might be helpful to have them in - that if a person is on a 4G call and moves from a 4G cell to a 2G cell, quite often that call will drop.  It is back to handsets and also the band in which the person is making the call.</p><p>  Operators are saying sometimes there are temporary outages as they start to upgrade areas from 2G or 3G to 4G.  It is correct to say that something has happened all right.  We are aware of some - possibly not all - of it.  It is an issue that would be good to take up with industry also.</p></speech>

Judging by the documentation from the Department, ComReg and everything else, it is a case of "we're working on it".  However, there is a crisis out there and the broadband issue is one of the major concerns.  The witnesses are quite right in some of the language used.  Everybody now requires broadband.</p><p>  Phase one of the joint venture with the ESB is bringing broadband to the provincial towns.  It is coming to a certain level but is not penetrating deeply.  I live four miles from the Kerry border and according to the documentation everything is fine in Cahersiveen, in Kerry and everywhere else.  It is not.  There is a crisis out there - perhaps I am meeting the wrong people.  Regarding Eircom, one of the providers contacted ComReg over a complaint for some of the regions in north County Cork recently and there has been no feedback.  What happens with a complaint when it comes into ComReg if there is a fault from the service provider?  How quickly is that acted upon?  How are complaints dealt with?  What are the outcomes form those complaints?</p><p>  There is huge frustration out there.  Does the broadband scheme announced in April need to get state-aid approval from the EU?  When is that likely to happen?  Why was that not put out there back in April regarding waiting for it?  With all the plans that exist there is desperate frustration.  It is not just me living three and a half hours from here deep in the rural community; some people living only 15 or 20 minutes from O'Connell Street have no broadband coverage.  There are people who are running businesses.  Farms are now more interactive than any other business in this regard.  They are doing a huge amount of their business on line in all aspects of agriculture and they need broadband.</p><p>  I listened to all the presentations and noted the sincerity.  However, the reality is that it is not getting down there to the people who need broadband coverage.  They are quite right in pointing out that in the 1950s ESB coverage was the major issue.  There are so many plans, roll-outs and initiatives.  The service providers - wireless and others - are not getting to the issue.  Certain households are paying huge premiums to get wireless access of some type, and they are still not getting a broadband service.  The witnesses have their plans and their ideas.  I know of a primary school in north County Cork that has no broadband service.  Can the witnesses imagine the disadvantage those kids have when they go into the nearest town to secondary school when they do not have the broadband service?  There is a huge crisis in this regard.  We need to tackle it more seriously.</p><p>  Regarding complaints to ComReg, I know that people in Banteer contacted it sometime in the middle of July and there has been no correspondence back.  What procedure does it follow?  Does it contact the providers?  They have been promised that they would be upgraded.  When will that happen?  I could mention many more communities.  We have to accept that it is not just deep rural communities far away from here; it includes some communities quite close to it.  I have met them all over the country.</p> <p>Over the past 12 months I have had reason to travel throughout the country and the issue of broadband service was raised everywhere.  The Department made an excellent presentation, and I know its aims and ideals, but it simply is not happening.  The people I meet are hugely frustrated about broadband services.  I ask the witnesses to take this on board and come back to me on it.  Will the witnesses clarify the situation with regard to State aid for the scheme announced?  When is it likely to happen?  Will it be a long time down the line?</p></speech>

The service in Cahersiveen has been upgraded and it is great, but if one lives just outside Cahersiveen it is no good to one.  We are critically aware of this, which is why we have a national broadband plan to address all of these issues.</p><p>  The announcement in April was not only with regard to just one scheme.  Another scheme will follow.  The announcement was the first signal of the Government's intent and ambition in the programme by stating it knows for certain it must deal with the 1,100 villages included.  It will be much bigger than this.  We have already been in touch with the Directorate General for competition and met it with regard to state aid.  We expect to obtain state aid approval next year for one scheme for everybody.</p></speech>

We will publish a map with every townland that requires an intervention, which we refer to as white areas, and this will allow every individual to see on the Department's website whether his or her house is included.  This will include everyone outside the border of Caherciveen's footprint.  The European Commission will have to review this and see whether we have done a proper job and ensure no issues arise with regard to state aid and the State intervening where it should not.  We will go through the first stage of the state aid process in November, which is mapping, and in the middle of next year we will go through the second stage, which is telling the European Commission how we will do it.  It needs to know exactly what we plan to do with the State's money for broadband before it gives approval.  At present we are not in a position to go to the Commission with this, and we have the next six months to identify exactly all of the issues outlined by Ms Licken on ownership, governance and how we will identify the priority areas mentioned to ensure jobs are brought to the areas through the availability of high-speed broadband.  We expect to obtain state aid approval at some point in 2015 but I cannot say whether it will be mid-2015 or late 2015.</p></speech>

We are very confident the approach we are taking to the scheme is very much in line with the state aid guidelines so we will not run into issues.  One never knows, but we are very confident we are taking the right approach and that Directorate General for competition will be happy with how we are doing it, which will mean a much speedier state aid approval process.</p></speech>

State intervention is necessary to fill in the gaps in certain areas.  The Deputy spoke about a specific complaint in north Cork.  We receive many complaints per year and we have a process whereby we require the complainant to have taken it up with the operator for a short period of time, and if he or she has not achieved satisfaction ComReg gets involved.  Usually we speak with the operator directly on behalf of the complainant and find a satisfactory solution.  In certain cases there is no solution and ComReg needs to take compliance action.  We are not afraid to do this.  If there are significant outages in a network, or we feel consumers are being charged when they should not be, ComReg takes compliance action which usually gets the right result for the consumer.  We can discuss with the Deputy the specific case after the meeting.  I am sure it is being dealt with but we can update the Deputy on it.</p></speech>

The storms at the beginning of the year meant some networks were down for a while.  ComReg spoke to all of the operators about what they were doing to ensure they were not charging consumers for periods when they had no service.  This was done in a comprehensive way which would have swept up many complaints.  The complaints are just a sample of the problem, so one is also solving the problem for those who have not complained.  This is one example where many complaints were taken together and there was a discussion with the operator and the possibility of compliance action.</p><p>  I can provide the committee with specific data on how we escalate and how many complaints get resolved at various stages of escalation after they come to ComReg.  It is best I do this in writing.</p></speech>

As some of them mentioned they have been before the committee previously.  I am a relatively new member of the committee but I have looked over the proceedings of previous meetings, specifically a meeting which took place two or three years ago when ComReg came before the committee.  A number of issues were raised, specifically with regard to mobile phone coverage.  I am not sure whether the issues were addressed or whether the comments made were taken on board.  A regulator exists to protect the consumer.  HIQA protects patients to ensure not just safe practice but best practice, and this is what we should be looking at here.</p><p>  To focus on mobile phone companies initially, they will say what they want.  The word "mobile" has lost its meaning because it is not mobile any more.  I am a Deputy for the constituency of Meath East which stretches from the top of Cavan down to Clonee in Dublin.  I spent most of the day in my car if I am not here.  I do not know how many times I have almost thrown my phone out the window.  I have a hands-free kit and everything is legal and above board.  The main stakeholders, namely, O2, Vodafone and Meteor, all claim to have 99% population coverage.  Perhaps this is clever use of language but it is false advertising because more than 50% of the population are in the top five or six cities. What the companies should state is what percentage of geographic coverage they have.  A person who signs up to a contract thinks they will have coverage everywhere they go but they do not.  The regulator needs to make this clear.  What are the requirements laid down for the companies?  Evidence-based measures were mentioned.  What measures are taken into account?  Will ComReg consider asking the companies to state their geographic coverage?</p> <p>Consumers do not pay as much as they have done for packages but that does not mean the service should also deteriorate.</p><p> I put a message on Facebook earlier this week indicating that representatives of ComReg and the Department were coming before the committee, that I was annoyed about services in the area and that people could inform me of blackspots in Meath.  It is an understatement to say I got a response.  Some of the areas mentioned were Kilmessan, Culmullin, Kilmainhamwood, Allentown, Rathmolyon, Kilskeer, Robinstown and Ardbraccan.  I have a two-and-a-half page list of areas sent by the people where broadband and mobile services are not satisfactory.  Some people have indicated they have to stand on one leg, touch their nose and put their hand out a window to get reception.  I apologise for sounding smart but the response I received was immense.  People are really frustrated as their expectations are high.  Mobile phone companies are pretending to do the devil and all but they are not providing a proper service. The regulator must ensure people know how to get the right service.</p><p> I will also pick up on the drive tests.  Where are these tests carried out?  Are they on main roads, motorways or regional local roads?  I drop calls all the time, and not just on small roads.  There is a large road network in Meath and many people are sick of listening to us going on about it.  If I leave my office in Kells to go to Dublin on the M3, which is a relatively new motorway, phone calls may drop five or six times during the journey.  There are 20,000 people using that motorway every day, so that should not happen.</p><p> With regard to broadband, I understand there is a mapping process under way, which takes time as the smaller areas must be examined.  The Department has indicated the process will not go where a commercial entity has a presence, but what if the commercial entity is not giving the service it should?  Many of the responses from people on Facebook claimed that when a complaint was made, they heard nothing from the companies.  What will be done for the areas that the Department will not deal with?  I understand there are issues with masts and pylons.  In Meath, the North-South interconnector is causing a major problem.  People want quick, easy, accessible, cheap and high-tech services but they do not want pylons.  How can we bring people on board while giving them the service they want?</p></speech>

She asked if we will go where there is already a substandard or standard broadband service.  In all these rural areas, there is a broadband service of some sort being offered by somebody.  One could go to Meath or Kerry and a broadband company would offer services of 1 Mbps, 2 Mbps or 10 Mbps.  That does not mean the State will not intervene in the area.  As part of the requirements under state aid issues, the main instruction from the European Commission is not to distort competition.  We must ensure that if we intervene in an area, it would see a step change in the service available.  If there is a 3 Mbps service in an area, as the Deputy notes, it may be advertised as "up to 3 Mbps" and be much less at a particular time, such as 8 p.m.  The State would intervene in such an area to ensure those customers and houses in that area would have a minimum of 30 Mbps.  That is the current plan to ensure a network can be built in those areas.</p><p>  One of the challenges is that many companies will not like this because they currently offer a service.  With mapping, we must ensure we understand such issues, as operators may claim to offer a 30 Mbps service.  We will have to do much research and investigation before we can intervene, as the European Commission would take on board the claims of operators.  It will argue that not a penny of taxpayers' money should be spent if a commercial operators offers a service in the area.  There are operators which claim to offer the services and we must investigate that.</p></speech>

We had a "call for inputs" consultation over the summer, indicating the speed, and we sought the thoughts of the industry and stakeholders.  That will inform what the maps look like.  There might be a service in an area but if we do not consider it a next generation broadband service, we would have to intervene in the area.  We must demonstrate that very clearly to the European Commission and we do not take the process lightly.</p></speech>

Our mandate is all about the consumer.  We speak about investment, innovation and networks but we make such considerations in terms of what they mean for the consumer.  That is fundamentally what we are about.  The Deputy made a good point regarding planning and infrastructure, which networks need, and there is no easy way to get away from that.  Different local authorities have taken different approaches at different times, which has an impact on infrastructure roll-out.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned advertising, and the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland deals with any misleading or false advertising.  We have worked with closely with the authority in the past, particularly with regard to the broadband speeds message.  For example, the authority has insisted at different stages that operators should introduce phrases like "up to" when referring to speed and so on.  We are not the relevant authority for advertising but we have loaned some of our technical knowledge to the Advertising Standards Authority of Ireland to help in its work.</p></speech>

When most people see 99% population coverage, they would equate it to coverage of 99% of the country.  It is a misleading term as it does not relate to geography.  Much of the population is in cities and I might make the same assumption about population coverage.</p></speech>

Those conditions are based on population rather than geographical coverage.  If one includes mountainous areas and lakes, big chunks of the country do not have houses in them.  It is a population measure.</p><p>  The Deputy asked how we measure operator performance.  We do drive tests, which is done within a mobile network metric.  A mobile vehicle does the testing, so the experience would be the same as a person moving around the country.  We recognise it is a mobile network when testing.  I mentioned that we are increasing the amount of testing being done.  Previously, we tested for all national primary routes but we are now extending that testing to all national routes.  That is any road in Ireland which is a national primary or secondary route.  That equates to 5,500 km of test route.  Considering this per operator and per network, we do more than 1 million per annum on any one network.</p></speech>

If I travel to Slane and on to Dublin, I might not get coverage for 20 minutes until I get to Slane.  If I go the other way and through Navan, my call would also be dropped five or six times on that route.  Will local and regional roads be included in the testing?  There is no point in stating that overall coverage is being tested if the areas where the main bulk of people live are not included.  They do not live next to a national primary road.</p></speech>

We have set it up to extend it significantly compared with what has been done in the past.  The big question for us in terms of licence obligations is whether we are statistically robust and if the measuring will stand up.  The experts providing the service to us must answer that question, and it must be an accurate measure of the overall characteristic of the network.  We have specified the process to cover all national roads but not anything more at this stage.</p> <p>However, that does not detract from the accuracy of the overall measurement in terms of percentage population coverage.  There is a statistical question in that, but we are safe in dealing with that by not going beyond the national routes at this stage.  We are always open to further consideration of this.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned that a number of areas in her constituency have been brought to her attention in respect of mobile coverage.  We would be happy if she would communicate those to us.  We can take if offline.  We follow up with operators regarding consumer questions and complaints in specific areas.</p></speech>

I understand the frustration that exists.  The witnesses, the Government and I have been telling people that things are going to get better.  Someone mentioned the person who must put their hand out the window to get a signal.  I know someone who must leave his house and drive to a higher point to get a signal.  He is trying to run a business with that.  I have been saying for the past couple of years that things are getting better, that there is a plan in place and so forth.  At this stage it is a question of credibility in me, the Government and the witnesses.  There was a reference to EU state aid approval.  Are we sure of that?  Is it a done deal?  Is the amount agreed or even calculated?  What is plan B if our expectations regarding the amount of that EU state aid approval are not as envisaged?</p><p>  My second point is a suggestion.  We must get that map completed very quickly.  As well as giving information about the white spots, as we publish the maps we must be able to give solid information to people stating when these gaps will be filled.  It must be accurate and we must give that information to people to enable them to plan.</p><p>  One of the witnesses said there are more than 60 operators.  It is quite a crowded workplace.  Do the witnesses have the right to insist that the operators share infrastructure to manage costs?  Do some of them operate in the Six Counties as well as the Twenty-six Counties?  Are we looking at the linkages between the Twenty-six Counties and the Six Counties in this regard?  I understand that the more operators there are, the more competition there is and, therefore, in theory it should bring prices down.  It also adds an element of risk for the continuity of service.  Does the State have any control if someone is not performing or delivering as they should be and must be taken out?</p><p>  I had another question but I cannot remember it at present.</p></speech>

Regarding state aid, the EU does not approve the money for us.  State aid is about the approval to do what one wishes to do.  The money is either Exchequer funding or other funding.  While there might be an EU element in it, the Commission is not concerned with giving us the money but with ensuring that whatever money the State spends is spent correctly and that we do not put people out of business, for example, if Eircom is providing next generation broadband in an area, that we do not encroach on that area where it is not necessary.  That is the purpose.</p><p>  We have a well-worn path to the European Commission regarding state aid.  We have been through it several times.  We are confident in this programme.  We are confident we will get the approval next year and that it will happen in parallel with the planning for the intervention and will not slow it down.</p><p>  There are more than 60 operators.  Some are small and some are very large.  Some of them operate in both Northern Ireland and Ireland.  There are provisions to allow infrastructure sharing and to mandate it in terms of State intervention.  Obviously, we cannot force infrastructure sharing on private operators elsewhere, but we have found that it is happening increasingly in the market.  In the mobile market, for example, they are beginning to share masts instead of having four different types of infrastructure in place.</p></speech>

We are acutely aware that the plan was published in 2012 and it is now 2014.  I can confidently say that we have a very firm quarter-by-quarter plan to see this job done.  That will take us through the majority of 2015 to launch a procurement process.  The procurement process answers many of the Deputy's questions regarding money and operators.  Next year we will know exactly where we are going and how we are going to get there.  When we know that, we can then publish a tender to commercial companies to tender to the Government to build the network we require for rural areas.</p><p>  We will not know how much that will cost the State until the procurement process is over.  Part of my job is to get maximum value for the State where a company or companies build the network with the Government and with their own money as well.  We do not know how much money the other operators are willing to put up to build the network in rural Ireland.  The winner will decide that in terms of how much money they ask from the State to foot the bill for the bit they are not willing to fund.  There are large companies, such as ESB or Eircom, and many small companies that are willing to bid for this network because, ultimately, we are going to subsidise the bit they cannot fund commercially.  There is, therefore, quite a significant prize for a number of telecommunications companies to be part of the award process in which the Government will participate.  Along with that, however, there are many issues in terms of legal challenges that might or might not happen and hurdles we might encounter along the way.  One of our jobs is to stay out of court.  If anyone goes to court, everyone is a loser because the entire process is delayed.</p><p>  We are moving things as quickly as possible.  We are conscious that we must ensure the European Commission is happy with everything we are doing and also that we do not get in trouble with any commercial operators who think what we are doing is illegal.  Those are the two key points we must address over the next 12 months to ensure that when we do it, we do it right, it happens on time and we are not tripped up on the way.</p><p>  We continually meet the European Commission.  There will be a number of meetings between now and November and now and next June to ensure that by the time we seek the official seal of approval, we are confident of getting it.  Again, one of our jobs is to ensure this communication area is open, the dialogue is open, the letter comes through in the end and we are not back to the drawing board.</p></speech>

Within the tender process those companies, which are the experts in building networks, will tell us how they can get from Donegal to Cork and in what order they can address that market.  Someone will have to build a network in every county in Ireland, which will be a logistical challenge in its own right.  At some point in the very near future we will have a fairly high level but reasonably clear window regarding how long this will take, and by the time we award the contract, it will be very precise and will be on a website showing where it is going and the date it will arrive.</p></speech>

I probably forgot it because I am not sure it is something the witnesses must be concerned about, but it is something that must concern the Government.  There would be little point in installing state-of-the-art communications if organs of Government, State and semi-State bodies and schools, hospitals and so forth continue to use record systems that Charles Dickens would work with quite comfortably.  I am aware there is a body examining the use of IT, but it is something the Government must take a great deal more seriously than it does at present.</p></speech>

I welcome the representatives from the Department and ComReg.  I agree with a lot of what has been said up to now, particularly what Deputy Helen McEntee has said.  Both organisations have successfully managed to let the operators off the hook, particularly regarding rural broadband, by focusing on population rather than an area.  There is a glib estimate that 1.7 million people live in rural areas if we accept there is a population of between 37% to 40% of people living in rural areas.  That is a considerable number of rural people.  Reference was made, a while ago, to broadband connectivity from a rural point of view.  Let us look at our population basis.  Ireland has an average of 65 people per km2.  Finland with 18 people per km2 does not have this problem due to planning and has a single point of contact, as far as I know, to deal with the issue.  Ireland, thanks to the legacy of the botched privatisation of Eircom, now has a dogs dinner of a telecommunication set-up.  The State's utility was privatised and now another State utility has been asked to come in, through legislation, to take up the slack.  I refer to the ESB in commercial partnership with an operator.  That is the kernel of the problem.</p><p>  Reference was made to Albert Reynolds, in his recent obituary, to the way he revolutionised the delivery of telephones to rural Ireland in the 1970s.  That is the same sort of issue that we now have.  The difference is that we had a State utility in those days that could be directed to do the work.  We do not have that option now because this country made a bags of privatisation.  Ireland is now ranked just under Algeria for its number of fixed subscription broadband connections, a fact that was stated in a recently published report that I read somewhere.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember where I read the statistic.  Ireland is ranked lower than Algeria for broadband connectivity which tells us the level of interest placed on the technology.  I do not believe people take connectivity seriously.  </p><p>  Reference was made to e-Net, for instance, and its role in the metropolitan area networks, MANs.  I welcome its role and the fact that four towns are being connected.  There are a lot of other towns in the metropolitan area networks.  When will they be reached?  Significant State investment was made into installing MAN cables around the country.  In a lot of cases people have very different views on how effective they are. </p><p>  The witnesses mentioned encouraging people to move to 4G which was going to be the be all and end all.  In a lot of the places that I represent we just like G because we have bogband in a lot of cases.  Dial-up was faster than what we have in some areas because we do not have a service.  It is all well and good identifying places like Caherciveen, which is in Deputy Tom Fleming's constituency.  However, there are places with poor coverage in my constituency due to the planning process where people objected to masts, and everything like that, which they were freely entitled to do.  There are huge areas in my constituency where we are never going to have any real level of coverage unless a genuine attempt is made to look at existing infrastructure such as have fibre optic cables run along defunct railways lines, the existing Eircom infrastructure, and the existing ESB infrastructure being looked at in terms of fibre to the wall.  Such initiatives are really the only way to deliver a service.  </p><p>  Deputy McEntee is quite right.  It is all well and good that 95% of the people have coverage but the remaining 5% probably live in very remote areas.  To be honest, I do not know if there is a more hostile landscape than the tundra located inside the Arctic Circle and I would not equate Deputy Fleming's constituency with the Arctic Circle.  If the Finnish, Swedish and Norwegian governments can provide broadband coverage in the Arctic Circle then why can we not do so here?</p><p>  I have asked the following question here before.  Why do we not have a single agency to roll-out broadband?  We have e-Net, the operators, the Department and ComReg.  It seems that there is a huge amount of talk but very little action.  That situation manifested itself again with another botched announcement during the summer on the ending of the rural broadband scheme.  It was announced as though it was a surprise but it was no surprise because the scheme was due to end.  The announcement could not have been done in a worse way as it sounded like the service was cut.  It was not cut.  It just reached its natural conclusion.</p><p>  I have very little confidence that things will improve anytime soon.  Will the EU State aid rules apply to extending MAN cables further?</p><p>  Every town in the country has been dug up to install water meters.  We seem to have a disjointed approach to installing infrastructure.  When a sewer is laid we seem to be averse to also installing a cable duct at the same time and later the sewer will be dug up again by a private operator, the ESB or whoever.  There is no joined up thinking about infrastructure.  There is a multiplicity of agencies which is evidenced by the fact that so many people have attended here today.  I do not believe this matter, for areas outside of the M50, is being taken seriously. </p></speech>

We share his frustration.  We know there is a problem and we have a programme in place to address it.  We are working full on and flat out on a programme to address the deficit and I mean not in a way where we do a programme but are back here in six years' time saying "Demand has gone through the roof and we have to intervene again."  We want to do it right, we want to do it once and that is what we intend to do.  We will need a little bit of forbearance in order to see the programme through right.  If we end up in court, as Mr. Mulligan has said, at any point in the juncture then everybody will lose.</p><p>  The MANs has been very effective, particularly in some towns.  Something like 85 out of the 88 MANs are now lit and being used.</p><p>  We look at existing infrastructure.  We look at the use of existing infrastructure and produce a database of assets that are available, in the broadband plan, for operators to use.  For example, BG has laid ducting on the Galway-Mayo pipeline route which will be brought into use, probably in the next year or so, for the purposes of putting fibre into it in order to use it.  EirGrid and ESB, while doing transatlantic cables, also lay fibre next to those cables.  The National Roads Authority has put ducts in all of its new road buildings in order to allow fibre to be put in those ducts.  That shows we look at existing infrastructure.  It is very difficult, I guess, where there are road opening issues with other utilities.  There is a Government policy that, where possible, one leaves open the opportunity for telecoms operators to use existing infrastructure.  For example, the OPW makes available publicly-owned buildings for the construction of masts and antennae for mobile broadband and fixed wireless.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy O'Donovan's point about Finland.  Although Finland has 16 people per km2,  which is a lot less than Ireland, the country has a greater concentration of people in villages than we do which makes things slightly easier.  Having said that, we share the ambition of Finland to deal with the problem conclusively.  </p></speech>

We are looking at comparisons, right across Europe and internationally, to see what is best practice, who has done it well, who has not done it so well and what lessons we have learned from the process.

We recently had a meeting with the Leader group from Kilkenny which had visited Finland and it gave us a lot of background information on what Finland had done.  Finland is predominantly community driven.  It is a place where communities come together and stump up a lot of money.  Local businesses and local people there want 100 to 200 megabytes, MB, and are willing to pay for it.  We are saying here that we do not have the microcosm of Finland which has individual communities that put up their hands and said "we are willing to build and fund networks".</p> <p>We do not have that in Ireland yet.  I hope we will have it next year when we say to people that we are willing to fund a certain part of it.  Then, hopefully, the commercial industry and maybe certain communities will be willing to fund certain parts of the network we want to build.  This is all part of the strategy that we need to come up with next week to maximise the use of existing infrastructure, to maximise the network that is built and also to reduce the cost to the State, because this will cost hundreds of millions.  To actually build it will cost much more, but the cost to the State will be hundreds of millions of euro because we expect the commercial sector, and maybe even local communities, to come forward with capital to build this network.</p><p> I can assure the Deputy that there will be no duplication of infrastructure.  We are required under state aid guidelines to avoid this, but it is also a logical step that in rural Ireland where existing infrastructure can be used - for example, a pole or a duct - we would put fibre cabling on or through it.  That is exactly what we will do; we will not allow a company to come in and say it will build all the poles on the other side of the road and put a cable on them.  That will not happen.  These are all the challenges that we have as part of the programme, but we know exactly what we have to do.</p><p> We will only mention a minimum of 30 megabits per second, with many of the premises in rural Ireland getting much more than that.  We cannot and will not say it is fibre-to-the-home, because the technical solution is not up to us.  The technical solution will be up to the companies that build it, with the proviso that it will be monitored every quarter and every year for the duration of the contract, which could be 15 or 20 years.  The companies will be monitored every quarter by the Department or the body that governs the contract to see whether they are meeting these targets.  As with issues of mobile phone coverage or other coverage where people promise up to 30 or 50 Mbps, within our programme, if the State is going to intervene here with money, there will be none of this "up to" this, that and the other.  It will be a nailed-up contract, with the company monitored every quarter to ensure it is delivering the service we are paying for - whether it is outside Cahersiveen, in Meath or in Wicklow - because the State is paying the money.</p><p> At the moment, with commercial operators, it is their money; we cannot say to them what they must deliver.  With mobile network operator licences one can to a point, but the mobile operators actually surpass this standard.  Within Eircom's footprint of fixed broadband we do not tell them they must offer 30 or 50 Mbps; it is a commercial investment.  If Eircom goes to Cahersiveen and offers 50 or 70 Mbps, we are just saying that is a welcome investment and we want them to push that investment as far as they can, so that the State does the rest.</p></speech>

Drive tests, static drive tests and regional drive tests were conducted, going through different areas, to ensure that these speeds were within the contractual specifications.

We are also ranked 43rd in the world for internet speeds, which is really Third World.  I welcome the developments that have been pointed out today in County Kerry, but we must be realistic.  We are starting from a very low base.  There is terrible frustration out there in rural communities.  They are at a severe disadvantage.  We welcome any process that aims to accelerate the delivery of broadband, but we must also take account of the fact that we need a properly managed economy in this country.  In the past we had a huge concentration of all these services.  For instance, the broadband aspect of it contributed to the property and wage bubbles in Dublin, at a huge loss to the rest of the country.  We must avoid such disparities in the future.  It is a necessity in this society at the moment, rather than a privilege, to have an equal spread for everybody.  We are well aware that in regard to broadband there is a fast lane and a slow lane.  Unfortunately, in the west of Ireland we are being left behind and we are falling down dramatically.  It is not by any means a level playing field, so we have a lot of catching up to do.</p><p>  I welcome some of the revelations and the sentiments that have been expressed, but I wonder whether we have grasped this thing by the neck and whether we are moving in a co-ordinated fashion.  As Deputy O'Donovan mentioned, it is mirrored here today by the huge multiplicity of individuals attending from various companies, etc.</p><p>  There is terrible frustration about mobile phone service provision.  In rural County Kerry, I travel a huge constituency, occasionally doing clinics, etc.  As part of our work, naturally, people are trying to contact us throughout the day.  One must often try to explain to them that coverage is bad in a particular area so the call may break down shortly, and that is what inevitably happens.  For people in a private or business capacity, we must address matters in the short term rather than prolonging things in both broadband and phone services, particularly for rural Ireland.  Sometimes we may get little announcements but they are not much comfort to the huge public that is being denied proper services.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.575" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014100800013#P01300"><p>I welcome the representatives from the Department and ComReg and thank them for their presentations.</p><p>  The first thing I would like to touch on refers back to the national broadband scheme.  Some of the presentations were almost apologetic in tone as regards the national broadband scheme, describing results in 2014 from a scheme that was launched in 2008.  I remember when the scheme was launched in 2008.  I was a member of the regional authority.  The scheme was very much a part of the work of the regional authorities in 2008, and many of the criticisms that we have heard throughout the scheme, and certainly at the end of it, were voiced in 2008, including the amount of public money to be spent on the scheme, the outputs achieved and the duplication that results when the scheme comes on top of private competitors offering something without State operation in a district-electoral-division-based national broadband scheme.</p> <p>I think there was &euro;100 million involved in the scheme.  It is hard to know whether we got value for money for that, but we do not want to replicate the mistakes of the old scheme in the new scheme.  The commercial sector is providing more of the coverage, a point highlighted in the presentation, and while we thought initially that the State intervention would involve a certain number of households, that figure has now halved.  This is a trend.  Under the new scheme, we should look at prioritising areas where there is not a hope in hell of the commercial sector providing a service.  The commercial sector can come in the front door and the State coverage can come in the back door.  There is no point in both coming in the same door and treading on each other's toes.  That was a fundamental error in the national broadband scheme.  I have contacted the Department and the Minister's office about the area of west Cork in which I live, the spectacularly beautiful Coomhola valley, where people cannot get any service, even from wireless Internet service providers, and mobile phone coverage is very poor.  Apart from land lines, they are cut off.  I suggest that the State prioritise these areas, because ultimately the State will have to provide a service anyway.  It makes sense to provide it first, and the State will meet the commercial sector at some point in three or four years' time.  There are seven west Cork islands that are very difficult to provide a service to, but the people who live on them are citizens and the State will be obliged to provide the service.  It would be helpful to start there.  Will that approach be taken with respect to those services?</p><p> With regard to more rural areas, the gold standard is a fibre line to the house.  That is very difficult.  The presentation referred to 200 km of fibre lines to be laid by the ESB and Eircom.  That covers from Youghal to where I live in one single line.  That is a very one-dimensional effort and will not suffice.  A more proactive approach using a myriad of different operators could involve opening up the ESB legislation to allow private contractors to tender.  They have been trying to do so but there may be legal issues or an evaluation of how it will work out, and there is not much feedback on how it will happen.  Many of the operators are familiar with the terrain and how broadband can be delivered, whether it is through fibre, VDSL or a satellite service.  The standard can be achieved, but the ESB network must be opened up to corporate competition.</p><p> With regard to ComReg, my focus is on rural areas.  There is no issue in urban areas; the challenge is in rural areas.  Is it being considered as a public service obligation through the Department or another operator to provide the service to the home?  What is the opinion of ComReg on facilitating new entrants, no matter how small, that have delivered a service in rural areas over the past ten years?  They are being frustrated in accessing the ESB and Eircom lines.  Does ComReg have a role in opening up and delivering broadband in a more efficient way, with less State intervention?</p><p> Mobile phone coverage has deteriorated.  I travel from west Cork to Dublin and the biggest black spot is along the motorway.  Testing on the national roads is a welcome initiative and I would expand it to the busier regional roads.  ComReg mentioned 1 million testing points.  Those results should be published in an easy-to-read map format so that the consumer knows where there are mobile phone black spots.  Is there a danger that the investment by companies in mobile phone infrastructure is lagging because the focus is on data and delivering broadband?  If that has been brought to the attention of ComReg, it might inform the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.577" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014100800014#Q00200"><p>I think both parties for their presentations.  I was one of the people who was anxious to see a presentation because there is a crisis in our communications systems across the State.  This includes mobile broadband and mobile telephony through to fixed-line broadband.  While the witnesses have set out their stall and the Department has set out its stall on the difficulty of extending broadband to rural areas, I am not convinced by anything I have heard that it will solve the difficulties.  The difficulty with the proposal the Department intends to proceed with, with the backing of State funding, is that although the indication is that it will be scalable, the pace at which the industry is moving suggests the Department will never be in tune with the thinking in terms of development of technology or the rate at which network operators roll out the new systems as they evolve.  This is not due to a lack of will on behalf of the Department but concerns about competition and the need to interface and receive permission from Europe.  Has any consideration been given to incentivising the industry to provide the coverage we wish to achieve without direct intervention?  A standard could be created that must be adhered to, with some tax incentive or other method so that we are in a position to get these companies to achieve the penetration required.</p><p>  I am disappointed with the ComReg presentation.  Of the 17,000 referrals or concerns raised, only 300 relate to mobile telephony and dropping calls.  I suspect that is more to do with the fact that people do not know about the existence of ComReg or its role at a consumer level.  Are there statistics from network operators on the complaints they receive?  This is the first line in any complaint escalated by a consumer.</p> <p>My experience is that the service has deteriorated very significantly over the past 12 months.  One only need go back to the storms of last winter.  The experience across rural Ireland was that as a result of these storms there seemed to be a very significant deterioration, which was not resolved or addressed.  We all accept that utilities suffer, whether electricity or otherwise, but they manage to get the networks up and running again.  I do not think the same level of remediation work went into the cellular side of things.  I expect ComReg would have a role in that.</p><p> With regard to mobile broadband, does ComReg think the way the State sold access to the radio frequency spectrum acted as a disincentive to companies to achieve the broadest geographical cover?  Deputy O'Donovan was very quick to try to suggest that in a previous era the then Government's sale of Eircom had an impact on the roll-out of broadband and the fixed-line business.  I would accept that because of the large price paid by the company which bought it.  Have we learned nothing from the decisions taken then?  We are still selling spectrum for 4G, tempting and all as it might be to take in close to &euro;800 million, but is that effectively spancelling the people who purchase these licences in any attempt to give the greatest geographical spread?  Would we be better, in selling spectrum, to demand 100% geographical cover in return for the licence to operate rather than eliminating a portion of the geographical area, concentrating on population and taking a once-off windfall payment which, sadly, will get spent?  We will then have large tracts of rural Ireland with no access to mobile broadband and poor mobile phone coverage.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the difficulty of ComReg's job in that it is a major challenge to try to bring the very best in terms of modern communications, whether it be broadband or other technology, to the entire country.  Given the topography of the island and the offshore islands also, it is a huge challenge.  I have always thought that we are only as good as our slowest connection when it comes to broadband.  Unfortunately, parts of the country have a very slow connection, while some parts have no connection at all.  There is a little area near Camp on the Dingle peninsula in County Kerry where, because of the topography, there is no connection and even satellite options are quite poor.  We need to try to find ways to improve this and to ensure people in these communities can get on with living in the 21st century.</p><p>  I have been a Deputy for almost four years and, from time to time, I get complaints from people about the national broadband scheme not working.  In many cases, when these issues were highlighted, the response was not sufficiently positive in trying to tackle the problems, and that will have to improve in the future.</p><p>  I understand a mapping programme is under way to let citizens know what is available to them and, if the service is not available to them, when it will be available.  That needs to be very clear and user-friendly.  People in every part of the country should be able to get the information they need to know what service providers are providing.  They need to know the speeds and in what areas services are provided.  If there is no service provision, they need to know when it will be available and what it will cost.  That should have been done by now.  </p><p>  People have been inundated with announcements and positive news.  I do not want to diminish in any way the positive developments in recent years, but it means nothing to people unless they have a clear idea of what is, what is not and what will be available.  If providers do not toe the line and do not do their job, people need to be confident that they can go to a body that will ensure the provider does what it says on the tin.  ComReg needs to brush up on that, as I do not think it has happened satisfactorily to date.  I would be interested to hear ComReg's views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-08a.580" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin O'Brien" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014100800015#R00300"><p>I will respond to the four points made and maybe try to take some of the common issues together.  Deputy Dooley referred to complaints to ComReg.  We certainly take complaints seriously.  The fact that the figure is 300 out of 17,000 is not in any way to downgrade those complaints, but it gives a sense of the number of issues consumers face and where this fits within that.  We follow up on all of those complaints.</p><p>  We engage in a significant amount of outreach activity.  By going to libraries, having an online presence, using Twitter and having community-level engagement, we try to make people aware of ComReg and what we do.  The more we can do in that regard, the better.</p><p>  Deputy Dooley mentioned how the State sells spectrum.  ComReg's spectrum manager is tasked with that.  There are very detailed European laws around the allocation of spectrum and how it is done.  I refer back to the 2012 option.  While the amount raised for the Exchequer was in the region of &euro;850 million, that mainly reflected a competitive option whereby operators bid against each other.  The reserve prices would have raised approximately half of that figure.  The auction was designed to ensure a competitive outcome, that there would be no distortion in the marketplace on foot of the auction and that operators would be equipped with spectrum to compete with each other.  Pricing was, in some ways, a mechanism to sort out who felt they would most use the spectrum in providing a service to consumers.  I suppose the Deputy contrasted that with other countries which have very significant or onerous coverage obligations rather than running an auction.  The one example often pointed to is that of the UK.  It had one operator with, I think, a 97% coverage obligation in its recent auction, again bearing in mind that its population density is four times that of this country.  What happened in the UK was that operator did not pay.  The UK Government paid that operator to take on the spectrum with that coverage obligation.  There are different choices here in terms of State intervention and whether one wants to pay for coverage levels versus allowing for a competitive marketplace.</p><p>  I turn to the points Deputy Harrington made which were relevant to ComReg.  He mentioned the notion of a public service obligation.  Under the framework, there is really only one thing I would compare with a public service obligation, and that is what we call a universal service obligation, which guarantees a fixed line to every household in Ireland and guarantees that fixed line at the same national price.</p> <p>The European framework considers broadband and mobile services as deliverable by the competitive marketplace.  The situation with mobile, therefore, is that the regulator is charged with managing the spectrum and making the marketplace competitive, but it is up to the operators themselves to compete on price, coverage and so forth.  Hearing from the operators about the challenges they face in getting into specific parts of the country is always worthwhile for this committee.</p><p> Deputy Harrington also referred to opening up networks, which is a core part of the work of ComReg.  Our role is to deal with what can be described as economic bottlenecks, where a company has an element of market dominance.  We deal with that dominance and open the network.  That mainly happens with Eircom.  A large part of ComReg's work over the last decade has been opening up the Eircom network so others can use it.  What one buys from Sky, Vodafone or the IFA generally involves, in the main, their access to the Eircom network, which ultimately benefits the consumer.</p></speech>

In general, where a company has significant market power, we are entitled to intervene.  However, if significant market power, which is a competition law test, is not proven then we are not entitled to intervene.  There are some aspects of the Irish framework that allow operators to seek access from each other and to interconnect with each other.  If operators are blocking each other in that regard - even non-significant market power operators - we do have a refereeing role to play.  Primarily, however, we are only allowed to intervene in situations of economic dominance by one party.<br/>I wish to deal now with points made by Deputies Fleming and Griffin.  I agree with Deputy Griffin's point about topography being very important and the more we understand about what that means for the networks, the better.  Both Deputies referred to broadband costs and speeds and transparency for consumers in that regard.  This is an area in which ComReg has always been very active.  We have a website, <i>www.callcosts.ie</i>, where consumers can input their own spending profile and then find out the full range of packages that are available to them and which offer the best value in their area.  We have been working over the past year on broadband speeds.  We have run a number of tests with samples of users and are planning to use a survey company in the coming months to sample 1,000 users with regard to their broadband speed experience.  We hope to build on that work and bring more information and transparency to consumers on the broadband speed experience.  We see that as core to our activity and will continue to work on it.</p></speech>

Since I started in this job I have seen multiple league tables, but we all know what the problem is in Ireland.  There are parts of rural Ireland which have substandard broadband provision, and we need to address that.  League tables can tell one anything, really.  One table can tell one the exact opposite of another, but we know what the underlying problem is and it is our business to fix it.  On that point, Deputies Fleming and Griffin mentioned frustration, and it is clear that consumers right across Ireland are feeling frustrated.  That frustration will continue until we address the very last premises.  We have an accelerated and ambitious roll-out under way, with &euro;2.5 billion being invested by the commercial sector.  That will probably cover 70% of premises, but until the last 30% of premises are addressed, we will still be here expressing frustration.  Our job is to address that 30%.</p><p>  Mr. O'Brien mentioned the ESB network.  The example in Kerry does not relate to the proposed ESB-Vodafone project.  Commercial State companies such as the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is roll out fibre lines as a matter of course when they are rolling out networks, which all adds to the sum total.  The ESB-Vodafone joint venture proposal, which is different, envisages using the ESB's distribution system to bring fibre to the home.  The plan is not to build just one long stretch of fibre but to have a branch network that can reach individual premises.  </p><p>  Deputies Harrington and Griffin referred to the shortcomings of the national broadband strategy, and we will be analysing the lessons to be learned from the strategy, particularly with regard to speeds.  One of the issues I have highlighted today is that we want this to be scalable.  Two years ago when were talking about 30 Mbps, people said that would be great but in five years' time 30 Mbps would not seem great at all.  The purpose of this project is to deliver a network that is capable of scaling all of the time to meet increasing demand so that we do not have to keep coming back to it.  Having said that, the national broadband scheme delivered a lot of new sites across Ireland that are now 4G-enabled.  There is an element of scalability but the question is whether it can ever meet the demand.  We found with the national broadband scheme that the commercial operators followed the investment of the State.  We cannot stop that from happening.  We engage in a mapping process and commercial operators tell us where they will and will not go.  If they say they will not go somewhere we have to take that at face value and invest there.  If they subsequently follow us in there, that is competition and probably normal competitive behaviour, but we do try to obviate that as far as possible.  </p><p>  In terms of prioritising areas, Deputy Dooley raised the possibility of doing it differently, by way of tax incentives or other measures.  We intend to identify the priority areas over the coming months as we develop the very detailed strategy.  We will be determining whether there are areas that we must prioritise having regard to the fact that this tender will go out to one or more network operators.  It will be a balance between prioritising and how a network gets built.  There are practical ways to build a network, which means we might not necessarily get to a particular area first, but certainly we will try to prioritise certain areas as far as possible.  A tax incentive for the industry is probably another way to do it, but experience tells us that the industry goes to the most commercially attractive areas first, which would not necessarily be the areas we want to prioritise.  Therefore, if we give a tax incentive, we might end up with the attractive areas being cherry-picked first.  I would also imagine that such a tax incentive would be very expensive.  In any event, we expect that it will be one or more seasoned network operators who will roll out the service.  The real trick for us is to set a benchmark speed and an expectation of future-proofing in the contract which will force them to move with the times.  We have seen so many technological developments in the last two years which show that this is possible.  </p><p>  Deputy Griffin asked about mapping, which is designed to be clear and user-friendly.  It will be available online for those of us who have online access.  It will be possible for people to drill down as far as their own house to see if they are in an area that will be served commercially or served by the State.  It is not a map that will deal with the speeds available in an individual house or the costs charged by the service provider.  It is a map which defines those areas that will be commercially served and those that will not, and in the latter case we will intervene.  It will be very clear.  We have run some demonstrations on the mapping and it is very clear.</p></speech>

We will probably publish the maps in the next six to eight weeks.  Once they are published there will be a public consultation, so that if people see that they are mapped as being in a commercially served area but they are not being served commercially, they can let us know.</p> <p>The maps will be iterative right up to the point of going to tender.</p></speech>

Deputy McEntee highlighted the level of representations in her area in the past two days.  The question is whether people know they should direct complaints about mobile phones to ComReg.  Is that message out there?  Obviously when constituents come to our clinics, we suggest they should contact ComReg, but there appears to be an information deficit on the way to make a complaint to ComReg.</p></speech>

On the first point, it has been a long journey for Eircom over the past 15 years, from having nobody else on its network to having many operators using its network.  A very significant area of activity for ComReg during those 15 years has been the engagement with Eircom to make that happen.  We look closely at the key performance indicators of how Eircom treats other operators compared with itself.  In 2013, we would have taken a compliance case at the end of which Eircom paid a penalty because we discovered that some of the indicators for one type of wholesale product were different for Eircom compared with other operators.  We engage with Eircom and look at the facts of the treatment of the other operators using Eircom's network.  Eircom has been improving over time in this respect, but the journey is not yet complete in terms of the wholesale service Eircom provides to other operators.  We hear anecdotal stories but we must look for the evidence and we make our decisions on the facts.</p><p>  In terms of consumer awareness of the role of ComReg, we do a great deal of outreach, and use social media and all the other channels one would expect a public body to use.  We certainly welcome members talking to their constituents or other stakeholders about ComReg and making them aware of what we do.  We have close working relationships with other bodies, for example, the National Consumer Agency, which is a statutory body and the Consumers Association of Ireland, which is a voluntary body.  We work closely with bodies such as these in order that they can talk to people who might raise complaints or issues with them.  We do a great deal in that space and we can always do more.</p></speech>

The issue I wish to raise has been alluded to in some of the responses so far.</p><p>  I live on the west side, just outside the Phoenix Park, and there are days when I have to go outside just to answer my mobile phone, whereas my son is able to answer his phone in the house because he uses a different operator.  My neighbours have made representations to me about the mobile phone service.  I live in a cul-de-sac with 20 homes, all paying the upper rate of property tax, but we receive anything between 0.7 and 0.9 at the very best..  At the top of the street there are thousands of homes built during the 1990s and 2000s and they have high fibre optic cable.  Representation has been made to the service provider, which has communicated that they do not have any plans to work on this cul-de-sac, even though the map on the website indicates that coverage is available in the area.  The service provider is saying the lack of service is due to the copper wiring in the area.  Another service provider which is interested in the business states that it is not economically worthwhile for it to provide fibre optic cable in a street with 20 homes.  I have made representations to the service providers, but I have not obtained an answer to the question as to who is responsible for upgrading this particular blackspot.  Is it the service provider, ComReg or the Department?  I would like to give the people who made representations to me an answer on dealing with the issue in the short, medium and long term.</p></speech>

I spoke about how we manage spectrum.  We have a competitive mobile marketplace.  If we maintain proper levels of competition and if we give the operators more spectrum in a way that ensures they use it competitively, one will, as Senator Coghlan described the situation in his home, have choice.  There will be choice between networks and the ability over time to switch network.  What happens in the marketplace is that operators respond to switching.  If they discover they are losing customers in the areas of poor coverage, they respond and they invest.  In some ways, his story captures a very important point about choice and competition.</p><p>  In respect of the specific area of west Dublin, it would be very useful if Senator Coghlan would give us the specifics after the meeting and we can follow up with relevant operators.  It is the case for the Eircom network that distance from the exchange is important or sometimes there are housing estates with split lines which were built a certain way before broadband.  The UPC network has covered a great many housing estates in west Dublin but there may be specific places where it has not gone.  Perhaps the Senator would share the location and we will follow up on it.</p></speech>

It gets shown up on a map as an area where no one is prepared to go, and therefore the State has to intervene and pay for the service.</p></speech>

I have had many requests from people who have been sent around in circles.  Who is the first point of contact to whom a consumer should go?  Is it ComReg?</p></speech>

As I said during the session, when any consumer comes, we always insist they take it up with the operator for a short period.  Our experience is that the majority of cases will get sorted between the consumer and the operator, but if the consumer is not getting satisfaction from the operator, they should come to us.</p></speech>

When they are not happy with the service from their provider they go to ComReg, but many of them are very unhappy with ComReg's service.  They believe they are not getting adequate responses, and in some cases nothing happens.  I am not exaggerating in that regard.  That is what I hear from people across my constituency including in Templemore recently, Dingle, Camp and all parts of Kerry.  I assume it is the same for other members also.  There has to be a serious improvement in the level of response. There is no point in having a regulator unless something happens, and consumers are very frustrated with the responses they are getting from ComReg.  That service has to improve.  I emphasise that not only must there be greater acknowledgement of the problems, solutions have to be provided for people.</p></speech>

They have been very informative for us, as members representing the people, in terms of what is happening.  I hope that ComReg and the Departmental officials are informed of our perspective in that it is welcome that this is happening but it is not happening soon enough.  I know they are aware of that.  There is an acute problem in rural areas as summed up in the members' contributions.  Another point made was that the targets should be set based on geography or population density, and that priority should be given as soon as possible to areas not on the radar of the commercial companies that would be interested or could afford to do it.</p><p>  The other strong point made by all contributors is that the mobile phone coverage has disimproved.  That is something to which all of us would like to see a solution.  I am summarising, but the presentations were very worthwhile.  </p><p>  We are looking forward to representatives of the industry coming before the committee also, and perhaps the Minister at some stage.  It is about trying to solve this problem together.  It is not about accusing anyone of anything but highlighting the issues that are live for people throughout the country, particularly in rural areas.  Senator Coghlan highlighted the black spots in urban areas also.  We do not have a monopoly in terms of some of those black spots.  I thank all the witnesses.</p></speech>
