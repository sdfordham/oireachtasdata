We are joined by Ms Vicky Phelan, one of the women directly affected by the crisis along with her solicitor, Mr. Cian O'Carroll.  We are also joined by Mr. Stephen Teap, the husband of Irene Teap who has sadly passed away from cervical cancer.  Thank you for agreeing to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts this evening.</p> <p>  The committee has already met officials from the Department of Health, the HSE and the State Claims Agency on the matter and we will resume that side of our discussions tomorrow.  For now, we want to hear from the people directly affected by this crisis.  It will be key in terms of making changes to the system used by the HSE to learn from those who have had direct experience of the system.  That is why their evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts is important.  We want to ensure that the women and families who have been directly impacted - they are very much representative of that group - are treated appropriately especially in respect of access to their information.</p> <p>  We also, of course, want the cancer screening service to continue and for the population to use it.  Notwithstanding the failures that have been highlighted and which have caused such public anger, it is a valuable part of our public health system.  We welcome the changes that are coming in which will make screening a more accurate exercise.</p> <p>  Ms Phelan and Mr. Teap are here today specifically to help the members of the committee deal with the whole question of open disclosure.  That matter has been discussed by the HSE and the State Claims Agency at this committee on several previous occasions.  We know there is a policy position in change.  We have heard from the relevant officials from those institutions in the past and no doubt we will hear from them again.  However, the job of the Committee of Public Accounts is to hear all sides of the story as to how that operates in practice.  Your attendance here today will help us verify what we are hearing from the State institutions on the matter.  That is why your evidence today will be beneficial in bringing about improvements that are ultimately required to be implemented - by legislation if necessary - as soon as possible.</p> <p>  We are in your hands, Vicky and Stephen.  We are here to hear your story.  We are here substantially in listening mode.  We will have some questions afterwards by way of clarification if you are happy to take them.  We are here to listen respectfully to you.  As everyone knows, we public representatives do a lot of talking, but listening is often a far more important aspect of our job.</p> <p>  I will start with you, Vicky.  You might tell us your story in your own words.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-16a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Vicky Phelan" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051600002#C00600"><p>Thank you, Se&aacute;n.  Thank you all for inviting myself and Stephen here today to tell our side of the story.  It is great to be able to have this opportunity for me in particular to set out my experience and to answer any questions you may have at the end of it.  Some of you have already heard my story numerous times at this stage I am sure.  It has been dissected in different parts of the media.  For me today, it is important that you hear my side of the story from me.</p> <p>  I will give my timeline and go back to where this all started for me.  In February 2011, I had my son, Darragh.  I had a smear test about eight weeks after I had Darragh.  Up to and before I had my son I had always had smears from when I was old enough to have them, before CervicalCheck came into being in 2008.  I never missed a smear.  I had always had normal smears.  I had never had an abnormal one.  I had never had any LLETZ procedures or colposcopies so I had nothing to worry about in 2011 when I went for my smear after having my son.  My pregnancy with my son went absolutely perfectly.  I had no bleeding - no issues whatsoever.  It was a textbook pregnancy.</p> <p>  When I went for my smear at the end of May 2011 with my GP, I had nothing to worry about.  When she rang me four weeks later with the result of that smear and told me that it was normal and that I was not due for another smear for another three years, I was not even worried, to be honest.  I was not expecting the result to be anything but normal.  Then in July 2014 I was first diagnosed with cervical cancer.  I actually went in earlier that year - I was not even called for the smear at that point.  I went to my GP in June 2014, complaining of symptoms.  For me, the symptoms were bleeding in between my periods.  It was nothing major, just very light bleeding, but it happened for three months in a row from March until June.  I gave it three months and I decided I would go to my GP and get it checked out, and ask for my smear a little bit early.  I was not due until October that year apparently when I got the letter but I went in a little bit early just to get it checked out.  I still really did not have any worries but there was something at the back of my mind.  I just thought it was a little bit unusual for me.  I was very lucky.  I am a woman who has always had very regular periods.  My sister would have always had very irregular periods and so she would not have gone with the symptoms I had.</p> <p>  My gynaecologist at the time when I was diagnosed told me that the type of symptoms I was complaining about were very minor.  I think that is something that women need to know.  It does not have to be really bad back pain and haemorrhaging that will send you into your doctor for cervical cancer.  I had very mild symptoms and I still got diagnosed, but now I know that my diagnosis goes back prior to 2014.  What made me go to the doctor in the end was that I had a bleed after sex, basically.  That is what made me really think this a little bit more serious than I thought.</p> <p>  When I went for my smear in June, I bled after the nurse took the smear and she said that was a bit unusual because it was quite a lot so she marked it urgent and sent it off to the lab.  That particular smear in 2014 went to MedLab in Sandyford.  The result came back four weeks later.  I got a call when I was in work on 2 July from the GP who told me that the result had come in and she wanted to talk to me.  I asked her, "Can you not talk to me over the phone?  Is it just high-grade changes that involve LLETZ procedure or colposcopy?"  I kind of pushed her, but she would not say anything really over the phone; she asked me to come in.</p> <p>  I went in when I got back after work that week.  She told me that there were very high-grade changes and that she was sending me for an urgent colposcopy so I went for that urgent colposcopy two weeks later on 15 July 2014.  When I had the colposcopy, I went to the colposcopy clinic in Limerick.  Dr. Kevin Hickey is the lead colposcopist there in Limerick.  He checked me and while he was doing the LLETZ procedure - he told me two days later when I got the result that it was cancer - but that day he did not tell me.  Obviously, he had to get the result of the biopsy, but he told me he knew.  He could see the tumour.  I had a 4 cm tumour.</p> <p>  He did the LLETZ procedure and took away 3 cm of a tumour that day.  It was a very uncomfortable procedure.  It was not a nice experience for any woman to go through, to be honest, but I did have an inkling that something was wrong before I left his clinic because he asked me if I was finished having children.  At that stage I was 39 and had two kids.  Luckily enough for me I did not want any more children; I was happy with my two.  I said to him, "Why?  Are you telling me I have cancer?"  He said, "No, no, no - I am sending your sample off for a biopsy.  It's just that these changes are very high grade and we would recommend a hysterectomy."  He had already booked me in for a hysterectomy at that stage.  I was due to come back on 1 August for a hysterectomy.</p> <p>  At that stage alarm bells were ringing and I thought, "Jesus, is it cancer or is it not?"  I was waiting for this call.  That was 15 July.  Two days later he rang me.  He had the results of this biopsy and it was cancer.  He said, "We're going to go ahead with the hysterectomy on 1 August, but in the meantime I'm going to send you for an MRI scan just to be sure there hasn't been any spread outside your cervix."  If the cancer is contained within the cervix, a hysterectomy would sort everything out and there would be no need for chemotherapy or radiation.  I went off for my MRI scan a week later on 22 July.</p><p>On 29 July, I went to Kevin Hickey for the result and my husband came with me to that appointment.  Dr. Hickey told me that unfortunately the cancer was showing up as having spread outside my cervix.  It was highlighted in two lymph nodes.  He said that at that stage, the hysterectomy was off the table because once it spreads outside the cervix, the cancer is graded much higher.  He was then going to send me for a PET scan to see if it had spread any further and whether they might see small metastases.  I went for my PET scan and that came back.  Luckily enough, at that stage, it was only in two lymph nodes.  However, the treatment plan had changed from a hysterectomy, for which I had planned at that stage, to radical chemotherapy and radiation.  I was then passed to the oncology team and put under a radiation oncologist.  For people who do not have cancer, it is hard to understand.  You have all these oncologists and some people are under radiation oncologists while others are under medical oncologists, depending on the primary treatment.  In my case, I was having radiotherapy five days a week and my primary oncologist was a radiation oncologist, namely, Dr. Lorraine Walsh.  If you are attending primarily for chemotherapy, you have a medical oncologist.  Dr. Lorraine Walsh was my lead oncologist and Dr. Kevin Hickey was the gynaecologist.</p><p> I started my treatment at the start of September 2014 and it was five weeks of hell.  That is the only way to describe it.  I was told that type of treatment is not prescribed for everyone.  I am sure Stephen will attest to that as Irene Teap had the same type of treatment.  It is usually prescribed for younger women who can tolerate it.  It is five days a week of radiation and one full day of chemotherapy.  It is all day from 8.30 a.m. until 6.30 p.m. and you are literally green coming out of it.  At the time, I was coming home to two small children.  My son was only three and my daughter was eight.  It was very difficult and I was in bed for two or three days, unable to move and vomiting.  It is a horrible experience and one I would not wish on my worst enemy.  It was very difficult.  On top of the treatment, you have to put up with all of the side effects.  You are very sick and are given tablets to deal with that.  You cannot sleep because you are on steroids to deal with the chemotherapy.  It is a vicious circle.  Luckily, I did not lose my hair.  I like my hair and that was one good thing.  People can call it vanity if they want but it was important to me because my son loved my hair.</p><p> It was a horrendous experience.  The worst part of it, which no one really explains, was to come.  I am sure Stephen will say the same.  It was the brachytherapy, which is internal radiation treatment.  After the five weeks of hell, you get a two-week break and they then bring you in for internal radiation treatment called brachytherapy.  They literally insert an applicator up inside you.  They knock you out for this.  It was three times in a week and a half.  There were three epidurals in a week and a half.  They then irradiate whatever is left up there.  Whatever is left inside you is literally melted together.  I have no ovaries, womb or anything at this stage.  It is all melted together.  That is supposed to cure you.  Those two weeks were the worst part of it.  I had my last treatment on my 40th birthday so that was really lovely.  At the end of it, I had an MRI scan.  They leave you alone for a few months to recover and it takes that long.  I had an MRI scan in February 2015, which showed there was no evidence of disease.  I was relieved.  I cannot say I was delighted because I was still sick and in recovery from the effects of the treatment.  I had no evidence of disease and they told me that was great.</p><p> The next step was to bring me in every three months for two years because I was very high risk.  I was stage 1B2 in terms of my original diagnosis in 2014, but because it had spread outside the cervix into lymph nodes, I was staged much higher in treatment terms.  One is staged like a stage 3 cancer because once it spreads to the lymphatic system, there is no telling where it is going to go.  They have to keep a very close eye.  I was being seen every three months after I finished my treatment.  One goes between the gynaecologist and the oncologist every three months.  I had complained consistently of back pain after I finished my treatment, however.  Looking back at my medical notes, which we got when I went through my court case, I was glad to see that I was not making this up.  I complained consistently at the appointments of back pain but nobody really took much notice.  They just kept saying it was a normal post-radiation effect.  One trusts the doctors and assumes they know what they are doing and, as such, I believed them.  I got to my two-year timeline and I thought that was good.  They say that if you get past the first two years, you are doing really well.  The next step after that is five years when you are really flying it.  Obviously, I have not got to the five years and am back now with terminal cancer.  I barely got to the four years, to be honest.</p><p> When I went back to Kevin Hickey for my check-up in September 2017, I was not feeling any worse than usual.  I was fine and had no reduction in my energy levels.  However, I had this lower back pain.  The previous year, 2016, I booked myself into Barringtons Hospital privately for an ultrasound because I had this tugging sensation in my abdomen.  I thought I had pulled a muscle or something as I was weight-lifting at that stage and trying to get back into exercise.  However, it did not clear up so I went for the ultrasound.  It could not explain the tugging and came back as normal.  As such, I did not think anything of it.  When I went to Kevin Hickey in September, I told him about the usual back pain and this tugging sensation in my abdomen.  I had a pelvic exam, an internal exam, and he did not find anything wrong at that stage.  Everything looked normal as far as he was concerned.  He told me he would send me for a scan just to be sure.  At that stage in September, when I had this meeting, I still did not have cancer.  That is important to bear in mind with what I was told then.</p><p> I went for a scan in November and that was when I found out cancer was back.  Once I went through the whole round of MRIs and PET scans, I found out, just after Christmas, that my cancer was back and was literally up my body.  It is in my paraaortic lymph nodes so it is in a chain all around my aorta.  It is touching off all my organs.  Approximately five lymph nodes are forming a 10 cm mass around my aorta.  All of one's vital organs are around there.  Part of it is touching off my kidneys, my lungs and my liver.  As such, I am not a candidate for surgery or radiation.  All they would offer me was palliative chemotherapy.  I went to see my radiation oncologist on 12 January this year and was told the only option open to me was palliative chemotherapy.  No other treatment was available.  If I took the palliative chemotherapy option, I had 12 months and, if I did not, I had six months to live.  I pushed her to find out the timeframes as she was not willingly going to tell me.  That is where I am at the moment with a terminal diagnosis.</p><p> I will rewind a bit to that meeting I had with Dr. Hickey in September 2017 when he sent me for the scan to find out what I know now, that I have terminal cancer.  He told me then that he wanted to have a chat with me about the audit the cervical screening programme had carried out.  He told me audits are carried out as a matter of routine when women are diagnosed with cervical cancer.  That triggers a check.  When a woman is diagnosed with cervical cancer, CervicalCheck will look at her screening history to see if there was anything which might have been missed.  The smear which diagnosed my cancer was in 2014.  My previous smear was in May 2011, eight weeks after the birth of my son, and I had been told it was normal.  When they retested it, he told me, there was now a query about the smear.  He did not actually say it was cancer at that meeting, he just said there was a query and that I may have had cancer or the starting of cancer, pre-cancer, in 2011.</p><p> When I was in with him in September, I was not in a state of mind to take this any further for two reasons.  First, I was cancer-free as far as I was aware.  That changed two months later.  Second, as a family my husband and I had a lot of medical issues to deal with for my daughter who has a congenital disorder.  Last year, in 2017, she had two full tonic-clonic epileptic seizures in school, which came out of nowhere.  It is a result of her congenital toxoplasmosis diagnosis, which led to a reactivation.  Basically, she has a parasite living at the back of her eye.  I was diagnosed when I was pregnant and she was treated for 12 months when she was a baby.  We went through the early intervention programme.</p><p>She had a stroke effect on her left-hand side.  We had awful problems with her.  She is basically blind in one eye.  She has 70% vision in the other eye but we thought we had dealt with it.  We were very lucky that she was not brain damaged and that she was not blind.  We were very happy that she was doing really well in school.  All of a sudden this kicked off in 2016 but it is all because of puberty.  She has hit puberty, she is nearly 13.  We went back down the whole rollercoaster of medication for her.  She was now on anti-epileptic medication as well as medication to treat her condition.  She nearly lost her eyesight during the summer of 2017.  We had to take her to Moorfields Eye Hospital in the United Kingdom.  She had to have laser surgery.</p><p> I had enough going on at that stage without trying to get my head around knowing that I probably had cancer in 2011 so I did not take it further in September.  When I found out in November I knew at that stage that I was going to have to do something but I waited until I knew what my treatment plan was.  There is all this waiting with scans, going from MRI scans, to PET scans to treatment plans.  When they told me it was terminal I was trying to get my head around it but I was not going to accept a terminal prognosis and went to research other options at that stage.</p><p> By the time I went to see the medical oncologist about options for the palliative chemotherapy I had insisted on a biopsy because I wanted to be 100% sure this was the same cancer I had, not a new cancer because the treatment would be different.  On 19 January I was waiting to have my biopsy.  Myself and my mother were sitting in a treatment room waiting for a bed, as you do with the HSE.  We were there for about four hours.  I was very bored.  I had my file because it had been sent up with me from admissions.  I started looking through it.  I still had not made the decision about whether I was going to go further legally about this missed smear.  As I was going through my file I noticed this letter from CervicalCheck and when I read it I could see the smear test date, 24 May 2011.  This is the report that CervicalCheck sent back to my gynaecologist on the review of my smear from 2011.  The original report stated no abnormality detected, NAD.  The review was query squamous cell carcinoma.</p><p> At that stage alarm bells started ringing in my head because Mr. Hickey was very vague in September and just said that there was a query, that there may have been a question about me having cancer in 2011 but this was in black and white, quite clear, this is cancer.  I then noticed at the end of the page that this was page 2 of two of this report.  I work in administration so I notice these things even though it is tiny, page 2 of two.  I was sitting there asking my mother "Jesus, where's page 1?".  Mam said "Ah sure it's probably just a cover page."  I said, "Well, yeah, but from who, to who and when was it dated?" because at that stage I started questioning when this was sent.  When I thought back to the conversation with Mr. Hickey I assumed that the audit had been carried out just that year, in 2017.  I took a photo of that and anything else in my file and straightaway started researching medical negligence solicitors.  I contacted Cian O'Carroll on 30 January, I was in his office and that was the start of me taking my court case.  We requested files then from CervicalCheck and that was the start of all this coming out.</p><p> I was not affected by the delay in being told that my cancer went back to 2011 and make no mistake about it, I had cancer in 2011 - it was not pre-cancer, it was cancer.  The misdiagnosis in my case, and I know this is not the case for other women in this audit, has cost me my life.  I have got terminal cancer.  I do not believe I am going to die but at the end of the day I am going to have to fight to live for the rest of my life and go from one treatment option to another until I find something to cure me but I should not be in this position at all, if my cancer had been picked up on that smear where there were plenty of cancer cells, there is no question from the expert cytologist on my legal team.  The person looking at my smear sample either was not competent or did not look at it at all because it was full of cancer.  It is not that there was a small little bit of cancer on the slide, it was full of cancer.  I could have been one of the women, like Irene, Stephen's wife, who was not given the chance to find out and was not given the chance to fight.  Stephen is here on her behalf.  At least I am still here to tell the tale.  That is why I am fighting with everything in my being not only to live but to get to the bottom of this because it is a disgrace that we have been put in this position.</p><p> There are three issues, first, open disclosure, which did not happen in my case, too little too late.  Mr. Hickey told me in September 2017 about this audit.  When we got the correspondence back through disclosure we found out that this audit was carried out in October 2014 on my smear.  I was diagnosed in July 2014.  It took a full two years to decide to communicate this to clinicians so it was July 2016 before CervicalCheck communicated my particular case to my gynaecologist.  Then there was 15 months of correspondence between the head of CervicalCheck and my gynaecologist about whose responsibility it was to tell me, 15 months of them deciding "You tell her", "No you tell her" before he finally told me in September 2017.</p><p> People will say it would not have made any difference at that stage because I already had cancer but I know the type of person I am, and Stephen will tell you the same about Irene, I would want to know that.  They should have told me that.  That is my information.  I am the patient.  It is my information that was hidden from me.  I would probably have asked for more scans if I had known "Jesus hang on a minute here, I don't have cancer only since 2014, in fact it's going back a further three years."  We know with cervical cancer the longer you have it the worse your prognosis.  That would have made me be more on top of my gynaecologist and oncologist and look for more scans and maybe it would have been picked up a little sooner and I would not be in this position.  </p><p> Patient safety is another issue.  Why were serious errors highlighted by these audits not treated as patient safety incidents?  In the briefing note sent to the Minister with regard to my case before it went to court, Jerome Coffey gave a written opinion to say that my mistake was not a patient safety issue.  I would like to know does Jerome Coffey, who is the head of the National Cancer Control Programme, NCCP, still believe this to be the case now that there are 18 women dead and 209 women involved.  If it is his view is he the appropriate person to be in charge? </p><p> The other question I have is who are the senior management team who approved this communication strategy which has come out?  We have seen various iterations of it in the press over the past few days.  Who approved this communications strategy and who decided it was okay not only not to tell the clinicians but not to tell the patients?  Why was the HSE more worried about being sued by the labs, such as Quest, than communicating the information on incorrect or misread smears to patients?  That fills the gap for us, to know that in the two years between my audit and the communication I received from my gynaecologist there was a full 12 months of wrangling between the HSE and one of these labs about disclosing information to clinicians never mind patients.  Where is the open disclosure in this instance?  Who stood over these contracts? </p><p> My questions are about open disclosure, patient safety and the labs.  With regard to the labs, who stood over these contracts where patient safety and open disclosure were not considered to be important issues?  When you think of the legal wrangling they were having with these labs where the labs were basically saying their contracts stipulated that the clinicians were not to be told because these were for educational purposes.  The reason my case went to court and I had to give evidence, and it went on for four days, was that the lab was insisting on a confidentiality clause because this was agreed as part of its contract with the HSE.  They are the two big issues I see with the labs.  I want to know who stood over these contracts, if they were reading them.  Patient safety and open disclosure were clearly not included if you read through their stipulations.  How can anyone stand over that and give these people contracts?</p><p> I think that is it.</p><p>If there anything else I need to say, the big thing for me is patient safety.  I am not interested in revenge.  That is not what I am here for.  I want to see accountability and I would like to see a legacy that this will never happen again to any woman, man or child in this country.  This is not just an issue for women.  This is affecting men and children who are without their wives and their mothers.  I never want to see this happen again.  If I do die, I do not want it to be in vain.  I want to make sure that protocols put in place, that there are sanctions for people who make these mistakes and that they are held accountable.  The HSE should be overhauled, and I mean overhauled from the ground up, so that people are held accountable and that this will never happen again in any shape or form.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-16a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Stephen Teap" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051600002#F00300"><p>No worries.  Thanks very much for the opportunity to speak to you all today.  I am here representing my late wife, Irene, who died in July last year at the age of 35.  I am going to begin just over two weeks ago when the HSE first contacted me.  It was Tuesday, 1 May, around 2.30 p.m.  I was in work and got a call from a non-clinical adviser from the HSE.  I was advised that Irene was one of the 17 women at the time whose name had come up in the most recent audit.  We now know that is 18.</p> <p>  I requested there and then - there is obviously no good time to receive a call like that - a face-to-face meeting.  I said I could not have that conversation over the phone.  I did ask what smear tests were being referred to in respect of this audit and I was told 2013 and 2010.  I asked whether they going back as far as 2010.  The woman on the phone pointed out that she was not a clinical adviser and that I needed to come in and meet a consultant next Thursday night at 7.30 p.m.  </p> <p>  I asked on Thursday night why a non-clinical adviser was phoning to tell us this.  Why was it done over the phone?  Why could someone not have called out to my house?  I was told then that a decision had been made that no medical staff were going to make the phone calls because they did not want us asking any questions over the telephone when we received those calls on Tuesday, 1 May.  </p> <p>  On Thursday, 3 May, at 7.30 p.m. we arrived in St. Finbarr's Hospital in Cork.  I was there with Irene's mum and dad.  We were brought into a waiting room within the hospital.  It was just a standard hospital waiting room.  We were passing women on the way out the doors of St. Finbarr's who were upset.  We were brought into an empty waiting room with vending machines in the corners and a television on and just told to wait there.  A girl walked in with her mum and dad.  I would say if she was 30 that would be a lot.  They sat down behind us.  I was trying to get my head around the fact of whether we were actually being brought in with all of the other victims of this audit.  Surely not, that would have been a bit insensitive.  I turned around to that family and asked were they one of the 205 or 206, as it was at the time.  The mother turned to me and said "yes, we are.  And you?".  I said that we were one of the 17.  The daughter of that family just got up then and left the waiting room.  She was clearly upset by that.  </p> <p>  We waited there alongside that family for the next half hour.  Then we were brought in to see the consultant.  He was actually the consultant that Irene was referred to on day one.  There was just him, a nurse and Irene's mum and dad.  We sat down.  Irene's file was open on the table with the CervicalCheck audit on it.  The last time I saw that file was 14 July last year, when we were given Irene's terminal diagnosis in hospital.  It was the same bulky file with all of her information in it.  The consultant started reading through the audit with us.  It was like the piece of paper that was shared a minute ago.  He shared with us that were two sides to the page.  On the left-hand side were the smear tests which Irene had done and the results that her GP would have been given.  On the right-hand side of the page were the results from the audit carried out on these two smear tests.  </p> <p>  Obviously, Irene was led to believe that both of these smear tests came back clean.  The 2010 test said to call back in three years and the 2013 test said to call back in three to five years' time.  When these were audited, it turned out that the 2010 test had pre-cancerous cells in it.  That was the result from the audit.  I asked what this would have triggered if Irene had got these results on day one.  I was told they would have brought her back in, they would have done a physical examination and would have performed a procedure where they would have burned away the cells.  The chances are that would have been it then.  She would have been told to go and live the rest of her life.  As the consultant pointed out to us, 2013 was the most concerning of the two smear tests because this had the beginnings of cancer.  This was the biggest concern because Irene would have been called in straight away.  She would have gone through treatment.  Again, she could have gone on to live a happy life with us - with me and my two boys.  </p> <p>  The question is how did Irene find out she had cancer.  It was not from a screening process.  Irene had two missed opportunities for cancer to be identified in her smear tests.  If it had been identified in either one, she would still be here with us today.  I have heard through different sources and through the media that these smear tests are accurate up to 70% or up to 90%.  They might have 10% inaccuracy.  In Irene's case it was 100% inaccurate.  Two consecutive smear tests were missed and two opportunities to save her life.  </p> <p>  On 21 April 2015, Irene gave birth to our youngest boy, Noah.  Soon after that, Irene noticed she was not recovering from childbirth.  She was still bleeding.  About five or six weeks after Noah was born, she went back into Cork University Maternity Hospital, CUMH, for an examination.  She was given some statistic.  I am not sure what it was but it was on the lines of so many women can bleed up to eight weeks and ten weeks after birth.  It was a rarity but did happen.  At eight weeks, Irene was still bleeding.  She went back to the GP and got an appointment to go back in to see a consultant in CUMH and at 12 weeks she went back in.</p> <p>  At that stage, her cervix was looked at.  There was nothing wrong with it.  It was going along the lines of maybe Irene had some kind of hormone imbalance and that was why she was not recovering from childbirth.  They were going to write her a prescription to balance her hormones.  Essentially that prescription would have been for the contraceptive pill.  Irene was breastfeeding Noah.  He was 12 weeks old.  Irene knew that this medicine that she had been prescribed would dry up her milk supply and she would be unable to feed Noah.  She refused it straight away.  </p> <p>  At 18 weeks, Irene was still bleeding and she went back to her GP.  Her GP referred her back to the CUMH to see the same consultant again.  They decided then to do a dilation and curettage, D and C, procedure because they were thinking that maybe some elements of childbirth still left in her womb might be causing an infection.  They said that if they carried out a D and C that might get rid of the bleeding.  When they were doing the D and C on Irene, the consultant that had seen her at 12 weeks noticed there was a change in her cervix at that point, at 20 weeks.</p><p>They took a sample and tested it.  It was then that Irene was diagnosed with cervical cancer.  At this point, we had a five-month-old boy being breast-fed and a two-and-a-half-year-old boy and Irene needed to start that gruelling treatment that Vicky went into detail about - radiotherapy, chemotherapy and brachytherapy at the end - for eight weeks.  As Vicky mentioned, this is a horrible experience - all of it.  The eight weeks of treatment are gruelling.  The medication and steroids - everything you are put on just makes you sick.  It was a very difficult time for all of us but we are fighters.  Irene led the pack and we just got on with it.  When you have two small children, you have to fight this.  At the end of the eight weeks, you have the horrible wait of three months for that scan to review how this treatment has gone.  That brought us up to around February when we had that scan.  In March, we were told the treatment went very well.  When Irene had been diagnosed that previous September, she had been diagnosed with stage 2 cancer and they told us they would be treating for cure.  So when they told us in March that all that was left was scar tissue from the tumour on her cervix, obviously we were delighted with that.  Everything seemed to be working fine.  </p><p> During the summer, Irene started to get progressively sick again with back pain and pain down her legs.  It go so bad that she was getting up in the middle of the night to take pain medication and to make up water bottles.  When we went back for our appointment in September 2016, after a couple of weeks of testing, Irene was told that she had secondary liver cancer and tumours in her lungs.  They did not discuss treating for cure at this point.  They never said it was terminal.  They just said we would now be living with cancer, that they had a very aggressive chemotherapy treatment plan, that after that, they had plan B and that after that, they had plan C.  Irene went through this chemotherapy involving one day of chemotherapy and going back every three weeks.  You are floored in the first week of this chemotherapy.  In the second week, you are coming back together and in the third week, you are up and running again.  Then you get slammed again with another dose of this chemotherapy and you are wiped out again.  It is just a continuous cycle for 12 weeks.  After a second dose of chemotherapy, Irene lost all her hair.  She said "I am now a sick person" because, as Vicky said, you do not lose your hair the first time and can still blend into the crowd and nobody knows what is going on but this time, as she said, people were giving up their seats for her and opening doors.  You are now sick.  This treatment lasted until January.  We had a scan that said the tumour on her liver was shrinking.  Less than a month later, we had another scan saying it was growing again.  Irene spent every second or third week in hospital in early 2017 - infection after infection after infection - up to the point of 14 July 2017 when they sat us down and said there was no more they could do for us and were stopping all treatment.  When we asked how long we had, they said a few short weeks and that they hoped we would get to the end of the summer.  Irene's only ambition there and then was to see our eldest guy start primary school at the end of August.  Irene only lasted a week and a half later.  She passed away on 26 July.  </p><p> The HSE received the audit results on 3 July last year - just over three weeks before Irene died.  It decided there and then that it was not going to share that information with Irene or me.  At that meeting on the evening of Thursday, 3 May, I was told a team of counsel made the conscious decision not to share the information with Irene or me.  They thought she was a bit too sick.  This was 3 July.  She did not get her terminal diagnosis until 14 July.  They did not know if she was going to live for three weeks.  They did not have a clue at that point.  We told him that this was not his decision to make - how dare he?  If he knew Irene at all, he would know that if she had three minutes to live and this information landed across her desk, she would want to know exactly what that was about.  The next morning, 12 hours later, I got another call from this consultant.  He said to me that he gave me misleading information at our meeting the previous night.  He did not do it deliberately but he wanted to correct it.  He said that the counsel - the team of people he met - did not actually tell him not to pass on the information to Irene or me and that they actually said that it was about open disclosure and told him to contact CervicalCheck.  Somewhere within the 12 hours, this consultant was clearly reminded of the company line and made a conscious effort to get in touch with me quickly just to correct exactly what he said.  When I asked him what happened when he did contact CervicalCheck, he said he did not know, which was odd because you would think that would be the first question I was going to ask.  He did not have that information for me.  I politely reminded him that this was a big part of the puzzle and that I wanted to know exactly what conversation he had.  I said that he was told about open disclosure and then told to contact CervicalCheck so I asked the conversation was.  I told him he needed to find this out to which I got the smart response that he would have a look and that he needed to trawl back through 2,000 or 3,000 emails but that he would have a look.  I told him that he had better do that and that I wanted to know that.  He replied that it may have been a verbal communication and that he did not know 100%.  I think we can all take it that I will probably never find out the answer to that question.  That is a problem.  </p><p> This lack of open disclosure within the HSE is clearly a problem.  The communication between senior management and consultants is an issue.  Communication between senior management and the Department of Health is an issue.  From what we have learned in the past 24 hours, communication between the Department of Health and the Government is clearly an issue.  While it exists with a fantastic nursing staff and the majority of consultants - I have to give credit to the nursing staff who took really good care of my wife - clearly patient care is diluted up the ladder and the element of protect and deny is introduced.  That is basically what we have seen in the past few weeks when it comes to all of this communication or the lack of communication we are being fed, the lack of communication with Irene, the lack of communication with me and the lack of communication with her GP.  I had to inform Irene's GP that she was one of the 17 women who were audited.  I had to inform Irene's GP about the results of the audit.  Irene's GP is not only her GP but the GP of her three sisters, her mother and father, my two boys and my niece and nephew.  He is the family doctor and he was never consulted about any part of this.  I have copies of the smear tests he performed in his clinic and they could not even give him the audited results of the tests he conducted.  Information was clearly withheld from him and it looks like information was clearly withheld from the Ministers.  We have to take them at their word that they did not receive this information.</p><p> It seems that the people in these senior positions who knew about all of these memos in 2016 are the same people in senior positions today who need to be questioned when it comes to these inquiries.  I do not understand how they can sit in these positions while inquiries are ongoing.  We have dead women here.  We have women who have been given terminal diagnoses - death sentences.  We are talking about 209 women, of whom 18 are dead.  We still do not know how many of the rest have a terminal diagnosis, how many are still going through treatment and how many have finished treatment and are lucky enough to be out the other side.  It is how many weeks later and they still cannot give us this information.</p><p>We have two people gone but more need to go now.  They need to step aside.  They have to get out of the way so these inquiries can take place.  Right now, they know where all the answers to the questions lie.  They know the places not to look or to keep us away from and they are clearly sitting on this information, preventing us from getting it.  It is obvious that this is going on from the drip-drip feed that Oireachtas Members seem to be getting at these committee meetings.  I welcome the Scally inquiry.  It is important that we have a third party inquiry on this.  He needs to speak to the same people that are sitting in these senior positions who are deliberately covering up information.  If someone knows something about another department and mistakes are being made, and that information is not being passed on, that is a cover-up.  If other people are involved in not sharing that information, they are now part of that cover-up too, yet they all remain in senior positions in the HSE.  That is a huge concern of mine.</p><p> Last Thursday, when I left the meeting, I left with nothing.  Nothing was offered.  There were no support services, nothing for me to help my kids through their bereavement.  Oscar was four when his mum died and Noah was two.  They are five and three today.  Ten to 15 years from now, they will be reading all about this in the papers and they will look at what their dad was doing here today.  What is there to help me prepare them for that?  What is there when they see two missed opportunities to save their mother's life?  How do I communicate that with them?</p><p> I am one of now 17 families.  There are close to 200 women.  We do not know how many are terminal and how many are going through cancer treatment.  When one is going through that horrible process of treatment for cancer, one's mental attitude towards that treatment is very important.  How do you think these women feel in the last couple of weeks after having these meetings and being told that a few smear tests were missed that could have saved their lives?  Maybe they would not have to go through cancer treatment, maybe they are not terminal and maybe they do not have to die.</p><p> On top of that, they have to fight for their life while having to process that information.  When the HSE informed them of this audit, it just sent them back out the door with no support services.  There was absolutely nothing but a "Goodbye, there you go".  This is why, from the beginning, I decided to share Irene's story because that is exactly what she would have wanted.  If she got this information three weeks or three minutes before she died, we would all know about that story.  She would have been shouting the same thing that I am shouting.  The support services took almost a week to be put in place from the second I started roaring and shouting about it.  We heard the announcement last Friday of all these support services, which I welcome.  They are great.  The problem is that I still have not heard anything.  I know you have not heard anything.  I do not think anybody has heard anything.  Will this come in for us in 2020 or 2021?  Those support services should have been in place two or three weeks ago when we were sitting with the HSE, and they were not.  It is another example of the lack of patient care within the HSE.</p><p> The HSE needs to be reformed, particularly at the senior level.  It needs to start looking at how it is run from the ground up and the staff that are there today, looking after patients.  Patient care needs to be put in the backbone of the HSE, right up to senior management.  Communication is key.</p></speech>

Mandatory disclosure is worthless unless sanctions are put in place to coincide with that.  That is sanctions on the individual.  One cannot tell someone to do something and then have nothing happen if they do not.  It will not work.  There need to be serious sanctions in place for this.  With regard to any reform in the HSE, legislation needs to be put in place to coincide with it to make it work.  I agree with all of Vicky's points about what needs to be done.</p></speech>

We are grateful to listen to the harrowing stories.  It is a deeply humbling experience for me and for most of us.  We are here to listen and we have listened to the failures of the State and State institutions that resulted in the needless deaths of women.  You are here, helping the Oireachtas and Government make sure that is right for the future.  Everything will have been in vain if there are no fundamental changes for the future.  Some good may come out of the harrowing stories if real improvements are made and situations like this never occur again.

I will take three at a time to make it easy.  They may have comments to make or some questions to put.

Thank you for coming here and sharing your stories with us.  As you know, we had representatives of the HSE and Department before us last week.  We will have more representatives before us tomorrow.  Some of those people that Stephen spoke about that knew about the strategy, the memo and the cover-up which has been referred to, will be here tomorrow.  We will ask the hard questions on your behalf, on Vicky's behalf and all of the women's behalf, and of those husbands and partners who are suffering.</p> <p>  Any of you can answer this question but I know that Vicky's solicitor has very publicly said that he believes that there is a cover-up in the main centres relating to the lack of open disclosure, the fact that discretion was given to consultants and, in the cases of women who passed away, the information was not passed on to their next of kin.  We heard Stephen's story.  If Mr. Cian O'Carroll is in a position to address the committee, he might expand on that a bit more with regard to his view of a cover-up and what exactly he meant by that.  He might also, if he can - and Vicky or Stephen can respond to this too - talk to me about how people were selected for audit in the first place.  Given the documentation that emerged yesterday, does Mr. O'Carroll feel there were any discrepancies or issues relating to how people were selected for the audit?</p> <p>  I am looking at a questions and answers document that was prepared for the Department and the HSE.  It talks about the 1,120 cases that were part of the audit by December 2015.  It says that 317 cases, which is 28.3% of the total cases, were flagged for further review.  In most, though not all, of these reviewed cases, there may have been an opportunity for earlier intervention.  This includes pre-cancerous cell changes that were not detected.  Those for whom this resulted in a delay in diagnosis of treatment are most likely dead.</p><p>I want to ask Stephen if that is what happened to Irene and whether she is in that category.  Vicky, how is that different from your own experience?  You said yours potentially might have been an outlier, or was it that it was an outlier in terms of how your smear test was so badly misread?</p><p> In terms of Mr. O'Carroll's work, did he discover any problems with the lab itself?  Vicky put it extremely well, better than anybody could, that the issues are open disclosure and patient safety.  I find it incredible that the HSE and the Department are still saying there are no patient safety issues when we clearly heard what happened in your case.  It is beyond words that they still say that, but you also talked about the labs.  When you talked about the labs being an issue, are you talking about the performance of the labs, issues in relation to the labs and the relationship between the labs possibly preventing information getting to patients because of contractual issues?  Is that the issue?  You might be able to come back on some of those points.</p><p> Those are the questions I have.  I will finish by saying that I think everybody admires your bravery and your courage, Vicky, as well as yours, Stephen.  I genuinely wish you both well.  It is sad you have had to come here and tell your story but I think it is worthwhile for us in view of our preparations for tomorrow.</p></speech>

I am ashamed that, as the body that is supposed to hold all of these organisations to account, we have all spectacularly failed you, and for that I am personally sorry.  I have two questions, one for each, although you covered it, Stephen.  Normally, we call people "Mister" and so on in here but if you do not mind, we can be more informal.  Given the work that is under way, and you did touch on this, you may want to add something in terms of the Scally scoping report.  We also have the indication of a commission of investigation after that and the indication of a peer review, as well as the work of the health committee and this committee.  In terms of accountability, if there are any tangible actions both of you would like to see now, you might expand on that.  Clearly, you have highlighted an awful lot that, as Deputy Cullinane said, will feed into our questioning tomorrow, and we will do that.</p> <p>  The other comment is that the principles of care that underpin actions in Ireland are from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists following the report in 2011.  The first of them is that the woman must be at the centre of her own care.  Have you any comment on that, give it is supposed to be principle No. 1?</p> <p>  Very finally and quite specifically, and Deputy Cullinane touched on this, you mentioned that MedLab was the lab where your test was.  We know from its confirmation and a statement on Sunday that it subcontracted to a third-party laboratory, and we will be asking on contractual issues about that tomorrow.  I know from speaking to some GPs that all the results coming back to them were signed by an Irish-registered pathologist.  I wondered if there was any information you had as to whether your tests were done on-site there, or were they a part of the backlog situation where MedLab subcontracted this work.  If it was a subcontracted test, were you or your physicians informed of that in your own research through the legal process or otherwise?  If so, is it the case that the Irish-registered pathologist based in Sandyford is transcribing results from another lab and just signing off on them, taking them as correct, or is that person looking under a microscope to say, "Yes, I concur with that", and then signing off on them?  That is something that would be useful for us to know in terms of the process.</p> <p>  Again, I want to thank you very much for being here today and for all you have done.</p></speech>

We have had the HSE in at this committee routinely on various issues.  Very often, it is about something much more academic and we are trying to understand something and humanise it.  Unfortunately, we tend to get change in this country by people putting themselves forward, putting themselves out there in a way that really should not have to happen.  Whether it is the Garda, the health service or otherwise, that seems to be what is important in terms of triggering public understanding of the failure of our system.  That is why it is so important that you have both gone so public in a situation that is so personal to yourselves.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  I know there are a lot of us here and I do not want to delay you.  One thing jumped out at me, Vicky, in regard to one of the points you made, and that was about the contractual obligation between the HSE and the lab.  Did the contract actually have a requirement for confidentiality?  Were there other things, as in the court, that jumped out to you, and that may well be more nuanced, but that would be helpful for us in exploring how we make changes to the system?  Stephen, I have to say the way you have been told, and the way this has been handled, has compounded the problem or - I should not call it a problem - has compounded the crisis.  The situation where you were brought in and told in such an insensitive way, plus the fact the supports are not there for you, is something of which we have to take very serious note because that is as much to do with the care as everything else that has transpired before this.  Thank you for sharing that because it is that understanding of putting the patient at the centre that is central to what we should be doing.</p></speech>

Vicky and Stephen, you might respond in any way you can.

It is an emotive term but I think it is fair to say that, from the documentation, you can clearly see there was a co-ordinated and a premeditated plan to deny patients the information, although not in total.  The documentation suggests that it was envisaged that some patients would be told of the audit, albeit quite late in the day.  Nobody was to be told before the middle of 2016 and, at that point, people were to be selected.  It is the criteria for their selection that causes a major problem for disclosure.  We see from the documentation that doctors were told not only could they be selective with their patients, but if the woman had died, they were not to tell her family and it was simply to be put in the file.  That appears in a number of documents and it turns up in the CervicalCheck preprinted leaflet that was sent out to the clinicians telling them how to deal with the audit in July 2016.  More than 120 pages of documents were released yesterday by the Department of Health.</p><p>I have not considered them in detail, but I did notice that there is a set of precedent letters towards the back of that bundle which are to be used by CervicalCheck.  Included in that bundle is a letter to clinicians.  The letter includes a line about open disclosure but beside that, in the Microsoft Word format, is a comment which tells the person reading the precedent document that in cases where a woman has died this sentence is to be deleted from the letter and there is to be no reference to open disclosure.  Therefore, we see that there is a thread moving through documents which suggests that there was a premeditated and orchestrated plan to keep this information from patients who had died in particular.</p><p> Furthermore, in the correspondence between CervicalCheck's Professor Flannelly and Vicky's consultant gynaecologist, there is a dialogue going on over a period of more than a year - 15 months - in which two clinicians are talking to one another and in which CervicalCheck's clinical director is saying that she does not believe that all these women should be told.  At one point she describes three of the ten patients who were on that list as meeting her clinical criteria for being told, yet we know that all of those women had suffered some degree of delay in the treatment of their cancer.  While I cannot comment in any meaningful way about the degree to which they were all affected by that delay, from the reports of this audit I have seen to date - and the records have been slow in coming through - four out of four women have been significantly affected.  It is reasonable at least to say that doctors looking at those records must have known that there had been a very significant clinical effect on women.</p></speech>

Did we know where the smear tests were screened?  Halfway down the page of Irene's 2010 result it said that the test had been processed in Austin, Texas.  There was no reference to where the test had been processed in the 2013 result.  While it is on the same headed paper, there is no information on the most recent result.  Was Irene's case flagged for further review?  The answer is that I do not know.  All we were told was the outcome of the audit.  I did ask what the process for the audit was.  I asked the consultant that.  He did not know the answer but, thankfully, there was a nurse in the room who did.  She could only speak on behalf of the clinic in St. Finbarr's.  She explained the process there to me.  Irene did not attend that clinic but it is where the tests for cervical cancer are done.  She said that once a month a list is compiled of the names of all the women who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer and it is sent off to the register.  It is there that the audit process begins.  I asked how long it takes for an audit to take place.  The nurse in question said that she had the exact same question earlier that week and had made a phone call to CervicalCheck which said that it would be six or seven months before an audit would be returned.  Irene's audit took 22 months and I believe Vicky's took nearly----</p></speech>

With the memos last week we discovered that this was clearly the case with one of the laboratories in particular.  That answered a question for us because we were wondering why there had been this delay of two years.  My audit was triggered in October 2014 and then in July 2016, almost two years later, CervicalCheck contacted my gynaecologist to inform him that I was one of these cases and that he was to use his judgment on whether to inform me.  It took another 15 months, until September 2017, before he actually did tell me.  We were wondering what the delay had been.  Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly was interviewed on "Morning Ireland" and that interview answered one of the questions because she said it took them a while to come up with this communications strategy.  That strategy had to be decided on and we were asking "Jesus, could that take two years?"  That was one explanation.  Then when these memos came out last week they showed that the laboratory was thinking about suing the HSE because it did not want the clinicians to know, let alone the patients.  How long did that legal wrangling between the HSE and the laboratory go on for?  My question is where was the patient in all of this?  Nobody really cared about whether the patient should be told.  It was about the legal wrangling between the HSE and the laboratory.</p></speech>

Perhaps the committee members could be mindful in their questioning that this can be used as a major distraction.  I cannot speak about Irene's medical records but what happened to Vicky Phelan, and what I have seen in other situations, is that an error occurred in the reading of the original smear which was of an unacceptable magnitude.  While technically it may be correct to call that a false negative, if one simply rests on it as a false negative and a statistical occurrence one closes one's mind to the necessary investigation of the cause of that failure.</p> <p>  It would be beneficial for patient safety if there was some questioning of the relevant key witnesses as to why clinical directors and other clinical people involved in CervicalCheck and the Department of Health appeared to have closed their minds to the magnitude of the errors which were coming back to them through the audit.  They were largely doctors and it must have been quite evident to them, from these 209 cases which involved a significant delay in the commencement of treatment, that there might have been someone in those laboratories who was simply incompetent or that there might have been other factors causing this.  The fact that only a month ago a memo from the senior medical people involved in cancer screening in Ireland to the Minister for Health stated that an error of that magnitude in Vicky Phelan's case was not a patient safety incident confirms that they have never investigated the error in her case.  In the absence of investigation, clearly there is no intention to learn.</p></speech>

The strength that both of the witnesses have shown is frankly incredible.  Vicky does not live that far away from me even though we live in different counties.  We will be shouting against one another on Sunday when Limerick plays Tipperary.  With regard to the way in which Stephen has told his story in such a short space of time, because he has not known his information for that long, and the strength that he has shown in being able to tell us all so quickly, the mix between his comments and Vicky's is very important.</p><p>It is a dynamic in itself.</p><p> I very much take on board what Cian said in respect of those questions because he is right.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Health and of this committee, and these guys have been in front of us a great deal.  They do not specifically accept what you are saying and they will have to be challenged.  We are going to have to go down the path of, almost, looking at individual cases in order to get those answers because they are generalised.</p><p> I have a couple of comments and questions for Vicky and Stephen.  They can answer in whichever way they want.  I was very much taken by what Stephen said about what the consultant told him and what the consultant said when Stephen challenged him.  Let me just say that, as far as I am concerned, and with regard to what we all do or try to do, he is entitled to get the answer to that question and we will not leave a stone unturned.  Stephen is entitled to know what happened and he is entitled to know what was said during that phone call because it was not that long ago.  It is endemic in the context of the cultural issues and other issues we have here, which come right up to this very bloody day.  We have to find out.  I think about open disclosure and all of the documents with which I and other colleagues were presented yesterday.  I counted 35 people between the Department and the HSE-----</p></speech>

Come on, open disclosure is a joke.  I look at the letters that were drafted.  Cian made reference to them earlier.  There was that awful commentary to the effect that in cases where the woman died, the result should simply be recorded.  I think of Irene and what was going on until Vicky blew the lid off it and then she was communicated with.  Then they had to tell her.  That is what was going on.  We can join up the dots here.  That is what was going on.  Vicky created the environment whereby they had to tell her and they have not even told her everything yet.  It is a scandal of the highest order in the history of the State.  We can join up the dots.  If we look at these documents, we can join them up.  I have done out a timeline and we can join it all up.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  I am with Stephen and Vicky on this, not because of the individuals involved - I actually know some of these people and some I do not - but because I agree that this is a live issue.  We are playing with people's lives.  Individuals who have made decisions about people's lives are still in position.  Stephen has been very articulate in saying that people who are in position should step aside while the investigation is going on and Dr. Scally is doing his work.  Is that something that Vicky agrees with 100%?</p></speech>

I see now that the Taoiseach said another nine cases are pending where the State Claims Agency is going to stand in and get indemnified against the laboratory, which I am glad to see, but why, in my case, did it try to fight it?

We have not seen the contract that is in place.  I presume this committee will probably get that documentation.  It is the indemnity which is in the contract and the indemnity is like any insurance indemnity that some sub-contractor would give to the person to whom they are contracted.  Presumably, the contract does not contain any confidentiality clause.  It is just that the laboratory, having given the indemnity to the State, is then running the proceedings and it insists on settling it on its terms.  That is all.</p></speech>

Everybody in Ireland owes thanks to Vicky, Stephen and anyone else who has come out on this issue and explained to us, from where we are, how it has affected them, their families and all those around them.</p> <p>  I want to home in on one particular aspect, which I believe Vicky said.  It is the idea that it would not have made any difference.  I keep thinking about her saying that.  Who decides what a difference is?  It may not have made a material difference to the outcome in some cases.  It is difficult to quantify in some cases, although I am not saying in the witnesses' cases, but the fact that something has to have a change in staging for it to have made a difference is getting to the crux of the issue because we are ignoring the feelings and the considerations someone goes through when they have a diagnosis of cancer.  They wonder what could have been if they had noticed something earlier.  Vicky went through her symptoms in great detail, and I thank her for doing that.  It is very difficult  but it is important that we hear the actual detail of what she has gone through.  However, it is important to acknowledge that in terms of families or individuals who have a cancer diagnosis, everyone will meet that news with a different reaction.  The difference does not have to be a stage or a level in terms of how long they have got left.  It is more to do with how they deal with it, and how they deal with it as a couple, in Stephen's case.  It is very difficult for any of us here who have husbands and young children to consider how they would get on without us.  In terms of the future, it must be very difficult for Vicky, with her diagnosis, to consider that it might not be her but those she may leave behind who will have to continue her fight.</p> <p>  Vicky mentioned the 12 months of wrangling with the HSE and laboratories.  Like Deputy Kelly, I sit on both the Joint Committee on Health and the Committee of Public Accounts.  So much has come out in the past week but I am almost sure that we were told that period of wrangling occurred between March of 2016 and the summer of 2016 and that was the reason for the line in the memorandum, "Pause all letters", or whatever it said.  The justification I heard this morning at the health committee for that period was that this was dealing with that issue, but Vicky has told us she was wrangling with the HSE for 12 months.  I do not want to put her under pressure but it is important because my understanding is that we were led to believe that this was a short period of a few months.  Is it possible for Mr. O'Carroll to find out where that is coming from because it is important for tomorrow's meeting?</p> <p>  I am shocked at the way Mr. Teap was treated.  I cannot believe the insensitivity shown in that people were brought into a holding area, for the want of a better term.  We need to find out who in God's name decided in the past few weeks that this was the appropriate way to treat these people.  I suspect it was not anybody with a medical degree, but perhaps I am wrong.</p> <p>  What comes to the fore in all of this is that people have a vocation.  They are clinicians first and they see patients before they see data.  We have a serious issue in our health service when somebody like Mr. O'Brien opens an email and decides, without his medical degree, that this is not a significant error.  A committee, and I believe it should probably be the health committee, needs to get to the bottom of who decided that was the framework in which Stephen should be treated.</p> <p>  On the magnitude of errors, in Vicky's case, when the audit of the slide was done, it was essentially extensive cancer.  It is becoming more alarming to me, as we find out more information, that the 15%, 20%, 30% or whatever was the acceptable level of false negatives or false positives was not a consideration.  To my mind, we have not seen any evidence that anyone quantified those errors.  Was it a systemic error in a particular laboratory?  It is shocking to me that anyone could look at Vicky Phelan's case in particular and say, "Okay, we have this false negative."  However, it is not really a false negative.  It is active cancer on a slide.  My understanding from the conversation around it is that they would not really need a microscope; it was that obvious.  It seems to me that this would be fundamental to the audit process.  If there was a 30% rate, they would need to make sure that it falls within the category of false negative and that it is not something extra to that.</p> <p>  We spoke about the auditing process at the health committee earlier and there seems to be a serious issue with that process.  There seems to be many people in the HSE with the word "audit" in their job titles.  One of the fundamental aspects of audit is that one should know what one will do with the results when they are received, and there should be a pathway.  Critical to this is that there was no pathway decided before anything happened, so what was the point of the audit?  It appears the point of the audit was data rather than people.</p> <p>  I hate giving round figures because everyone is a person in this but we have a figure of 1,500 and then 1,641 from the cancer registry.  If we combine them we have approximately 3,000.  That is the number of women with a diagnosis which have been audited.  Of those, there are 209 in the first batch - excuse my terminology - and another number in the second batch.  We do not know that number.  In the case of the error on Vicky's smear, it seems obvious to me that an immediate random audit has to start of all of the samples, not just the approximately 3,000 women because all of those have cancer-----</p></speech>

I thank you for your testimony today.  I do not know what else to say.  It was difficult to listen to and as I can only imagine how difficult it is for yourselves and your families to go through this, I thank you.</p> <p>  I have a comment and two brief questions.  My comment relates to what you said earlier about the wrangling period.  My understanding was similar to that of Deputy Kate O'Connell, namely, that that period of disagreement between the labs concluded around May or June 2016.  My understanding - and I will double-check tomorrow - was from the documentation we had received, which said that a meeting was requested between the national screening service and the labs.  After that took place, all legal correspondence ceased.</p> <p>  My questions relate to some of the issues that we heard last week and on which I seek your views.  Last week, representatives of the State Claims Agency claimed that they were completely opposed to the non-disclosure agreement which Vicky was being asked to sign.  They said that under no circumstances did the agency support that.  Can Vicky say whether that was communicated to you or your legal team?  Perhaps Cian O'Carroll can answer that.  When did either Vicky or Cian become aware that the State Claims Agency had taken the position that it was completely opposed to the use of a non-disclosure agreement in Vicky's case?</p> <p>  What sort of process was there in respect of obtaining documents?  Was co-operation given to Vicky and her legal team up to this week?  Can Cian say what the attitude has been by CervicalCheck towards releasing documentation to people, in his experience?  Is there an open procedure to getting that information or is there still a culture of trying to put obstacles in people's way in terms of getting the documentation to which they are entitled? </p></speech>

I wondered if, in the course of Mr. O'Carroll's investigations in Vicky's case, it had emerged that one of her tests had been done in this subcontracted laboratory.  If this was the case, was it still signed off on by an Irish-registered pathologist?</p></speech>

It then sent back the result.  I do not know if there was another version of that result which was then signed off on by an Irish pathologist.  That is entirely possible.  There was a subsequent review of that in 2014, which was conducted through the MedLab sister company, CPL, and that was signed off on by a Dr.Clelland who appears on both MedLab and CervicalCheck documentation.</p></speech>

I have also called for that but for two reasons, one of which is to alleviate the fear among the women of Ireland.  They are terrified.  When one hears Vicky's story, or Irene's story about two consecutive smear tests which have been misread and now she is dead, of course they are afraid.  The Government and the HSE have a duty of care to alleviate women's fear and to do so quickly.  Second, we do not know what the error rate actually is.  There are so many different variations of what it is and we are being told by people who cannot back it up with any type of proof.  As part of this investigation, we need to get our own proof on that and arrive at our own figure.  We can only do that by doing our own audit of these.  That is why I support what Kate said and those two reasons are why I think it should be done as a matter of priority.</p></speech>

She stated that the 3,000 women who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer over the last ten years, during the life of CervicalCheck, had been audited or subject to an audit.

Jonathan asked when I learned the position of the State Claims Agency.  I probably would have learned it moments before my client.  I hope I would operate an open disclosure policy between the two of us.  I was not aware that it was the laboratory and not the State Claims Agency.  We were not aware of that initially.  It became apparent after the case was resolved when there was a press release to "Morning Ireland" a few days afterwards at the height of the media controversy.  I accept that it was not at the request of the State Claims Agency.  In fact, it would not be its form to seek confidentiality.  We just did not know it was resisting that with the laboratory at the time.  It is probably understandable that where there are co-defendants and multiple parties in a case, one is not going to come to us and tell us it is having trouble with the other.  That is not typically the way it works.  There is a united approach.</p></speech>

I had escalated the query to some people in the Department of Health who had given me their contact details.  They were very helpful, as was the new director of CervicalCheck.  He instructed us that it was in order for us to send somebody to its office in Limerick to collect records.  When the person got there, the person was told the records were not available and the person was escorted from the building.</p></speech>

On a sunny evening such as this, I am sure that, as young parents, they would prefer to be playing with Amelia and Darragh or Oscar and Noah rather than be in a committee room in the bowels of Leinster House discussing this subject.  We thank them for making the time available to give their accounts.  Stephen said he wondered what Oscar and Noah would think ten years from now when they look back on this and on what their Dad did today.  They will be very proud of what their brave Dad has done in standing up and talking for their Mum in Leinster House.</p> <p>  Officialdom has been given a fair crack of the whip in these committee rooms, week in and week out, but I am not sure if people listening are any wiser.  The impact of its decisions, or lack of decisions, is a personal human story that is manifest in the stories of Vicky and Stephen, on behalf of Irene.  Vicky spoke about the appalling breach of trust - on the day of her court case - on the steps of the High Court.  As she has monitored proceedings over the past couple of weeks, has she seen anything that shows a willingness to change on the part of the people who are coming to this committee to answer questions or, as Stephen said, is the protect and deny culture still thriving even up to this point?  The exiting director general of the HSE at the committee last week, and even after he was gone, was like a dying wasp with a sting in his tail.</p></speech>

It was disgraceful.</p></speech>

I would like to hear Vicky's reading of that situation and those comments and her thoughts on whether a protect-and-deny culture is still endemic.  Is that fuelling her request for a complete clear-out to allow for an honest appraisal of the situation, rather than protecting an entity?  God knows what they are protecting.</p> <p>  I am interested in the question Cian posed about the magnitude of the errors.  The discussion has been focused on the lack of communication, but you made an interesting point in terms of focusing on the magnitude of errors and why there is a closed-mind attitude to the latter.  How far do you think that closed-mind attitude permeates the system?  When the Taoiseach was addressed on this matter during Leaders' Questions on 1 May, he said it is just the norm that two pairs or four pairs of eyes miss something like this.  However, as Vicky said, it was not a small amount of cancer but, rather, a slide full of it.  I would like to hear the witnesses' views on that substantive issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-16a.152" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1268" speakername="Pat Deering" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051600002#O01700"><p>I welcome Vicky, Stephen and Cian and thank them for appearing before the committee to tell us their heartbreaking story in graphic detail.  Obviously, the past period of time has been very difficult for them.  I recall a certain individual a number of years ago making the point about another person who had passed away that he had done the State some service.  There is no doubt that Vicky, Stephen and Cian have done the State a great service over the past couple of weeks.  They have become the catalyst for something everybody in this room and many people in Leinster House have been seeking in recent years, namely, reform of the HSE and the health service.  As a result of what they have done I believe we will never again see the same attitude in the future.</p> <p>  I wish to raise two points arising from the presentations.  One was mentioned by Deputies Cassells and Kelly and I wish to tease it out further.  It is about the same people still being in position as we move on.  I believe there must be accountability not just in the House but across the board.  Vicky, Stephen and Cian will be aware that there are a number of investigations taking place.  We all want to get to the bottom of this issue.  We need to get all the answers.  Would it be better if the five, ten, 20 or whatever number of people are involved were left there to get the answers rather than move them to one side at this stage?  I have no preference regarding the answer to that.</p> <p>  Second, Stephen made a point that refers to both him and Vicky.  First, you said it is disappointing that you still have not heard anything about the suite of services and supports that was announced on Friday last.  Do you think there is enough there?  Stephen might have mentioned that there are other issues that could be addressed in the future.  You are both in different situations to a certain extent.  What other services are required over and above what has been announced in the past couple of weeks?</p> <p>  I wish you both every success and good wishes for the for the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-16a.153" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1369" speakername="Peter Burke" time="17:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018051600002#P00200"><p>I would like to thank Vicky, Stephen and Cian for attending.  I think Vicky and Stephen have shown great courage in giving their testimony.  It is very much appreciated.  As other speakers have said, I think it is going to be of huge service to other women, and will ensure that we do get the truth.  Over the course of this discussion we have got very valuable information that will help us in questioning the other individuals who will be coming before us.  I wish to raise two things very briefly.  First, anyone with a basic knowledge of statistics would know what a false negative is.  However, the chances of an individual getting a slide wrong twice, in two separate tests, are non-existent.  That is what really worries me here; the incompetence.  As you said, were they looked at at all?</p> <p>  The second thing concerns the State Claims Agency.  Its representatives said that they were very vociferous, although maybe I am quoting them incorrectly, in their fight against non-disclosure agreements.  Is that a sense that you got from your interaction with them?</p> <p>  Finally, everyone is very proud of you both.  I know from watching her interviews that your family has been incredible.  Your television appearance on Saturday night was an incredibly brave and courageous interview.  Most importantly, I hope that from all this and from your treatment your get a good sense of hope.  It is very important to have hope for the future, and I hope that you progress well.</p></speech>

One of the things that really actually enraged me with my case, when it did settle, is this.  I got to a point where they were going to waive the confidentiality clause because they knew I was not going to sign one.  However, what happened in that case was that the HSE was struck out.  It was absolved of all responsibility and did not have to admit any liability, because we were looking for exemplary damages.  The HSE officials knew that if they got caught there would be a rap on the knuckles and they would have to pay for it.  I have a huge issue with this.  I know there was a trade-off, according to what Cian was telling me.  I do not understand the ins and outs of legalities.  However, he will tell you; I really wanted to keep going, to be honest.  I did not want the HSE to be struck out because I wanted it to be made accountable and to admit liability, but I was never going to get that.  There was a trade-off.</p></speech>

In regard to the point that she makes about the HSE, there were two defendants in the case.  There was a negotiation.  There was one fundamental that my wonderful client had set from day 1, which was that there could never be a confidentiality clause.  Eventually, when that was surrendered by the defendant - I thought it was the defendants, until we found out later it was just the laboratory - then a negotiation began.  That was after three days in the High Court.  It was six days after the case had started.  The focus then was on the terms of settlement.  As part of that, the HSE was to be let out of the case.  There was nothing, apparently, to be lost or gained from doing that.  I almost feel I am confessing and apologising to Ms Phelan.  Maybe in hindsight, if we were to go back now, knowing what we know and what has happened, it would be tidier to keep the HSE in it.  The HSE admitted in their defence to a breach of duty in a partial delay of informing Ms Phelan in 15 months of what had happened, which is extraordinary.  A party has been let out of proceedings, and yet it makes an apology, publicly, for the actual liability issue that the proceedings were about.  I do not think I have ever seen that before.  In that sense, the HSE was not let out.  It was let out, but it ultimately had to apologise to Ms Phelan.</p></speech>

He asked if they should be left to answer the questions.  I think they have clearly proven time and time again that they are incapable of passing on information, currently, with regard to questions they are being asked.  What I was saying was that they should be removed, and we just need to get the answers through investigations.  However, I would not let them go too far.  They still face questions that need to be answered.</p> <p>  With regard to support services and whether we have done enough, I think that as long as we can implement everything that was said last week, we will have done enough in the short term. </p></speech>

It needs to be proactive, and people need to be reached out to.  There is no point in displaying a number on a wall and directing people to contact it.  They need to be reached out to.  We do not know the scale of how sick some of these women are.  We do not know the situation of all of the families that are in my position, that have lost people, and where they are today.  In the short term we need to act fast, but there certainly needs to be some sort of review on a long-term basis.</p></speech>

It started with the interview given by Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, then clinical director of CervicalCheck, on "Morning Ireland" on 25 or 26 April.  We first got a sense of statistics then, when she explained that there were 1,462 cases that had been looked at.  Of those, a cohort selection of 460-odd cases had been sent for review.  Of that, there were 209 cases - it was about 206 then, but the number has since grown - which involved an error in the reporting, which resulted in a clinically significant delay in the commencement of treatment for the cancer.  That is the crucial bit.  We then found out that there were another 1,500 on the national cancer register, and that brought the total figure of women who had been diagnosed with cervical cancer over the ten-year life of CervicalCheck to date to 3,000.</p> <p>  However, the documents that were released last night from the Department of Health include some of the annual reviews and audits which were happening around the CervicalCheck programme.  In the review, the statistics for 2016 show that at that stage they had only audited about 400 cases.  The current figure is somewhere around 462.  That is the figure that Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly gave.  It explains why not everybody is being audited in this report.  It shows that the service categorised cases by the timing within the history of the cancer.  They categorised the timing into six different categories.  For example, among women who had a diagnosis following a previous colposcopy, only most of the cases were reviewed and looked back at.  None of the cases where there was no screening for the woman prior to diagnosis of cancer were reviewed or looked back on.  </p></speech>

Stephen and I should not know each other, and I do not mean that in a bad way.  Look at why we know each other.  It is horrible.  Stephen and I met for the first time today and it was very difficult for both of us.  We have been in touch with each other over the phone but we had not met before today.

On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General at the Department of Health, and Dr. Tony Holohan, chief medical officer of the Department.  From the HSE, we welcome Mr. John Connaghan, interim director general; Mr. Damien McCallion, national director of the National Screening Service; Dr. Stephanie O'Keeffe, national director of strategic planning and transformation; and Dr. Peter McKenna, clinical director at the national women and infants' health programme.</p><p>I draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l) </i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

I would like at the outset to recall the bravery of Vicky Phelan, Ms Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na, and the loved ones of other women who have come forward in recent days.  Their testimony and willingness to speak publicly about deeply personal matters has raised very serious questions.  These questions related to how the health service engages with individuals when things go wrong and the fact that the audit results for these women were not conveyed as they should have been.</p> <p>  The CervicalCheck programme was established to help prevent cervical cancer.  Before it was introduced, we were not making any impact on cervical cancer but following its introduction we are seeing a steady reduction each year.  However, every time a cervical cancer is not prevented, it is a tragedy.  That is compounded when women who have been diagnosed with cancer are not properly informed of the results of a subsequent audit.  I would like to acknowledge the powerful and deeply generous nature of the advice that is given when women who have had such painful experiences encourage others to continue to participate in the programme in the interest of their health.</p> <p>  These powerful testimonies place on all of us a responsibility to act to address weaknesses while sustaining the national cervical cancer screening programme in the interest of current and future generations of Irishwomen.  The Department is committed to discharging its particular responsibility to take the necessary steps, in association with the HSE, health professionals and others, to restore the trust of women in the CervicalCheck programme and, indeed, our health service more generally. </p> <p>  Last week, the Government commissioned a leading UK expert, Dr. Gabriel Scally, to conduct an inquiry to establish the facts and to review all aspects of CervicalCheck.  We are determined to do everything we can to assist Dr. Scally in his inquiries so that we can all find out what happened and why it happened, to make sure that we have a robust cancer screening programme for women, and so lessons are learned for the future.</p> <p>  The focus, however, needs to be on the women most affected as well as the CervicalCheck programme.  On Friday last, the Government agreed a comprehensive package of health and social care measures to support the 209 women and their families who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer and whose audit result differed from their original smear test.  The Government has committed to ensuring that these women and their families are supported to the fullest extent possible.</p> <p>  The health and social care measures include a discretionary medical card for every woman affected, or her next of kin in cases where the woman has sadly died, so that they can avail of health services, including medicines provided under the medical card scheme, free of charge; out-of-pocket medical costs incurred, including the cost of any medicines that have been prescribed by their treating clinician; primary care supports, including counselling, for the women affected, and also counselling services for the immediate family members of these women, including bereavement counselling where needed; and other health and social care supports, including travel costs and childminding.</p> <p>  An international clinical expert review panel is also being established as part of the Government&rsquo;s investigation into CervicalCheck.  The main purpose of the panel is to provide women with facts and independent expert assessment of those facts.  The panel&rsquo;s findings will also contribute to the overall independent assessment of the quality of the CervicalCheck programme.</p> <p>  The review will consider all cases of invasive cervical cancer in Ireland since CervicalCheck was established.  Women who developed cancer and who were screened by CervicalCheck will be identified and their screening histories will be examined.  The expert panel will review the cases of those women who had previous screening tests prior to their diagnosis and undertake a re-examination of cytology tests.  Where the expert panel opinion of cytology results differs from the original results provided by CervicalCheck, the panel will endeavour to determine, wherever possible, any failures to prevent cancer or to intervene at an earlier stage and will prepare individual reports for those affected, setting out the facts and their expert and independent assessment.</p> <p>  The Government has also announced that the State Claims Agency is advancing a new initiative aimed at expediting the resolution of the nine outstanding legal cases in a sensitive manner, utilising mediation wherever possible.  In addition, last week the Minister for Health received Government approval to provide in law for mandatory open disclosure, through the forthcoming patient safety Bill, in respect of serious patient safety incidents.  The Bill will also provide for mandatory reporting of these serious events to the appropriate regulatory authority, such as HIQA.</p> <p>  Yesterday, the Department published records relating to the CervicalCheck clinical audit.  The information submitted by the HSE in regard to this audit in 2016 provided the Department with an understanding that this was a retrospective clinical audit undertaken for quality assurance and learning purposes and that CervicalCheck had a clear objective to provide results to consultants in order to allow for direct communication with the women concerned.  Both clinical audit and the communication of the results of clinical audit to women were seen by the Department to be very worthy and valuable undertakings by the CervicalCheck programme.  Clinical audit is an important means by which standards are maintained and advances made in healthcare.</p> <p>  I believe a reasonable approach was taken by the Department at the time based upon the information available to it.  There are two ways of looking at issues, one based upon the information available at the time and the other based on hindsight.  Of course, had the subsequent widespread non-disclosure been escalated by CervicalCheck within the HSE and raised with the Department, this would have triggered major concern and a much different attitude.  Based upon the information we had, however, we viewed the initiative taken to communicate audit findings to women in a positive light.</p> <p>  The widespread and still unfolding distress caused by the non-disclosure of the clinical audit results to the women concerned demands serious reflection, however.  The Scally inquiry provides us with a mechanism to achieve an objective basis for introducing improvements, where these can be identified.  The Department has at this stage publicly committed to engaging with the HSE on a full review of the implementation of its open disclosure policy.  </p> <p>  As I have mentioned, the Government has approved the drafting of a patient safety Bill by the Department.  This Bill will provide a mechanism to develop and introduce standards relating to clinical audit so as to ensure that open disclosure, including roles and responsibilities for such disclosure, are fully addressed in advance of the commencement of an audit.  As the CervicalCheck experience shows, it is important to anticipate the issues that will arise for the disclosure of clinical audit findings before commencing the process.  The clinical audit standards to be introduced under the patient safety Bill should also entail a responsibility to record the fact that open disclosure has taken place.</p> <p>  I look forward to the recommendations produced by the Scally inquiry.  The inquiry will produce an interim report at the start of June and a final report by the end of June.  The Department will be subject to this inquiry and will be scrutinised by it, but the committee can be assured we will provide full support and co-operation and address any learning and recommendations as a matter of priority.</p> <p>  With the agreement of the Chairman, I will ask Dr. Tony Holohan to make some remarks.</p></speech>

I cannot recall a time in those years when patients were gripped by such widespread fear and concern as they are now.  Of course, given the nature of the events that have unfolded in recent weeks, the fear and concern are entirely understandable, but it has been difficult to get real facts, which people can trust, into the public domain and hence into public understanding.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute in this regard this morning.</p> <p>  We know things went wrong.  It is true that lessons must be learned but it is important that we be clear about what actually came to light.  Arising from the publicity following the Vicky Phelan court case, questions arose as to whether other patients might be in a similar situation.  Had Vicky Phelan not highlighted her case, we might not have become aware that other women had not had the findings of the CervicalCheck clinical audit disclosed to them by their clinicians.  We therefore owe a debt of gratitude to Vicky Phelan.  </p> <p>  It has become clear since the case that the non-disclosure of clinical audit findings was widespread.  It has also become clear that the issue of disclosure was the subject of dispute among some elements of the relevant clinical community.  I can provide assurance that the Department was not aware of these issues until this controversy arose, towards the end of April.  We have since had the opportunity to engage directly with a view to understanding, directing and investigating what happened.  </p> <p>  Let me be clear on what we knew in 2016.  First, no Minister was advised.  Second, the decision not to escalate was a fair and reasonable decision based on the information available to the Department at the time.</p><p>It was reasonable because the information provided in the briefing notes provided by the HSE to the Department was evidence of ongoing improvement to how the service was being delivered, rather than the identification of problems that might require escalation to Ministers.  The HSE has confirmed, and will confirm, that no systems of escalation within its organisation in relation to the implementation of the audit programme were activated.</p><p> In respect of CervicalCheck, it is important to point out how much has been achieved in recent years.  Before 2008 in this country we had a disorganised arrangement of random screening were random women were getting too many smears and many others were not getting any smears at all.  On an annual basis, we were doing more smears in the country at that time than we do currently.  Smears were being examined in a wide range of laboratories, many of which were too small and not fit for purpose.  There were no quality assurance arrangements in place and there were very long turnaround times for reporting of smear results.  In 2008, the population-based programme which invites patients to come forward to their GPs for smears was established with those smears being sent to accredited laboratories and appropriate follow-up in colposcopy services.  Prior to 2008, cervical cancer incidents were rising but we know that the impact since 2008 has been a 7% annualised reduction after 2010 in the incidence of cervical cancer, a clear impact of the programme.</p><p> Let me turn briefly to open disclosure.  It is important, given some of the debate that has taken place, that we make the position of the Department clear.  The Department does not and never has regarded open disclosure as optional.  Open disclosure should happen in the right way, in every circumstance in which it is indicated.  Patients simply must be informed.  I know that this can be a challenge for the medical profession but professionals in this country are rising to that challenge.  Our legislative approach is to encourage doctors to do the right thing in circumstances where disclosure is required.  We know from international evidence that one of the reasons that disclosure does not always happen in the right way or at all is that doctors may fear the medico-legal consequences.  We have directly addressed this fear through the voluntary disclosure legislation, the Civil Liability (Amendment) Act 2017.  The regulations are to be signed within the coming weeks.  That legislation provides that if doctors disclose appropriately, they will not contribute further to any legal risks they may have.  That is intended to create a so-called safe space to encourage people to do the right thing.  </p><p> That is not to say that we do not see a role for mandatory open disclosure, so a stepped approach is required.  Therefore, following many months of work, we have secured Government approval for the patient safety Bill to introduce mandatory open disclosure for a specified list of serious reportable events.  This is in line with the UK duty of candour.  However, it goes further in that it is not just an obligation on organisations, as with the duty of candour in the UK, rather it is an obligation on doctors to disclose.  Thus, the commitment to open disclosure in this country could be regarded as exceeding - when we have enacted that legislation - that which is placed on doctors in the UK.  </p><p> It is really important that I am clear that we absolutely recognise that at the centre of this are tragic cases.  We are fully sensitive to that.  I want to engage, and the Department would wish to engage, directly with the individuals involved in these cases, as we have done in the past in other situations, to ensure we fully understand their perspectives and fully engage them in the process of further policy development and oversight so that we can ensure that any lessons that can be derived here can be properly applied to improvements in the future. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-16a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018051600002#H00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to attend this meeting.  Several issues have already been covered by Mr. Breslin and Dr. Holohan so I will truncate my opening statement accordingly.</p> <p>  First, I would like to acknowledge and apologise for the confusion and alarm which has been created in relation to the CervicalCheck programme as a result of the failure to communicate with the women affected.  This failure has ultimately impacted on every female in Ireland, their families, their spouses and their children.  Irrespective of the original, well-intentioned undertaking by the CervicalCheck programme to conduct an audit of invasive cervical cancers and communicate the results to the patients affected, the organisation - in that respect both CervicalCheck and the HSE - has failed by any measure. </p> <p>  I sincerely apologise on behalf of the HSE and CervicalCheck to the women and their families who have been directly affected by what has happened and to all the women of Ireland who have been understandably frightened and concerned by what they have read and heard.  We must learn lessons from what has happened.  I assure the committee and especially the women of Ireland that I am determined that we will take on board these lessons.  Together with my colleagues, we will work to bring about the changes needed with a view to ensuring that this does not happen again.  The CervicalCheck programme is vital to women's health and we must clearly understand the mistakes that have been made and how we can learn from these and restore confidence in this life-saving public health programme.</p> <p>  In the short time that I have been interim director general, less than three days, I have asked for a full record search and a full chronology of events to be compiled.  That exercise is now under way.  The HSE last week provided three separate briefing notes at short notice to the Committee on Public Accounts, PAC, and we have also submitted them to this committee for information.  Regrettably, there was not sufficient opportunity at the PAC meeting last week to provide appropriate context and interpretation of the three briefing notes.  I have therefore brought colleagues to this committee who will be prepared to answer any questions of detail on these notes.  The full record search has allowed three further briefing notes relating to the audit process.  These briefing notes are provided to the committee here.  It is fair to say that the language in all of the briefing notes is very functional and somewhat lacking in empathy for the women who were to be communicated with. </p> <p>  I have submitted an information note to the committee regarding the briefings that were submitted to PAC together with other information.  In relation to the three specific briefings given to PAC last week, and which we have also copied to this committee, the context for the briefing given in March 2016 to the national director, health and well-being, HSE, the former director general of the HSE, and to the Department of Health was to raise awareness of the audit process that CervicalCheck was engaged in and the initial outcomes and next steps of that process.  The intent of the CervicalCheck programme was that all treating clinicians would be given individual audit findings for their patients so that these could be in turn communicated to the women concerned, in line with guidelines at that time.</p> <p>  A key element within the March 2016 briefing was the assurance it gave that there was no systemic quality issues of concern with the programme.  This is the most important element of an audit from a cancer prevention and effectiveness perspective, namely, to provide assurance that there is nothing systematically happening in the screening programme and its operations that would lead to it operating outside of internationally acceptable quality parameters, for example, European guidelines. </p> <p>  The process involved sending audit results to treating clinicians in order that these results could be communicated to the women concerned.  The CervicalCheck programme had commenced sending letters to treating clinicians in February 2016.  All individuals briefed expected that women affected would be receiving information from their treating clinicians on the result of the audit findings pertinent to their case. </p> <p>  The subject matter of the March 2016 briefing was to provide a snapshot of the process to date and to escalate a particular issue at hand.  This issue concerned one laboratory, Quest Diagnostics, that challenged the CervicalCheck programme communications process with treating clinicians and invoked a dispute resolution process, as part of that contract.  I have been advised that this is why "pause all letters" was listed as a next step in the briefing.  It was imperative that CervicalCheck and the National Screening Service resolved this issue quickly so as to ensure it had solid legal footing to continue with its work in sending audit findings to treating clinicians for onward disclosure to the women concerned, within the guidelines set out. </p> <p>  The thinking at that time was that if CervicalCheck were to continue sending letters, without that assurance that it had legal cover to do so, it could have created subsequent legal issues for the operation of the CervicalCheck programme, in addition to potential risks for any women seeking redress where the laboratory could claim its legal rights and entitlements were infringed by the process.  This is why "await advice from solicitors" was one of the next steps in the briefing note from March 2016.</p> <p>  CervicalCheck was supported in resolving the dispute with Quest Diagnostics and the process of issuing letters to treating clinicians recommenced in June 2016.  During the time it took to resolve the dispute, CervicalCheck was preparing individual letters for each patient case history to send to treating clinicians.  The March 2016 briefing note states that "There is now a batch [or] accumulation of clinical audit case reports that have been completed".  It was understood by those that were briefed that these case reports needed to be converted into individual letters in relation to each patient concerned.</p><p>The correspondence demonstrates that this work was happening at this time.  This correspondence will be made available to the scoping inquiry.</p><p> CervicalCheck explained in the briefings how the audit and communications process was complex, multi-layered and resource intensive.  They made clear to those being briefed that each communication needed to be specific to the individual and checked and rechecked for accuracy relating to the specifics of each patient, and that the logistics of sending out these communications needed to be carefully thought out so as to mitigate any risks relating to the manner, mode, content and logistics of the communication.  This is, therefore, why "decide on the order and volume of dispatch to mitigate any potential risks" is set out as a next step in the briefing note.  It is important to note that CervicalCheck issued the majority of the correspondence concerned during July and August 2016, with approximately 200 letters according to the July 2016 briefing notes.</p><p> We need to be realistic in our assessment of the communication process.  The CervicalCheck programme did not close out the issues that were subsequently encountered regarding the breakdown in the process of treating clinicians discussing those audit findings with their patients.  Indeed, it is not clear to me that the staff within the programme were aware of the scale of the difficulty in terms of the proportion of women who had not been communicated with.  I can confirm at this point that the screening service is concluding an agreement with the faculty of pathology to provide guidance and direction for the screening programme.  This will help us to provide the necessary clarity as we move forward.</p><p> It is also important that we look at some key facts.  Most women&rsquo;s smear test results are accurately reported.  Every year, more than 250,000 smears are undertaken.  For women who have received a normal result, the chance of going on to have cervical cancer by their next smear test three years later is less than 1%.  Since 2008, the CervicalCheck programme has provided some 3 million screenings to over 1 million women.  The programme has detected over 50,000 high-grade pre-cancerous changes in women, therefore reducing their risk of cervical cancer by 90%.  These were women without any symptoms who, without that screening programme, would not have known that they had pre-cancerous changes.  Latest figures show that the incidence of cancer in Ireland reduced by 7% in the period 2010 to 2015, which is welcome.</p><p> I want to take this opportunity to say a few words briefly in defence of our national audit programme.  The process of clinical audit is about measuring the quality of care against relevant standards and best professional practice.  It encompasses the requirement to identify any factors causing sub-optimal delivery of care, either at an individual patient level or more widely, and allows the necessary remedial actions to be identified and taken.  In light of the controversy over the CervicalCheck audit process, we must ensure that healthcare professionals are not discouraged from taking part in clinical audit.  Fostering an open culture which supports clinicians and encourages learning must be part of our ethos.</p><p> I should also say a few words on accountability.  To me, accountability is the obligation for an organisation or individual to account for its, his or her activities, accept responsibility for them, and disclose the results in a transparent manner.  As interim director general, it might also be useful to outline how I see myself discharging my duties against the obligation to be accountable to the Minister and more generally.  As part of the Health Service Executive (Governance) Act 2013, which established the directorate as the governing body of the HSE, the directorate is accountable to the Minister for the performance of its functions and those of the HSE.  As the interim director general, I account to the Minister on behalf of the directorate through the Secretary General of the Department of Health.  It is important that we, therefore, foster a culture of openness, transparency and both personal and organisational accountability in doing so.</p><p> The process and procedures for how the CervicalCheck programme intended to communicate the results of the audit to patients was developed at that time with the best of intentions, with a view to ensuring that women would receive the results of the audit, consistent with policy and best practice as set out in the 2015 open disclosure national policy, and informed by wider best practice for the disclosure of cancer screening audit results.  The failure here, which was a collective failure, was on ensuring effective follow through on these good intentions.  While the results of the audit were communicated to the relevant clinicians, the arrangements thereafter broke down.  The outcome was that a large proportion of women were not told about either the audit itself or the results for them as individuals.  The impact of this failure has been profound for every woman affected and for their families.  It has also undoubtedly caused significant levels of fear and anxiety for the wider population of women living in Ireland and it has, sadly, undermined public confidence in the CervicalCheck programme.</p><p> I will conclude with four pledges.  We will move swiftly and with compassion to provide effective support packages to the women and families who require support.  As outlined by the Secretary General, we will do this with the minimum of fuss and bureaucracy and with empathy.  We will fully, openly and transparently co-operate with the Scally inquiry and any subsequent inquiries.  If there is a requirement to hold individuals to account on a personal basis, we will do so.  In this respect, the Scally inquiry and subsequent inquiries will be important for the independence of their views and to allow due process and fair procedures to be followed.  We will learn lessons from recent weeks, not least the ability to say sorry.</p></speech>

The way we will conduct the meeting this morning is we will offer each member of the committee 12 minutes to ask and receive answers to questions and I ask them to observe the time limit, if possible.  Those who are not members of the committee will be allocated five minutes to ask questions and have them answered.  With this in mind, I will begin.</p> <p>  I have number of questions which I would like Mr. Connaghan to answer.  Why was the information on the false negatives identified in the audit not brought to the attention of the secretary general of the HSE and the Minister for Health at the time, in regard to open disclosure?  Why was it not escalated up the line?  Where is the information regarding the number of false negatives identified from the various laboratories?  We requested last week that we would get information on the quality of the reporting of each laboratory, but we still have not received that information.  Why was open disclosure posing such a great difficulty in 2016 when it was already HSE policy in 2013?  What was the issue that inhibited open disclosure?</p> <p>  I believe it was the responsibility of the CervicalCheck programme to make information available to patients.  I do not think it was the responsibility of the treating clinicians.  I would like Mr. Connaghan's comments on this because it was the CervicalCheck programme that took the smears, and I believe they were the appropriate people to contact patients and pass the information down the line.</p> <p>  With regard to the documents we received yesterday, in document No. 5 there is a table of cervical cancer cases notified to the National Cancer Registry in Ireland and another table of the cancers identified by CervicalCheck.  Up to 2013, some 1,853 cancers were notified to the cancer registry yet the CervicalCheck screening programme had only 808.  Did that not trigger alarm bells, that there was a growing disparity between the figures?  Perhaps Mr. Connaghan will comment on this.</p> <p>  Was there any withholding of information over the period up to now, from women who specifically asked for information on their previous smears but were denied access to that information?  Are there any issues in relation to cytology, other than the false negatives, that have led to delayed diagnosis and delayed treatment in the CervicalCheck programme, in other words, in the process of recall, getting appointments and access to colposcopy?  Why is the proposed introduction of HPV testing of smears being delayed until November of this year?  Surely that test could be introduced sooner.</p></speech>

This is complex to do because it depends on when the laboratory concerned came on board and when it left.  Not all laboratories started and left at the same time.  If a laboratory started early and reported a smear as negative, the patient will have had a longer time to develop a cancer.  It is complicated to work out.  It is not just a matter of seeing if all of the laboratories are represented proportionately in the number of smear tests they did but when they started doing them.  That will be looked at.  I could eyeball it - I have - but it will need more complex analysis than I could give it.  It is not simple to do.</p></speech>

The director general has also mentioned that we have engaged with the faculty of pathology.  Clearly, that was a vacuum.  There was much analysis of laboratory results and different interpretations.  We felt we needed to channel it into a formal process.  We asked the faculty and hope to finalise tomorrow that it will provide support for the programme in dealing with that issue.</p></speech>

It is the positive predictive value.  It takes a couple of months because the smear needs to be matched with the histology report on the biopsy.  That is easier to do.  The laboratories all fall within a fairly narrow parameter in the early to mid-80s.  That is acceptable.  The false negative will take a long time to come through because there could be a five or six year gap between a negative smear and the diagnosis of an invasive cancer.</p></speech>

That is why we cannot abandon cytology totally.  If we did and just used the papilloma virus test, we would end up overtreating many women.  The treatment is generally fairly innocuous, but it can on occasion result in infection and haemorrhage.  If it is overzealous, there may be adverse outcomes in respect of future pregnancies.  The idea that it is possible to pick up everything and that treatment is innocuous has to be weighed against the missing sum.  I can talk about the over-disclosure element mentioned in a question.</p></speech>

If it is negative, the chances of the person subsequently developing carcinoma are very small.  It is very good at that.  However, if it is positive, there may not be a disease present.  It is possible to carry the virus and for it not to effect a person's cells.  That is why we have to have cytology.  HPV testing will pick up much and it is very good at producing the negative that a person is unlikely to develop the disease, but it will also pick up more false positives.  That is why we need cytology and colposcopy.</p></speech>

The question between the clinicians and the programme is important.  I was involved through hearing about it from clinicians.  They were of the opinion that they were asked to give information that had been known to the programme for some time.  They had not been involved in the collation of the material and at the outset, when it was probably inevitable that this was going to happen, they had not been involved in the construction of the audit or the dissemination of the outcome.  That would explain their reluctance to give the information.</p> <p>  The principle of open disclosure, from a clinical point of view, is well established.  If, for example, in the course of a hysterectomy I was to damage somebody's bladder, the onus would be on me to explain that I was sorry that I had done it and why it had happened.  I would explain that it happened in so many instances, that it was unusual and again that I was very sorry.  What would happen in that hypothetical example would be current and the error I would be disclosing was mine.  The question of an audit is quite different.  The information would be retrospective and I would be disclosing somebody else's error.  That was not something with which the clinicians were immediately comfortable.  It is a departure from what most people consider to be their normal day to day activity.</p></speech>

He or she would probably have a relationship with the patient that the programme would not.  However, it was entirely predictable that false negatives would be found.  The clinicians should have been brought on board at an earlier stage and their willingness to undertake this part of the work should not have been taken for granted.  It should have been sought.</p></speech>

Looking at some of the briefing notes later produced in the system - I am talking, in particular, about those produced in October - there was some degree of assurance that the process was under way.  The failure was not to complete the feedback loop.  Communication was intended, but it should have been asked if it had actually been done.  Mr.  Breslin might want to say a few words.</p></speech>

These two facts would not have raised serious concerns on the part of the Department.  In fact, they would have been seen in a positive light in the context of commitment to operational improvement and a commitment to openness.  The Department was updated over a period and the updates showed the progression of the process.  They were showing that what people had set out to do was being done.</p> <p>  What we were not advised of was the subsequent widespread non-disclosure of the results.  Had we been so advised, I think our attitude would have been very different.  However, based on the information we had at the time, we looked at it as something that was worthwhile and being delivered.  We were told that the process had finished with good progress being made and that the road set out had been gone down.  Everything had been done as intended.</p><p>The process for an official in the Department is to engage with the issue and seek to manage it out with the HSE.  It is only if they such issues are not resolved that they are escalated.  We are a relatively small Department and I want to have responsibility within the Department for interacting with the HSE at various levels and to identify issues and raise them with the HSE.  Sometimes we will get a very appropriate response and everything will be fine.  Sometimes there is an issue, and then we need to push the issue to try to see it followed through.  If at that stage more support is needed to resolve an issue, it is escalated.  Simply to escalate every piece of information which comes into the Department from an organisation the size of the HSE would not be realistic and effective in terms of how we do our work.</p></speech>

I wish Mr. Connaghan the very best of luck in his role.  I would like to make a point to Mr. Breslin, as head of the Department, and Mr. Connaghan, as the interim director general for the HSE.  Over the past two weeks this committee spent about eight hours with various senior representatives from the Department, HSE and CervicalCheck and we asked a lot of questions about who knew what.  I do not want to get into a Jesuitical conversation about exactly how questions were phrased, but the distinct impression I was left with after eight hours in this room was that the first the office of the director general in the HSE and Department knew about any of this was 2008.  It was very disappointing then to discover through the Committee of Public Accounts that there were detailed memos between the HSE and the Department as far back as 2006.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman.  I want to put on the record that that information should have been disclosed.  Whether any of us asked the right question exactly, in the spirit of open disclosure and an investigation into open disclosure it was very disappointing that the information was not released.  Yesterday we received an entire folder worth of correspondence from that time.  Who knew what within the Department?  My understanding is that none of the information in that folder and nothing to do with this issue was escalated to Mr. Breslin.  Will he confirm whether that is correct?</p> <p>  Mr. Breslin stated that in his opinion something of this sort would not be escalated to a Minister.  Within this documentation it clearly states that there is a substantial risk to public confidence in the national screening programmes due to the potential of woman who are being informed going to the media and talking about their very tragic cases.  Is the potential loss of public confidence in a part of the health care system due to what happens in the media and public arena not exactly the sort of thing officials should bring to a Minister?  Given that is what the warnings were, why was this not raised at any point with the then Minister and now Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, or the current Minister, Deputy Harris?</p></speech>

I appreciate the way the Deputy has put the question across in terms of the engagements we have had and what he has taken away from those engagements.  I have been very clear and consistent throughout the process that there was a significant trawl of documentation under way in the Department of Health and I was not in a position to be definitive until we got to the end of that process.  What happened on Thursday was that we effectively switched focus into a very focused look at some particular records to try to generate them.  We had a significant trawl under way and I explained that to people as they asked me exactly what the Department knew on the overall issue.</p> <p>  The other question concerned the potential loss of public confidence.  The generality of service delivered within health care is intimately involved with interaction with patients.  There is almost no situation, other than in the back office, where issues being dealt with are not being dealt with with patients.  There was a distinction around this which was that it was a quality assurance programme that was retrospective and did not bring someone in to tell him or her that he or she had a diagnosis of which he or she was unaware.</p></speech>

I understand it is inherent in a screening programme.  I am going to ask him the question for the fourth time.  The Department was told by the HSE that CervicalCheck was about to do something which could lead to a loss of confidence in the programme due to media coverage and the public reaction.  That is exactly what has just happened.  Is that not the sort of warning that the Department should escalate to a Minister?</p></speech>

The assessment done at the time was much closer to the ongoing operation of a screening programme.  People who, as part of the delivery of screening, subsequently get cervical cancer will say they were screened and this is a real issue.  From the very first day the screening programme was put in place, that was an issue present within it and something which was being managed with women when they came forward.</p></speech>

With the greatest of respect, that is not what happened.  This was not business as usual.  The HSE decided, correctly, to do an audit which was international best practice.  It also decided, correctly, that it was going to communicate the results of those audits to the clinicians.  I understand at the time CervicalCheck believed the clinicians would communicate that to the women.  The HSE was doing something new.  It was flagging issues to the Department and saying that it was about to communicate for the first time with hundreds of women around Ireland and tell them that they got a false negative that was likely to lead to a loss of confidence in the programme.  This is not business as usual.  That is the warning which was flagged to Mr. Breslin.  I am asking the question for the fifth time.</p><p>Is that not the type of warning that should be escalated to a line Minister?</p></speech>

Business as usual was when the programme was set up and I put the other extreme as being the very intense position in which we find ourselves.  There is no doubt that in tackling a backlog of audit results and engaging with women, it was further along, but the judgment made was that it was not, within the gamut of issues being managed across the health service, of sufficient scale.  It was being dealt with in an appropriate fashion according to a good, open approach with women, and the judgment was that it did not need to be escalated.</p></speech>

I will move to the legal advice.  One of the documents indicates that one of the cytology laboratory providers has sought legal advice with regard to the rights of the programme to communicate audit outcomes and the programme is liaising with the legal team on this.

The Department was told the clinicians were being told, which was also positive and good practice.  The Department was also told that CervicalCheck or the HSE was essentially opting out of open disclosure.  In the documentation provided, it states that while CervicalCheck &quot;supports the principles of open disclosure, it is recognised that there are limitations to its universal implementation&quot;.  It goes on to elaborate on that and provide various opt-outs to clinicians if they believe it is not in the best interests of women or if the woman is deceased.  <i>Pro forma</i>letters are provided to that end.</p><p>The policy of open disclosure was in place from 2013.  Dr. Holohan stated that he does not regard open disclosure as optional.  The HSE told the Department explicitly that it was opting out of full open disclosure.  Does the witness believe the Department, in that sense, was correct in not interrogating that opt-out further?</p></speech>

The HSE open disclosure policy does not mention disclosure in every circumstance, irrespective of every consideration.  There are mitigating circumstances and circumstances taken into account by clinicians.  The HSE may wish to add to some of this.  For example, we know that in the screening of this kind, international evidence tells us that up to 40% of patients would not wish to have this information disclosed.  It is just one fact I would point to.  It cannot be seen as something that happens in every situation, irrespective of the considerations.  An approach to what might be termed non-optional disclosure does not mean clinical considerations or the realities of individual situations between clinicians and patients are not taken into account and precisely how and when that disclosure takes place.</p> <p>  It is important and it goes to the core of our policy in disclosure that it should not be seen as an event or the passing over of a piece of paper or information.  It is a relationship with the patient where trust and confidence are maintained.  The patient has a piece of information shared and sometimes it is bad news and difficult to take on board.  Patients do not fully absorb it on the first occasion.  There needs to be a proper and quality relationship.</p></speech>

If I understand those comments correctly, Dr. Holohan has indicated his support for that.  He has given incidents where non-disclosure might be okay.  I want to be very clear on this.

It states that while CervicalCheck "supports the principles of open disclosure, it is recognised that there are limitations to its universal implementation, particularly for screening services where there is an inherent recognised error rate" and so forth.  In its defence, CervicalCheck told the Department in 2016 that its approach to non-disclosure recognised there were limitations to its universal implementation, if the witness does not want to use the word "conditional".  I am sure the witness has re-read this very carefully since, so does he believe CervicalCheck's approach and what it said it was doing was in compliance with the HSE's open disclosure policy?</p></speech>

Disclosure operating in a screening environment is not the same.  It is true to say the CervicalCheck programme did not have its own specific policy relating to open disclosure, and perhaps that is learning that can be applied.  The only other jurisdiction we have been able to identify that has open disclosure specific to audit findings of this kind is England.  Most jurisdictions throughout Europe do not have express policies and most that do have express policies not to disclose such information.  All of those policies relating to disclosure recognise that this inherent fact is true, that open disclosure in a screening environment is different from normal clinical situations.  That is not to say, therefore, that it is not in compliance with the open disclosure policy.</p></speech>

Then there is another comment which says, "Do not include if the woman is known to have passed away."  To me that would be the very opposite of open disclosure.  There is literally no reference to telling the woman anything.  For the avoidance of doubt, if anyone is unsure about what it is people are angry about, it is that impression that has been given that information was deliberately withheld.  We can get into a conversation about whether that information was material to a woman's health and well-being, but it was information that certainly could and should have been shared, and by my reading of it, any policy of open disclosure should have encouraged that information to be shared with the woman herself.  Dr. Holohan is signing off on these letters.  They explicitly exclude telling women.  They simply say "ensure that the correspondence is added to [her] medical records" and, "If open disclosure is indicated [very much optional here] please follow the local hospital guidelines", unless of course she has passed away, in which case just stick a note on her file.  That is the sort of stuff that makes people very angry.  Dr. Holohan might advise us on those letters and when he signed off on them.  It does not look like open disclosure to me, but perhaps he has an alternative view.</p> <p>  Around the same time as these letters were circulating, Dr. Holohan sent an email to Ms Conroy on the memo.  In it he said they should have a chat about this.  Does Dr. Holohan have any recollection of that?  Was it a formal meeting?  What would they have been discussing at that time?  It strikes me that Dr. Holohan has come here to talk to us, in hindsight, about all he knows, but the truth is that he and his colleagues knew more than the women themselves.  That information was available to him and his colleagues.  It is not fair for people who would have had sight of these memos from February 2016 to pretend they are surprised at the revelations now.  This would have been known to them all along.  It is shocking to me that that sort of information would not have been escalated to the level of a Minister.</p> <p>  I am not sure I am satisfied with the explanation Dr. Holohan gave because it is clear when these memos are read through that the women are hardly mentioned at all but the media features.  Dr. Holohan and his colleagues were getting themselves ready for some class of a media storm.  He would have seen the Minister in the D&aacute;il two weeks ago.  The Minister was not pleased at being handed information just as he walked in the door, and I do not think anybody would be in those circumstances.  This information was known to Dr. Holohan in February 2016 because he would have had sight of those memos, so it is not fair of him to pretend it is coming as a surprise to him now.  On the process of escalation, it defies belief that it would not have been escalated to the level of a Minister, but maybe Dr. Holohan can explain his involvement in those template letters, because clearly they were sent to him for his own information.  I am assuming he read them and he was happy with the content.</p></speech>

They were offered as evidence of validation of the process.  The documentation shows that the majority of these letters in relation to the backlog had already issued.  I would know and understand that no one of these templates would actually look like the individual letter that would be sent to an individual patient.  It reflects some of the considerations.  It is important that the HSE would speak to this.  That is how I would have perceived these letters with my understanding of screening and audit.  I would not have taken some of those interpretations from them.  Perhaps the HSE might wish to comment on that.</p></speech>

It is clear there were issues and then these letters come across his desk saying that there are issues but not to tell the women, whatever he does.</p></speech>

The reference to the State Claims Agency was the extension of the implementation of the national incident management system to the screening service.  That has been in roll-out for a number of years, and the extension of that right across the clinical system still has not been fully completed but it is very significantly advanced.  It is a prerequisite to being able to record incidents.  What we need to be able to move to then, as we strengthen our implementation around open disclosure, is that system capturing the fact of open disclosure when adverse events have occurred.  In dealing with adverse events, it is important to point out that the open disclosure policy relates to adverse events and it is correct to say that not every false negative is necessarily an adverse event.  Some judgment is required on that and the letters provide those flexibilities.  Those are templates that have to provide for any eventuality.  Any individual letter that will issue in respect of an individual patient will look specific to that patient and I would have known that.</p></speech>

When this was first brought to my attention in February 2016, all of those briefings detailed that there was an accumulation of case reviews that had been completed.  A decision was made the previous year to ensure that this information was given to women.  A process was put in place to figure out the best way to do that.  As Dr. McKenna mentioned and in relation to the Chair's question on who the best person to give this information was, they considered all those things.  They looked at the open disclosure policy and the guidance for the disclosure of audit findings for cancer screening programmes to come up with a process that would support this.  I have got emails from the screening programme stating that the programme has information on women's screening history that may be of benefit to her and we believe it should be disclosed.</p> <p>  The issue that they brought to my attention in February and March was the fact that they felt that some of the laboratories had queries once they found out that they were issuing letters to treating consultants so that the information could be given to patients.  They were concerned, they escalated it to me and I supported them to resolve it so that those letters could continue to be given.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly's questions on the interpretation in relation to the letters are very fair.  The questions on whether the open disclosure policy was appropriate at the time are very fair, especially in hindsight, but they were looking at what the policies were in other jurisdictions on this type of disclosure in these circumstances.  Their intent was that the information would go out.</p> <p>  In terms of Deputy O'Reilly's specific question on the letters, it is fair to say that these are templates.  What that means is that every letter is individualised to the case, so when it says "if open disclosure is required" that is also a template letter for women who are getting the results of audit findings where there is no discordance between the cytology.  Open disclosure would be required if there is a discordance.  It is true that within the provisions here they have left space for clinical judgment.  That needs to be reviewed and we need to look at it.  In speaking to Professor Flannelly who was running the programme at that time and meeting individual women, and it can be seen in the first memo that she meets women, talks to people who are getting these results, and she is talking to consultants and so forth, my understanding was that there would be circumstances where it would not be advisable to tell a lady something like that, for example, if the person was close to passing away.</p><p>That absolutely has to be looked at, in terms of what kind of guidance can be given to clinicians in the context of wanting to be fully open and disclose this information, and some of the challenges there might be from a clinical perspective.  It has to be reviewed in hindsight, but it is really important to say that those carrying out the programme, at all times, wanted the information to get into the hands of these women, and expected that it would.  </p></speech>

A procession of very senior, very well paid people come before this committee and say that all they ever wanted was to share that information, yet mysteriously that information does not get shared.  One wonders how that was happening, regardless of hindsight.</p> <p>  We asked for the breakdown from the laboratory this day last week, and at the time it was indicated that it would simply be a matter of hitting a button and that we would get it very quickly.  We still have not received it, which is very worrying.  The witnesses have told us how interested they are in sharing every bit of information with us.  Mr. Connaghan has now explained that it might take some time to get it, but it strikes me as a bit bizarre that that information is not to hand.  </p> <p>  Perhaps the witnesses might be able to explain the tendering process to us.  It appears that around the time concerns were being raised the tender came up again.  An expression of interest process was offered to the two outsourced companies which were already doing that work.  Was this reviewed by anyone at any stage?  We know what the Minister for Health at the time, Ms Harney, said about it; that it was great value for money and that it was a third cheaper.  Was it reviewed in terms of quality, and did the review include the 60,000 files that were outsourced in 2007 to Quest Diagnostics?  </p></speech>

There was an original tender in 2008, which was awarded to two providers.  In 2009 there was another tendering process, and a framework agreement was set up in 2012.  I can provide that by copy to the committee.  There were a number of other mini-competitions within that framework.  The framework agreement provided for a number of laboratories, and the mini-competition was effectively a mini-competition within that for the supply of laboratories.  For some number of years now, Quest Diagnostics and MedLab Pathology have been the two laboratories involved, with 10% of the testing undertaken by the Coombe hospital.</p> <p>  In terms of quality assurance - and the Deputy will appreciate that I have only looked at this in the last number of days - there is a quality assurance process around the laboratories which covers a range of areas, including the facilities, the staff qualifications, the specimens regime and data entry, among other things.  I will not list everything out, but we can supply that information to the committee.  It involves regular meetings with the laboratories.  There is also a quality assurance group within the programme that looks at that area, including international expertise to support it from outside the Republic of Ireland.  That is a brief summary of the process that is in place around the laboratories.</p></speech>

I do not believe it is acceptable.  I am trying to do my job here.  In order to get through this jigsaw I have made requests to the Secretary General and have asked parliamentary questions about when all the hospital groups and all the individual 11 hospitals involved were made aware of the audit programme.  I have still not been told.  That is unacceptable.  I needed that information today.  I asked for it on 3 May, long before the Scally investigation ever existed.  Why have I not been given that information?  It is a matter of sending an email to 14 people and telling them they have 24 hours to answer a simple question; when did they know about this audit?  They will not tell me.  I wanted to have that information to hand in order to ask Dr. O'Keeffe and Dr. Holohan questions here today.  I cannot do my job because the witnesses are not facilitating me.  It makes me wonder why that is the case.</p> <p>  The situation makes me wonder about the internal politics at play.  The HSE was worried about the briefing that we got yesterday from Mr. McCallion and Dr. Holohan in case accountability was pushed downwards.  I can understand that point of view.  I am worried about ass-covering across organisations; it is undoubtedly happening.  I have the HSE's organisational chart from 2016.  Where are the national director of acute hospitals, Mr. Liam Woods, and the national director of quality assurance and verification, Mr. Patrick Lynch, who is now the chairman of the serious incident management team, SIMT?</p></speech>

I suggest, through Mr. Breslin and through the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who I will contact, that they are here tomorrow.  I have specific questions for both of them.  They had key roles.  When did they know about this?  What did they do about it?  What communications did they have from various people in this room, and others outside this room?  It is not fair that Mr. McCallion is a plenipotentiary, answering questions for them.  He cannot, to be fair.

The Deputy contacted me directly asking that I intervene in relation to his parliamentary questions, after a very long day at the Committee of Public Accounts.  It was late on Thursday night.  I assured the Deputy that I would personally intervene the following morning to try to establish whatever information I could for him.  The first thing I did on Friday morning when I got to the office was to ensure that that detailed information was requested from the HSE as a matter of urgency.  I followed that up on Friday and again on Monday, and last night I discussed the issue with Mr. McCallion to find out what information we were in a position to provide to the Deputy and to stress the urgency of doing so before the committee meetings this morning and tomorrow.  Mr. McCallion assured me he would draft a response - and I am fairly sure he was doing that very early this morning - and get it the Department.

For nearly two and a quarter years, he is involved in the cycle of all the issues going on.  Why did Mr. Connaghan's predecessor appoint somebody who was actually involved in the issue, was part of the decision making, or non-decision making process, to go in and act as the investigator on this issue when he was part of the process in the first place?  The investigator is part of those being investigated as to what went on.</p></speech>

Patrick Lynch had a particular role in the organisation regarding quality assurance so there was a logic in Patrick Lynch being able to head up an SIMT to be able to address this issue at the earliest opportunity.</p></speech>

He was asked to go in and head up a SIMT in regard to responding to the requirement to contact 209 women effectively and very quickly.  The nature of the task he was asked to undertake two weeks ago is slightly different from the position the Deputy is outlining on assurance.</p></speech>

To clarify, information regarding the actual audit was not perceived to be a problem at the time everybody heard abut it.  It was perceived to be a good thing.  An audit such as this one is the last tool in a suite of things we do to quality assure a programme.  When people were briefed, they would have been briefed in the context of knowing that these type of things happen in screening programmes.  They work at a population level but, unfortunately, they do not work for every single individual.  Patrick Lynch would have been involved in supporting a constructive, positive process at the time.  The abject failure here was in the execution of the communication between the treating clinician-----</p></speech>

The reason I am glad Dr. O'Keeffe gave me the earlier date is because I want to know when both of these individuals were aware of this and involved in the process.  I want to know the actions they took and when they took them.  Dr. O'Keeffe did say that, and she has explained clearly that it would have been in the early days of March 2016, but we all know they were part of the conversations after that.

It is important to say to the Deputy, and to other members here this morning, that those briefings were given in the context of either a verbal briefing before the person received it or a briefing at the time the person received it.  In looking at those memorandums now, I can see all kinds of things.  There was never an intention in the screening programme, for example, that those briefings being given to me would be distributed for the public.  It was about trying to understand how it was that they were going to resolve the issue with regard to the challenge from the laboratories to send the letters to the consulting clinicians and what they were going to do about dealing with the historical cases.</p></speech>

Does Dr. O'Keeffe believe that was okay, and that it was ethical?</p> <p>  Second, on the real issue here, Dr. O'Keeffe was in charge of this area.  Subsequently, I understand her position changed and it was no longer part of her area.  Mr. Connaghan might tell us why that happened.  The letters went out to clinicians in June 2016.  What I do not understand is why they were not also sent to the hospital managers, which I would know now if the Department of Health actually did its job and told me the answer?</p><p>That is why I want to make up this jigsaw.  Why were the letters not sent to the hospital managers?  Second, why did Dr. O'Keeffe, in her role, not follow up to understand why these women, who were so badly affected, had not been told?</p></speech>

At the time when this was being discussed, it was clear to me that they were involving many other parties from the colposcopy forum and a whole range of individuals with expertise in this area, including colleagues internationally, on the best approach.  Within that context, I was satisfied that what they had come up with was appropriate in the context of the guidance document.  I absolutely appreciate that, with hindsight, perhaps a different decision could have been made.  At the time, the way it was explained was that there were all sorts of different family types and questions over who would be able to get the information, and that there could be legislative issues with regard to the divulging of information and so on.  I genuinely do not want that to sound like a kind of excuse because I accepted at the time that this was what they had come up with as part of the process.  I completely accept now, in the context of how all these women and their families found out about the matter in the context of this national controversy-----</p></speech>

In the briefing note the Deputy has, from October 2016, it is made very clear that the process we were engaged in over the period had concluded and that the historical letters had been sent to consulting clinicians.  It is very clear within the memo that the programme was engaging colposcopists with treating clinicians to support the process of open disclosure and that they would be issuing letters at a pace of approximately four to six every month as they started to conclude reviews that were coming in.  At that point, they were also hearing about cases that were coming through, which was always the intent.  In carrying out this audit process and in sharing this information with women, the reason they were flagging the media piece was because we always knew that, once women had information, they would have absolutely every right to seek legal advice and legal address if they so chose.  Therefore, we were expecting cases to come through.  What I was not expecting, and what we were all not expecting, was that women would not be told.</p> <p>  After October 2016, I received a management report every month from the screening service stating the audit process was going well and that improvements were being made to the programme.  In about May, June or July &mdash; I have the specifics here if the committee needs them &mdash; it would have stated in the management reports that three cases were going to the State Claims Agency.  That reinforced to me the view that the process was working.  Looking back, I could ask if I should have relied on my one-to-one management team meetings, my senior management team meetings and bimonthly risk reports.  None of those things told me-----</p></speech>

There was a failure in detecting the risk and there was absolutely a failure in its escalation because it is clear to me that there was correspondence in 2017.

With regard to dealing with CervicalCheck, I have a number of questions about the clinicians at the front line.  My understanding, on which I would like clarification, is that they were not advised of the clinical audit taking place and that they were not involved in it.  Second, the first they heard of the clinical audit was when they got notification from CervicalCheck to advise them.  I have reliable information informing me that, in one case, the person was advised there were adverse findings in the reviews of the smears of ten of his patients.  The information all arrived in to him on the one day and he was asked to inform the patients.  I want the delegates to clarify whether the clinicians at the front line in the 15 centres around the country were aware of the clinical audit before it started.  Why were they not involved in the process and kept up to date as it developed?  According to my information, the first involvement of the clinicians was when they were notified of the results of the clinical audit in respect of their patients.</p> <p>  There is information from February and March of 2016 that went out in June.  There was then ongoing communication regarding who should advise the patients.  My information is that there was a meeting on 1 September 2017 with the clinicians.  There was a quite robust debate about the issue.  Therefore, the issue was still not resolved on 1 September 2017 in respect of informing the patients or the backup support being provided to the clinicians.  Surely alarm bells should have been rung at that stage indicating that, 12 months later, the process was still ongoing.  Could I get some clarification on those questions?</p></speech>

I will ask Dr. O'Keeffe to respond.</p></speech>

One of the documents the committee has talks about the process development, that they engage with the colposcopy forum, they engage with the programme colposcopy services and histology laboratories, the cytology lab providers, the quality improvement division and the State Claims Agency.  The documentation and briefings I had suggested that was engagement with the consultants and clinicians.  The October briefing I have, which is very important from my perspective in trying to look back at this and understand how this could have happened, makes it very clear that there was ongoing engagement with the consultants in supporting them with this process.  They had developed a guidance note for them and Professor Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly herself was directly engaging with consultants as they called up, as well as patients.  That was my understanding at the time.</p> <p>  It was not brought to my attention that there were difficulties at that stage.  I would have known that it was an evolving process.  They would have said that this is very challenging and that all the international evidence suggests that this type of disclosure is very challenging.  They would have said, while the treating clinicians were the most appropriate people to do it and that was well-established, it was not an easy thing to do.  They would have described research studies which would have shown the types of fears around this type of thing.  There were actively engaging with that.  They stated in October that this would continue.  As I mentioned already to Deputy Kelly, there was no escalation or no early risk detection communicated on that not happening in practice.</p></speech>

Going back to pre-June 2016, my information is that the clinicians were not engaged in the audit process or were not made aware that there was an audit process in place.</p></speech>

The October briefing makes very clear at the end of it that they would have ongoing meetings.  It stated several consultant doctors have engaged with the National Screening Service, NSS, CervicalCheck and the next steps to be taken, following communication of a review outcome, was that a short explanatory document was developed and accompanying letters issued to consultant doctors that can be found appended.  In addition, it stated:</p><blockquote>Administrative leads in the programme colposcopy services have been advised of the process.  NSS CervicalCheck is providing additional support to consultant doctors in carrying out and assessing open disclosure requirements and appropriate protocols.  Engagement between project consultant doctors would constitute an ongoing process.</blockquote> <p>I may not have known a meeting was happening exactly in September.  However, I would have expected there to have been considerable levels of engagement to ensure the supports being put in place were actually being followed through.</p></speech>

Typically, in those processes, there is a requirement of the senior management team to escalate any new or emerging risks, obviously within the risk register, to be able to detail them comprehensively and at a one-to-one meeting to brief me on anything that may be rising in any of the programmes across the NSS.  Within all of those management reports, it states that the audit process was going well.</p> <p>  Given what has happened and given the fact that actually the communication to women happened in the context of a national controversy where people are worried could it be them or husbands whose wives have died are concerned, that was not the intention.  It was not escalated to me.

Accordingly, I was not able to do anything about it.

Everybody knew what the plan was and what was the intention.  There were no briefings or no escalations of that information that the NSS may have had regarding doctors being uncomfortable with the process.</p> <p>  From what I am aware of, there was clearly a formal escalation of that between the consultant in Limerick and between the clinical director of the CervicalCheck programme that was discussed within the NSS but it was not escalated to me at that time.

This was identified in February 2016.</p><p>However, by September or October 2017 we still did not have the process fully in place about advising the patients and their families.  We are talking about a period of 18 months.  People surely must have become concerned at that stage.</p></speech>

My expectation was that patients were being told.  If they were not being told, it would be for a very small minority of cases where a clinical judgment was being made and where a consultant could stand over that.  Our expectation was that we would be seeing cases coming forward as women were given this information.  Within the October briefing, one will see it states that cases were starting to come through.  The expectation was that women would be told.  It is an incredible deep regret that this did not happen and that people had to be told in the way of this national controversy.</p></speech>

Who was driving that particular programme, who had the responsibility to ensure that the open disclosure policy  was observed in the letter and the spirit?  It would appear that a decision was taken to operate slowly in that particular direction and that this arose from a concern from clinicians regarding the undermining or pre-empting of legal cases that may have been pending  Is that true?</p></speech>

We have a national policy, and we expect the implementation of that to be taken forward in hospital groups, community healthcare organisations and organisations such as CervicalCheck.  We would expect that within the organisation of CervicalCheck, it would have its own internal policies and procedures to ensure the open disclosure policy was effectively deployed.</p> <p>  In my remarks at the outset, I stated that it is quite self-evident that those internal policies and procedures did not take effect in this particular case.  There should have been a flag raised earlier and we readily hold our hands up to that particular failure.</p></speech>

I believe it was two years after the introduction of the policy.  Colleagues around the table may be able to say a little bit more about this.  That review examined how well the open disclosure policy was being supported in certain units.  I am not sure if anyone present recalls that review.  We can make that available to the committee if it wants.</p></speech>

We were involved in some ourselves and I can give some examples including Portlaoise, where the baby deaths occurred.  There was not just not open disclosure, there was active withholding of information from patients.  At the same time and concurrent with the time period of this particular audit, a colonoscopy review was taking place arising from Wexford, where open disclosure was an escalation issue and a concern that was being raised on a continuing basis by the Department.</p></speech>

Did somebody not take it in hand and say that we have this policy of open disclosure.  Why are we deviating from it?  Were the consequences anticipated at the time?  It would appear that the consequences were serious?  What action was taken following that by anybody?</p></speech>

At the policy and legislative level, actions continued in terms of informing and prioritising the legislative effort, which is what I spoke about in my opening statement, that is, on supporting voluntary disclosure, creating the safe space and making disclosure more likely and setting standards for the disclosure that clinicians would do the right thing and support patients through that journey, while ultimately leading to the mandatory disclosure I spoke about briefly earlier.</p></speech>

If the policy is for open disclosure and if some members of staff - I use that term in the all-embracing sense - were not in favour, there was then a conflict within the system.  Did some clinicians state they were not in favour of open disclosure because there were cases pending in which such open disclosure, if now practiced, would leave certain people exposed?  Would I be right in coming to that conclusion?</p></speech>

They were reluctant to take this on board.  That is my understanding as to where this internal dispute, as it were, arose.</p></speech>

I expect that Irish clinicians would have been aware of that and of the growing movement towards open disclosure.  I would be surprised if any clinician in Ireland at that point in time would have said that open disclosure was not a good thing.  </p> <p>  In fact disclosure, as we see in respect of the other process, was undoubtedly a good thing.</p></speech>

We all agreed with that.  But if someone does not practice that, in essence it means that it is not going to work.  If there are people who are opposed to the concept of open disclosure, it will cause a glitch in the system, which it did, and it was a serious one.  We would be entitled to know what happened at that level.  I will come back to the  laboratories in a moment.</p> <p>  Incidentally, is it correct that 50,000 high-grade pre-cancerous changes in women were detected, reducing their risk of cervical cancer by 90%?  Then, I note there was a 7% reduction in cancer generally from 2010 to 2015.  Is that in cervical cancer or all cancers?</p></speech>

We say about 70%.  What that means is in a situation where something is present and one is trying to find it, there is a 70% chance that it will be picked up with the test and a 30% chance that it will be missed.  That is where it is there - the finding is there - but when the great majority of women have a smear, their cervix and cells are normal.  The following question then arises.  If a person has a normal test, how certain can that person be that that normal test is actually correct and the test has been performed well?  The answer in that situation is over 99% of the time.</p></speech>

Our services in terms of performance and protecting the population from the incidence of cervical cancer works better in this country with our organised screening.

The updates we had from the HSE were updates that gave us assurance that the process was taking place over a number of months and that the HSE was problem-solving when issues arose to get through them.  It completed that process around late summer or so in 2016.  I am aware that a clinical audit of that nature is not a common thing in screening programmes internationally.  That is a positive development.  I knew that open disclosure arrangements in respect of those findings would be even less common.  These are features that would have added to the value and the standing of our screening programme in international terms and we saw them as good developments.  There was nothing in that in a broad sense of risk, problem or concern being escalated to us as part of all of that which would be the subject of disclosure.  That was the information we had at the time.  Clearly there were gaps in the system.</p> <p>  It is very clear to see in retrospect that if the arrangement had been in place to have absolute clarity tied down before the commencement of feeding back of those findings with regard to whose job it was, what precisely was going to be fed back by way of a clear open disclosure policy for the service and a clear feedback loop to tell the centre, in this case the screening programme, then this might not have happened.  There is clear learning in respect of all of those things.  Without getting ahead of where Dr. Scally will take us in terms of findings, at a minimum we can see these are developments that will enhance the screening programmes.  The patient safety Bill, which the Minister brought to Cabinet last week, will give the Minister powers to essentially set guidelines for clinical audit that would ensure that when clinical audits are started - of this nature or elsewhere - that in advance of commencement those guidelines would be crystal clear on the question of responsibility for feedback to patients and on the question of feedback to the centre so there is verification the open disclosure has happened.</p></speech>

Despite what Dr. Holohan said, I still think the Minister should have been informed.  We could go around in circles.</p></speech>

I am very happy to hear what Dr. Scally may or may not have to say on that particular question.  We saw the escalation and the decision for escalation on its own merits as something worthwhile in broad terms.  Not everything that I would be aware of either in terms of positive developments or, dare I say, in terms of negative developments in the system would be things I would see as necessary to escalate to the Minister.  We operate on the basis that as much as we can we try to manage and resolve issues if they are things we can manage and resolve and we have a system for that.  I will not tell the Deputy it is a perfect system.  I will and would like to say it is a system that is getting better and better.  For example, we have a patient safety protocol that has been in development and improvement between us and the HSE which captures the kind of information we really need to have when patient safety incidents arise so we are able to discriminate between those circumstances that we really need to be concerned about and where, as the Secretary General said earlier, we need to step in.  There was evidence of that at the time.  There were areas where we were stepping in with regard to other areas.  In respect of this particular one, I understand the Deputy's question.  We did not at the time see it as anything beyond positive developments by international standards.  We were getting the assurances from the HSE around its implementation of that but I am very happy to hear what Dr. Scally has to say about it.</p></speech>

People were coming to my clinics with friends and family.  It was suggested to me that a culture of secrecy had crept into the Department and possibly a lack of transparency and disclosure.  That is obvious.  Will Mr. Breslin comment on this?  Can he see why people would think it?</p></speech>

I certainly feel we try to operate in a transparent fashion.  We approach the need for transparency through our engagements with committees here, freedom of information requests and a range of other forms of accountability such as parliamentary questions.  We are very serious about it.  Dr. Holohan has spoken about probably some of the most difficult and sensitive engagements in which we have been involved when particular patient safety incidents required the Department to work with individuals and their families.  We seek to do so in a very open and caring fashion.  I do not say we have always got it right and that we get it right every time, but if somebody said it to me, I would take it very seriously because I would want to ensure, as we continued to develop the Department, it became one where its reputation would be quite the opposite of what has been said.  I do not believe we have the veil of secrecy that is spoken about.  Much of the interchange on health matters is done in a very open way and often the subject of correspondence between the HSE and the Department, the subject of media debate and so on.  I do not believe it is our ethos.  It is certainly not what I am trying to encourage in the Department and not what I see every day in my engagement with individuals.  They are very professional public servants who are seeking to operate in a way that is accountable; therefore, I would be disappointed if it was the reality.</p></speech>

I would like to restore confidence in the cervical smear process and our ability to furnish the committee and to get the right people in front of it that it wants to see.  Those are my immediate priorities.  In terms of mid-term priorities, implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report will figure quite highly.  I can see many benefits in it.  I come from a system which has geo-aligned health authorities with funding provided on a weighted capitation basis and devolved authority to a lower level.  I think that is good because with devolved authority comes more power but also more responsibility.  That is good and we should do it.</p> <p>  I have a particular interest in encouraging the growth of clinical directorates at local level, both in hospitals and community healthcare organisations.  That is where decision making and power are moved nearer to the front line by investing clinicians with a degree of budget responsibility.  I am a particular fan of it and have operated it very successfully in other jurisdictions.  </p> <p>  Another objective of mine is to ensure the values we must observe in terms of the principles of public life - transparency, openness and personal and organisational accountability - are also quite up on my agenda.  Last but not least, one of the interests I had in applying for the job of deputy director general of operations was related to trying to improve the performance of the health system in Ireland, from elective, emergency and scheduled care points of view and to transform what we were doing in changing the model of care to a better one.</p></speech>

Many members of the committee were members of the Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Healthcare.  When we hear Mr. Connaghan talk about geo-alignment and clinicians in directorship roles, many of us get very excited about that prospect.  In particular, Deputy Bernard J. Durkan is very excited about geo-alignment.  I genuinely wish Mr. Connaghan the best of luck in that regard.</p> <p>  I refer to Professor Scally's letter that was put into the public domain yesterday.  As a member of the committee, the people concerned have been before us since after 10 a.m.  Obviously, there is value in the conversation.  In no way am I trying to shut down any conversation about the CervicalCheck scandal, or whatever we want to call it, but, as indicated by Mr. Breslin in his exchange with Deputy Alan Kelly, there are only 24 hours in the day.  He was answering calls late last Thursday night.  When we are questioning whether people are on holidays and so on, the committee might take on a responsibility to perhaps pause for a moment and let people in the Department and the HSE work with Professor Scally who is very well qualified.  I have heard nobody criticise him in his role or his level of competence.  It is not as if we have been told that this issue will be referred to in 2020.  We have been told it will be referred back by the end of June.  I understand the preliminary report is due to be presented in a couple of weeks.  While I understand the value for the public and committee members in extracting information, I wonder about the material impact of such sessions in the overall investigation.  I also think that discussing the issue in this forum at this time may be contributing to a lack of confidence in the smear programme which, as we all know from the evidence, has actually saved lives since its introduction.  This is my own view.  Perhaps we might discuss it when all of the contributions to the committee have concluded.  I support what Professor Scally said in his letter.  Perhaps we might pause and reflect on the issue until the interim report comes out.  </p> <p>  I want to focus on auditing.  My understanding is a fundamental principle of auditing involves what one does with the information when one receives it.  Mr. Connaghan will be very familiar with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence from his time in the United Kingdom.  It is also used as the standard for many of us in our practice.  At the heart of clinical audit is clinical governance.  It involves reviewing notes and, fundamentally, seeking ways to serve the patient better.  That is what appears to have been lost.</p><p>I am asking about the person who was responsible for designing the audit process.  Dr. O'Keeffe referred to the process that was set up.  It seems very strange that when the audit process started, what would be done with the information when it was received was not considered.  How did that happen in the clinical audit process?  Who is responsible for not designing the process correctly?  Perhaps whoever answers the question will state whether a similar non-ideal audit process is happening in, perhaps, BreastCheck and BowelScreen.</p></speech>

Clinical audit is the systematic review and evaluation of current practice against research-based standards with a view to improving clinical care for service users.  That is the objective.  Colleagues might correct me on this but one of the primary objectives in conducting the audit on cervical cytology was to feed back into the training of those who were interpreting those results, as well as furnishing the women concerned with the results of those audits.  There is a dual purpose, based on my understanding.  One of my clinical colleagues who has been involved in audit might want to make more detailed comments.</p></speech>

It was established in 2008 and 2010, it was decided that it would be audited.  I understand that the programme was governed through an independent statutory agency at the outset and then, during the period of austerity, was merged into the HSE, into the national cancer control programme.  In 2010, it started the audit.  When the open disclosure guidelines were initially published, the service reflected on the information that it had and decided that this information would be of benefit for patients.  It is of benefit for patients anyway because those involved in the service are trying to improve all elements of the care pathway, from the letters that they issue if there is no one at the address or to general practitioners, GPs.  There are many parts of the cervical screening process that could fail.  The audit looks at all of those processes.  It is of huge benefit to patients in identifying any problems.  It is important to note that with this particular audit, the cervical screening service has stated that there are no systemic issues of note and that the programme is working well.  The open disclosure element, with regard to making a decision that the information on individual patients' reviews is of benefit to patients, was the right decision to make in 2010.  It will be interesting to finally hear Dr. Scally's findings on this with regard to the journey.  It has clearly been a process that has been evolving.  Whether those decision-making points many years ago were the right decisions, that is, to continue with the process approach rather than making finite decisions that we would stop all the cases that we reviewed up to that point and only do open disclosure prospectively, the service committed to ensuring, in the decision that it made, that the information it had would benefit all patients who had been diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer and had a history of screening.</p></speech>

I say that because I have been involved in research ethics committees for a long time.  It is a moot point whether all audit should go in front of a research ethics committee or not but something of this magnitude would have benefitted from review.  On such a committee, one would have had, as well as colleagues and service users, an ethicist.  A core principle for successful work is that one does not impose a duty on somebody who is not represented in one's protocol.  At the heart of this is that clinicians were expected to do something that they had not been involved in from a very early stage.  If they had been, then much of the subsequent debate as to who should have done the informing would have been short-circuited.</p></speech>

The conversation would have arisen about who will tell the person or family affected by this.  The absence of clinicians in that initial audit design process led to the issues that started to happen in summer 2016.</p></speech>

To my mind, she can be given credit for being involved in the reversal of the downward trend in the HPV vaccine.  Just because her head has rolled in this instance is not to say that she never did any good, since she had significant impact on the HPV vaccine uptake.  The witnesses outlined two roles that she had in a half-time job, which I imagine is probably 18 hours a week - I do not know.  Many of us here do 18 hours of work in a day.  It seems like a very important role.  Now it is vacant.  It was a half-time role, which was filled by a clinician.  Is there a move to get that filled as quickly as possible?</p></speech>

With regard to Professor Flannelly, I can also point out, while others are pointing out what she did with the HPV vaccine, that she was one of the people instrumental in helping to get the political buy-in to establish the programme.  She had recently come back, if I recall correctly, from the UK and I remember her testimony about her shock at seeing women who were young coming with late stage presentations of gynaecological malignancies that were often preventable.  The programme that she developed and directed for ten years is another contribution that she has made to saving lives.</p></speech>

She became highly aware, as a witness mentioned earlier, that we are doing about the same amount of smear tests now as we did ten years ago.  They simply are being done differently.</p><p>Everybody is getting a go at it here.  In Sl&aacute;intecare, we talk about a single-tier health service based on need, not ability to pay.  In this case, it is actually a success story in the sense we have managed to - I want to phrase this correctly - get to every woman and every demographic in the country, when we were not doing this ten years ago.</p></speech>

There is still another 20% we would like to get to.  The uptake rate is about 80%, which is good, but we still have the message of wanting to have women come back into a programme they can trust.  That has turned around a rising incidence of cervical cancer that we had in 2008 into one that is falling now at about 7% per year.  That is a significant contribution that will be made to mortality and survival.</p> <p>  If I am not wasting the Deputy's question time, I want to comment on the reference to NICE and to point out some of the kinds of learnings we have.  We have more of the architecture now than we might have ever had before in terms of implementation.  Legislatively, there has been the patient safety Bill I mentioned earlier, giving the Minister guidelines to set capacity.  We also have a ministerially-appointed committee, chaired by Dr. Karen Ryan, a palliative care consultant, with a broad range of consultants called the national clinical effectiveness committee that, essentially, oversees the endorsement of national guidelines, early warning scores and so on, with which the Deputy might be familiar, as well as clinical audit.  The first clinical audit that was endorsed through that mechanism was the trauma audit last year, which directly informed the trauma strategy that was approved by Government as a consequence.  That is the kind of structured approach to audit that we have and which will give us the kind of machinery, if I can put it in those terms, to enable verifiable implementation of some of the learnings we will have from all of this.</p></speech>

A lot of the narrative in the media and in here has been around who knew what and when, and it was Vicky Phelan who used that phrase initially, if I remember correctly.  It seemed to be very clear from all the documentation we received that there is no evidence this was ever escalated to ministerial level.  From the evidence, I think we can see that is the case.  Dr. Holohan should please intervene if I am not stating things that are factually correct because it is very confusing.  What I am confused about is this idea that we moved from the period of February-March 2016 up to summer of 2016, when there was an issue with the lab getting involved and this pause was put on, and then we moved into the summer months where, it is my understanding, those within the Department thought the process was going ahead and there was nothing flagged to them to suggest there was any reason to be alerted to anything untoward, yet we are told here today they did not know that the treating clinicians had a problem with telling patients the information.</p> <p>  It was Senator Colm Burke who mentioned how many clinicians were involved - I think the number was 29.  It is a small community.  They talk, and there are medical people within the Department and within the HSE structure.  I do not understand how, even on the grapevine, it did not filter down that there was an issue among the consultant clinicians who were treating women who had active cancer, given this was a retrospective look-back at their smears.  If that is the case, the fact the HSE was operating in a vacuum is even more apparent.  It seems incredible to me that some doctor at some conference, or some gynaecologist, would not pick up the phone and say, "Did you get a letter from CervicalCheck making you telling whoever about whatever?"  That element seems incredible.  I am not accusing anybody.  I am just trying to get to where we are probably going next in the story.</p></speech>

I can say, from my own point of view, that any interfaces I would have had with that professional group were almost exclusively focused on the obstetrics side of that, given all of the policy issues we have been dealing with in recent years.</p></speech>

It is clear in the documentation, when they are talking about how they develop the audit process, and it is certainly very clear throughout the briefings, particularly in the October briefing, that they are actually stating - for example, in the paragraph I read out earlier today - that they are engaging with consultants and clinicians in an ongoing way to support them with this process, writing out to the clinicians with regard to the support for the communications and the support to be able to have this conversation with women.  All of those documents are there.  It is the case, however, that if there were issues or concerns arising within CervicalCheck, and I say "if" because the only person who can really give us that answer fully is not here today, because the person who engaged with those consulting clinicians in the main was Professor Flannelly herself, then either she felt it was being dealt with or it was not escalated as an issue.</p></speech>

While I understand the pressures that are on the system since the controversy broke, I would like to highlight one particular case that really brings home the anguish and worry of women across the country, and that is the case of Jacinta Doyle.  She is a Wexford woman and mother of two who had a smear in 2011 which did not flag any issues but, in 2012, when she presented to her doctor with chronic back pain, she was referred for a scan - which she had to pay for privately, incidentally - and that is when her diagnosis was made.  My concern is the ongoing firefighting approach we have seen since the controversy broke.  This lady spent 12 days trying to get answers as to where she goes next.  She initially called the helpline on 28 April but got no response.  She then called on 3 May but got no response.  She then contacted CervicalCheck via a Facebook post on 7 May.  It was only on 10 May that she was told her original smear was tested in the US and that this lab was no longer used.</p><p>That constant drip-feed of these stories we hear in the media is not reassuring to the women of Ireland.  Furthermore, from a general practice point of view, it is only really in the past few days that we have got any clear direction in order to provide the free smear programme, which GPs are more than happy to do.  While it is clear that, for patients with medical cards, we can use an STC, or special-type claim, and put the medical card number on it, for private patients I understand we are instructed to use the patient's PPS number.  Can the witnesses clarify if there is a breach of data protection, as I understand there may be some issue in this regard?</p><p>Second, Dr. Holohan stated in his submission:</p><blockquote>It has become clear since the case that the non-disclosure of clinical audit findings was widespread.  It has also become clear that the issue of disclosure was the subject of dispute among some elements of the relevant clinical community.  I can provide assurance that the Department was not aware of these issues until this controversy arose...</blockquote> <p>It is very difficult for people watching this today to understand or believe how this could be the case.  I would like an answer as to how the Department was not aware of this until the controversy broke.  Really and truly, the women of Ireland need reassurance about this.  While I am not suggesting Dr. Holohan is misinforming the committee, it is very difficult for people to understand this.</p><p>Dr. Holohan said he has been chief medical officer for the last ten years and he has escalated many issues to various Ministers, be it Ms Harney or Deputy Martin, over the years.  He has a long-standing history of doing this, which is to be welcomed.  Why did he feel this was not an issue that needed escalation?</p><p>In hindsight, do the witnesses feel this decision was a misjudgment?  </p><p> Looking at the Minister's diary from 26 November 2015, I can see that the then Minister for Health attended a HSE directorate meeting.  Did any of the witnesses attend that meeting?  </p></speech>

In terms of the response, I acknowledge the scale of what has happened and of trying to put a cohesive response in place.  The screening programme is a relatively small service.  CervicalCheck has just over 30 staff, which includes managing and running the service day to day.  The helpline was effectively inundated in those first number of days with a very low response rate.  To date, there have been over 17,800 calls as of our report last night.  A total of 14,290 of those have been responded to.  This still leaves a very significant number.  As I think I explained at one committee meeting last week, I do not want to go over old ground but in simple terms, we set up four call centres to try to deal with this.  One is in Cork, which takes the initial calls.  Typically, it is able to handle 25% to 30% of the calls at the first point of contact from the women who are concerned.  All of the others are requesting callback from a clinician.  That is one of the key issues for us at the moment in terms of making enough clinical staff available to deal with the responses.  We triage those calls into a number of categories.  One is where a woman has a normal smear history so the call is taken to Limerick where the centre is based and they go on to the system to pull down the information for that woman so it is not actually just a phone call and a conversation.  It involves looking at their full clinical history so that we can then determine who is best placed to talk to that woman about the concerns she expressed.  If the woman has a normal smear history, our call centre in Waterford or public health take that call.  If there is an abnormal smear history, there are two centres in Dublin and Limerick, which we try to resource to take those calls.  The final category are people who have had a cancer history or colposcopy.  We have put a model in place for the hospitals where the women contact them directly.  It is fair to say that there is significant stress and strain in that model.  Obviously, we had to put it in very quickly.  We brought in some expertise around call centre management but it is after the act.  One would certainly not be doing this in the normal course of events.</p> <p>  In respect of the case mentioned by the Senator-----</p></speech>

I will take the specific case and then the broader learning from it.  I became aware of the specific case late last night and have asked for the woman to get a callback this morning.  It came to me through a different source and I have asked for an arrangement to be put in place for her this morning.  We are taking them chronologically so that people are waiting for the shortest period of time possible but in terms of clinical resources, we are pulling the resources from the hospitals.  That is where the clinical staff are based.  The screening service itself has a very small pool of clinical staff who can answer those questions.  The cancer screening programme is also supporting it.  We are looking from all the agencies - those that are contracted and those that are not.  We have looked at cross-Border options.  We have tried to ensure that no stone is left unturned to maximise that.  We have made some progress but I accept that it is still an extensive delay for some people in getting through.  Our priority is to look at those women who have had a history first.  These women are being prioritised with the hospitals, which are working through those cases this week.  That is the overall response.  With regard to the specific case mentioned by the Senator, last night, I asked that the woman in question receive a call this morning.</p></speech>

Our understanding is that we were able to use that.  There have been some queries back and we are solving those but the advice we took at the time was that this was an appropriate mechanism to ensure that GPs were reimbursed for seeing all patients because this is a population health screening programme.  It does not just apply to medical card holders.</p></speech>

It is normal because there is a failure rate and everybody should know so really the women should have known.  I do not like that because it suggests it was the women's fault because they did not know that there would be a 30% failure rate.  All of this stuff makes really interesting reading in the documentation provided so far.  The reason for this is that one can see a clear escalation in terms of the number of cases and what people were thinking along the way.  If we go to the March 2016 briefing note, we see the logging of cases.  Work is under way by the State Claims Agency to extend the architecture of the national incident management system to facilitate logging of incident cases for screening programmes.  That would suggest that we know that we have something here that may escalate.  What I am trying to get at is people's awareness of the existence of a really big problem.  How often do normal meetings to brief the Minister about what is happening take place?</p></speech>

Then, if they did react the Department had the headlines in mind.  The approach suggests if the women were going to react or speak out then the Department had to be prepared.  To me it seems like a defence mechanism.  I take what Mr. Breslin says about confidence is the screening but-----</p></speech>

If the intention was to withhold information, what was the process of generating letters all about?  It was the opposite of withholding information.  It was generating individual reports and issuing letters for the purposes of passing that information out into the system to be passed on to individual women.  I am looking at this in reflection and trying to be objective about it.  If the purpose was to withhold information, those letters would never have been generated.  I do not believe they would have been.</p></speech>

Let us suppose a person wants her file.  Maybe this question is relevant to Mr. Connaghan as well.  Let us suppose a woman wants her medical file today.  How is she going to get it?  How long is it going to take her?  If a woman goes to her general practitioner and seeks a medical file from the consultant, how long will it take her to get it?  Who is responsible for giving it to her?</p></speech>

This is iterated throughout all the other briefing notes as well.  Since 2008 the programme has facilitated the provision of information to women and their legal representatives whenever they require it.  The information note to consultants states that women have a right to access information on all their files and that they can also go to the CervicalCheck programme to get that information.</p></speech>

I want to go back to where the non-disclosure process failed, that is to say, between the consultants and their patients.  Mr. Breslin said earlier that the general issues in the 2006 documentation covered the fact that there was going to be disclosure to patients and this could lead to risks and so forth.  None of that was escalated to Mr. Breslin or the Minister.  My question is specifically on the issue of consultants not relaying the information to patients.  When did the Department first become aware that was happening?</p></speech>

The knowledge of that was consequent on the Vicky Phelan case.  There was no knowledge in the Department of the widespread non-disclosure that has taken place.  The first we were aware of it was consequent on the Vicky Phelan case.  Then, our awareness of it was only increased and heightened by the information arising from looking at the 208 or 209 cases and trying to identify through the serious incident management-----</p></speech>

In the interest of time I am going to keep going.  No one in the Department had any knowledge before April of this year that consultants may not have been passing the information on to patients.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

There is widespread belief in a clinical link between non-disclosure and outcomes for the women involved.  My understanding is that there is no clinical link.  In other words, had the women been told about the identification of the false negatives the day they were identified it would have made no difference to their clinical treatment and outcomes.  Maybe this is a question for the doctors on the panel.  Am I correct in that belief?</p></speech>

It relates to what I regard as misleading information given to the women.  The briefing note states:</p><blockquote>As with all screening tests, cervical screening is not 100% accurate. Screening cannot give a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;no&rsquo; answer and a negative screening result does not mean that the disease will not develop in future.</blockquote> <p>That is what people were told.  Will the medics before the committee indicate whether they believe giving that information made sense?  In reality we now know is that had the disease been present or had abnormalities been present there was only a 70% chance that the screening would actually pick them up.  Do the medics before the committee believe stating that screening is not 100% accurate was appropriate?  Many people, including me, would be led to believe that the accuracy percentage is perhaps in the high 90s.  Could that have led women to being less vigilant with regard to becoming symptomatic, given that they were told screening is not 100% accurate?  I would have taken it that I was meant to believe it was 99% accurate but that I had the all-clear.  Is it possible that there is a causal link between clinical outcomes for women and information that suggested the screening was more accurate than it actually was?</p></speech>

We would have to go back and look at the data but I would be fairly confident that the coverage of the programme has been increasing year on year, which would suggest that that is not the case.  The coverage of the programme is increasing year on year.  It is now up to 80% and was at 79% a year ago.  That means that more of the population is being covered over that period of time, which means more of the population is coming for their results.  The target is 80% and we are now at 80%.  As Dr. Holohan has said earlier, we would like to see that go even higher but it is a very high participation level-----</p></speech>

Dr. O'Keeffe is talking about the percentage of the population covered.  I am talking about an individual woman.  An individual woman is told that the test is not 100% accurate.  That is the information she is given and that is the information consultants are given.  The reality is that if that woman has pre-cancerous cells, the screening has about a seven in ten chance of spotting them.  If I were told that the test was not 100% accurate, I would not infer from that information that the test was only 70% accurate.  Do the witnesses believe the information provided to women is accurate or misleading?  If it is misleading, is it reasonable to suppose that it could have led to less vigilance than might otherwise have been the case, which could have clinical repercussions?</p></speech>

Accuracy refers to the combination of both sensitivity and specificity.  In other words, when we add up all of the correct numbers, whether correct positives or negatives, it will be over 99%.  An individual woman can have confidence that her result is more than likely 99% accurate.  Within that however, the Deputy is correct about the sensitivity and there is a question here to which we must be open.  If, when the Scally processes finishes, there are recommendations on risk communication they will need to be taken on board.  Across the practice in medicine we have encouraged too much, in an almost paternalistic sense, dependence on tests that are always fallible.  People get the sense that they are 100% effective with every result but in reality, there is no test of which I am aware for which that is actually true.  The phrase that is conventionally understood for general diagnostic work of "all clear" is not something that is accurate.  Therefore, we need to be more clear in the way we communicate risk in the context of tests than we have been historically.</p></speech>

Let us be very clear here.  The instruction in the case of the deceased was to stick a note on her file but there was no instruction at all to disclose.  In no way, shape or form was there an instruction to disclose in any of those template letters.</p></speech>

The programme has told me that these templates would have been amended for the specific purposes of each individual piece of correspondence going to consulting clinicians.  The reason the letter says "if open disclosure is indicated in the case" is that for some people, there is no discordance between the two reviews.  However, for other people, open disclosure is indicated in the case.  While I accept that it is not mandatory or total open disclosure and that clinical judgment is allowed for within the documentation and advice to doctors, one can also see that the programme is suggesting to the doctors how best to communicate the information and how important it is to do so.</p></speech>

The witness has said that 120 letters had been issued with no adverse reaction.  Did nobody think that might have been because the information was not getting to the women?</p></speech>

Preparing for the adverse reaction was, again, back into ensuring that the reputation of the programme would be minded as women would talk about this in a public forum.  We were expecting women to do that.  We were expecting women to seek their files from CervicalCheck and, if they chose, to seek legal redress.  There was an expectation-----</p></speech>

Much of what we are discussing here has to do with us looking at information that should have had a red flag.  The HSE team seemed completely unconcerned.  Now, that HSE team seems concerned with apologising and telling us that with hindsight it would, of course, have been different.  However, the witness and her colleagues are not paid for their hindsight.  They are paid to take action when an issue comes up.  An adverse reaction was expected.  There was no adverse reaction and yet nobody thought to question it.  If that is the case-----</p></speech>

The current medical practitioner ethical code from 2016 states that "if it is unclear whether the patient consented to the disclosure of information after their death, you should consider how the disclosure might benefit or cause distress to the deceased&rsquo;s family or carers.".  That is the current set of guidance for medical practitioner and the code under which doctors operate.</p></speech>

Is it possible to send out an email in the Department of Health, by next week, asking anybody with any knowledge in respect of this issue to bring it forward?  I also ask that by this day next week that information be provided on all meetings or discussions that anyone is aware of, and are in any way documented, about CervicalCheck since 2011?

I ask Mr. Breslin to make sure it is all covered.  The second issue is just an observation.  Mr. Breslin has said he was not told about any of these issues until the Vicky Phelan case came light.  I accept that.  How does he feel that senior management in the HSE - the top tier, bar Mr. Tony O'Brien - was aware of these issues in respect of the process and audit since March 2016?  I refer to the evidence of Dr. O'Keeffe.  Some of the senior managers were also aware of the Vicky Phelan case since the summer of 2017.  Does that not tell Mr. Breslin that there is a serious failure both in management in the HSE and also in the overlap of communications with the Department?</p></speech>

I believe during the course of the morning, there has been a lot of reasonable and plausible presentation of the information showing that the core issue of widespread non-disclosure existed within the CervicalCheck programme and was not escalated sufficiently both within the HSE and within the Department.  We have talked about the management systems that were working within the HSE at the time.  That is a separate question but I cannot blame someone for not passing on something if he or she did not know it.</p></speech>

Had it anything to do with the fact that one of the two women, who took legal cases before they unfortunately passed away, Lord rest them, had been told about her situation in respect of a number of smears taken some years previously?  She had been notified just prior to that date.</p><p>Was there any correlation between the fact that she had just been told and this document and the process of communicating it upwards or across?  Subsequently the case went legal in April and the lady, unfortunately, passed away in June.  I have spoken to members of her family.  They are going through a legal process, which is not very nice and is contrary to some other evidence we have heard in respect of the State Claims Agency.  I want to know because the family wants to know whether there is any correlation in that case which is actually referenced in the document.  It references one case which, I presume, is this one.  The lady also did not make the meeting on 3 March because she was too sick to attend.  She was never able to have the meeting with CervicalCheck.</p></speech>

There was a process CervicalCheck had started to instigate.  A laboratory suggesting CervicalCheck should not be sending letters to treating clinicians threatened the process.  In that context, I received a presentation the day before the first meeting, which for the record was in February.  I received a presentation from Professor Flannelly on the audit.  Although there are many other meetings I do not particularly remember, I remember a lot about the particular meeting because it was new information.  I remember initially feeling a sense of concern about the audit as to whether it was throwing up any factor or issue with the integrity of the screening programme.  I satisfied myself that it was not and was happy with that.  We addressed the issue with the laboratory and it was going to continue to engage, although that became a little more problematic in March, as can be seen from the briefings.</p> <p>  I also genuinely remember Professor Flannelly talking about the case from the perspective of what we should do as part of it.  CervicalCheck was certainly conscious to alert me to the fact that it was engaging in this and that it intended for patients to receive their information  I actually remember Professor Flannelly telling me that CervicalCheck would be providing the lady with all of the information on advice received from its solicitor.  I remember saying at the time that there was no need to wait for the solicitor and that the person could be given the information.  However, CervicalCheck was very conscious that, because it was engaging in the process with the intent that women would receive the information and knew that it clearly would result in cases, it wanted to ensure it could protect the totality of the programme.  It knew that cases would come up in carrying out the audit.  </p> <p>  From my perspective as a national director, it was very important to ensure there was nothing else within the findings of the audit that was troubling or concerning and that we had a safe programme.  We do have a very safe programme.  What is being found through the audit is within all of the normal parameters.  While I absolutely accept the criticism that the briefings are very process oriented and not personal, the conversations are personal.  There was a personal conversation about the difficulties in having that conversation.  However, as can be seen in the February briefing, there was a statement to the effect that this is what CervicalCheck did and that Professor Flannelly would meet patients, which she went on to do.  That is what happened at the first briefing.</p></speech>

On page 4 there is a reference to 317 cases as having been flagged for further review which focused on more than one area.  It states:</p><blockquote>In most (although not all) of these reviewed cases there may have been an opportunity for earlier intervention.  This includes instances of pre-cancerous cell changes that were not detected, no referral or a delay in referral to colposcopy, and a delay in diagnosis or treatment.</blockquote> <p>Are these issues other than the cytology that are affecting the clinical treatment of women?  Perhaps the delegates might speak about it.  </p><p>My other question is addressed to Dr. Holohan.  Will he expand on the advice he gave to the then Minister in 2015 that we should go for voluntary rather than mandatory disclosure?  </p><p>I am not sure who would like to take those questions.  It is really about further delays in diagnosis, other than those caused by false negatives.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-05-16a.706" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018051600002#DD01800"><p>The advice I gave was that there had been advocacy for mandatory open disclosure in all circumstances.  The advice I gave reflected on a review and examination of the international evidence which showed that, although it was almost counterintuitive, it was the case that mandatory open disclosure in all circumstances carried with it risks in the sense that it, first, sometimes conferred a view among medical practitioners that the risk of medical legal actions was increased, which could make them less likely and less willing to make such disclosures.  If it is applied as written in all situations, as opposed to being targeted at the most serious cases, as we plan to do, it will unnecessarily bureaucratise the reporting and potentially lead to mandatory disclosure.</p> <p>  The reality is culture is what is important as opposed to law.  The law may say something, but, frankly, doctors do not tend to look to it for guidance in conducting clinical practice.  Something in the law might lead to more box ticking style reporting.  We want to encourage the safe space and support the culture of open disclosure in its development by ensuring that when something goes wrong which is the reality and a feature of everyday clinical practice because the sciences, people and technologies are not perfect, the first thing that is done is that, rather than withdrawing from patients, as we have seen happen in some patient safety instances, doctors, nurses and other senior staff will metaphorically put their arms around the patients and support them through understanding.  That is a relationship that is built over time; it is not a single event.  Putting something in legislation on its own will not deliver that culture.  </p> <p>  The view is that the combination of mandatory reporting, where appropriate, and voluntary support by giving doctors assurance that protection will be available in wider circumstances if they come forward and do the right thing in the so-called safe space will lead to and support more a culture of open disclosure.  We will have standards for how that open disclosure should be done, recorded and so on.  The science on it, so to speak, is not absolute.  These are judgments.  There is not a huge body of international evidence in that regard, but it tends to point in that direction.  There are other areas of social science and so on where these questions also play out.  The extent of mandatory reporting can sometimes actually drive down reporting, increase fear on the part of those reporting and so on.  </p> <p>  That was the reason for the advice which the Oireachtas committee reflected in its report.</p></speech>

I am trying not to be personal here but how could that have happened?  How could we have started off with an audit process that was flawed because how the results would get to the patient was not considered?  How was it not considered, discussed or known by Dr. O'Keeffe that treating clinicians would perhaps have an issue in giving the information to a patient?  As one of the gentlemen present said, it would be a departure from normal day-to-day activities.  How does Dr. O'Keeffe feel about how she did her role, in the sense that she did not make a decision or consider a pathway to informing the patients?  Does she think she did her job right?  I am not looking for another head here.  I am just trying to get to who made that decision and what it was based on, or was it just that Dr. O'Keeffe did not know?  Maybe it is as simple as that she did not know what to do and that she was not equipped-----</p></speech>

Does she not accept that at her level, perhaps she should not just accept what she is told?  Does she not accept, and I would think that it would have been fairly obvious to anyone who had worked in clinical medicine, that doctors would have had an issue disclosing information that was not part of their testing?  A woman with active cancer has a consultant in charge, so more than likely it was not at the GPs where they had the smear done, it was with the next doctor.  I would have thought it was fairly basic that one would assume that clinicians would have a problem disseminating the information down.</p></speech>

My understanding is that 275,000 smears are taken per annum.  With regard to people who have not been identified with cancer, is there any view now that a sample audit should be done of people who have been advised they are all clear, just because of what has occurred?  Does Dr. McKenna believe an audit should be done in respect of this at present?  Is he satisfied the programme as it currently functions is doing so in a proper manner?</p></speech>

My office is making the arrangements with the RCOG and the British Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, who will conduct the independent expert clinical audit, which will start with all of the cases of cancer that have been notified since 2008 at the inception of the programme, and bring them right the way through an assessment to come to a determination in respect of each of the individual cases.</p></speech>

The February 2016 briefing note stated the legal team was reviewing the content of case reports to be communicated and would advise.</p><p>The note continued, "Await advice of solicitors."  Is the advice of solicitors on how the information should be communicated in writing and is it available?</p></speech>

The legal advice emphatically supported the position of the CervicalCheck programme that it had a right, and indeed an obligation, to communicate that information to patients but that it had to be very careful about how it did so.</p></speech>

We had a meeting on 27 April with the team in CervicalCheck to agree the way forward.  CervicalCheck then had a meeting to resolve the issue.  In or around April, there would have been legal advice.  I can give what I have to the Senator.</p></speech>

Surely, having already received that legal advice in April 2016, more than 14 months later someone in CervicalCheck, the Department or anyone else who was aware that the information was not being given out must have been aware of the seriousness of that legal advice not being followed through.</p></speech>

This was what they sought through the process they established and what they expected when the letters would be sent out.  They engaged in a whole series of activities to ensure the consultants were supported in doing that.  I cannot say what happened within the CervicalCheck programme or the national screening service around that time because, as I said, any concerns that were raised with them were not reported to or discussed with me.  We know of one consultant's specific concern, which I know was discussed previously.</p></speech>

We have asked CervicalCheck why the information was not escalated and so on.  Again, the Scally inquiry will have to determine this fully, but within the CervicalCheck programme I think there was a lack of a perception of what that risk might mean once CervicalCheck realised, certainly with the correspondence from Dr. Hickey, that that information was not being communicated to patients.  However, I cannot really comment because I was not involved in any of the conversations and had none of the information.  There is a clear risk-----</p></speech>

I find it strange that we now have only a written record of one medical clinician being concerned about getting the information out there.  Is Dr. O'Keeffe saying the other 28 did not communicate at all and, at the same time, the information did not get out to the 200 patients?</p></speech>

The Senator would have to speak to CervicalCheck directly but, from the programme's perspective, those involved seemed to think the correspondence from Dr. Hickey was specific to him.  That is my sense.</p></speech>

I know that my colleague, Dr. Colm Henry, as the national clinical adviser for the acute hospitals division at the time, directly intercepted to try to resolve what was an issue.  However, I was not party or privy to any of the conversations about it.  I was not aware of it at all.</p></speech>

Regarding Dr. Henry's role at that time, all kinds of matters concerning doctors across all kinds of specialties and subspecialties get raised to an acute hospital divisional clinical lead, and Dr. Henry would go in to try to resolve the programme and move on.  Dr. Henry genuinely would not have been aware, nor would I have expected him to be aware, of any of the context of this.  He would have been presented with a problem, supported its resolution and moved on to something else.</p></speech>

It is called politics.  Let us deal with the matter in a different fashion.  I have a comment to make and it is not personal in any way.  In no way have I any acrimony towards any of the personalities involved at all.</p><p>However, my long-time view is that the HSE is an inappropriate structure to deliver health services to the country at large.  Comparisons have been made with the greater Manchester area, the population of which is equal, but they do not apply as geographically it is vastly different.  In recent years we have had complaints from the regions about a lack of accountability, liaison, consultation and so on.  It will never work and this is a classic example of why not.  In the communication system, either up or down the line, the chain of command did not operate.  The communication that should have taken place never did.  This will be repeated time and again.  The Minister has promised to change the system.  I hope he does because if he does not, whoever sits on the other side of the room will be here again in two or three' years, or perhaps six months, but it is inevitable that these things will happen again. </p><p> We did not dwell on the dispute between Quest Diagnostics and CervicalCheck.  When the issue arose initially, legal advice was sought on full public disclosure.  Am I correct in assuming that legal advice was sought in that regard or was the public disclosure policy in abeyance?</p></speech>

It received legal advice that it could go ahead but that it had to be careful about the mode, method and content, that the individual details needed to be clear and so on.  I recall one email had legal advice appended to it.  There is possibly an awful lot more in the CervicalCheck programme and I will be happy to furnish whatever documentation the Deputy wishes to see.</p></speech>

My worry at the time was how long it might take since, if a dispute resolution process was invoked, sometimes these things could take forever.  In fairness to the programme, once it received its legal advice, it met the relationship manager, or whatever the individual's title was at the time, with the CervicalCheck programme, the national screening service, and the issue was resolved between them.  My understanding is they did not necessarily have an issue with the letters being sent, but that they did have a concern that there might be something in the letters that might bias the interpretation, or something like it.  One meeting seemed to settle it and there was possibly some correspondence back and forth, but it was settled and the programme resumed the sending of letters.</p></speech>

Representatives of the State Claims Agency were present when I was at the meeting of the Committee on Public Accounts on Thursday.  They explained the totality of the role as also including advice on risk.  Their advice in a healthcare setting is on taking an open approach, identification of incidents early and giving a response early, rather than waiting for legal writs to fly.  If one looks at the State Claims Agency's database, it has hundreds of thousands of incidents.  It wants everyone to feed in issues that happen within the health service and be proactive in responding to them.  I would be very surprised if anyone in the State Claims Agency was to say they were in favour of closing things down.  I think they would take an open attitude to issues as they arose.</p></speech>

The doctors received letters that gave them the information; they received the guidance.  As one can see from the audit process methodology, processes were in place to consult people on the whole thing.  There may be some very genuine reasons within that because when the CervicalCheck programme was developing its approach to open disclosure and the intent was to give the information to women - this is something on which we will have to reflect in hindsight - it did envisage that there would be circumstances where it might not be either appropriate-----</p></speech>

I am looking through the minutes and I see that some referrals are urgent and some are non-urgent.  The reason I ask is that I have been contacted by several people who tell me that they experienced symptoms following a smear test that did not show up anything.  I will not get into a discussion about percentages.  By virtue of the fact that they had recently had a smear test with a clear result, these women tell me that they are being categorised as non-urgent.   In some instances the fear, or indeed the fact, is that they have developed cancer in the intervening time.  </p></speech>

I know we are into our fifth or sixth hour here and I know the witnesses are dealing with this issue at the same time, so I want to thank them all for their time.  It is appreciated.</p> <p>  I refer specifically to the women being supported.  The HSE data on Monday, indicated that about two in every five women looking for a return call had yet to receive one.  Could the witnesses give us a quick update on how many of the women who have requested a callback are still waiting for one, how long they have now been waiting, and when we are going to have this resolved?  </p></speech>

Some 10,666 women had requested callbacks from a clinician as of yesterday.  The number of women who have yet to receive one is now 3,562.  As to when this will be closed out, I note that at the moment there has not been a significant drop in call volume.  Effectively we have to plan on the basis of two things.  One is that we will have to plan to continue with this for a certain period, until people have a certain level of satisfaction.  Then the call volume may drop.  Second, I note that the CervicalCheck helpline was always there, but it had a different purpose.  It was intended to facilitate and advise.  My view is that in light of this we will have to strengthen it beyond the current week so that it provides greater assurance to women.  Moreover, the people manning the line will have to be clinical staff.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question about how long it will take, I think that will be contingent on the duration of the issue.  If people call us then we have an obligation to get back to them, and we will continue to do that.  That is challenging.  I described it earlier.  We need clinical staff, whom we are trying to pull out of services and hospitals.  Those women who have more complex needs, in the sense that they have a history of colposcopy or cancer, need to talk to an oncology or a gynaecology nurse as well as medical support.  We will have to monitor that week by week.  I cannot give a date by which we will have dealt with all the queries, because the situation is changing each day.  As I say, while there have been some dips in the number of outstanding queries, it has typically come back up again.</p> <p>  In the long term, I have mentioned that I do believe we will need to strengthen the helpline to provide support to people over the next six, nine or 12 months as we hopefully turn the corner, give women assurance on the screening service and deal with the many questions, some of which have been captured over the last week or two.  As I have mentioned, it was largely an administrative line.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their time today.  I know they have given a considerable amount of time, and that they are all under pressure.  Let us call a spade a spade.  It is the issue everyone is discussing and it is a national crisis, so I appreciate their time.  I also appreciate their frankness.   There have probably been some learnings today for Mr. Connaghan and that will continue tomorrow, trust me.  I am one of the few people who are on both committees.  I wish to say to Dr. O'Keeffe that we will probably need more information by tomorrow about the relevant teams, what they did and how the issue was escalated.</p> <p>  My question relates to the national performance oversight group.  This issue surely came up in the group's work.  How did it come up?  What was dealt with?  What was done?  Can we have the minutes of meetings relating to this period please?  </p></speech>

I believe this issue was mentioned the group's meeting on March 16.  That was merely a mention that the audit was taking place.  We, that is the national performance oversight group, were advised that it was taking place.  There is nothing in the minutes of those meetings that fostered any action.  If there was an issue with communication at the time, nothing in the minutes outlines a concern.</p></speech>

It is very much appreciated.  I note that there is a lot of misinformation out there.  For instance, on Sunday evening I had a discussion with nurses who believed that the audit was carried out in respect of people who had not been diagnosed with cancer, and that information was kept from them.  Given this type of misinformation, is a plan being put in place to get up-to-date information out and give some clarity to the general public?  I wonder if the Department or the HSE has any plans to address this issue at the present time, because it is extremely important to rebuild confidence in the whole system.</p></speech>

I will ask Mr. McCallion to speak about our information strategy there.</p></speech>

Certainly we are trying to get some updates out.  We have tried to get some speakers that can perhaps give reassurance from a clinical perspective.  I think it would be fair to say that this has been difficult in the past seven or eight days, because there is so much going on around this that information simply does not get through.</p> <p>  We have tried to look at communication from two perspectives.  One is the communication with women themselves through the programme, the direct communication.  The other perspective concerns getting greater reassurance into the system.  We all talk to people who have different views - friends, relatives etc. - and as the Senator says, there is misinformation out there.  Hopefully over the coming weeks we will put a plan in place to try to create some reassurance.  That has been difficult, to be frank.  Although the issue has attracted huge attention, as in the situation the Senator describes, it is difficult to get simple messages across to people who are clearly and understandably very anxious, concerned and unsure of exactly what all this means for them.  We are seeing that in our hospitals.  Apart from the phone line that I mentioned earlier, they are getting a huge number of calls straight to their colposcopy units.  These are placing huge strains on the service.  It is our intention to bring together a small group of patients, general practitioners and key people to look at how we can navigate through this, and hopefully provide some reassurance and greater clarity for women.</p><p>To be blunt, the difficulty in the last six or seven days has been that with so much happening it is very difficult to translate that through.  We are putting messages out but I have to say that we probably need to step back and look at how we might land that much more powerfully in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

I will make a suggestion.  As we have gone through this issue over recent weeks, and the committee has played a valuable role in that, we have tended in our discussions to intersperse the public health and public interest explanation of this issue with, quite legitimately, other questions related to scrutiny and accountability.  It is hard to have the public health and public interest message communicate itself in a situation where we are also doing the historical record and the scrutiny and accountability.  Both are absolutely legitimate and I wonder, and it might not involve the players here at all, if there is any way we could give some collective thought to a more concentrated public health and public interest discussion on explanation and trying to put that out.  The nature of the programme is such that we also must talk about the public interest and public health dimensions of sustaining the programme.  I absolutely recognise the need for accountability but-----</p></speech>

However, in the environment that pertained in the country over the past several weeks, it was difficult to get a moderate voice heard.  Moderation was interpreted as a cover-up so the only two positions were outrage or covering up and it was difficult to get a moderate message out.  The atmosphere that has been created here today signals to me that it might be possible to change the environment and get the good news out.  Personally, I wish to thank the committee for the atmosphere that has been created today.  It will give us encouragement to get a more moderate message out.</p></speech>

Some of them, unfortunately, have passed on and some are still with us.  We should take this opportunity to wish them well.  Given the events of the past few years that have come to public notice in recent times, have any specific lessons been learned which could be applied to the operation and delivery of health services in the future, with particular reference to acute and sensitive areas such as this?</p></speech>

Some of the obvious lessons, notwithstanding that investigations are taking place, relate to audits.  Before they commence, it should be absolutely crystal clear whose responsibility it is to communicate.  In respect of specialised services such as screening services there should be specific service open disclosure policies.  We will need to look again at the open disclosure policy and update it in the light of the lessons that have emerged from this and develop open disclosure policy specific to the screening programmes.  That can be said.  Each of the audits would have feedback loops so we can be sure that if there are open disclosure policies we will know whether they are being implemented effectively.  Those are a minimum set of responses.</p></speech>

It is a sad reality that the very thing that the CervicalCheck programme was trying to prevent actually was something that happened that was far worse and more catastrophic, particularly for the individuals who were impacted.  It is difficult for the people involved in terms of what they intended and what actually happened in the end.  It is very important in that context for the public and, most importantly, for the women impacted to understand how sorry we are about all of that.  That is really important.</p> <p>  Also, a broader, mature conversation needs to happen around the area of open disclosure and situations such as whether one discloses if somebody has passed away.  As Dr. Holohan said, the Medical Council guidelines are that one does not do that.  The country needs to have that conversation because sometimes people might say: "I would have preferred not to have had that information".  There probably needs to be a broader debate about that and also with regard to screening programmes more generally.  No screening programme is 100% effective and there probably needs to be broader communications in that regard.</p></speech>

It perturbs me to hear the witness say this should have been handled in a more calm, measured way when 18 women are dead and over 200 are affected by this.  There are women fighting for their lives.  I cannot apologise for there being anger about this.  I beg Mr. Connaghan to address the protectionism and the power and control that exist within the HSE.  Please do that.  I have many years of experience of dealing with the HSE and the Department of Health.  There are some excellent and good people in the system.  They should be brought to the fore and the others should be made accountable.  Get rid of the protectionism, power and control because it costing people their lives and not only in the situation we are discussing today.</p></speech>

It is the case that in these screening programmes not everybody will be protected against cervical cancer.  While it works for the population, it does not work for every individual.  It is really important to say that this crisis is not about the fact that there are women and families impacted by cervical cancer.  Cervical cancer is a reality in all our lives and even with the best screening programme in the world we would still-----</p></speech>

Why did the programme not say 30% in the leaflet?  Why did it say that there is just a small chance?  Why did the programme not instruct GPs to tell women when they were having their smears that there is a 30% chance that it might not be good and that if the women were having any symptoms they should disclose them?  Why did the programme not make that a priority in its communications?  I have seen HSE communications in action throughout the system.  It needs to get the basic communications right.</p></speech>

We appreciate the pressure the witnesses are under, but we also appreciate the anger among the public.  There is a balance to be struck between strident and discordant voices and a reasoned interrogation of what is happening.  Hopefully, that balance is being struck now.  I appreciate you coming here this morning at short notice.</p><p>On behalf of the committee I thank the representatives from the HSE, the Department of Health and CervicalCheck for assisting us in continuing to explore the matter.
