    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017112800002#D00200"><p>I welcome this opportunity to present this sustainability impact assessment to the committee.  A rigorous assessment, as in previous years, has been undertaken to examine the implications for Ireland of the EU Commission's proposals for the fixing of total allowable catches, TACs, for the coming year.</p><p>The European Commission proposal was issued on 7 November and several non-papers updating the proposal have issued since.  The final arrangements for 2018 are due to be negotiated at the Council scheduled for 11 and 12 December.  The levels of total allowable catch, TAC, and the quotas for Ireland will be determined at that meeting following intensive negotiations with member states and the European Commission.<br/><br/>The waters surrounding Ireland contain some of the most productive fishing grounds in the EU.  We have a duty of care to protect their biological richness and, as such, they must be managed responsibly and sustainably.  Ireland&rsquo;s total allocation of quotas in 2017 amounted to 233,500 tonnes with a total value of &euro;280 million.  There are also valuable inshore species which are not subject to EU TACs, such as crab, whelk, scallop and lobster, and are fished by the Irish fleet inside our six-mile coastal zone.<br/><br/>The process of preparing for the Council is now well under way.  The proposal covers stocks which are not subject to third party international agreements and are, in the main, whitefish and prawn stocks.  Stocks which are subject to ongoing international negotiations such as blue whiting are not included in the proposal as yet.<br/><br/>With regard to the coastal State pelagic stocks, the mackerel TAC was agreed in October.  The new quota for Irish fishermen for 2018 will be 69,143 tonnes.  There was new scientific advice this year which showed that, while the stock is in good shape, a precautionary approach for long-term sustainability was necessary with a significant reduction in quota recommended.  Accordingly, following careful consideration of scientific advice of the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, ICES, and discussions with the Marine Institute and industry stakeholders, I supported a reduction, in line with the agreed long-term management strategy, in the quota for 2018.<br/><br/>The blue whiting negotiations will hopefully be concluded in early December.  This agreement involves some transfer of blue whiting to Norway.  I will be seeking to keep that transfer as low as possible.  The EU-Norway negotiations began in Bergen, Norway, yesterday and will last all week.<br/><br/>Next year will see the continued phasing-in of the landing obligation or discards ban.  This was a central element of the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and agreed by all member states, as well as the European Parliament.  It will, in effect, phase out the dumping of perfectly good fish at sea and end the catching and discarding of juvenile fish.  This is a common-sense goal but the obligation comes with significant challenges.  We must be determined to face these challenges head on, if we are to ensure the sustainability of our vibrant coastal communities which depend on healthy fish stocks.  That is why I have, in co-operation with my colleagues from other member states, requested that the landing obligation and, in particular, the issue of choke species be discussed at the December Council.  There are several challenges that can only be addressed by common action from the Commission and the member states.  I will be pursuing this issue vigorously.<br/><br/>One of the key objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy is maximum sustainable yield, FMSY.  This is the largest average catch or yield which can continuously be taken from a stock under existing conditions without damaging the future returns from it.  Our shared ultimate objective is to bring and maintain our fish stocks to levels that can deliver FMSY by 2020 at the latest.  However, in line with the Common Fisheries Policy, it is being implemented in a progressive manner and its introduction may only be delayed if a strong case can be made that its immediate application seriously jeopardises the social and economic sustainability of the fishing fleets involved.<br/><br/>The proposals are based on formal advice received from ICES, the independent international body with responsibility for advising on the state of fish stocks.  It also takes account of the views of the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, which gives the Commission its views on the economic, technical and social impacts of the scientific advice.  To inform my negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, I have had an assessment of the impacts of the Commission proposal undertaken.  To facilitate the assessment, an open consultation process was initiated, whereby stakeholders were asked to submit their comments and observations on the Commission proposal for fishing opportunities for 2018.<br/><br/>From 7 November, an online web portal on <i>www.fishingnet.ie</i>was activated to enable the transmission of electronic submissions for consideration.  These portals remained open until 22 November and in all four submissions were received by the closing date.  The full content of all the submissions received by the deadline will be published on the <i>fishingnet.ie</i>website.<br/><br/>In addition to the written submissions, I convened a meeting of stakeholders, fishing industry representatives and environmental NGOs, on 24 November.  The purpose of this meeting was to give a further opportunity to the main stakeholders to outline their positions on the many aspects of this proposal.  Unfortunately, due to personal circumstances, I was unable to attend in person but I have been fully appraised by my officials of the views expressed.  I thank all the various stakeholders for their contributions to this impact assessment.<br/><br/>As always, there were a range of views among stakeholders.  However, there were also commonalities and I agree with many of the sentiments expressed through the consultation process.  These include a call for adherence to the available scientific advice to enable responsible and appropriate management decisions to be taken.  This however must be balanced with the concern that major cuts to TACs could have severe socio-economic impacts.  In that context, I will not support cuts unless I am satisfied they are absolutely necessary and fully supported by rigorously assessed and clear scientific evidence.  To illustrate what we are facing next week, some of the cuts for some of our important stocks will involve a cut of 62% in herring in the Celtic Sea, 34% for haddock in the Celtic Sea, 59% for whiting in the Celtic Sea and 12% for monkfish in the Celtic Sea.<br/><br/>Following the consultation process and the expert advice of the Marine Institute, I do not believe that all these reductions in quota are either justified or necessary.  However, I accept cuts where the scientific advice available to me makes the case for such reductions.  The Marine Institute and BIM have again this year made an invaluable contribution to the assessment of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal, which is contained in the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment before the committee.<br/><br/>From a purely biological perspective, the Marine Institute&rsquo;s view, which coincides with the ICES view, is that there has been an improvement in the status of some fish stocks.  However, others remain a concern, namely, in the areas west of Scotland and in the Irish Sea.  In the impact assessment, the Marine Institute summarises the pressure on the 74 stocks dealt with in the 2017 stock book and compares this assessment with the same evaluation presented in previous years stock books.  There is a higher number of sustainably fished stocks, 29, and percentage, 39%, in 2017 compared with last year.  The percentage, 23%, and number of stocks, 17, overfished have also increased in 2017, whereas the stocks with unknown status declined slightly from 31 to 28 or 42% to 38%.  The specific details for all stocks are available in the document which has been laid before the D&aacute;il and in the stock book, which was prepared by the Marine Institute and is available on its website.<br/><br/>The socio-economic impact assessment of the Commission&rsquo;s proposals does not fully account for Ireland&rsquo;s share of fishing opportunities.  The current proposals exclude a number of important stocks, mackerel, horse-mackerel and blue whiting, where the final European Union TAC, as well as member states&rsquo; quotas, depend on external, third country, agreements.<br/><br/>If agreed as they currently stand, the Commission&rsquo;s proposals would see net reduction in fishing opportunity, quotas of 27% by volume, tonnes, and 12% by value.  In financial terms, this amounts to a direct income reduction of &euro;17.4 million.  A net reduction in fishing opportunity for the demersal sector, whitefish and nephrops, of 21% by volume and 10% by value would have a direct income reduction of &euro;12.9 million.  A net reduction in fishing opportunity for the pelagic sector of 34% by volume and 39% by value would have a direct income reduction of &euro;4.56 million.  This is due mainly to a decrease in boarfish and Celtic Sea herring.<br/><br/>For north-west stocks in area 6, there would be a 6% reduction in fishing opportunity, valued at &euro;460,000, for the demersal, whitefish and prawn, fleets.  This will directly impact the ports of Greencastle and Killybegs.  For the Irish Sea, Celtic Sea and west coast, area 7, stocks it is estimated there will be 23% reduction in fishing opportunity for the demersal fleet.  This reduction is valued at &euro;10.8 million and will directly impact the ports of Clogherhead, Howth, Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay, Dingle, Castletownbere, and Ros a&rsquo; Mh&iacute;l, as well as other smaller ports.<br/><br/>In addition to the direct losses to the fleet, income is also lost from the processing sector as a direct result of reduced catches and in several ancillary industries, such as net-making, chandlery, engineering and refrigeration.  Based on turnover multipliers from fish landed in distinct Irish ports, BIM estimates the full costs, direct, indirect and induced, of the proposed quota reductions are in the order of &euro;54 million.  This will obviously have a knock-on effect for employment.  BIM further estimates, on the basis of the most recent employment surveys of the catching sector, these reductions could impact between 200 and 300 full and part-time jobs.</p><p>This could occur either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies in the seafood sector.</p><p> The proposals do not include the Hague Preferences which are a safety net for the Irish fleet in the case of specific stocks, in respect of which total allowable catches, TACs, are in decline.  Essentially, they are additional quota amounts Ireland and the United Kingdom claim for important whitefish stocks.  Many member states object strenuously to their application as the additional quotas comes off their allocations.  Ensuring the preferences are applied will be a key political objective for me in the negotiations.  The loss of these allocations in 2018 will amount to 2,726 tonnes of fish, with a direct value of &euro;5 million and an associated impact on between 60 and 80 full and part-time jobs, either through reduced incomes, partial lay-offs or redundancies.</p><p> I fully concur with the findings made in the sea fisheries sustainability impact assessment.  It highlights the significant impact the current proposals could have on the fishing industry.  Significant challenges lie ahead in the next two weeks, but I will do my utmost to agree to a fair and balanced package for Ireland that will ensure the continued vibrancy of the fishing industry and the long-term sustainability of stocks.  I thank and acknowledge all those who contributed to the production of the impact assessment and look forward to the debate on the conclusions reached.</p></speech>

The long-term implementation of the landing obligation was to be set out in regional multi-annual management plans, MAPs, adopted through co-decision.  However, since it was envisaged that the adoption of MAPs would take some time, the CFP provided for the adoption of discard plans through Commission-delegated acts shaped through joint recommendations of the member states concerned.  These discard plans could last for a period of no more than three years.</p> <p>  The first Commission-delegated regulations establishing discard plans entered into force on 1 January 2015 and are expiring at the end of 2017.  After the expiration of the initial three-year period, the CFP only empowers the Commission to adopt very limited delegated acts to implement the landing obligation, since the objective was to have all MAPs in place after three years.  To date, however, only the Baltic multi-annual plan is in place.  Two Commission proposals for multi-annual plans for demersals in the North Sea and small pelagics in the Adriatic are under negotiation between the co-legislators.  A proposal for the north-western waters multi-annual plan which is of greatest concern to Ireland is expected to be published later this year.</p> <p>  Against this background, the intention of the proposal amending the basic regulation was to extend the empowerment of the Commission to adopt discard plans for a further total period of up to three years while the remaining MAPs were being negotiated.  The purpose is to allow the regional group of member states' discards plans to have legal effect for a further three years  in order to facilitate the implementation of the landing obligation.  For Ireland&rsquo;s pelagic industry the concern was not immediate, but all were conscious of the implications for demersal discard plans which would expire at the end of 2018.  It is demersal fisheries that will require the full use of the flexibilities available under the CFP to try to avoid so-called choke situations where there is insufficient quota to cover catches that must be landed.</p> <p>  Member states were only informed in July that the Commission intended to bring forward a proposal for an amendment to Regulation 1380/2013 to deal with this issue.  My Department had previously raised it with industry representatives at meetings of the sea fisheries liaison group, SFLG, in March and May.  The SFLG is the formal group where either my officials or I meet the representatives of the producer organisations &ndash; the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, KFO; the Irish South and West Fishermen's Organisation, IS&amp;WFO; the Irish South and East Fish Producers Organisation, IS&amp;EFPO, and the Irish Fish Producers Organisation, IFPO - and the representative organisation for processors, the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association, IFPEA, to discuss issues arising.</p> <p>  With the announcement of a specific proposal, a more in-depth discussion took place at the SFLG meeting held on 19 July.  At that meeting all representatives agreed that there was a need to allow discard plans to continue and that if that required a change in the regulation, that is what should be done.  The formal proposal was circulated to both industry and NGO stakeholders on 31 August.  Only one response was received and it was supportive of the amendment.  During the discussions that took place at the Council fisheries working party Ireland consequently supported the proposed amendment so as to allow the continuation of discard plans.  The proposal received the full support of the EU Fisheries Council and the European Parliament and the amendment was given legal effect earlier this month.</p></speech>

I wish to make a few points, of which the Minister is probably aware as we had a conversation about this issue at the committee not long ago.  </p> <p>  Approximately 1.2 million tonnes of fish are caught annually in Irish waters.  Some 20% of the total catch is allocated to Irish boats, while 80% goes to others from abroad.  Currently, 5% of all fish caught in Irish waters is processed in the State.  Of the 250,000 tonnes caught by Irish vessels, only 50,000 are processed, which is, of course, where the value is added.  These are unbelievable statistics.  Can the Minister imagine the loss the State is facing because of this?  We must have a conversation about it now in the context of Brexit.  The committee heard the presentations made by the fishing organisations which were deeply alarming on the potential impact of Brexit and the denial of access to British waters.  If the removal of access to British waters materialises, as the British Government has indicated will be the case, will the Minister to ensure it will not trigger displacement?  In other words, under no circumstances can the EU boats currently fishing in British waters be transferred to Irish waters as we would be squeezed even further.  Considering the stark realities of the percentage of fish caught by Irish boats in our waters, the tiny percentage processed in the State and the huge potential loss of income, will the Minister give the committee a clear assurance that his objective in the negotiations is that we will not concede any further in the context of Brexit?  We must make it clear now that under no circumstances will the fleets currently operating in British waters be squeezed into Irish waters.  I appreciate that the Minister must negotiate on these matters, but I wish be given an assurance that this will be the objective of the Government.</p></speech>

He has outlined that the current proposals could lead to an overall cost of &euro;54 million for the fishing sector and the economy.  It is quite stark and the Minister and his officials will be seeking to mitigate that figure at the Council meeting.  We had a similar meeting in this regard last year when there were similar difficulties with proposals related to a number of catches.  Can the Minister recall how it worked out at the Council versus what was on the plate beforehand?  How far was he able to mitigate the figure last year and how exactly did it pan out?</p> <p>  The mackerel allocation is particularly significant for an important sector in the fishing industry.  The Minister has indicated that it will depend on external agreements.</p><p>Where does that stand?  Last year scientific advice was given by ICES on the available fish stocks.  How did it come about that incorrect information was provided which led to a correction?  Does the Minister believe the factors that led to that incorrect information being provided have been addressed?  Can he stand over what is included in the stock book and the proposals made?</p></speech>

I am not as familiar with it as perhaps I ought to be.  </p> <p>  Fish processing which could contribute significantly to employment seems to be minimal within the industry.  It is similar to the old argument about the beef industry when many jobs were lost when cattle were exported on the hoof.  Thankfully, that trend has been reversed a little and we are in the peculiar position where if we did not have live exports, the beef industry would not be doing as well.  Is there any correlation with what could happen in the fishing industry?</p> <p>  The Minister faces difficult negotiations and takes everybody's best wishes with him in trying to secure the best deal in the context of various external reports and advices with which he must contend regarding reductions that will be foisted on us in our TACs.  To whom will he look for support around the table?  We are able to cultivate support from, say, France and others in the case of the agriculture industry.  Who are our best friends when it comes to the fishing industry?  While many fish are being caught, they are being caught by large trawlers.  What about the small entrepreneurs in the industry?  Where do they fit in?  Surely, because of these proposals they will suffer a significant adverse disproportionate impact.  As Deputy Charlie McConalogue said, the Minister will try to mitigate the impact as best he can - we all wish him well in that regard - but will the harshness of the proposals be visited disproportionately on those who operate small trawlers and boats?  Large trawlers can absorb such cuts better than small fisherman who are trying to rear families and do not have the wherewithal to compete or seek alternatives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017112800002#G00300"><p>Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn made an important point in the context of Brexit, a matter on which we have had some exchanges of views at the committee previously.  It is almost an existential challenge for the fishing industry because the consequences will be enormous.  The Senator has made reference to the fact that while Irish fishermen catch a proportion of the TAC in Irish waters, fishermen from other countries catch the majority of it.  However, it is interesting in the context of Brexit to consider the volume of fishing endeavour undertaken by the industry in what are deemed to be UK territorial waters.  The advantage in some respects of the CFP is that where we have a quota, fishermen can chase it in other waters also.  Therefore, in that context, there have been swings and roundabouts.  The most important issue is the health of fish stocks, not so much where the line is in the Irish Sea or UK territorial waters because a country's quota allocation determines the entitlement to fish at any given time.  We have a system which is different from that in the United Kingdom in that the quota is a publicly owned resource allocated on the basis of one's track record annually, whereas it is a privatised resource in the United Kingdom.  The most valuable fish stock in Ireland is mackerel.  Approximately 60% of our mackerel is caught in UK territorial waters, while 40% of prawns, our second most valuable stock, is caught there.  That is a major concern for us.</p> <p>  If the United Kingdom opts for a hard Brexit and pulls up the drawbridge behind it, stating these are their waters and that no one else can fish them, displacement will be a concern.  However, it is also impacted on by quota availability because nobody is supposed to fish without an allocation and the danger is that more people will look for a share of the available sustainable fish stocks in a smaller pond.  That is the challenge.  We have been working extraordinarily hard with like-minded member states that will be equally adversely impacted on.  It would not serve our purposes well to engage in a solo run.  A shared analysis of what the impact will be for the industry across member states is likely to bring us the best dividend.  I have heard the view expressed that we should use the negotiations to revisit the isssue of relative stability and so on.  They are issues to be considered in a new CFP.  There is a shared analysis among member states, including Spain, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden and Ireland, which is being fed into the Commission to try to make sure our interests are protected in the negotiations.  With regard to relative stability, it is a reasonable position to take that the shares allocated under the CFP will be the legal entitlement of the United Kingdom on leaving.  It is not the territorial area but, legally, the United Kingdom's share of the fish stocks.  I cannot state definitively what the outcome will be, but our best opportunity to secure a good result for the industry which is part of a pan-European industry alliance that has a similar shared analysis to like-minded member states is by sticking together in the negotiations because if we try to fight individually, we will be picked off.  That is what we are trying to do in the negotiations.</p> <p>  Deputy Charlie McConalogue raised the issue of the advice given by ICES.  It is the international body that provides scientific advice.  No mistake was made in the Department or the Marine Institute in providing advice on mackerel stocks.  The issue was the collation and interpretation of the scientific data ICES had available.  We subsequently contacted the body.  There was a belief at one stage that ICES might correct the quotas mid-year, but that did not happen.  The correction has been made this year.  While that was disappointing, the industry recognised that this outcome was not unexpected.  For example, Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation is the one impacted on most by the reduction, but there was a realisation that, in the context of the scientific advice available, the outcome achieved was not unreasonable.</p> <p>  Deputy Willie Penrose raised the issue of support from other member states at the upcoming Council meeting.  Unfortunately, unlike the aforementioned Council meeting on Brexit, at the December Council it tends to be each country for itself to maximise its yield.  There may be occasions when a temporary alliance can be formed in dealing with a particular stock, but my initial and only experience, at last year's Council meeting, was that it was a fast moving, dynamic set of negotiations across a range of species and that one made alliances where one could.  Sometimes one is standing on one's own, but it is primarily driven by the sustainable management of the resource and then trying to get one's maximum share.</p><p>We have to bear in mind the critical importance of things like the Hague Preference, for example, a provision that has enabled us to achieve a higher rate when an overall allocation in a species is going down, thereby recognising the importance of that to us.  It is extraordinarily challenging now because, for a number of very important stocks, the science suggests very significant cuts and the impact on employment, both on the high seas and onshore in terms of processing, is significant.</p><p>Senator Mac Lochlainn referred to the level of fish processed here.  What we have been trying to do in recent years, in a co-ordinated way, through investment in our port facilities, is to encourage foreign vessels that are fishing off the south or west coast of Ireland, for argument's sake, instead of steaming back to the north of Spain, France or wherever, to drop into Castletownbere, Killybegs or Rossaveale and have their catch processed there, where they can also re-fuel and obtain all other necessary provisions.  That is an industry that would bring benefit both in terms of onshore processing and the provisioning sector.  We have been reasonably successful to date and I am aware, for example, of a significant industry that has built up around Castletownbere on that basis.  It is the kind of investment we are putting into facilities in Killybegs, Castletownbere and Dingle, where significant dredging works in the harbour are ongoing at the moment.  This gives an opportunity to try to increase processing opportunities and the jobs that go with that to the Republic.  I believe it is more cost-efficient for those boats to land and have their catch processed here, and then have it shipped onwards by ferry to wherever the markets are.</p></speech>

The issue of international transferable quotas arises where corporations that own super-trawlers have been able to buy massive quotas, which impacts on our indigenous fishing industry.  Is this an issue that has come onto the Minister's desk?  Obviously, we have discussed the issue of super-trawlers in this committee and we looked at the challenges of ensuring the catch they report is actually happening, and we looked at the issue of inspectors going on board to monitor this more closely.  There are big concerns about super-trawlers within the fishing industry and I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts.</p> <p>  The Minister talked about trying to attract more of the foreign trawlers to land here to the benefit of our processing industry and to have that added value.  Is there anything we can do to oblige those trawlers which access Irish waters to land their catch in Irish ports?  I was able to tell the Minister that 1.2 million tonnes of fish are caught in Irish waters.  I assume that, at some point, every one of these trawlers has to report this catch, whether they land in an Irish port, a home port or a port on the neighbouring island.  The Minister might advise us how that reporting is done and how the catch is monitored.  I assume it is all under the jurisdiction of the European Union.  Is there any way we can oblige or encourage them to land their catch here or to directly connect that fishing in Irish waters with Ireland?  We need to do more than just market or encourage this.  If we look at the 5% of overall catch that is processed here, we have do much better than that and we have to get more value out of that for our island.  I would like to get a sense of all of that.</p></speech>

I welcome the strong statement from the Minister in regard to his endeavours to achieve a fair and balanced package for the industry in his negotiations.  The figures are very stark when we look at the potential impact on jobs, ports and all of the knock-on impacts.  We need to be very aggressive in ensuring we can make the best case for ourselves.</p> <p>  There is information from the IMI and ICES in regard to the impact on stocks of overfishing.  I believe we would all agree this is bad news for everybody in terms of smaller catches and the knock-on effect on jobs.  I wonder how we would go about rebuilding, protecting and maintaining stock levels so we can ensure there are enough fish in the sea to make sure the industry is protected.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="16:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017112800002#H00600"><p>On the point raised by Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, what we are moving towards in terms of sustainable management is what is called MSY, or maximum sustainable yield.  We want to get to a situation where all species are fished according to this objective and it a road we have been making progress on.  We subscribe in principle to that but we accept that, in certain situations, it cannot be achieved overnight and we need to have a two-step or three-step approach to it.  However, it is getting to a situation where we are only taking from any particular species a level which allows us to come back the next year and also have a harvest.  It is a question of moving stocks to that sustainable management process.  In many respects, it is what is driving the quite considerable proposed reductions here, which, in certain circumstances, would be quite difficult economically for coastal communities to reach in one short swoop.  Our position will be informed in terms of both the survival of fishermen and the survival of fish, and we must have balance in the approach.  We certainly want to, and do, subscribe to the principle but it is a question of getting there over a manageable period.</p> <p>  On the issue of the international transferable quotas, super-trawlers and so on, the first principle is that no vessel, whether a super-trawler or a small fishing boat, can fish without having a quota to fish those species.  Obviously, it then becomes an issue of policing the effort of every boat.  If we had a situation where our quotas were private assets, we would long ago have had a situation where we would have maybe a dozen or so huge boats and the industry would be wiped out as we know it in very many small communities.  I am glad that is not a road we have gone down.  However, it is equally important that we are able to police those who come in with big quotas and take substantial volumes.  The practice in other countries has been to have private assets and, therefore, to be able to sustain huge boats, rather than having the large number of small and medium size boats that our industry is, in large, characterised by.</p> <p>  The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, is the critical agency and the Naval Service is important in terms of boardings.  For example, in 2016 we had 18 inspections and we have had 30 to date in 2017.  I understand that three German, one Lithuanian, ten Dutch, one Norwegian and three Russian boats were boarded, which is a significant increase in activity over the previous year.</p> <p>  One of the things we have been supportive of, in principle, is the idea of further ensuring compliance with quotas through the placing of onboard cameras on these boats.  It is something we have been trying to make progress on in negotiations, although it has not yet been possible to get agreement on it in terms of getting access to real-time information shared by all member states.  I think it would be a logical step forward.</p> <p>  There has been increased activity in regard to boardings and the relevant authority, the SFPA, is active in that area.</p><p> Obviously, it polices anybody who fishes in our waters, be they our own boats or others.  It is important that the authority has all the necessary instruments and the use of cameras to monitor activity would be another tool in its armoury to be more effective in that area.  I am aware there is a narrative suggesting the big super trawlers are the bad guys and the small community-based fisheries are good guys.  What is important from a policy perspective is to ensure that there is a level playing field for everyone who has a quota - be it a privatised asset in a super trawler coming from the aforementioned states that we have boarded or our own industry - and they are catching what their quota is.  That is how we ensure that stocks remain viable and sustainable in the future.</p></speech>

The case we have been making is it is in their economic interest that, rather than steaming all the way back to the north of Spain with their catch, for instance, reprovisioning there and steaming back to catch whatever species they are chasing in Irish waters, they drop into Castletownbere, reprovision there, have the stock processed there and then have it carried to market via Rosslare or Cork Harbour on a roll-on roll-off ferry.  We are increasingly making that pitch for business based on the investment we are putting into piers in these critical areas.  For example, blue whiting is one of those stocks and we have an opportunity to make the business case to Norwegian vessels to come into Killybegs, rather than them going all the way back to a port in Norway.  We also do that elsewhere.</p></speech>

I ask those present to ensure that all mobile phones are turned off.  The meeting has been convened to consider a Supplementary Estimate for Vote 30 - Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which was referred by the D&aacute;il to the committee on 21 November 2017 with an instruction to report back to the D&aacute;il no later than 6 December 2017.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed.  I also welcome his departmental officials and thank them for circulating briefing papers beforehand.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.43" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017112800002#A00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to present this request for a technical Supplementary Estimate for 2017.  I am seeking the committee's approval to use savings on the Department's Vote to fund other desired expenditure.  As these proposed transfers and expenditure involve significant changes to the original 2017 voted allocations, it is important to seek the committee's input and approval.</p><p>This technical Supplementary Estimate will transfer savings of &euro;9 million in certain areas of the Vote to fund the Brexit loan scheme I announced in budget 2018.  In addition, I am requesting the committee's agreement to transfer &euro;14.5 million of savings in certain areas of the Vote to the agriculture environmental schemes to ensure that there is sufficient funding available to pay 85% advance funding to all farmers who have established their eligibility.  A further &euro;4.5 million will be moved to the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme and &euro;6.6 million will be transferred to Bord Bia to assist with ongoing promotional work in addressing the market challenges relating to Brexit.  Finally, a further &euro;14 million will be transferred to the World Food Programme to support its humanitarian work across the world.</p><p>The &euro;48.6 million current funds required will be transferred from various subheads where, due to changed circumstances, savings have emerged, most notably in the context of the administrative budget pay subhead, the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, the knowledge transfer programme, the animal welfare scheme for sheep, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, seafood development programme, research, the early retirement scheme and the development of agriculture and food.</p><p>On the payroll underspend, the savings arise from a lower than estimated pay bill due to recruitment of additional replacement staff not proceeding as quickly as planned.  The delay in the recruitment process will give rise to a saving of approximately &euro;12 million in 2017 payroll allocation.</p><p>On the &euro;8.2 million in savings in development of agriculture and food, these are primarily due to funding which had been allocated to this subhead of the Department's Vote pending the development of a programme of activities to support the food and drink sectors in addressing the market challenges relating to Brexit by Bord Bia.  It is proposed to transfer this to Bord Bia under the Supplementary Estimate.  Other savings are arising because there has been a lower than projected spend on lean reviews by food companies.  In addition, a specialist food producer scheme which is currently in development has yet to be launched.  It is now expected that this will be launched in 2018.</p><p>On the animal welfare scheme for sheep and the sum of &euro;8 million, this scheme was launched in December 2016 and is centred on a payment of &euro;10 per breeding ewe on foot of the flock owner undertaking two animal health-related actions.  The original Vote allocation provided for full payment in respect of all ewes in the national flock.  While a high percentage of sheep farmers are participating, not all potential participants choose to do so.  Year 1 advance payments commenced on schedule in mid-November and some &euro;16 million has issued to more than 20,000 farmers.  Balancing payments will issue in 2018.</p><p>On the BDGP and the sum of &euro;3 million, 23,150 farmers are currently participating in BDGP 1<b>.  </b>The programme was reopened in 2017.  However, fewer than anticipated numbers applied to participate.  Some applicants were ineligible to participate while others did not comply with the mandatory requirements of BDGP 2.  Ultimately, 1,550 farmers are participating in BDGP 2.  The &euro;3 million reduction in the Estimate for 2017 is attributable to the take-up and the compliance with mandatory requirements relating to BDGP 1 and 2 being less than projected.  Payments in respect of BDGP 1 and 2 will commence in December to those herds who are compliant with the requirements of the schemes.</p><p><b></b>On the knowledge transfer programme and the sum of &euro;2.8 million, the programme is designed not only to help develop the skills base of Irish farmers but also to support a number of other themes and measures in Ireland&rsquo;s rural development programme.  The original allocation of &euro;25.6 million provided for 20,000 participants satisfying all scheme requirements.  A saving will arise because approximately 19,000 farmers are currently enrolled in knowledge transfer groups and a minority of these have not complied with all the conditions required to receive full payments.  Payments under the knowledge transfer programme commenced at the end of October and, to date, more than 13,700 farmer payments have issued.</p><p>I made &euro;43.6 million available in 2017 for the EMFF operational programme in the budgets of my Department and its agencies.  However, there are some savings as schemes roll out.  There will be a saving of &euro;4.5 million in respect of the current expenditure budget of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, primarily regarding the sustainable fisheries scheme and the skills and training measure.  There will also be savings of &euro;2.5 million on other EMFF budgets managed by my Department, mainly on a marine development team and marine spatial planning project.  These savings will not affect the overall budget available for the seafood sector under the EMFF because these investments will occur over the latter years of the programme.</p><p>Other savings are in the early retirement scheme, where participants receiving the State pension reduces the early retirement scheme spend by a corresponding amount, and research grants, where, due to a later than scheduled launch of the 2017 research call, &euro;7 million of expenditure will not arise until 2018.</p><p>Overall, these current expenditure savings amount to &euro;48.6 million and, with the select committee's approval, they will be transferred to fund the following measures.  A total of &euro;9 million of the savings identified will be used to contribute to the &euro;23 million Brexit loan scheme I announced on budget day.  This scheme will be operated in partnership with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The aim behind it is to make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses that have up to 499 employees.  Given their unique exposure to the UK market, my Department&rsquo;s funding ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses.  The finance will be easier to access, will be more competitively priced - with a proposed interest rate of 4% - and will be offered at more favourable terms than current offerings.  This will give businesses impacted upon by Brexit time and space to adapt and grow into the future.</p><p>The new scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, through commercial lenders.  SBCI issued an open call on 21 November inviting lending institutions to participate.  The scheme is expected to be in place in March 2018 and it is anticipated that it will remain open until March 2020.  Supporting lower-cost, flexible finance is a key response to Brexit.  The very successful agriculture cashflow loan scheme has provided a template for such schemes, including this one for businesses.  I also announced in the budget that I have secured funding of &euro;25 million for my Department to facilitate the development of new Brexit response loan schemes during 2018 for farmers, fishermen and food businesses.</p><p>On the GLAS scheme and the sum of &euro;14.5 million, there are now in excess of 50,000 farmers approved into the GLAS scheme over the three tranches, that is, GLAS 1, 2 and 3.  The environmental benefits to date are evident.  In September, the European Commission agreed to my request that provision be made for an increase to the advance payments for Pillar 2 rural development schemes, with the rate increased up to 85% under those schemes.  GLAS advance payments will begin this week at the higher advance rate of 85%.  The additional &euro;14.5 million sought in this Supplementary Estimate will facilitate this.  I urge all participants to ensure that they submit all outstanding documentation so that they can avail of this advance payment in 2017.</p><p>The sum of &euro;6 million for Bord Bia will ensure that it can fund a programme of additional activities to support the food and drink sectors in addressing the market challenges relating to Brexit.  The funding, which is additional to the substantial funding already provided to Bord Bia for 2017, includes further market promotion and support activities internationally, in the UK and in other markets within the EU.</p><p>The programme of activities draws on analysis of data from the Bord Bia Brexit barometer exercise which was completed by 139 food, drink and horticulture companies and follows my Department's request to Bord Bia to undertake a major market prioritisation exercise to identify the best prospects for sustainable growth in individual sectors.</p><p> Areas of natural constraint, ANC, require &euro;4.5 million.  The significant level of financial support delivered through the ANC scheme over the years recognises the issues which pose a significant threat to the future viability of these farming communities.  In budget 2018, I was pleased to fulfil the programme for Government commitment to allocate an additional &euro;25 million to the scheme.  Almost &euro;200 million has been paid out under the ANC scheme this year and this extra &euro;4.5 million allocation will ensure the maximum number of eligible participants is paid this year.</p><p> The World Food Programme requires &euro;14 million.  Including the advance payment of &euro;10 million that I am requesting here, Ireland will have contributed &euro;60 million to the World Food Programme for the years 2016 to 2018.  The additional &euro;10 million provided for the World Food Programme in this Supplementary Estimate represents an advance payment of next year's commitment under Ireland's strategic partnership agreement with the World Food Programme.  This earlier disbursement is at the request of the World Food Programme's executive director, who has written to inform me that this funding will significantly contribute to enhance the World Food Programme's capability to plan its interventions and better address the several growing humanitarian crises around the world.  I also propose to provide an additional &euro;4 million to the World Food Programme which will contribute to its lifesaving work around the world, including helping 4.3 million people who are facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity in the Kasai region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  They include 350,000 children in the region who are at risk of severe acute malnutrition.  This funding, while generally targeted at the World Food Programme's emergency and protracted relief operations, is provided on a non-earmarked basis which gives the World Food Programme the flexibility to plan and target this funding in the most strategic, efficient and effective manner and provide lifesaving assistance for people living on the front lines of hunger, conflict and climate change.  Ireland will become a member of the World Food Programme's executive board in February 2018.</p><p> This is a technical Supplementary Estimate.  The savings I have outlined will be used to fund the World Food Programme, the Brexit loan scheme, green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and ANC payments, and Bord Bia and I earnestly recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the committee for its support.  I am happy to respond to members' questions.</p></speech>

Will the Minister clarify why &euro;4.5 million is needed for the ANC scheme?  I welcome the extra money for Bord Bia because with the challenges we are facing with Brexit, which we do not have to elaborate on here, Bord Bia needs all the funding it can get to withstand the market challenges it would face in a hard Brexit.  We had farmers who were aggrieved that they did not qualify for the loan scheme the last time.  Will it be at the same interest rate as the last time?  Will people who failed to qualify get priority for this extra &euro;25 million?</p> <p>  It is charitable for a country such as ours to provide &euro;14 million to the World Food Programme but Fianna F&aacute;il raised a Topical Issue matter last week which highlighted the fodder crisis in the west of Ireland and the pressure that will be there in the spring of 2018.  This was an ideal opportunity for the Minister to put aside money for aid for those farmers and I am disappointed that there is no provision for funding for that impending crisis.  There will be a severe further shortage in the west.  A number of funding sources are available and I would be disappointed if one of those was not used to address this crisis.  Eight of us spoke on it last week in a Topical Issue debate in the D&aacute;il and that is the one significant disappointment I have with this reallocation of funds and it is a serious missed opportunity.  I welcome the money for Bord Bia, which is sensible, but I would like clarification on the &euro;25 million for ANC.  Will that be at the same interest rate and will farmers who failed last time around get priority?</p></speech>

Some &euro;9 million of the payments that have issued to date in the 2017 budget was used to pay successful applicants who established their entitlement from 2016 so there is a roll-over.  The &euro;4.5 that is being provided for now is to pay people who have carried over liability from a previous year and established their entitlement at a later stage.  There are stocking density requirements, retention periods and such that have to be met for ANC.  Some people establish their entitlements at a later stage.  Last year, for people who established their eligibility for the 2016 payment in 2017, there was a provision of &euro;9 million, and this year the requirement is for &euro;4.5 million in roll-over.</p> <p>  No decisions have been made about the loan scheme and interest rate yet.  A decision was made on the scheme that is available for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, which will be at a 4% interest rate.  The variables that will decide the size of the loan fund will include the terminal loan and the interest rate that is charged.  We will be trying to draw on the lessons of the last scheme for the loan scheme for fishermen and farmers next year.  Is there something to be gained from pitching the interest rate at a different level that will encourage the banks to compete as well?  A lesson that could be learned from the last scheme was that, at the interest rate of 2.95%, banks just did not compete.  Outside of the pillar banks that were used by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, was there an opportunity if it had been pitched slightly higher to draw in more competition from other sectors?  There is a suggestion that, at that rate of interest, other banks outside of those involved in administering it would not compete.  All those decisions on the interest rate have yet to be made.</p> <p>  I welcome the Deputy's comments on Bord Bia.  From my own engagement with it, it is putting its time to good use, seeking out new market opportunities, working with companies and so on.</p> <p>  On the fodder crisis, as I discussed in D&aacute;il, I have asked the Department's agents on the ground to assess the situation which is a fundamental exercise to carry out before we do anything else.  If we were to do something on foot of that, I have every confidence that funding would be available but we have to gather the information and as I have said previously, Teagasc is in the field to do that assessment.  We will have feedback from that in due course and we will consider the options available to the Department then.  I am satisfied that, should the need arise from its analysis of the situation on the ground, we will be in a position to respond.</p></speech>

We will have to reflect on the best use of the funding.  Deputy Cahill raised an interesting point about those who did not get funding the last time around.  Is there a significant cohort in any particular sector that was refused?  Was it due to a credit history issue?  What were the reasons?  We will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the last scheme to see if we can learn from it.  Bear in mind that that was the maiden voyage for subsidised loan schemes.</p><p>Broadly speaking it is recognised as being a significant success.  We have lessons to learn from it in respect of what the interest rate might be, should the conditions of the loan be short term or long term, and what sectors should be covered.  We will take all these issues into account.</p></speech>

It keeps a degree of context on the scale of challenges that are being faced.  It is one challenge to which Ireland is glad to respond.  It is part of a three-year cycle of commitments we have made to the World Food Programme.</p> <p>  With regard to the specialist food producer scheme, we are focusing on the artisan food sector.  The scheme has yet to be designed and that is why the savings are currently there.  We recognise that the artisan food sector is part of the colour of Ireland's food offering and tourism product.  There is great interest now in provenance and the specialist food sector has a great story to tell.  The sector is also putting its foot in the export market but it is substantially for the domestic consumer.  It is quite a significant sector and the scheme is primarily geared towards the artisan food sector.</p> <p>  On the issue of the sheep welfare scheme applicants, a simple calculation was done.  On the basis of there being 2.5 million ewes in the State the scheme was estimated to cost &euro;25 million.  For one reason or another, despite the best efforts of the Department to advertise the availability of the scheme, and the despite the fact that the scheme was widely recognised as simple to avail of, not all sheep farmers who were eligible for the scheme applied for it.  That is a disappointment.  The scheme will reopen next year and will have a provision for new applicants.  Maybe word of mouth might see the uptake increase.  The saving is there because it was demand led.  We budgeted for the maximum, with everybody participating.  We have made an 85% payment on it.  This leaves us with 85% of the number of applicants.  Having budgeted for &euro;25 million the balancing payment will issue in 2018.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.61" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017112800002#C01100"><p>On the figure for the underspend for last year for the Department, I cannot recall exactly but I believe the leftover at the end of the year was to the tune of &euro;70 million.  Will the Minister indicate what that figure was at the year end and what was done with those funds?  Were they left in the Department?  Were they carried over?</p> <p>  I am aware that the Minister is moving &euro;48 million today from a certain number of funds and destinations to others.  Does the Minister expect an underspend in the Department at the end of the year aside from this?  I do not see any reference to TAMS in today's figures but TAMS certainly seems to be underspent this year.  Does the Minister have any data on that?</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill made reference to the &euro;6.5 million allocation.  It is very welcome and necessary and is something we pushed for over a period of time.  Is it going to be built into the base fund going forward, or is the &euro;6.5 million a once off?</p> <p>  The Minister is transferring &euro;8 million from the sheep welfare scheme into other programmes.  There was a very sensible suggestion put forward relating to hill sheep - an additional &euro;5 given on hill sheep - especially given the pressure the sector is under with margins being so low.  I thought this was a worthy suggestion.  Has the Minister considered this proposal?  Perhaps he will clarify why he is not going down that route.</p> <p>  The Minister proposes to move additional funds into GLAS to bring it up to the 85% forward payment.  There were significant issues and difficulties last year in relation to GLAS but the Minister is moving &euro;14.5 million into it.  Given that the payments are due to start issuing next week, as the Minister indicated in his opening statement, how confident does he feel that the difficulties experienced last year will not be repeated this year?  With the commonage management plans, up to 9,000 applicants, or 20%, potentially have commonage.  An issue is brewing where payments may be delayed to those who have not been able to get their commonage management plans completed, which is the vast majority.  I honestly believe that a way should be found to pay them in advance pending the plans being completed.  They should not have to wait.  There were delays in the Department also in getting the system up and running and in making sure it was all in order.  It is important farmers are not left to feel the financial pain as a result of that.</p> <p>  I am aware that it is slightly off-topic but will the Minister comment on the areas that were burned?  Those farmers' payments are delayed.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the hill burning that occurred earlier in 2017 with gorse burning.  Hills and commonages in particular were burned.  As a result farmers' single farm payments are delayed because their areas are declared ineligible.  It is a real issue for those involved.  It is tricky and messy and we need to find a resolution.  There are many genuine cases where things happen which are outside people's control.  While they may have had nothing to do with it, they had their hill burned and are now finding difficulties with their payment.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill made reference to the fodder scheme.  I echo his comments in that regard.  The Minister has said that he will look at the scheme in due course.  Perhaps the Minister will define what he means by "in due course".  Given the fact that the issue is recognised, would it not be appropriate to put a small fund in place sufficient to provide assistance to these farmers?  This would mean that where the Teagasc assessment identifies farmers in difficulty early engagement and assistance would be given.  This is especially relevant in the provision of concentrates.  By providing some concentrates, or funding towards concentrates, at an early stage it can take the pressure off, increasing prices for roughage fodder.</p></speech>

With regard to the underspend, it is important to put it in the context of the Department's overall budget of &euro;2.5 billion.  The underspend is less than 2%.</p><p>In the context of trying to manage departmental expenditure of this scale, it is quite a fine act to bring in the expenditure as close as that.  The fact that 70% of the Department's expenditure is concentrated in the last quarter of the year makes the management of that expenditure quite a challenge.</p><p> The issue of GLAS payments has been mentioned.  I am advised that our systems will be fit for purpose when we hit the "pay" button later this week.  Obviously, certain issues are outside the control of the Department.  Last year's issues are well documented.  We are hoping against hope that all of the thousands of outstanding nutrient management plans will come in to enable us to pay all farmers for whom that is the issue.  A completed commonage management plan is no longer required.  My understanding is that as long as the adviser has commenced the uploading of the plan, and this is registered with the Department's online system, that should be sufficient to clear the way for payment.  The advice we received during our engagement with planners was that they started the process of compiling commonage management plans a considerable time ago.  All that remains is for them to engage with the Department's online system to upload those plans.  When we have received evidence of such engagement, the commonage management plans will not be an impediment to the releasing of payments.  We are on target to pay the maximum possible number of people the 85% advance on the basis that the planners have started commencing the nutrient management and commonage management plans.  Approximately 3,300 nutrient management plans are still outstanding.  They are coming in at a good rate.  We will hit the "pay" button this week.  We will do another payment next week.  As they come in, we will be able to approve them for payment.  The additional funding for Bord Bia is a once-off payment.</p><p> The sheep welfare scheme is designed and approved by the Commission on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone.  I appreciate the difficulties that are being experienced in the hill sheep sector.  If we wanted to top up the payment, we would need to have incurred an expenditure of an equivalent amount to the top-up amount.  This would involve going back to the Commission.  If one looks at the simple mathematics of it, one will see that it involved &euro;10 for 2.5 million ewes.  We did not get 2.5 million ewes.  We will open the scheme again if more people want to participate in it.  It is not open to us to make the payment for which the Deputy is calling.</p><p> There is not much I can add in respect of the fodder issue.  I think it is appropriate to ask.  If we did this in reverse - if we committed public funds without the appropriate input - we would be rightly questioned about that in the Oireachtas and by other public expenditure watchdogs.  We have to make sure everything we do is based on an analysis of the situation.  That is what Teagasc is currently doing.</p><p> I am aware that burnt land is an issue.  I understand that a couple of hundred farmers, or maybe fewer, are involved.  Deputies will recall that in the first half of this year, an outcry followed the media coverage of hill burning that was taking place outside the timelines for burning.  I suppose this is a follow-through on it.  The Department deals with these files on a case-by-case basis.  It assesses the evidence available to it in each case.  Landowners are entitled to exhaust an appeals process.  Nobody wants to see a bona fide victim of unauthorised burning by somebody else having his or her basic payment reduced for that reason.  Equally, we do not want to see a wanton disregard for the terms and conditions of the scheme.  The number of people affected has been distilled down from a far larger number of land owners to a relatively small cohort of people who are entitled to and should avail of the appeals process that is open to them.  I hope we reach a point where everybody gets a fair hearing in respect of what has happened on his or her individual holdings.  The Department's eligible land is also subject to audit by EU auditors in respect of this issue.  We have to be able to stand over our systems so that we do not end up costing the State money as a consequence of non-compliance with land eligibility issues.  It is a question of trying to find an appropriate balance.  The scale of these problems is relatively small.  Obviously, it is a blow for any individual farmer to receive a letter like this.  At the time, these fires attracted considerable adverse publicity because they were significantly outside the time permitted for burning and were of a scale that led to many difficulties.  The Department was obliged to respond.  Farmers should exhaust the process that exists in order to ascertain what the outcome will be at the end of the day.</p></speech>

There is no doubt we have a challenge with TAMS.  There is no issue on the Department's side with TAMS payments.  The issue relates to delays in the submission of claims data.  We are issuing approvals for farmers in respect of the tranche 8 of TAMS, which is the latest tranche.  The provision we have made on the capital side in the current year is more than the amount that will be actually drawn down on the capital side.  We have a capacity to carry more than &euro;24 million in capital from one year to the next.  We have issued approvals, but some farmers have not applied for one reason or another.  They might not apply for good reasons; for example, they might not be in a financial position to carry out the works at a given time.  Since tranche 6 or tranche 7, we have been making the approvals subject to timelines.  There is a 12-month approval for buildings and a six-month approval for plants.  We have done this to improve our capacity to manage the cashflow in the Department.  In that context, there is provision for applicants to reapply when the timeline is exhausted or to apply for an extension of the works that have commenced but not concluded.</p></speech>

I ask him to let us know how much engagement is required to satisfy what is needed for payments to be made.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the diligence of the staff of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.

Payments will issue in these cases and in all other cases</p> <p>as commonage management plans are commenced on the system.  My understanding, which is subject to correction, is that this process can be commenced but not completed.  In some cases, there might be a degree of work to be done to complete the plan.</p><p>However, once a farmer engages, he or she leaves an electronic thumbprint, I presume, and there is some measurement of the advisor on the system that is sufficient to clear those farmers for payment.  The fact is that it has been out there so long.  We do not require full completion.  As long as farmers have engaged with the system and put something up, they will be cleared for payment.  That is not an unreasonable compromise in the circumstances.</p><p> We hope that the outstanding nutrient management plans and commonage management plans will arrive in sufficient numbers to enable us to pay practically all applicants.</p></speech>

I have always found the officials most helpful - I wish to recognise that.  Indeed, often I go off-script to ask them about various things.  I am writing something at the moment and I get great co-operation from Department officials with some of the material.  I hope that when I leave here I will have something to leave behind.</p></speech>

The underspend is significant.  I support unequivocally what the Minister is doing in terms of subsuming the savings into various critical areas that need additional funding.  The aim is to meet targets like the 85% advances, which is most useful.  There is a &euro;12 million underspend in that area.  Is it difficult to recruit in that area?  What was the projected level of recruitment?  What specific areas were targeted?  Was the recruitment for Teagasc advisers or specialists or researchers?  Many good young agricultural graduates are coming on stream and I imagine they would be delighted to get into the Department to learn and get some experience before moving out.</p> <p>  Considerable work is done on inspections.  We know the Department is reviewing the Agriculture Appeals Act.  The quicker the review, the better.  I read with some alarm two articles by Darragh McCullough in the past two weeks.  The reports would make a person's hair stand on end.  I know that Department officials and those dealing with it are somewhat numbed as well in so far as they appear to be perplexed by the complexity of the various things they have to deal with.  These things are imposed by Europe - I am not saying they are imposed by Department officials.  Certainly, we need to streamline this area, especially if people are dropping out because of the associated complexity and because the eligibility criteria are so strict.</p> <p>  My next question relates to targeted agricultural modernisation schemes.  Let us suppose someone is spending &euro;45,000 or &euro;50,000 and buys a big bulk tank or new milking machine.  What happens if Department officials arrive the following day and the farmer has everything there and is using the machinery, but then is knocked back?  A person can have all the degrees in the world &ndash; I have gathered a few in my time &ndash; but if there is no common sense then no degree is worth a sugar.  I know that myself.  I have one case going into the Department and the details of it are frightening.  The person is an extremely hard worker and is working desperately.  He is spending &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000.  He is in for 40%.  His is putting in new robotic milking apparatus.  I think someone arrived.  The matter is with the Minister now.  We are in the middle of appeals and whinges and everything else.  I think we have to bring some common sense to these matters.  He bought the machinery because of the incentive provided by the TAMS measure.  Otherwise, he would not be on the pitch at all.  The Department's position will come as some slap to him and he will be &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 out.  We have to bring some common sense to it.  I realise we must have rules and regulations, but he did not start it one month, three weeks or a week in advance - it was one day ahead.  </p> <p>  A great friend of mine down in Mullingar used to scourge everyone.  His name is Eunan Bannon.  He was a sheep man.  He always wanted this welfare arrangement.  He was a great advocate of the welfare sheep.</p></speech>

I think everyone knows Eunan.  Am I reading this right?  The Department provides for &euro;800,000 more in ewes than the actual number that comes in.  Is that right?  Surely, the figure must be &euro;8 million.  There is an &euro;8 million underspend.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I am actually surprised by it.  This relates to one of the things we had before the current Minister assumed office.  His predecessor had a major campaign to get this scheme brought in.  In fairness, the Department provided the money.  Now, however, it is not being taken up.  I would be delighted to remind the former Minister about it &ndash; I will probably meet him tomorrow night somewhere.  I will tell him that people did not take it up.  Is it because of two health-related actions?  Are they part of the problem?  I cannot see it.  Have Department officials given any thought to what has led to this significant shortfall in the anticipated numbers that would participate?</p> <p>  I am a great advocate of the beef genomics scheme.  I am glad to see Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raising the matter.  Deputy McConalogue, Deputy Cahill and myself have had some significant clashes on it.  I was a strong advocate and I think it is important.  In fairness, it is useful but there are large numbers of technical requirements.  I have a brother involved and he is a relaxed person.  There is such a level of technicality involved that one could overstep and lose.  That is the problem.  I am beginning to wonder about some of the management requirements.  Will the Minister arrange for some officials to examine which of the management requirements are the biggest blocks to people participating?  The numbers involved in part 2 of the beef data and genomics programme are disappointing.  I thought the programme would get another 5,000 or 6,000 participants.  I believe the potential of this scheme is over 30,000 or thereabouts.</p></speech>

He is great.   I would like to know what the major drawback is.</p> <p>  Another thing surprises me.  The Minister came through the system.  He was in Macra na Feirme and many other organisations.  Macra na Feirme has been advocating for a renewal of the installation aid scheme.  The Minister has done a good deal for young farmers, in fairness.  When a young person is taking over a farm many hidden extras arise.  In fairness, the Minister has done a good deal in the recent budget and recent changes have been most helpful.  I was a great advocate of the installation aid scheme.  It was only &euro;7,500 but that aid was vital.  I know many young farmers took over during the 1990s and that was great.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill made reference to the Brexit loan scheme and I know what he means.  He referred to the scheme by analogy as a cash flow scheme brought in by the Minister.  I hope the &euro;25 million will help ordinary farmers with the response to Brexit.  I hope it is not too curtailed.  I presume the Department will use the banks again for the Brexit loan scheme.  I presume it will be modelled on the previous scheme but I hope it is not as restrictive.</p> <p>  I am delighted with the Bord Bia measure.  One organisation I always advocate for is Bord Bia.  Bord Bia has done a great job and has a great record.  During Aidan Cotter's time in the organisation the amount of positive work done was extraordinary, as was the number of graduates trained.  Many of those who graduated through Bord Bia are all over the world.  A significant number are in America and they are being head-hunted.  That is a tribute to the skills they acquired from Bord Bia.  I would like to see more of them kept within Bord Bia.</p><p>With the wage structures available and the category of graduates coming from Bord Bia, they will be snapped up by other organisations.  We need them now and over the next three to five years.  This may be heresy but it is important that the Minister would go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and make a case for trying to retain a number of those people.  They are exceptionally good graduates and they are very talented.  I am acutely aware that a number of them are being head-hunted by various organisations in America.  As soon as they are in one job in America, they are head-hunted from that job.  It is not the most popular thing to say but because of what we must face over the next two or three years in the context of Brexit, we need those types of people with particular skills and expertise.  I would like to see us in the position to retain and reward them accordingly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.80" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017112800002#F00200"><p>I thank Deputy Penrose.  On the recruitment and savings element, my own take is that the embargo on recruitment for a number of years meant the age profile increased significantly.  We are now trying to recruit but we are also losing quite rapidly at the other end with people going to retirement early and just because they have reached the age.  We are running to stand still.  We are just about getting ahead of it now and part of that comes from recruiting people in mid-year or the back end of the year, so we are not getting the full-year cost.  I am advised there is no particular sector where there is a specific shortage but it is across the Department.  We were hoping to get our staff numbers from just under 3,000 to 3,200 over the course of the past year.  We are starting to make better progress but it is, as I stated, a case of running flat out to just about get ahead of the attrition rate.</p> <p>  On the installation aid matter, a value-for-money audit was done on the scheme that was quite critical of it as an untargeted approach.  I do not know if the Department or the Comptroller and Auditor General did it.  At that stage one got the money and there was no specific obligation on what to do with it.  In recent years with the national reserve and young farmer top-up it costs as much and probably more than the installation aid but it has a specific focus.  If there is on-farm investment, there will be a 60% grant and priority access to the national reserve for young farmers.  These are practical and more focused elements.  I appreciate there are hidden expenses to taking over a farm and installation aid money was important for that.  Some of those expenses were related to improving the infrastructure on the farm, which now has a higher rate of targeted grant aid.</p> <p>  I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy's comments about Bord Bia.  Not to tell the committee its business but perhaps it would be a very useful exercise to invite delegates from Bord Bia before it.</p></speech>

They are being resourced to do it.  They are highly motivated people.  The matter of staff recruitment and retention is inexorably tied up with public sector pay and it would be very difficult to specifically ring-fence this for Bord Bia when there is a host of other sectors in the economy seeking higher than the average pay increases.  They do an excellent job.</p> <p>  We are not quite sure why there has not been full take-up in the sheep welfare scheme.  The scheme was designed in very close consultation with farm organisations and it is very practical.  It is designed for the needs of both the hill sheep farmer side and the lowland farmer.  There are options that can be used.  We were surprised we did not have closer to a full take-up.  In any scheme that might happen.  Now that the first tranche of claimants are out there and we will re-open it, we hope to see more people coming in.  It is a very simple scheme to comply with.</p> <p>  The review of the appeal system is up and running.  I have a slightly different view that we should be careful what we wish for.  I believe the system worked reasonably well but the review is up and running and has eminent people involved with it.  Let us see where the chips will fall.  The agricultural appeals model is different from others and perhaps we should be glad it was somewhat different.  Let us see how this plays out.</p> <p>  On specific cases of the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, there is a requirement for a level of inspections.  I would like to think Department staff are, by and large, very practical people with such inspections.  That is my experience.  There are regulations, compliance and audits of which we must be cognisant.  If the Deputy has an individual case he would like to bring to our attention, we are certainly prepared to look at it.</p> <p>  I also believe in the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP.  It can bring a degree of scientific evidence to the industry that is required.  We have a very commercially focused dairy sector.  If we could get 30,000 to 40,000 highly focused commercial beef people, we would have a great foundation for an industry.  The problem is the industry is currently haphazard and fractured, with too many cattle movements and not enough cradle-to-grave operations on the beef side.  On that basis, too many people are trying to make a slice from an animal.  The BDGP has the potential to do for the beef side what genetic improvement has done for the dairy side over many years.  In any scheme, in due course we must look at it to see if it delivers and whether we need to tweak it.  We would have thought there would have been more applicants.  Apart from the few that came in, thousands of people were in it and left voluntarily.  There were nearly 5,000 who originally applied and did not activate their application.  The big challenge in the Irish agricultural industry is to drive a substantial cohort of commercial beef operations.  All the evidence is there, from the Teagasc farms on different soil types, that although the incomes may not be comparable with dairy, one can have a decent income in the beef sector if all the correct management decisions are being made.  BDGP is only one aspect and grassland management etc. is another.  It is a good scheme and in due course we will have to look at it and see if it is delivering and whether it should be tweaked etc.  It has great potential to deliver.</p></speech>

The people pay a deposit to secure equipment.  When they look for a grant they are penalised because they have part paid before they apply for the grant.  In the modern world, these people are forced to pay a deposit to secure a deal and this is a problem when they apply for a grant for the equipment.  It is occurring more frequently now and it must be addressed.  These people are not breaking any rules and the equipment has not been delivered.  They have put down a deposit to secure the deal and run into problems with grant approvals.</p></speech>

They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>I also wish to advise witnesses that any submission or opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind witnesses and members to turn off their mobile phones or turn them to flight mode.</p><p>I welcome the witnesses here this evening.  We have officials from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  We also have representatives from the following stakeholders: An Post; the post office network business development group; the Irish Postmasters' Union and Age Action Ireland Limited.  This will be followed by a questions and answers session with the members.  </p><p>The committee last engaged with stakeholders on 17 January and wrote to the Taoiseach recommending that a single Minister should be responsible for An Post and the post office network. </p><p>I understand that has now happened and the Department of Rural and Community Development is still responsible for investigating the Sparkassen model and how it might apply in Ireland and in particular to An Post and the post office network.  The witnesses' opening statements and presentations were circulated to the committee and will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  </p><p>We have received apologies from the Communications Workers' Union, CWU, and Tico Mail which were also invited to the meeting today.  Mr. Pigot would like the letter he forwarded to the committee to be noted and circulated to committee members.  </p><p>I will start with the first witness from each organisation.  If they want to introduce other speakers from their organisations they should do so as they go along.  We will start with the witnesses from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  They are Ms Patricia Cronin, assistant secretary, and Ms Barbara Leeson, principal officer, both of the corporate governance division.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia Cronin" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017112800002#B00200"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it.  By way of background, I will explain the role of the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, which is responsible for the postal sector, including the governance of An Post.  It is responsible for ensuring the company is fully compliant with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and the governance functions included in the statutory framework underpinning An Post.</p> <p>  The committee facilitated a very informative and useful discussion on the challenges facing An Post last January.  Since then there have been a number of developments which I will now update the committee on.  To start, the committee will be aware that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment briefed the Government last week on the comprehensive strategic plan that An Post has prepared, the objective of which is to secure the long-term viability of both the post office and mails businesses and return the company to a sound financial footing. </p> <p>  The current financial challenges facing An Post have been well documented over the past year.  They have arisen mainly from the decline in mail volume and the move to electronic transactions in both the mail and post office network.  In my previous appearance I indicated that mail volume decline accelerated to 5.5% in 2016.  This trend has continued this year with volumes to date down 7.5%.  This is a global trend and is not unique to the Irish postal service.  However, the action taken by the Minister and approved by the Oireachtas to facilitate the repeal of the price cap mechanism has worked to stabilise turnover on the mails side.  This has resulted in an improved financial forecast for An Post for 2017 with a much lower level of losses now anticipated. </p> <p>  Despite the improved financial forecast, the Government accepts the long-term challenges facing An Post in both the mails and post office business.  In response, the Government has agreed to make available State funding of &euro;30 million to enable An Post to move quickly in delivering on the vision of the plan, building on the momentum of actions taken this year.  The &euro;30 million has been ring-fenced for the five day a week universal postal service in order that it continues to every address in the country and to support and develop services in the post office network.  This funding will be provided in the form of a repayable long-term loan.  To ensure its long-term success against the backdrop of an accelerated decline in mail volume and falling revenues, An Post is embarking on a significant transformation programme.  As this loan represents an Exchequer injection to An Post, it will be subject to a degree of oversight including a new letter of expectation from the shareholding Ministers.  The detail of how this will be managed is being worked on. </p> <p>  The strategic plan prepared by An Post harnesses the company's existing strengths such as its nationwide reach, trusted brand and the relationship of postmasters with communities, both urban and rural.  At the same time, An Post has recognised it cannot and should not fight the digital agenda.  It must be embraced and this is reflected in the plan, especially in the emphasis on growing the parcels business.  For example, the company now offers Saturday and evening deliveries and has launched new product lines such as AddressPal and ReturnsPal, embracing the rising trend of online shopping.  Enhanced banking services are becoming available through the post office network with the smart bank account.  It is expected that further such opportunities will be available across the network, especially as high-speed broadband becomes widely available through the roll-out of the national broadband plan. </p> <p>  The Government decision last week also formally transferred the post office network back to my Department from the Department of Community and Rural Development.  The community banking model will be finalised by that Department.  </p> <p>  The Government has also committed to exploring the potential for extra business for the post office network, including motor tax.  The nationwide reach of the post office network makes it uniquely positioned to act as a gateway to Government.  The local post office and local staff who deliver mail are still an important part of the fabric of local communities, especially in rural areas, and the Government recognises the importance of ensuring this continues into the future.  Part of the Government response includes the development of the digital assist concept where the post office will act as a digital gateway to Government.  This project will be developed on a pilot basis working with Government, An Post and postmasters.  </p> <p>  There are concerns about the closure of post offices and it is something that also concerns the Minister.  Overall activity levels are down by 15% since 2013 and annual payments to some post offices have reduced by up to 20%.  These reductions mean the income model is becoming unsustainable, especially for postmasters operating smaller post offices. </p> <p>  The Minister is extremely conscious of the value placed on local post offices in towns and villages across the country.  While it is accepted that in light of the ongoing decline in activity the network must be renewed, it is also important that this is done in a controlled and transparent manner.  An Post is entering into a period of significant change but this change is critical to ensuring the long-term success of our national postal operator and a sustainable post office network.  Doing nothing is simply not an option.  </p> <p>  Once again, I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David McRedmond" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017112800002#B00300"><p>I submitted my introductory remarks to the committee so I will highlight a number of the items in it.  When I appeared before the committee last year I had just joined An Post.  We had a very severe financial crisis.  PwC had estimated we would lose &euro;61 million this year.  I am pleased to say that as a result of some of the actions Ms Cronin outlined and some of the actions we have taken in An Post, we expect to break even by the end of the year.  We have managed to get ourselves into a position of some sustainability but we have yet to get ourselves to a position of growth.  One of the essential things we did was to increase prices but that just got them up to the European average.  It has been extremely important for us to take the tough decisions that allow a business and service to be viable.  For years prices were suppressed and it was a tough decision.  I commend the Department, the Minister and the Government for backing it.  It has allowed us to get to viability.  The second thing is in terms of mails and parcels we completely relaunched our parcels business.  This time last year there was a project about whether An Post should probably get out of parcels.  We said parcels were our future.  We worked very closely with the unions, particularly the CWU.  We agreed to Saturday delivery, later cut-off times and a whole range of new products so that today customers in Ireland have probably one of the best parcel services anywhere in Europe.  They are able to get parcels from anywhere around the world.  They can get them delivered next day and collected from their homes.  It is very significant change.  To date, we have about &euro;8 million additional revenue from that parcel business.  The third thing we have done is made a very significant reduction in our head count.  At the end of this year, somewhere in the region of 350 people will have left.  Some have left already but 316 additional people will be leaving An Post.  That has been done with the agreement of the unions on a voluntary basis.  That is a huge credit to the staff of An Post and shows the organisation is really grappling with the issues of the pressures of mail decline.  That is what has happened on the mails and parcels side of the business.  We have implemented a strategy.  We brought in McKinsey.  We looked at the business of An Post and we decided to split between mail and parcels and the post office network.  The mails and parcels business is now moving forward like a train and I can see a whole load of developments coming there in the years ahead as we become the backbone for e-commerce in Ireland.  The post office network side of the business we have done all we can centrally to be able to reform and modernise that business.  It needs rapid modernisation.  We have put in place a management team that has control over the business.  We have identified the three areas in which the business has to succeed and grow.  The first is in financial services.</p><p>We launched the smart account, but we have far more to do.  We have to investigate again where An Post can go with banking, community banking and making services available throughout the State.  We are exploring that right now while we continue to develop financial products.  We have proven that we can do it.  We have proven with our smart account and foreign exchange services that we have the capability.  We need to extend our range of services.  We have also proven our capability with State savings.  Through An Post, the State has built up savings of over &euro;20 billion.  We believe we can build something very big on the back of this significant business and significant level of activity.</p><p> The second area of interest is Government services.  This probably relates somewhat to the earlier conversation about the television licence fee.  I was unaware of this proposal until I read about it in the Sunday newspapers.  When I think about the real meaning of the post office, it strikes me that it should be the State's office in every town and community.  We have committed to ensuring there is a post office in every community of over 500 people.  We want the harp to be above the door.  We want citizens to know they can get every service through the post office.  We want all of those services to be available through An Post online.  That is a major piece of activity for the post office network.  Financial services is the first leg of our activity and Government services are the second leg.  It is right that Deputies and Senators are concerned about whether post offices will remain open, but it is wholly unrealistic of them to want to keep every post office open while moving Government services away from the post office.  It is very important that we do our job to deliver that efficiently, well and in a modern way so that consumers can absolutely rely on the service they get from the post office and can see the post office as a one-stop shop.  If we make Government services available, we can add real value to communities throughout the State.  It is a very important piece of what we do.</p><p> The third area I would like to highlight is our mail and parcels business, which is the backbone of e-commerce in Ireland.  We want to strengthen the important part the post office network plays in that supply chain and make sure it is known.  The post office has a viable and strong future.  We have completely restructured ourselves internally.  We have built a machine that can deliver what we are seeking to deliver.  We need to be able to move on with the actual footprint of the network so it can work in a way that involves modern and properly broadband-connected post offices that can deliver a range of services.  The attention and focus of the post office side of the business will be on providing those services, which will be replicated online, in the months and years ahead. </p></speech>

I have not really done anything since I submitted my report.  I would like to recap on what I recommended with the collaboration of the Irish Postmasters Union and the company.  I recommended to the Department that &euro;56 million should be spent over a four-year period to regrade all the post offices into three grades.  I suggested that the amount of money to be provided under the capital investment plan would vary depending on the post office involved.  I proposed that a co-location incentive be introduced to encourage post offices to relocate to convenience stores or other locations.  I recommended that a minimum payment should be guaranteed to smaller post offices, which currently do not enjoy such a guarantee.  I suggested what the network should do over four years to be best positioned to survive.  I proposed that &euro;4 million from the &euro;56 million fund should be allocated to pay for the closure of 80 post offices, at an average of &euro;50,000 per post office.  It seemed to me from my discussions with the company and the union that a number of offices wanted to leave the network and I thought this could be facilitated.  I submitted my report when my work ended and I wished everybody well.  I read about the latest modification of what was submitted in the newspapers and online.  I am happy to contribute by answering any questions members might ask me.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Kerr for the work he has done.  He has reminded us that almost 12 months have passed since the solutions to this problem were highlighted, but nothing has happened in the meantime.<br/><br/>I welcome the investment of &euro;30 million in the post office network announced last week by the Minister, Deputy Naughten.  Our understanding is that this &euro;30 million will be divided between the universal service obligation mail business and the post office network.  We are not clear on that.  While we welcome the investment, it has to be prioritised as a matter of urgency.  As the Minister has acknowledged in the D&aacute;il, during the year that has passed since Mr. Kerr proposed his solutions, the individual incomes of postmasters have decreased at an alarming rate.  The network is in danger of collapse.  Individual postmasters cannot survive.  We are looking for clarity on the breakdown of the investment.  We do not know what the investment is for.  As far as we are concerned, it must deliver sustainable news services in post offices.  Postmasters cannot determine what services they provide.  They depend on An Post and the Government to provide them with services.<br/><br/>The four-year transition mentioned by Mr. Kerr must be supported to enable postmasters to adapt to new commercial contracts that are agreed.  The goal of keeping as large and as sustainable a network as possible open must be supported.  It is not sustainable at the moment.  We recognise that postmasters' contracts are in need of review.  The allocation that has been approved by the Cabinet will go some way towards enabling this process to be agreed and completed.  This investment should allow for an ordered review and an agreed plan for the future size of the post office network.  A concern of ours is that it must not get diverted.  We are aware of all the issues faced by An Post.  We recognise all the solutions outlined by Mr. McRedmond.  Our fear is that some of the investment will be diverted away from the post office network and will be used to address other issues in An Post.<br/><br/>I would like to remind people of the overall position.  The people of Ireland regard the post office network as a national asset.  It is a key resource in addressing many of the issues in rural and urban Ireland.  We believe the service we provide represents good value for the people of Ireland.  Postmasters are paid by transaction.  Our firm belief is that any issues in An Post are not caused by postmasters and cannot be linked to the amounts of money paid to postmasters.  The post office network can offer expanded and safe financial services and innovative social and community services.  We are trusted.  People want to use their post offices.  They want them to stay open and to do much more.  On a macro level, the postal industry is in decline but the demand for personal services has not changed.  Communities should not be threatened just because the postal industry is changing.  Some 30% of the transactions handled by postmasters at the moment are post office-related, some 55% of them are Government-related and 15% of them are commercially-related.  The postal industry is in transition,  but that should not threaten the demand and the need of communities for personal services in their post offices.<br/><br/>We want clarification on what happens next following last week's announcement by the Minister.  We need full transparency and details.  We need a breakdown of what this money is specifically for.  Last week, the Minister said:</p><blockquote>The &euro;30 million which has been put into the company has been ring-fenced for the five day a week universal postal service in order that it continues to every address in the country and to support and develop services in the post office network.  The nationwide reach of the post office network makes it uniquely positioned to act as a gateway to Government.</blockquote> <p>That statement does not clarify what the money entails for the development of the actual network.</p><p>We understand, but it has not been clarified, that the announcement involves &euro;15 million for the post office network and &euro;15 million to support the universal service obligation.  We need clarity.</p><p> We also want to know the time period for the investment.  This is not clear.  We also want to know what new services are planned in post offices.  The Minister has spoken about exploring the potential for extra Government business.  Exploring the potential for extra Government business and delivering extra Government business do not sound urgent from our point of view.  Mr. Bobby Kerr knows that from the first day we sat down with his group we spoke about the provision of motor tax services over post office counters.  We recognise the service is going online, with 60% to 65% online, but we would regard this as an indicator of the Government's intention to do something for the post office network.  We produced a report in 2014 which stated the Government could save &euro;65 million over five years by allowing the post offices to provide a motor tax service.  We are not looking for exclusivity, but we are looking for a signal that the Government is interested in saving the post office network.  Exploring the potential for extra Government business, including motor tax, does not signal to us we will get motor tax any time soon.</p><p> A new pilot initiative, digital assist, will use local post offices as digital gateways for Government business.  More that 12 months ago, we made a presentation to the Department with responsibility for rural affairs and provided a solution with regard to social services.  We were promised that five pilot schemes would be up and running and &euro;100,000 was allocated for them.  It is 28 November 2017 and nothing has happened in this regard.  When will motor tax be available for payment at post offices?  What range of services will digital assist involve and when will they come on stream, other than that somebody is committed to exploring them?</p><p> At the announcement, key performance indicators were referenced.  These are to measure the project referred to by the Government last week.  We would like to know what are these performance indicators, in so far as they relate to postmasters, and how will they be measured.  What is planned with regard to the renewal of the network?  If there is a requirement to close any post office, and we represent every postmaster, we will only countenance any suggestion in this regard so long as it is on a voluntary basis.  We have heard compulsory closures may be required.  The business of any post office closed under such circumstances, that is involuntarily, must transfer to the neighbouring postmaster to ensure those offices have a sustainable future.  They must not be siphoned off or encouraged off to a means other than the nearest post office.  We also want clarity on what the announcement accounts for in terms of modernising postmasters' contracts.  What is the vision of An Post and of the Government on the size of the network over the coming four to five years?</p><p> Resulting from the work we did with Mr. Bobby Kerr, postmasters believe a full range of additional State financial, social and community services can be provided, including all Government payments for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, motor tax, the HSE, the CAO, third level, fines, licences, all Government forms including electronic form completion, and identity verification.  As we stated a year ago, postmasters are ideally placed to be peace commissioners.  There are also counter transactions for all commercial banks.  People throughout the country are up in arms about commercial banks closing and being robotised and there is a demand for personal service.  With regard to remote health checks, a postmaster here today provides a video doc service in his post office in Ballymore Eustace because the doctor only goes to the village twice a week.  People use that service.  Post offices could also be used for transport information, bookings and meeting points.  They could also be used for information and communications technology services.  I have stated previously that the people to whom we speak regard this as the adult literacy issue of this age.  People are crying out for information and training with regard to information and communications technology.  We already provide citizens with tourist information unpaid on a voluntary basis.</p><p> Mr. McRedmond referred to the television licence.  We read about the committee's proposal that the television licence be taken away from post offices.  This will cost postmasters &euro;3 million per annum.  We regard this with alarm.  We believe the Minister has proposed &euro;15 million for the post office network, but &euro;3 million of this has already been taken away by the recommendation of the committee.</p><p> The Minister announced a &euro;30 million investment last week and we welcome this.  It would be churlish not to.  Many challenges are faced by An Post, and we need full clarity that the post office network allocation will not get diverted to addressing the other issues in An Post.  Postmasters and the communities we serve need assurance, transparency, detail and a timeline of how this investment will translate into post offices being supported and kept open, additional services being provided as a matter of urgency, a fair and acceptable exit process for non-viable post offices, clarity and agreement on what a new postmasters' contract would look like, and an agreed and planned vision on the sizes of the Irish post office network.  I repeat that this is 28 November 2017.  These solutions were available on 28 November 2016 and nothing has happened.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it.</p></speech>

As stated in the Kerr report, the post office is an essential service for facilitating communication and interaction in local communities.  It is especially important for older people who use the post office to collect pensions, get cash, pay utility bills and, perhaps most importantly, meet their friends.  One Age Action member described the local post office as the most sociable place in town.</p> <p>  The closure of post offices in rural communities forces older people to rely on a transport system that is not fit for purpose, or on the kindness of friends and family members, to get the next town.  In this context, we warmly welcome the additional funding announced by the Minister last week and his statement to the D&aacute;il that the Government is fully committed to a sustainable post office network.  However, echoing Mr. O'Hara's point, we have seen no further detail on how this money will be used.  Are closed post offices, such as those in Sandymount in Dublin or Cleggan in Galway, to be reopened?  Are post offices threatened with closure now safe or, as has been suggested, are these funds to be used to create a redundancy fund to pension off postmasters?  Put simply, how will communities throughout the country, particularly in rural Ireland, benefit from this additional &euro;30 million?  In practical terms, what will change for them?</p> <p>  Another matter on which we would welcome more detail is the digital assist pilot initiative, which envisages the post offices as a digital gateway.  Recent CSO figures show almost half of Irish people aged over 60 have never used the Internet in any circumstance.  We know this proportion is even higher among people in their 70s and 80s.  This is a disturbing statistic in an increasingly online society and evidence of a rapidly emerging digital divide.  I acknowledge and welcome the funding received from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment for Age Action's programme to train older people to get online.  How will digital assist work for those older people and others unfamiliar with online services?  Who will teach them how to use the computers?  Who will ensure they do so in a secure manner?  It may be helpful for the Department and An Post to explore how this pilot programme could be supported by organisations such as Age Action providing computer training to older people.</p> <p>  I welcome the roll-out of the smart current account by An Post.  We would be delighted to see additional new financial services and the expansion of State services outlined by Mr. McRedmond in our post offices.  In recent years, we have noticed a large increase in the number of complaints from older people frustrated by banks closing branches, reducing services and avoiding dealing with customers in person.  Many have expressed frustration at being unable to take their business to their post office, and I urge everyone involved to expand more quickly the services available in our post offices.</p> <p>  In preparing for today's meeting, I came across a debate between the Minister and an Opposition spokesperson about allowing people to pay their motor tax in their local post office.  The debate took place in 1987 and concluded with the Minister announcing that a working group was to be established to look at the matter.  It is 30 years later and the same suggestion is still being made, and it was as valid then as it is now.  I welcome the efforts by the Minister, the Department, An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union to work collectively to save our post office network, but I urge all to move more quickly to preserve this priceless national asset on which so many older people rely.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.110" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Phil Cooley" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017112800002#D00400"><p>I work with Age Action as an information officer.  On 24 November 2016, a large queue of people were chatting outside the post office in Rialto where people went to collect pensions, disability and other social welfare payments, pay their bills and carry out banking.</p><p>A note on the door said that the post office was closed for business and offered Dolphin's Barn as an alternative.  Rialto has a large number of older people and others who depend on the post office.  Many with mobility issues use Rollators and Zimmer frames.  Accessing Dolphin's Barn was very difficult for them.  They were using taxis they could not afford to get their pension.  One older resident told me she would not be able to pay toward her heating this week as it went on the taxi.  The closure was done without notice or any form of consultation, just a note was stuck on the door.  A small group of local residents, myself included, gathered in our local community centre to form a campaign.  We wrote to An Post to seek a meeting.  That Saturday we started to collect signatures on a petition to reopen Rialto post office.  That campaign was run every Saturday at the Rialto shops throughout Christmas.</p><p> Though we never met An Post, it was aware of our campaign as it gathered momentum.  We produced banners and flyers with the help of local businesses.  I thank our local elected representatives from all parties who were very supportive of the campaign and contacted An Post directly.  In late January 2017, we learned that it was not An Post's intention to terminate the post office service in Rialto but it needed a new location.  This was very good news and very hopeful.  However, we needed to be vigilant to be sure we did get our post office back.  We kept in contact with suitable businesses in the area and continued our campaigning.  In early April, we learned that the Rialto Centra had been successful with the tender and the post office reopened on 12 June this year.  We continued the campaign for a few weeks, urging people to use the service and return to Rialto post office.</p><p> I wanted to tell the story of our campaign as a way of acknowledging all of the local people and representatives who supported us.  For more that seven months right through winter and spring, we collected signatures, ran stalls and organised meetings.  Many told us we were wasting our time and the post office would never come back.  While I am proud our campaign succeeded, I know similar campaigns in other areas have not.  I believe that communities should not have to fight so hard to protect essential services.</p></speech>

I might start with a few questions and then bring in the Deputies and Senators.  If anyone wants to come in on any particular question, just indicate to me.</p> <p>  Mr. McRedmond stated that he wanted a post office within 15 km of every household in rural areas and 3 km in urban areas, and a post office in every town with a population in excess of 500 inhabitants.  How would that square with the lack of transport in rural areas?  Perhaps the witnesses from Age Action might want to come in on this if they have assessed how that would impact on local communities.  The witnesses should bank those questions and I will come back.  Does Deputy Fitzmaurice have a question or Senator McDowell?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.114" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1403" speakername="Michael McDowell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017112800002#E00400"><p>There are a few questions that I would like to put arising out of the presentations.  I found them very helpful on all fronts.  I think the idea that the post office should be a local State office is a good one.  It should also be a portal for online services, even with the State.  The idea that it could be used for medical consultations and other suggestions is really inventive thinking.</p> <p>  It occurs to me that local authorities might be able to use post offices also, not just the central State.  If one wants to get some service from the local authority or to report something to the local authority, the local post office could be the means of communication with county councils and the like.  That is a fairly vague proposal but if one wants to have some business with the local authority, it seems to me that is a way of doing it.</p> <p>  On financial services, I was listening recently to an advertisement on the radio for life policies being used to cover funeral expenses.  They are being marketed at the moment for people over 55.  It struck me that at the end of it there were about five or six sentences added to it saying who it was organised by, that the Central Bank had licensed it and all of these complexities.  A State agency was promoting a financial service and half of the advertisement was spent trying to comply with the Central Bank or other regulatory requirements.  It made the advertisement unpleasant to listen to and diluted the impact almost completely.  Will the Central Bank give the witnesses a much simpler type of logo, word or phrase which gets one past all of this garbage?  We do not want to hear people blathering and almost too fast to hear all sorts of stuff which ruins every advertisement. </p> <p>  On parcels, I happen to get them because of a hobby I have.  Rathmines post office is not open on a Saturday.  That is the one time I want to go and collect a parcel but they do not want to give it to me.  A parcel motel service is needed if one wants to be serious about that service.  One wants to be able to collect it when working people, what the Taoiseach called people who get up early in the morning, can come and collect their parcels.  There is no point in telling a working person who is sitting in an apartment somewhere that they can take hours off work to hunt down their parcel.</p> <p>  An old hobbyhorse of mine is getting stamps to send letters.  I know it is easier now, but I cannot believe that something like a franking machine cannot be put on the outside of post offices.  One could stick one's letter in and use a credit card.  One does not need cash.  If one wants to frank a letter, one can frank it there and then and send it off.  Many people say they will send a letter without a stamp because it is too complicated.  They will avoid the witness's system.  It is difficult to access the postal delivery service.  I know most of An Post's business now is coming from large institutions which have franking machines.  However, for the ordinary Joe and Josephine Soap, the hassle of getting a stamp is big.  If there are parking machines that spit out little adhesive labels, it must be possible to have something equivalent for a letter.  The other option is to stick the letter into a slot and do it that way.  I feel there are difficulties in using An Post's services.</p> <p>  Mention was made of the television licence fee and that &euro;3 million was going to be lost from post offices' revenue.  We launched a report today on that subject.  The idea we put forward is to have the Revenue Commissioners collect this on the basis that every house has to pay it.  It is already collecting money from every house in the form of the local property tax.  It is fair to raise the point that this is a revenue stream which it is proposed to be curtailed. However, it is not going to happen immediately.  When it does, it will be up to the State and local authorities to think of other revenue streams which can be used.</p> <p>  Is it possible for a post office, reimagined as the local State, local authority, parcel and financial services office, to provide agency services for the broader private sector?</p></speech>

The first issue is the number of post offices.  I can absolutely understand that the role of Members of the Oireachtas includes representing citizens, looking after them and ensuring that the post office network is maintained, but an obsession with the number of post offices holds back the development of the post office network more than anything.  It is far more constructive to talk about the coverage of the post office network and the services it provides.  We all know that, as a by-product of modernising the network, some post offices will inevitably close.  This is simply because people have moved away from areas where those post offices are situated.  What the Senator has described quite correctly is our minimum service.  There is a minimum commitment about what will be available in those places and the distance from people.  That minimum commitment is very positive because it is bigger than the current minimum commitment.  At the moment there is no commitment other than one relating to the distance a person lives from a post office.  It is, therefore, intended to strengthen the network.  However, there will inevitably be some consolidation of the network, whether it is what Bobby Kerr is saying or what Ned O'Hara is saying about it having to be voluntary.  We accept all of these different views but that is essential.  We must move on in terms of the services we provide and ensure that the coverage is adequate.  I respect the right of the committee to ensure that the coverage is adequate but the number of post offices might not always be the most useful measure.<br/><br/>The second issue is whether local authorities could use post offices.  Absolutely.  We have a website called <i>licences.ie</i>and I believe every licence and planning permission form ought to be on it.  There is the retail jargon &quot;omni-channel&quot;, which means something is available online as well as in a place made with bricks and mortar such as a post office.  We cannot hold back the digital world and we must make our services available online even if it means fewer people going into post offices.  However, if we expand the range of services, we will get that share.  For instance, we do a very good job with our passport service.  We know that there will always be that 25% of people who will want to go to the post office to get it.  It is important they know that the post office is the place it can be got and we are comprehensive in our services.  Dog licences is another area.  To have all of these services, which are the daily things that annoy us in our lives, available in a one-stop shop, which is the post office, is really important.  Local authorities are very important, particularly around motor tax and the provision of driver's licences, although that service is not with local authorities at the moment.  We would work closely with them.  We have had to get our own house in order inside in An Post to ensure that we are properly organised as a retail business and are able to deliver these products.  This is something Bobby Kerr and I, given my past, recognise.<br/><br/>The third issue was life policies for funeral expenses.  This is a very popular product.  The biggest issue we face with banking, which is why we cannot just introduce all these services immediately, is the level of regulation and the need to have a banking licence.  At what point do we need to have a banking licence?  We do not currently have one.  Banking services stopped because a partner of ours, Fortis, a Belgian bank, went bankrupt.  It was not the fault of An Post.  However, we have to explore this again and find a way around it.<br/><br/>Having come from the television industry and seen the amount of time and advertising spent on it, I could not agree more that there should just be a stamp that says &quot;Approved by the Central Bank&quot;.  That would be enough and it is short enough.  We should somehow be able to find a way to get to that.<br/><br/>Regarding parcels, even worse than the issue of post offices not opening on a Saturday is that of post offices not opening at lunchtime.  I appreciate that they are small offices and it is difficult for people to man them, but we simply have to change that in this day and age.  This is why I look forward to working with the IPU and postmasters to find a way to get post offices open.  We have just done it with our parcels service to ensure that people can get their parcels on a Saturday and that there are later cut-off times.  We now need to do that with post offices.  To me it is not acceptable that we are not open at lunchtime or on Saturdays.  It is not the fault necessarily of postmasters.  It is that of An Post.  We have to fix that and we will fix it.  I hope it is done very soon.  I should note for the benefit of the Senator that we deliver to homes, so we can deliver to his home.  Our delivery service can now leave it with a neighbour or nearby or we can do a number of other things.  However, the point is well made. <br/><br/>On having a franking machine outside post office, we should have those.  I have seen stamp machines on the street.  However, I have not been asked this before so I will have to go back and look at it.<br/><br/>On the licence fee, I completely respect what the committee is doing.  My background was in television for years.  I understand why RT&Eacute; needs this and I appreciate the work done on it.  It is an example of where post offices need to be somewhere in the thinking.  This is not to preserve the post office but the idea of a one-stop shop for everyone.  Services should not be taken away from the post office, especially in light of what those from Age Action say about being able to go to the post office in Rialto or wherever else, knowing that one can get all the services there.  The services might be added on elsewhere but they should also be available through the post office.<br/><br/>I cannot read my writing but I think the final issue is whether we can provide the services-----</p></speech>

There are private licences but some licences which we do not have are semi-State licences.  For example, we do not sell Leap cards.  It is ridiculous that we do not have the licence to sell Leap cards.  This needs to be thought through.  I am very grateful for the support, including financial support, of the Department but we need to work with all the Departments to ensure that we get these services.  The <i>quid pro quo</i>is we need to do a better job in order that we can guarantee they will be available and done efficiently.  I hope that we will do that.</p></speech>

I understand the focus on the number of post offices but it can be quite frustrating given the focus needs to be on expanding the services available in them.  To nuance the issue slightly, our members' concern is less about the number of post offices closing down and more about the issue of accessibility.  Having fewer post offices that people can still get to makes sense.  At this point, it goes way beyond the responsibility of the Department or An Post.  We are talking about rural transport more generally, which I could talk about for a long time.  It is probably one of the key issues for older people.  Rather than being something stakeholders can deal with, we have to put it back to Members of the Oireachtas.  The more effective the rural transport system is, the easier it is for older people or anyone else to get to post offices.  It could be argued that fewer post offices would be needed if people could get to them.</p></speech>

Not only does the post office play a huge social role, but economically it plays a huge role in local communities because the money handed out locally in cash is spent locally.  That sustains and creates jobs.  Unfortunately, the Department has been directing, encouraging and coercing many of its customers to go online and into commercial banks.  If it continues to do that, irrespective of the services into which we expand, the network will collapse.</p> <p>  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is hugely critical to the post office network.  No one is trying to stop the tide that is online business.  However, at times we need to take a step back and we need to understand what type of society we want.  The society we want is a society where we have face-to-face contact and local services in local communities.  If welfare is taken from the post office network, we will collapse that local community and service.  It appears to me that this is a programme or campaign on the part of Government to phase out the elderly.  This is wrong and it will have huge implications for society.  I note that the biggest economy in Europe is Germany's where 80% of transactions are in cash.  Why?  It is because the Germans know and understand the value of cash.</p><p>We need to take a step back and understand there is value in delivering cash to communities.</p></speech>

That might help.  Our recommendation is that Revenue collect the fee, but there is still a role for post offices to play and it is up to the Minister and the Government to explore it.</p></speech>

They may be housebound or semi-housebound and unable to get to a post office ten or 15 miles up the road.  I concur with Mr. Martin when he says the older person is pushed aside.  There is a huge cohort of older people.  I know what Mr. Moran said about the rural transport service which needs to be put in place.  I am on the front line with three colleagues who receive calls once something about a post office comes up and they are very upsetting to listen to.  We know that getting people to participate in a campaign does not always work out.  People power might work in some areas and people might be listened to.</p></speech>

An Post is getting a loan of &euro;30 million.  Its income is approximately &euro;78 million.  The figure in respect of social welfare payments is approximately &euro;50 million.  There seems to be a hole every year.  I am almost sure the figure in respect of social welfare payments was &euro;60 million, but it is now down to &euro;50 million.  It seems that a patch is being put on the tube, but more work needs to be done.</p> <p>  Many postmasters are afraid to retire.  I know people running post offices who are well past pension age but who say they are running them because the minute they close the door no one local will get the job.  Why do we not shop in a small rural area?  Mr. McRedmond might consider the economics and the figures, but I am talking about socially and economically deprived areas in rural Ireland.  In looking at new ideas to revitalise the business why did An Post not tender for the contract to collect the licence fee? </p></speech>

Why is there no tie-up with courier companies?  Postmasters cannot take in parcels because they have signed a contract with An Post.  Why is An Post not actively searching for businesses that will bring in &euro;1 or &euro;2 on every transaction that will a service something viable?  What is the position on a bank that actively wants to locate in Ireland?  Has An Post had talks with it?  If it links with a bank that can offer loans or mortgages at massively reduced interest rates, it will get people in.  It has the buildings to provide such a service throughout the country.  In a town where someone gives up the contract for the post office does An Post consider any tie-up with the local credit union that is open six days a week?  </p> <p>  I want to hear how An Post will pay back the sum of &euro;30 million.  Is its idea that it can pay off Joe and Mary and whoever else in every post office and and get the money back that way?  Are we going to build a sustainable future for post offices?  Two years ago when we agreed to the programme for Government, there were many ideas.  I commend Mr. Bobby Kerr and much of the work he has done, but we seem to be sitting and waiting for this bomb to go off.  A loan will never make An Post sustainable.  It might close the gap, but it will not solve the problem unless there is a proper business plan.  My fear is that, socially and economically, Mr. McRedmond may not understand parts of rural Ireland.  The only time some elderly people might see others during the week - there may be no transport available - is when they go to the post office and have a chat.  Is there any link between postmasters and the Health Service Executive to tell it that they saw Johnny or Mary on Friday and that they are still alive, as that might be important?  Unfortunately, only economics are being considered.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is telling farmers that applications for the single farm payment will not be accepted unless they are made online.  People aged 60, 70 or 80 years who fill in the form do not have a bull's clue about how to get online.  They do not have broadband.  The Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is actively telling people that if they do not sign up online, they will not be able to withdraw their money.  Are we trying to go after all of the kids in rural parts, as the credit unions were cute about doing, with their Sammy stamps and other ideas?  Their representatives went to schools to look for business.  An Post needs a business plan.  It is a question of fighting for business, dreaming up new ideas and going for every contract.  We can blame every Department, but if Mr. McRedmond does not tender, he will not get the job.</p></speech>

In the early 2000s there was a lot of talk about trying to reform the post office network.  Time has been lost and we are trying to play catch-up.  Since the formation of this D&aacute;il a year and a half ago we have discussed this issue at the committee many times.  We have met several lobbyists outside and the delegates formally inside this room.  I am concerned about the lack of a combined drive to put in place a sustainable post office network.  I heard what was said here today and have read the presentations.  I welcome much of what is contained in them, but I do not get a sense that we are all driving forward together.  When things got going in difficult times it was because somebody had taken them by the scruff of the neck.  I do not want to speak for Mr. Bobby Kerr, but I listen to him very carefully when he speaks about this issue.  I sense his frustration at the delay and inaction.  We have met him. </p> <p>  My concern is that, while we took some convincing, the cost of the national postage stamp has increased to &euro;1.  I would not have gone that far, but we were convinced reluctantly to go that far.  I have spoken to Mr. McRedmond about this a couple of times.  He worked in Tesco and knows that something on the shelf is not priced at &euro;1 but at 99 cent.  Once the price moves into three figures, it is in a different domain.  There is a psychological effect.  To what extent is this responsible for the 7.5% reduction in mail volumes this year?</p><p>I expressed concern at the time that the price increase would accelerate the reduction in mail volumes, which is what seems to be happening.  Do the price increase and the &euro;30 million loan amount to a band aid solution which seeks to address the problem from the wrong end?</p><p> I accept that it will take time to put the new services in place.  Sinn F&eacute;in has argued strongly for several years that expanding the range of services is key to securing the future of the post office network.  If we do not do so, things simply will not stack up.  We have heard from Age Action Ireland and other representatives about the importance of the social aspect of the service provided by post offices.  The range of services must be extended in order to secure a volume of business that will ensure a dynamic service into the future.  We do not want to see it on its last legs again in ten years' time.  I agree with Mr. McRedmond's observation that the post office should the State's office in every town and village.  In my county of Laois I said at the time that the closure of the post office in Ballacolla meant we had lost three legs of the stool, the others being the local Garda station and the local shops.  The social benefit in having people go into the village one day a week is taken away if they have to go to Durrow or Abbeyleix.</p><p> Additional moneys have been allocated to An Post, but a question mark remains over their purpose.  The delegates from the Irish Postmasters Union have asked legitimate questions about the &euro;30 million loan and what new services are planned.  If we do not take the matter by the scruff of the neck now, we will be in trouble.  We must drive on in expanding the services offered and avail of the opportunities to provide banking services, the German Sparkasse model and so on.  A pilot project in conjunction with the credit unions is in place and should be expanded.  The possibilities in regard to the administration of car tax payments were first debated in the D&aacute;il in 1987.  Thirty years later our hair is much greyer.  Time has passed, but we have not caught up with it.  None of us wants to see a post office service that is limping along on a crutch and will be decrepit in ten years' time.  We need a dynamic network that will function as the State office in every town, offering customers a range of services.  Change is difficult and not everybody will be happy about it.  However, if people see positive outcomes and that a dynamic structure is in place, they will get on board.</p></speech>

There are four mail centres in the State, at Portlaoise, Athlone, Dublin and Cork, which are important pillars of the post office network.  In Portlaoise there is a new parcel centre beside the mail centre which provides a very good service.  It looks like funding will come on stream next year for the installation of 450 m of roadway as part of the Portlaoise N80 orbital route which will see the road run right past the front door of the centre.  It is within 1 km of the N7-N8 motorway junction and the rail station is around the corner, making Portlaoise a key transport hub.  The centre has created 200 jobs in the town and an additional 180 in the lead-up to Christmas.  In addition, customs processing of inward mail parcels for delivery throughout the entire State is completed there.  It is a very important facility.</p></speech>

We have all encountered these issues in our constituencies and there is a good deal of frustration that despite the various assessments made and reports, very little action is evident in towns and villages throughout the State.  Under European competition rules, the &euro;30 million in new funding must be given as a loan which will be subject to oversight.  Will Mr. McRedmond explain how the money will be spent and its proposed effect in practice?  Several postmasters have told me that, as far as they can see, its function will be to offer them an incentive to close their post office and get out of the system.  Will the CEO outline the purposes to which the funding will be put?</p> <p>  The last time we discussed these issues with Mr. McRedmond, we agreed to support the removal of the price cap on stamps.  Since that was done, the volume of transactions has reduced.  Like Deputy Brian Stanley, I wonder whether the measure has proved to be counterproductive.</p> <p>  I am concerned about the reduction in the number of postal delivery staff.  In County Tipperary, for example, we are set to lose 15 permanent staff and another 15 or so contract workers.  What is puzzling is that these staff reductions were to be implemented on 1 December.  Why would any organisation choose to implement a reduction in the number of front-line staff at the busiest time of the year for its business?  An Post has put the move on hold until early January, but the original decision made no sense and leads one to question management's judgment.</p> <p>  In his submission Mr. McRedmond states management is in advanced negotiations with the Irish Postmasters Union on the future of the service.  How many times have we heard the same?  What is the status of the negotiations?  What is the cut-off date for their completion and the expected outcome of the process?  There is a great deal of concern, anxiety and uncertainty.  Whatever the overall plan which, in any case, seems to be changing all the time, it is certainly not being communicated to postmasters and not coming through to the customer base.  As a public representative, I am still wondering, even after all of the discussions, evaluations and reports, what the outcome will be.</p></speech>

The scale of the transformation in An Post will require a lot more than &euro;30 million, but it is a very substantial contribution.  It is our job to operate within our means and make the funding work for us.  It is easy to accuse me of taking the economic view, but I do not have much choice.  I have an obligation to ensure the service is sustainable for everybody, not least the State.  The &euro;30 million will be split on a 50:50 basis, with &euro;15 million being used to implement our universal service obligation to deliver mail to every house in the State on every working of the week and the other &euro;15 million being invested in the post office network.</p><p>It will take a lot more than &euro;15 million to modernise the network but we have to find ways of doing that.  We have some of our own assets that we have to take a look at.  It is my job and that of the management team to make sure we find the funds to invest in the network.  The investment is for a whole range of different things, from capital expenditure to paying to relocate post offices.  I was asked if we would be more inventive and look at local shops that could take it on.  That is at the core of what we are doing.  Mr. Bobby Kerr mentioned co-location.  There is a good reason for it because it is convenient for people.  Where it is convenient for people, it is convenient for people.  There is money for co-location.  </p><p> There is the issue of the contract negotiations with the postmasters.  It will require some investment in terms of what the postmasters make.  There will need to be some funds if some postmasters leave the post office network as a result of these changes.  It is not money for that; it is money for a range of things to modernise the network.  It is only part of it.  We have to fund a lot of this ourselves.  </p><p> I was asked why we are not talking to a bank coming into Ireland.  Before I joined An Post, it had a relationship with Fortis and it was unfortunate that Fortis closed.  I have read about Sparkassen and what it wants to do.  We have had some conversations with it but not at length.  We need to do much more fundamental work on it, which we are doing.  We are launching new services such as the smart account, which is about getting into a banking licence.  We have to work out what that arrangement will be.  I hope to come back here at some stage to tell the committee what those services are.  </p><p> We have set ourselves up now in terms of how we are managing ourselves.  Financial services are at the core of what we are doing.  We will certainly be doing that and looking at potential partners including credit unions.  There can be issues with credit unions, for example, they are local.  They are not a group although there are some associations of credit unions.  It might be difficult and there might be a different solution.  If it was the only solution in a place then we would look at it but our energy will be spent on trying to find a solution across all post offices.  In terms of building the sustainable future of the post office and whether we have a proper business plan, that is what we have been doing.  I have spent a year trying to get the plan into place.  We have the plan in place and we are making all the changes at the centre to be able to deliver the range of products I have been describing.  </p><p> We have not made sufficient progress on the discussions with the IPU, which Deputy Lowry and other members raised.  Those discussions reached a certain point and unfortunately in the middle of the summer they stopped.  We wanted to start them again but for various reasons, they are only now just getting back on the table.  I hope Mr. Ned O'Hara will agree those discussions are imminent.  We are ready to have them.  We have made considerable progress and have considerable agreement on a number of issues.  I could not agree more with the members, in particular Deputy Lowry, on the need to get this to happen and to mobilise work.  We have done it on our mails and parcels business and have made changes there in terms of mails and parcels.</p><p> Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about the issue of working with the HSE.  It is one of the issues we are looking at on the mails and parcels side in terms of postmen and postwomen who pass by every house every day.  It is something we are very conscious of.  The committee should not misunderstand me - when I talk about the economics or good management of An Post I am not ignoring the social need.  The only purpose of An Post is to deliver social need and we are all acutely conscious of that.  The only reason we talk about these other elements is to make sure the social need can be delivered.  </p><p> I was asked why we did not tender for driving licences and I do not know for sure.  I understand the tender for driver licences specified there should only be one location in each county for driving licences.  I may have that incorrect because it was a number of years ago but it made it difficult for An Post to tender.  We can deliver it everywhere.  If we do not tender we will not get it and my colleagues and I want us tendering for everything.  We need to all be on the same page.</p><p> Deputy Stanley talked about the discussions with the IPU and I quite agree with him.  We tested the difference between pricing a stamp at &euro;1 and pricing it at 99 cent and there was not really that much of a difference.  Has the &euro;1 driven the 7.5% reduction?  It is far less of a reduction than we had expected in mail volumes.  It only has us pretty much in line with other countries.  It is a bit faster than it was so it has probably accelerated it slightly.  I am sure it has had some impact.  Has it had the desired impact for An Post?  Yes, because we would have lost &euro;61 million.  If we lose &euro;61 million we are insolvent.  We have debts and creditors and if we lose &euro;61 million we cannot pay our bills.  We cannot pay our weekly pay bill.  The price increase in the stamps brought us back into a strongly solvent position whereby we will break even this year.  I quite accept it will have a market impact and we have to watch that carefully as we go forward.  We must expand the range of services, get the vision and take it by the scruff of the neck.</p><p> I have tried to share the vision for the post office network particularly with regard to banking, Government services and as the backbone of e-commerce.  The Deputy said the parcel service is welcome and asked about the four mail centres and Portlaoise.  I cannot say what exactly will happen with the mail centres.  There is an agreement with the Labour Court and it is envisioned that one mail centre will close.  I would much prefer that a mail centre did not close and that we develop other services.  One of the things we are doing separately to what we are talking about today is looking at the strategy for adjacent industries.  With the post office network, that is banking.  With regard to mails and parcels, it is fulfilment.  Major fulfilment centres could open up.  We have considered whether we could do something like a pick-and-pack warehouse and how we could deliver Amazon or Alibaba products in Ireland.  They are discussions we want to have.  We would love to see that.  I would much prefer a mail centre became that but we have four mail centres.  The Deputy is absolutely right; Portlaoise is a great facility.  They are all great facilities and they were all improved dramatically before I went to An Post.  We have a very high next day delivery service and it is something we are proud of.  Getting the configuration right is something we need to manage. </p><p> Deputy Lowry said he is frustrated by the reports and research.  I am frustrated as hell.  I really want to get on with this and we have to get on and complete these talks with the IPU, make sure we get the shape of the network right and make sure we move forward.  I want to do that very fast.  We have sorted out the centre of the company.  We now need to work with postmasters so I can share their frustration and we can deliver.  </p><p> I have talked about the &euro;30 million.  It will be spent.  Has the price increase been counterproductive?  I am saying "No", but inevitably there is an impact.  The Deputy is quite correct.  </p><p> The Deputy asked why the policy was for staff to leave on 1 December.  We have no choice but to reduce our head count to maintain viability.  All the partners recognise that whether it is the unions, An Post or the Government.  It was due to be earlier but these things take time.  The date of 1 December is not ideal but we can cope with the volumes of mail.  I am delighted they are staying until 31 December.  It is important for those who will be leaving the organisation.  They will be working through the Christmas period. </p><p> I have answered the question on where we are with regard to the IPU negotiations.  The plan not being communicated is a very fair criticism.  We are just at the point now where we have completed it and we know what it is we want to do.  Only last week, the top 40 managers in An Post came together to say we should make sure we get that communication right.  It is a very reasonable criticism and we need to get it out there.   </p></speech>

A number of questions came up at the beginning of the session that Ms Cronin might want to deal with.  If anyone wishes to contribute, they should indicate that.</p></speech>

The &euro;30 million loan from Government will be paid this year.  It is a loan from Government so there will be some level of conditionality on it which will be set out in a term sheet.</p><p>The conditionality is around maintaining the five-day-week delivery service for mail.  Clearly the Government is keen that there would be progress on the sorts of initiatives that have been outlined by Mr. McRedmond.  That is what the money will be spent on at a very high level.  I should mention that we are working on the detail of that.</p><p> The money comes from the Department of Finance rather than the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, because that is how the An Post legislation was written.  As such, there are quite a number of players involved in managing the process, but we are committing to get &euro;30 million to An Post this year.  As I have said, the conditionality is around the sort of initiatives Mr. McRedmond has mentioned and the statutory obligations of An Post.</p><p> In response to other points raised by members, the Minister is obviously extremely committed to the post office network, and he recognises the value of it.  Another issue around allocating the sum of &euro;30 million is that the Minister has also asked for a protocol to be put in place between An Post and the postmasters.  This protocol will be facilitated by an external facilitator.  It will deal with the opening of new post offices, extra business and opening hours.  As the Irish Postmasters' Union, IPU, has indicated, when a postmaster leaves, it is important that that business transfers to another postmaster.  There are a whole range of issues that it is important would be finalised, both for the IPU and An Post, before the next phase of the reform can start in the post office network.</p></speech>

We are available and we want to negotiate.  I just want to make one point about the reality.  I deal with a lot of people on the front line every day.  Consider postmasters' incomes in 2017.  Some 290 people or 72% of the people who had a salary review this year got a reduction in pay, with the maximum reduction at &euro;27,000.  I got a phone call this morning from a postmistress in Limerick whose salary revision came through this month.  She is due to be paid this month, and she got &euro;600 less this month than last month.  She said to me that she had plans for that &euro;600 for Christmas.  We need to translate what we are talking about in the abstract into the real lives of people.  That lady is down &euro;600 this week, next month, and for every month from here on.  We want this solved quickly.  We could have solved it a year ago if there had been a will to do it, either a political will or whatever will is required.  We are available and we want to negotiate.  Regarding the protocol that Ms Cronin referred to, we met the facilitator last Friday.  We want to be in that room this week.  Are other parties not available this week?  We need to get in and get this done.  People are hurting.</p></speech>

There was not particularly good news for An Post in so far as the collection service is concerned.  As a former Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I have always fought very strongly for An Post to get the contract for collection.  Unfortunately, however, the collection misses a lot of people.  About 15% of households are not paying.  That is not very satisfactory.  Those responsible are doing their best.  It is not easy to collect licences, particularly in urban areas.  There is a change coming, but it is one area of income which has been very useful.  I renew it in my local post office.</p> <p>  I have a great faith in the post office system.  I was there for a number of years, and I know the service that is provided the community.  We must do our utmost to maintain post offices in rural areas.  We are finished without them.  Rural Ireland would be wiped out.  Whatever moves the Minister makes to enhance the postal service, particularly post offices, are for the better as far as I am concerned.  It will take a lot of work, and the service have great support from this committee.  Every member of this committee would back the service in any way on any initiative that could build up local post offices.</p></speech>

Reference to this arrangement is also made in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform guidelines on appointments to State boards of November 2014.  The 2016 Programme for a Partnership Government suggests that nominees for chairs of State boards will be required to engage with the relevant Oireachtas committee prior to their appointment.

I am honoured to accept the role of director and chairperson designate of Bord na M&oacute;na.  It is an iconic Irish company with a proud tradition and a trusted brand name.  I want to talk briefly about Bord na M&oacute;na.  From a historical perspective Bord na M&oacute;na is a company that has derived great value and benefit from one natural resource, namely peat.  It is now in the process of transformation going on to find further value from other resources.  The company now has six divisions - peat, powergen, fuels, horticulture, resource recovery and the recently formed bio-energy business.  I will speak about each of those briefly.</p> <p>  Peat, with more than 1,100 employees and a turnover of nearly &euro;80 million, is the oldest business in the company and is primarily focused on the harvesting of peat, management of bogs and supply of peat to our major customers, including the ESB.  It is facing the challenge of transitioning the business into a new regulatory environment for electricity generation post-2019 and ultimately the end of energy peat harvesting by 2030.</p> <p>  Powergen, with approximately 100 employees and a turnover of &euro;82 million, is involved in electricity generation including at the power station in Edenderry and the development of renewable energy assets which currently involves wind farms.  </p> <p>  Fuels, with 250 employees and a turnover of &euro;74 million, is involved in the manufacture, development and sale of domestic heating products, including of course the iconic peat briquette.  Due to changing consumer needs this business remains challenged.</p> <p>  Horticulture, with 250 employees and a turnover of &euro;54 million, is concerned with the sale of horticultural products to the retail and professional markets in Ireland and overseas.  </p> <p>  Resource recovery, with 400 employees and a turnover of &euro;97 million, is a key enabler of national policy in terms of recycling, waste recovery and waste management.  </p> <p>  Bio-energy has recently been set up to source and sell biomass for the Irish market.  The business is developing a supply chain with a mix of imports and indigenous biomass.  </p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na has a great history and a great association with communities, especially across the midlands of Ireland.  These are communities of neighbours, suppliers, and employees.  Indeed for many places in the midlands this company is the reason many communities were created and have been sustained.  The mandate Bord na M&oacute;na has received from Government is clear.  The company must support regional development in the midlands and sustainable employment in the region.  This is a significant challenge, especially as the company exits peat production as nearly half of all Bord na M&oacute;na employees work in this area.  As non-executive chairman, my role will be to remind management frequently that meeting this objective around jobs and employment is the number one priority for the company at this time.  The second part of our mandate is ensuring that the company remains profitable and returns a dividend to the taxpayer, therefore making the right commercial decisions.  The third and final part involves supporting the delivery of key strategic national policies, particularly in the areas of energy, carbon emissions, bog rehabilitation, biomass development and resource recovery.  It is my intention that the board would help the company maintain its focus on this mandate into the future.  </p> <p>  One of my other intentions as chairperson is to ensure that as the company changes the association between Bord na M&oacute;na, the bogs and the surrounding communities will remain important.  Bord na M&oacute;na has always been about community and this will not change.  The company provides many benefits to communities and the region.  Amenity land, cycle and walkways, and the cultivation of biodiversity provide other tangible advantages to local communities.  The economic value of these and other ecosystems services is increasingly being understood and accepted.  Tourism also confers an economic benefit both in terms of employment and regional income generation.</p><p> In truth, however, it is difficult to place a euro value on these amenities that fully captures their real worth to the people who live near them and use them.  As a company, we provide these because we recognise the need to give value beyond what we relate in our financial reports.  Bord na M&oacute;na has a history of supporting community activities, whether that is through sponsorships of sporting, voluntary or cultural groups.  Sustainability in this sense recognises that people have a range of needs, not just the economic, that enhance lives.  For a company like Bord na M&oacute;na, we cannot be "of the community" unless we engage at this other level as well.  It also makes sense from a business perspective.  It is likely the reason Bord na Mona has a 100% record in progressing major planning applications to successful conclusions.  If we are to maintain the support of communities, we must continue to engage with them in a meaningful way.</p><p> As we change, we will of course look to the 2,100 employees to continue being our most effective ambassadors.  I have begun touring the company in recent weeks and have been impressed by the level of dedication and commitment to Bord na M&oacute;na exhibited by employees at all levels.  The professionalism and expertise I have encountered so far are causes of optimism in the ability of the company to transition to a post-energy peat future.</p><p> I remind the committee that my appointment is effective from 22 October.  Therefore, my knowledge of the company at this point is just five weeks.  In that time, my key priorities have been: to commence the interview process for a replacement CEO; commence visits to key sites to understand the businesses and meet the people; meet representatives of the Government on stakeholder expectations; understand the various business segments and performance; and get to know board colleagues and key management.</p><p> I will speak a little about my background.  I am from a farming background and a native of south Kilkenny.  I trained as an accountant with PricewaterhouseCoopers in Kilkenny, spent two years with a private engineering company and, in 1975, joined Avonmore.  My career from there to retirement, on reaching the company retirement age in 2009, was basically with the same company but with many changes along the way, some of the key milestones being: significant growth in Irish milk output up to the introduction of EU milk quotas in 1984; the decision to set up a plc in 1988 to access capital and expand overseas; the completion of 35 acquisitions and joint ventures over the following ten years; the merger of Avonmore and Waterford Foods in 1998 to form Avonmore Waterford Group and, subsequently, Glanbia; and the uniting of a co-op culture with that of a plc.</p><p> Today, Glanbia is a successful company with operations in many parts of the world.  However, that was not achieved without a great deal of hard work, difficult decisions being made, difficulties with business sectors and the need to change and innovate continually.  I operated in various roles within Glanbia over the years, including more than 20 years as group finance director and the last four years also as deputy group managing director.</p><p> I see many similarities between Glanbia and Bord na M&oacute;na.  The heritage of both is rooted in rural Ireland.  Despite international expansion, the Irish operations of Glanbia in the east of Ireland provide significant employment and support a vibrant dairy and farming community.</p><p> Since retiring from Glanbia, I have run my own consultancy business.  My other activities are: board member and chair of the audit committee of Enterprise Ireland; board member and chair of the audit committee of One51 plc; board member and chair of the finance committee of the Bon Secours Health System; chairman of the finance and development committee of the Kilkenny co-op mart; and chairman of SME Finance and Leasing Solutions, a startup leasing company serving the SME sector.  I am involved in the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, having served as national treasurer for a five-year period up to 2012.  I went on to serve as national president, also for a five-year period, which ended in May of this year.</p><p> I am honoured to be in attendance as chairman designate of Bord na M&oacute;na.  I am aware that I follow in a long line of people who have given service to the company and the State in this role.  It is a company with a proud history stretching back to the early days of the State when the country developed agencies and bodies necessary to sustain an independent Ireland.  By 2030, we will be approaching the 100th anniversary of our establishment as a company by the State.  We will be looking back on a first century marked in its early years by its development of energy peat and its recent ones by new sustainable businesses.  I would like the common theme of our first century to be of a company that is rooted in the Irish bogs, delivering in a multitude of different ways for the State and the Irish people.</p><p> I look forward to answering whatever questions members might have.</p></speech>

I have a couple of specific questions on particular ventures.  My understanding is that Bord na M&oacute;na is considering the purchase of a company in Georgia in the US with a view to buying virgin forest there for importation to Ireland for burning in biomass power generation, co-firing with peat.  Where does that project stand, what is the timeline, what is the requirement for ministerial approval and so on?</p> <p>  I understand that there was an announcement in April of a joint venture between the ESB and Bord na M&oacute;na regarding the introduction of four large solar farms.  Where does that venture stand?</p> <p>  Mr. Meagher referred to divisions.  In terms of the production and export of peat moss for horticultural purposes, how many tonnes are we collecting and exporting?</p> <p>  As a former finance director of a large multinational, has Mr. Meagher a view on what the price of carbon should be in terms of board assessments of investment decisions, including long-term capital investments?  Would he advise a shadow price on carbon that would apply to Bord na M&oacute;na's investment decisions or planning?  As chairman designate of a company that is "naturally driven", what is the price on carbon in Mr. Meagher's opinion?</p></speech>

His CV is impressive.  He has a varied and extensive range of experience, and I am satisfied that he has the ability and commitment to give leadership and guidance to Bord na M&oacute;na at a time of great change and challenge for the company.</p> <p>  Mr. Meagher is aware that we in Tipperary are conscious of the fact that we have lost our briquette factory at Littleton.  It is a significant blow to the workforce, their dependants, the local community and the local economy.  In recent months, efforts have been made to resolve the issue of redundancies and the terms and conditions of disemployment.  The workforce has been patient and engaged with Bord na M&oacute;na.</p> <p>  Next Wednesday is an important date in the negotiations.  After a long engagement, there is little left dividing the company and the workforce from reaching an agreement.  I ask that the chairman designate convey to his team representing the company in those negotiations the urgency of finalising the redundancy package.  The company must understand that there is a need to be more generous in its approach.  I have an indication of the figures that are preventing the negotiations from reaching a conclusion.  The company owes it to the workforce to put an increased offer on the table for the final set of negotiations next Wednesday.</p> <p>  The workforce at Littleton has been committed and dedicated.  It has given years of loyal service to the company.  The least that workers should expect in return is for a generous package that reflects their commitment to be finalised in the coming weeks, if not week.</p><p>I ask Mr. Meagher to take back to his company the message that this is a matter of urgency and that there needs to be a conclusion at the earliest possible time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.161" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1232" speakername="Brian Stanley" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017112800002#P00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Meagher and Ms Curry.  I congratulate Mr. Meagher on his appointment as chairman designate of the board.</p> <p>  As a former employee of Bord na M&oacute;na, as someone whose family lived in a Bord na M&oacute;na house in Edenderry and as a midlands Deputy, I have a considerable interest in this.  I want to try to address a number of specific issues.  On the issue of biomass, all we have are media leaks or stories in the media about the purchase of a plant in Georgia, USA.  Various figures are mentioned, one being &euro;60 million.  I want Mr. Meagher to address this directly.</p> <p>  The next issue is of significant concern.  In 2030, peat extraction will be finished if we are still in the European Union.  What is the position on replacing peat?  When I first walked through the doors of this House seven years ago, Bord na M&oacute;na representatives were raising with us the need for a proper scheme to be put in place for the growing of willow for biomass in the midlands.  What is happening in this regard if we are to reduce or put an end to peat extraction?  There is a lot of marginal land across Laois, Offaly and west Kildare, which looks very like north Offaly.  There is also marginal land in other areas, such as Roscommon and other parts of the midlands, that may be suitable for biomass.  It is estimated that Ireland would have a very favourable climate in this regard.  Why are we not developing that industry?  I have raised this with the Minister before.</p> <p>  Some 150,000 tonnes of palm oil husks were brought to Edenderry from Indonesia.  They came from virgin forests.  What is the cost in terms of carbon miles?  The product looks very clean but it is a bit like the case of the renewable heat incentive in the North in that the product going in looks lovely but diesel guzzlers have to haul it here by road and sea, clocking up considerable carbon miles.  We are not generating the industry in the midlands.  This needs to be dealt with.  There is a considerable need in this regard.</p> <p>  I read the delegates' presentation twice before attending this meeting.  I welcome the statement that Bord na M&oacute;na's first commitment is creating jobs, particularly in the midlands, and working with communities.  This is all 100%.  Obviously, the company's activities have to be commercially viable given that it is a commercial semi-State company.  I understand that.  Believe me, when I was involved, we worked hard to make sure that happened.  The employees of Bord na M&oacute;na are hard workers.  Biomass is one of the issues we need to address.</p> <p>  Another issue I wish to raise concerns biogas.  Bord na M&oacute;na is involved in the waste management industry.  I am a customer of AES, one of the company's subsidiaries.  Has Bord na M&oacute;na considered biogas?  We have a fairly large agriculture sector.  There is a debate over what to do with agricultural waste.  Agricultural waste mixed with other waste can be used to generate energy and make fertiliser, as Mr. Meagher knows having come from Glanbia, another very successful company.</p> <p>  The other issue concerning renewables is that of wind.  I note revenue from the sale of wind energy from Mount Lucas in north Offaly has declined.  I actually drew peat from the briquette factory there in a truck to Coolnamona many moons ago.  Revenue from the sale of electricity generated by the plant fell by &euro;5.2 million last year.  It is said the company struggled with its second lowest yield in ten years.  That is not an argument against wind energy but an argument for proportionality.  We have large tracts of cutaway bog.  There are major debates over where solar plants should be located.  There is a large amount of bog where they could be located.</p> <p>  The last point I want to address with Mr. Meagher is the horticulture section of the company.  I met the company's previous director and management a few times.  I met Mr. Mike Quinn, Mr. Gabriel D'Arcy, Mr. Gerry Ryan, Colm &Oacute; G&oacute;g&aacute;in and others at various times in respect of projects they were trying to develop.  Regarding the horticulture sector, which was the sector in which I worked, Bord na M&oacute;na purchased a plant, White Moss Horticulture near Liverpool and Manchester, for &euro;12.1 million.  It has taken a &euro;14 million hit on it.  There was an inventory write-off in respect of the purchase.  It did not turn out to be exactly what it was supposed to be.  Issues also arose over compliance.  The logic for buying White Moss Horticulture was that it would provide a bridge into Britain after Brexit.  There could have been other methods used.  I argued very strongly at the time in question that the plants in Coolnamona, Laois, and Kilberry, south Kildare, should be considered in order to up the game.  That has not happened.  The jackdaws are flying in and out of the plant at Coolnamona.</p></speech>

I will deal with some of them as I go along.</p> <p>  Deputy Eamon Ryan asked a question about biomass in the United States.  A number of people asked the same question in different ways.  My understanding is that biomass represents an alternative form of energy production that makes considerable sense.  Bord na M&oacute;na's intention is to get as much raw material as possible from Ireland.  Currently, however, not enough raw material is becoming available here.  That is the reason there are imports.</p> <p>  With regard to the plant in the United States, this is a matter that Bord na M&oacute;na has examined.  No decision has been made on it.  Nothing has been done in regard to it and no proposition has been made to the board.</p> <p>  As I mentioned earlier, our wish is to obtain an increasing amount of material from Irish sources.  If this is achieved by using some of our own lands for growing willow or for other forms of production, I will be all in favour of it.  As I understand it, various trials are taking place in this regard.  Therefore, I have no issue whatsoever about producing a home-grown product wherever we can and minimising imports.</p> <p>  On Deputy Eamon Ryan's point, there is no decision on a biomass plant in the United States.  It is certainly a matter that was examined but there is no decision.  Nothing has come back to the board.  Obviously, if something is to be done, it will have to come back to the board in due course.  That is the current position.</p> <p>  A question was asked about the exportation of moss peat.  This relates to the horticulture business.  As Deputy Brian Stanley knows better than I do, there are two sides to that business, namely, retail and supplying products to professional gardeners.</p><p>On the retail side, about 80% of our product goes to the UK market and the balance is used in the home market.  At the time, the proposition for White Moss Horticulture was recognition of the challenges associated with Brexit and sterling.  The concept was that if we could export a certain amount of product to the UK, have further processing there and then sell on to our customers in the UK, effectively we would have a natural hedge in terms of currency and sales.  It made sense in theory.  As Deputy Stanley pointed out, this business in the UK ran into difficulties, however.  The &euro;14 million referred to by the Deputy was a write-down of the value of the purchase in light of the performance of the business.  I have visited the White Moss business in the UK and it is making progress in sorting out the regulatory issues associated with it.  There is no doubt the horticultural business will be challenged.  It needs to address innovation and market diversification.  Depending on the UK market, as well as where sterling is at the moment, these will be a severe challenge for the business.  The Deputy referred to effectiveness and efficiencies which could be pursued.  That is a valid comment.  We need to address effectiveness and efficiency in order that we can compete.  Unless we are commercial and efficient, we will be struggling with the business.  There is a fair challenge to get that right.  The team are on it and, hopefully, that will continue.</p><p> I have visited the Kilberry plant and it is a fine plant.  On the price of carbon, I must plead the fifth amendment to some degree on it.  In terms of investment, for anything one has to pay, one has to include that as part of the cost of the investment.  It does not matter what it is.  If one is paying cash for something, one must recognise that as part of the cost of the investment.  Other than that, that is as far as I can go to clarify this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.169" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1294" speakername="Eamon Ryan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017112800002#Q00200"><p>I asked that question because I believe the fundamental nature of the business is not sustainable on a carbon basis.  We are a country which is shamed internationally in carbon leagues and so on.  We cannot continue burning peat in power stations, importing palm oil kernels or acquiring forests in Georgia.  The environmental community will soon start targeting companies which do that, arguing it is not naturally driven.</p> <p>  I asked the question on the price of carbon and moss peat products because we will soon count that as a store for carbon.  The value of stored peat is a multiple of what it may be for commercial purposes.  There is a fundamental need for the company to genuinely live up to what it is saying in its advertising.  With the company's current trajectory and the ignoring of the carbon issue, I do not believe it will last another year or two.  The publicity this will attract to the company and the country will be damaging.  I am as interested in those jobs in the midlands as anyone else.  However, hand on heart, we will not do it if we keep burning peat.</p></speech>

We have a duty of care to our 2,100 employees, 1,100 of whom are in the peat business.  The company is progressing towards renewables and will continue that.  We obviously have contracts with the ESB and others which we need to honour and we cannot walk away from them.  The progression to renewables might not be at the speed Deputy Eamon Ryan would like.  However, it is doing it in a way that is fair to all parties involved of which there are many.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.172" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Geoffrey Meagher" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017112800002#Q00500"><p>On Deputy Lowry's question on the closure of the Littleton peat briquette plant, the company did not want to do it.  However, with the decline in briquette sales, having two briquette plants did not make economic sense.  While it was a decision we regretted, it had to be done for the future of the company.  As I mentioned earlier, we are required to return a dividend to the State and, therefore, we have got to be commercial.</p> <p>  I will take back Deputy Lowry's comments on the current negotiations on the closure of the Littleton factory.  As non-executive chairman, it is not my role to be involved in those discussions.  As I understand it, the discussions are going well and progress has been made.  It is obviously a sensitive issue for all of the parties involved.  Apart from noting back to my colleagues on the management side that we would like to see it completed fairly, it would be our intention to ensure that is done.</p> <p>  I cannot comment on the economics of biogas as I am not familiar with the full details of it.  It is an issue which could be examined as a possibility, however.  We have several wind farm developments under way.  We have been in wind energy since 1992.  There are developments in the pipeline to produce 600 MW of electricity from wind over the next several years.  If it was taken further with a larger landmass, there is the possibility of another 1,000 MW that could be developed.  However, no work has been done on the siting of those wind farms.  There are many opportunities for Bord na M&oacute;na in wind energy development.  The company will be pursuing that over the coming years.</p></speech>

I know he is five weeks into the job and has probably had a baptism of fire.  Tonight, the committee might help him with that because he is already taking questions thick and fast and is learning on the job.</p> <p>  I represent north Kildare.  With the Bog of Allen, we are never too far from the bog, particularly in north-west Kildare.  It is very close to the hearts of the people in the county in every sense, as a resource, an amenity and our heritage.  I often think of James Joyce's short story, "The Dead", with its closing lines with the snow "falling softly upon the Bog of Allen".  It is close to the heart of the Irish nation as much as it is to those in my county.</p> <p>  Mr. Meagher said he will undertake some site visits.  I am sure he is familiar with the Drehid landfill in north-west Kildare which is due for expansion.</p><p>It has had an uneasy peace with its nearest neighbours but that has been jeopardised in recent times.  It is one of the largest landfills in the country at this stage.  It has been discussed in the D&aacute;il with the Minister and with various other interested parties.  With the intensity of landfills and the shortage of such capacity around the country, more and more municipal waste from the Dublin region is heading towards the Drehid site in Kildare.  Last year it exceeded its capacity before the end of year and operations had to ground to a halt.  There is an issue currently in that an application for a hazardous waste licence is being made.  It is bypassing Kildare County Council and going through An Bord Plean&aacute;la directly in terms of the strategic infrastructure.  I have seen that happen previously with other applications.  I was a member of that council at one stage and I have seen how that can often be counterproductive in that the local authority becomes an objector and rather than being something of a facilitator.  It can go the other way.</p><p> The bulk of the local community is not opposed to the presence of landfill and there is a working relationship, but what is of major concern is the haul routes.  There are four haul routes in the planning but, in reality, one or two of them, for example, the Sallins-Clane-Prosperous-Millicent route is a rural back road which will be subject to heavy traffic at different hours of the day, even during down hours, at times when children would be walking home from school and when people are out and about.  It is a real concern.  The fact that additional volumes of waste will be going into that landfill site will cause great alarm in the community.  The nature of the material and the fact that it will be hazardous has already caused alarm.  As recently as yesterday, I was contacted about that.  With respect to when Mr. Meagher is making a visit to that site, I might correspond with him about that after the meeting separately or in further correspondence, but I would suggest that he explores other haul routes.  There are four haul routes available but only one or two of them are being used.  I would say the Kilshanroe-Edenderry road would be a more appropriate haul route and there may be other ways to access the site rather than the one that is being currently used.  That is what I would say on the Drehid site.</p><p> I wish to refer to a solar facility being developed at Timahoe North-Timahoe South in my constituency.  The plan is that it will have a 500 MW capacity.  It has been reasonably well received.  Often energy facilities can have a mixed reaction but there is reasonable openness to it.  People are on board with renewable energy and understandably have made that transition.  There is not necessarily opposition to it yet.  Mr. Meagher might need to check this and come back to me on it but in terms of community gain, I understand that the Mount Lucas site down the road has a 84 MW capacity.  I understand there are grants in the region of &euro;85,000 available to the local community.  For a facility with a 500 MW capacity, I would hope that &euro;500,000 would be made available, if I could be so blunt as to use the same ratio for the Timahoe site.  I do not know if there are plans in that regard but I certainly hope that there are.  It may help to sweeten the deal for the community.  One of the reasons people are so accepting of the Drehid site is that there is a good relationship with the community and a good grant scheme in operation.  Mr. Meagher might respond to me on those points.</p><p> We have a few raised bogs in north Kildare.  There are a couple of sites with which I am familiar where turf-cutting has been prohibited on individual plots of turf.  I am not sure if the areas are designated special areas of conversation or natural heritage areas but strictures have been imposed.  I understand that sometimes a deal can be done or an arrangement can be made where Bord na M&oacute;na can work with the landowners and the National Parks and Wildlife Service to do a swap.  I am aware of a couple of instances of that.  Again, perhaps we could correspond about that off-line.  Mr. Meagher might be able to give me a general answer on that now, and perhaps we would correspond off-line about the specific cases that I want to raise. </p></speech>

I acknowledge his suitability based on his distinguished and successful career at Glanbia and note his comment that it, too, like Bord na M&oacute;na is rooted in rural Ireland.  He is well aware of the historical fact that Bord na M&oacute;na has been to the forefront of economic life, vitality and the social fabric of the midlands region for many years.  I welcome the fact that he saw fit to specifically mention the commitment and the mandate the board has from Government to support regional development in the midlands and to sustain, where possible, employment in the region, and obviously to do so based on market forces and return of profit to the taxpayer.</p> <p>  Mr. Meagher also said that the company is committed to the community.  It is greatly challenged in how it does that nowadays and over the years it obviously has had to diversify and have less of a dependency on its core activity of peat excavation.  As he rightly said, it has diversified to meet those challenges with respect to Powergen, the fuels element, horticulture as he mentioned, and the move towards bioenergy and, indeed, tourism.  I am mindful of the fantastic investment and return that has accrued to both the company and to the locality, and I am conscious especially of Lough Boora, those parklands and the marvellous addition it is to the tourism product.  That is a new development, added to the other diversifications that have happened.  Tourism is a sector in respect of which the company can work in tandem with the local authorities, local community groups and local ventures to gain a return for the locality, the community and to the economy.</p> <p>  The company still retains peat production as being its core product.  The numbers have diminished back towards the thousands and there is a commitment towards 2030, as Mr. Meagher acknowledged.  He spoke about the orderly move away from peat excavation and peat production towards renewables, but that is being  done in conjunction with the partnership with the company has with the ESB and the negotiations that are ongoing regarding post-2019 and the public service obligation commitment.  How are those negotiations going?  It is vital they would come to a successful conclusion to allow the generating stations to have the potential to be in a position to co-fuel or to go into other activities in order to maintain their capacity to provide energy.</p> <p>  I am also conscious of Derrinlough and the decision that was taken prior to Mr. Meagher coming into this position and the commitment that was given to the workforce there and to the diversification that will take place and the improvements in that plant in order to meet the demands of the industry.  Is progress on that proceeding at the pace expected and will it be in a position for that to come to fruition?  I am also conscious that as that orderly move takes place, much plant will be available or will not be in use.  Will Mr. Meagher begin a process again of exploring with local authorities and communities the potential for those facilities to be of benefit to the economy and to the social fabric of the areas where they can play a part?  </p> <p>  We have always heard from the manufacturing sector, for example, of the great quality of fitter that emanated from the Bord na M&oacute;na.  Many manufacturers would now say that the quality they have now is nothing compared to when those numbers were at their best and what was coming out of Bord na M&oacute;na.  Does Mr. Meagher see a role in that respect?  There has been a great call in recent years regarding the lack of facilities and making provision for apprenticeships.  It could have an educational and beneficial role in working with State educationalists and in being in a position to use much of that plant for that purpose.  The Mount Lucas facility was mentioned earlier.  It has gone into other ownership but that facility, together with the education and training board and the Construction Industry Federation, are providing courses that are yielding jobs in the workplace to meet the demands that have been placed on the construction sector, and the intention that it has to grow in the future.  Similarly, that could be done in different locations where the plant exits.</p> <p>  I welcome Mr. Meagher and wish him every success.  Based on his record and from the research I have done, I am sure he will be a perfect fit.  I hope he will work hand in glove with the management and the workforce, whom, in the past, have met the challenge that has been placed on them, and in recent times that has been a difficult one to say the least, but they are hugely committed to their communities and to the company.  I hope that together we will in the position to have a successful stint while Mr. Meagher is chairperson of the company. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.177" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017112800002#S00100"><p>I welcome Mr. Meagher to his new role.  I crossed swords with him previously when he was the chief financial officer in Glanbia for which he was an excellent operator.  He had a great grasp of the dairy industry and I am sure he will be of great benefit to Bord na M&oacute;na and its mission statement.  With regard to that mission statement, Bord na M&oacute;na was established to create jobs in rural areas that were unable to attract industry.  Unfortunately, as mentioned previously, a decision was taken to close the plant at Littleton, a decision that will leave a serious void in the area.  The talks on a redundancy package are at an advanced stage.  Bord na M&oacute;na is a very profitable company and the plant at Littleton contributed to that profit.  The company owes it to the workforce to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion.  The gap between the two sides is not huge and I hope the incoming chairman will advise the board that the negotiations must be brought to a successful conclusion in the interests of goodwill in the area towards Bord na M&oacute;na.  Given the financial state of the company, we can make strong arguments this should happen.</p> <p>  We must accept that the decision on the closure of the plant at Littleton was taken for economic reasons, as the company only wanted to have one briquette production plant for the future, but one of the major criticisms of the decision in my area is that no plan was put in place before the closure.  How much will the closure of the plant cost?  How much will its dismantling cost?  How many employees will be employed while the plant is being dismantled and for what period will they be employed?  The plant is located on a very big site.  It is most disheartening that a semi-State company made no plans for the use of that huge acreage before the plant was closed.  The decision to close it was not taken overnight.  It is unacceptable for a semi-State company to leave us with what could be called a desert of bog.</p> <p>  Horticulture has been mentioned with reference to the alternative use of peat.  There are 1,100 acres of land in Littleton and other significant tracts in other areas of the country.  It is incumbent on Bord na M&oacute;na to put that acreage to use for the local communities.  If it was used in the horticulture sector, there could be 20 to 30 jobs created it Littleton alone.  While that would not replace the jobs that were provided previously, it would be a step towards making Bord na M&oacute;na relevant in the community again.  We reluctantly had to accept the decision to close the plant, but our main criticism is that no alternative use for either the plant or the huge tract of land available was found by the board.</p> <p>  I also have questions about different ventures Bord na M&oacute;na has in the pipeline.  An agreement was signed with a Chinese company on the use of a hydro electric plant in the Silvermines.  What is the position on that project?  Has a feasibility study been carried out and will the project get off the ground?  If it is feasible, what is the timeframe for construction and so forth?  We have seen much coverage of the issue in the media, but I have seen no concrete evidence that the plant will be viable in the future.  What is Bord na M&oacute;na's position on the use of this hydro electric plant?  Will it be a runner and what is the position on the agreement with the Chinese company?</p> <p>  We have also heard about the plans to invest in a wood pellet plant in Georgia in the United States.  As a farmer by trade, I cannot understand an Irish company investing in the United States in the production of biomass to be imported into this country.  It smells of bringing coal to Newcastle and defies logic.</p></speech>

That is where the focus must be.  The agriculture sector has the potential to produce biomass.  The stocking rate in this country is only 50% of what is permitted under the EU regulation for nitrates; therefore, there is huge potential in the sector to produce biomass which could be a huge economic driver in rural Ireland.  It defies logis for a semi-State company to consider investing in the United States to import biomass into this country.  I will argue very strongly at every opportunity that this is doing nothing for rural Ireland and flies in the face of what Bord na M&oacute;na's mission statement should be.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, spoke about the agreement with the ESB.  What is the position on that agreement with reference to the use of peat and biomass in ESB plants?  We need an answer to that question.</p> <p>  I greatly respect the reputation of the new incoming chairman, with whom, as I said, I have worked in the past.  However, I cannot stress strongly enough that this country has the potential to use biomass as an economic driver in rural Ireland.  We cannot let that opportunity pass.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1341" speakername="Michael Fitzmaurice" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017112800002#S00700"><p>I wish Mr. Meagher the best of luck in his new position.  I wish to hear his vision for apprenticeships in Bord na M&oacute;na in the coming years.  In fairness, the company had a great name for bringing forward new generations of apprentices, particularly fitters.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, it appears that in the period between now and 2030 some 1,600 to 1,700 jobs in peat production will be under pressure.  One can look at the company's track record and what it did with the last batch of workers who were employed on temporary contracts.  When the company took the lorries from them, it brought in private contractors.  It put full-time lorry drivers on the bogs and got rid of the part-time workers who had made a living by farming or working for a while during the winter and working in Bord na M&oacute;na during the summer.  That is not the way to ensure there will be sustainable jobs in rural Ireland.  I wish to hear Mr. Meagher's views on that issue.</p> <p>  This was mentioned earlier and I will not dwell on it, but I do not believe Bord na M&oacute;na should receive a tariff to produce biomass in Georgia or elsewhere.  It should be examining such ideas as the use of solar panels here.</p> <p>  On flooding - I appreciate that Mr. Meagher will not be able to answer all of our questions - we have looked at areas along the River Shannon where water could be parked.  Is Bord na M&oacute;na willing to work on that matter with either the local authorities or the Office of Public Works?  Parts of the Little Brosna river were dredged.  Is Bord na M&oacute;na willing to help in the cleaning of rivers in which there is a huge amount of silt?  The debate on the amount of silt in rivers is over and Bord na M&oacute;na should make a gesture in that regard.  In fairness, it has plenty of 22RBs, crawler cranes and so forth, available, the use of which would be a help.</p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na is involved in the operation of wind farms.  To be honest, we had a bad experience in County Roscommon where Bord na M&oacute;na became involved in the Sliabh Bawn wind farm.  Due to flooding and so forth, it has been a very protracted issue for people living in the area.</p><p>The company needs to handle things and work with the communities.</p><p> I wish to touch on a question asked earlier.  Natural heritage areas and special areas of conservation have been designated throughout the country, north, south, east and west.  A tranche of natural heritage areas has come on-stream.  Bord na M&oacute;na has vast tracts of bog that it will probably not use.  The company decided not sell this land to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  Bord na M&oacute;na wanted to have the title of the land and a 65-year licence.  I would not tolerate that, to be honest.  Is Mr. Meagher willing to give a commitment to resolve the problem in order that we can protect bogs under so-called EU legislation and under Irish legislation, in particular, the Wildlife Act?  Is Mr. Meagher prepared to see it outright?  Coillte is doing that, in fairness.  Other State or semi-State bodies have co-operated to resolve the problem.  Funnily enough, Bord na M&oacute;na has decided to hold the title and give a 65-year licence.  Is Bord na M&oacute;na willing to go down the road of making a decision in that regard?</p><p> Peat production in my area for Shannonbridge and Lanesboro will be reduced in the coming years.  Bord na M&oacute;na has a vast amount of railway track.  There are communities in the west that have large amounts of designation in their areas.  Is Bord na M&oacute;na willing to work with these communities to give them these railway lines?  We could create jobs through potential tourism.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Meagher and wish him well.  I note that he is only in the position five weeks.  While I have no doubt that he can provide a high level of detail, we would be delighted to hear back from him at a later stage in respect of some of the queries we are putting to him.</p> <p>  I note that in the past five weeks Mr. Meagher has travelled to areas throughout the country.  No doubt he has been to Kildare, my home county.  If he wishes to come back again, I would be more than happy to meet him there.</p> <p>  Bord na M&oacute;na has been crucial to my county.  I come from Rathangan, where we have Ballydermot.  My home is beside where An Foras Taluntais used to be so I am familiar with Bord na M&oacute;na.  I live in Newbridge now.  Of course that is where the headquarters of Bord na M&oacute;na is situated.  Bord na M&oacute;na is something we have always been very proud of and I have always been proud to be associated with Bord na M&oacute;na.  I am proud to be a bog woman, to use the words of Luka Bloom.  I will never shy away from that.</p> <p>  I have two queries, one of which is around the apprenticeships.  This is relevant for people in Rathangan, Ballydermot, Coill Dubh and Timahoe.  These people came from all over to serve their time with Bord na M&oacute;na and greatly added to our culture and society.  They married and settled down.  We have second and third generations there.  At one stage, per head of population Rathangan had the highest number of start-ups in the country.  I imagine that was due to the legacy of Bord na M&oacute;na.  People who had worked for the company could leave, having served their time and secured an excellent training in every sense of the word.  Many left to start up successful businesses.  That is something we need to start looking at again.</p> <p>  My particular question relates to Kilberry.  Across south and north-west Kildare, Bord na M&oacute;na has been essential to the economic, social and community fabrics.  In January of last year we heard that an acquisition was made of the White Moss company in England.  The 60 people in Kilberry were concerned about this because they believed it would impact on their jobs and livelihoods.  An extended community within Kilberry and Athy are dependent on these jobs.  I had the opportunity to raise the matter in the Chamber with the Minister.  We had a subsequent meeting with Bord na M&oacute;na.</p> <p>  Sadly, what the employees foretold has come to pass despite all the reassurances we were given at the time.  I accept that Mr. Meagher may not be able to respond to that particular query at this point.  Money had been invested recently in the plant.  It is the only plant in Ireland for developing horticultural compost of a high standard.  I understand that the English product Bord na M&oacute;na invested in is not of the same standard and this is impacting on the quality.</p> <p>  There was to have been a strike last week but it was called off at the last minute.  I would have been happy to stand shoulder to shoulder with the workers because there is no doubt their livelihoods are being threatened.  At the time, I said that there was a real sense of fear among the workers about asking the questions and speaking out.  They felt they were being intimidated.  That is not right in any organisation.  There has to be a commitment to a given level of consultation.  Unfortunately, I have heard that to some extent there is the same cultural ethos within headquarters.  Having said that, I know many excellent people who work there and I wish them well.</p> <p>  I accept that there are challenging times ahead and that, as a company, Bord na M&oacute;na has to diversify and become sustainable.  There should be a commitment to sustaining the jobs in Ireland and developing the resources in Ireland rather than outside the country.</p></speech>

I imagine you will not be in a position to answer some of them now but I know you may be able to relay them to management.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Geoffrey Meagher" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CC22017112800002#T00400"><p>I will go back to the questions from Deputy Lawless first.  He asked about Drehid.  I take his point on the traffic and congestion.  I have been to the Drehid site.  It is impressive in terms of the technology being used and the professional ways things are done.  It is a great asset to the State in terms of waste recycling and recovery and in terms of how to do things well.  That should not be forgotten.</p> <p>  Deputy Lawless asked a question about hazardous waste.  At the moment, all that is being done is work on an application to see if we could apply for a licence.  No decision has been made in respect of what we want to do within that context.  Anything we do is totally within Government policy and what is required.  From what I have seen, one area in which members can be assured is that whatever will be done will be done not alone within all the licences required but in excess of the licences in terms of safety.  Certainly, what I have seen in Drehid is along those lines.</p> <p>  There was a question about Timahoe.  I am sure the members will negotiate well with regard to Mount Lucas.  Again, that is a local issue.  To be fair, we want to work with communities.  We want to be fair to communities and to be consistent in the way we operate.  I am sure that issue will be dealt with.</p> <p>  Reference was made to a local issue relating to prohibited areas for cutting.  That is a local issue that I will bring back.  We can refer back to management.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Cowen for his comments, especially on tourism.  I agree with his comments in that regard.  Deputy Cowen referred to peat production post-2019 and the position with the ESB on the two power plants.  Those negotiations are ongoing.  The discussions are at sensitive stage at the moment.  They are going positively in the sense that both sides want to do a deal.  In fairness to both sides, they have to do a deal that makes commercial sense.  It is work in progress at the moment.  Both sides would like to have the deal completed.</p><p>They are at a sensitive point but both sides are actively working towards something that will work for both.</p><p> In the past year, 65% of biomass used by Bord na M&oacute;na was local and Irish, while 35% was imported.  I take the point on doing more and I understand various trials have been done or are ongoing on the possibility of using more Irish biomass.  It is a fair challenge but one we should follow up.  There would be no great wish on the part of Bord na M&oacute;na to have a plant in America or anywhere else if we could get the supply here in Ireland.</p><p> I understand the concerns over the closure of Littleton and the impact it had.  The discussions with the workforce about redeployment, training opportunities, etc., are ongoing and at a delicate stage but I am sure that both parties will come to a satisfactory conclusion over the coming weeks.  The costs of closure have not yet been finalised but the redundancy package is the largest part of it and that has not been completed yet.  It will be finalised over the coming couple of months.  It is regrettable that the decision had to be made but Bord na M&oacute;na has to be a commercial operation.  The Government rightly requires us to pay a dividend so we have to make commercial decisions, although I accept the point that we have to act fairly, reasonably and proportionately in doing so.</p><p> I take Deputy Cahill's point about the plant in Georgia but no decision has been made by board on that issue.  It is still just a discussion on something that might or might not happen and the opportunities on the Irish side will be pursued.</p><p> I covered the issues relating to Kilberry and White Moss earlier.  Strike action was mentioned but my understanding is that what is being done at Kilberry is part of an overall agreement at the WRC as to the savings the company was putting in place.  I have been in Kilberry and we want to protect that facility but 80% of what Kilberry produces is exported to the United Kingdom.  Without some action to diversify markets or some developments within the UK, part of that business will be under threat.</p></speech>

Biomass was expected to be one of the possible answers but there were difficulties with that, although hopefully they are on the road to being resolved.  We do need to find solutions, however, because of Brexit and the current level of sterling, things will be difficult.  We want to protect Kilberry and the jobs at that facility.</p> <p>  I was asked about apprenticeships.  I have travelled around the various sites and I learned that there was a link between Bord na M&oacute;na and the Army, which uses apprenticeships from Bord na M&oacute;na.  This shows that the value of our apprenticeships should not be underestimated.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice raised the issue of flooding on the Shannon.  We will co-operate with whatever works are ongoing in this area but our lands in the Shannon represent about 2% of the catchment area, and less than 1% of that is inactive in terms of peat production for the two electricity generating plants.  Within the terms of our licences and the rules under which we operate, we will work with local authorities and others to help in any way we can.  It is a question, however, of what we can and cannot do.</p> <p>  In regard to railway tracks, we will talk to the local communities about what we can and cannot support and we would be very open-minded about things we could do which make sense for all parties, as we are part of the community.</p></speech>

I thank them for appearing before us this afternoon.</p><p>Before we commence and in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>May I also remind all parties to turn off their mobile phones as it interferes with the parliamentary reporters and the recording system, and our web streaming is adversely affected.</p><p>I wish to advise that any submissions or opening statements that you have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>Our witnesses have kindly provided us with an opening statement but members have requested that the statement be taken as read.  We will proceed to put questions to the witnesses, beginning with Deputy Anne Rabbitte.</p></speech>

A report was completed in 2015 and another report has just been completed.  What powers of enforcement does HIQA have, if any, in instances where service providers do not address findings of non-compliance?  I am asking this in the context of the failure on the part of Oberstown to demonstrate that single separation was being used in line with policy and that accurate records were being maintained on the use of single separation.  This was highlighted in the earlier report and is highlighted again in the most recent one.  What actions can HIQA take, given that it is a red-line issue in two reports?</p></speech>

We can take no action.  HIQA and the directorate of regulation has several different functions but in the context of children and children's services, we monitor.  In monitoring, we monitor against nationally mandated standards, we report our findings, we can escalate the risk within the context of the service provider and to Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs but we have absolutely no enforcement powers in that context.  We report and publish our findings and we escalate risk appropriately.  If it is an immediate risk, we will always ensure that it has been addressed because it has been escalated immediately.  However, the responsibility of the provider is to give us an action plan outlining what it intends to do.  We can re-monitor but we do not have any enforcement powers.</p></speech>

It was quite a settled period.  There were 35 children on campus.  There had been no major incidents during the period that we were there.  We actually noted in our report that there was a very good feel in the units and a good rapport between young people and staff.  Obviously, the staff team had been through a very difficult and traumatic time but some of the measures that had been introduced for staff, such as critical incident debriefing, were welcomed by them.</p></speech>

How does what they were doing and what HIQA does differ?  Their purpose, according to the report, was to evaluate practice and policy in line with international standards and best practice, to identify obstacles or barriers to achieving greater implementation of international standards and best practice and to make recommendations to ensure greater and more successful implementation of these standards.  Is that not what HIQA does?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Dunnion" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017112800002#O01500"><p>They were a group of professionals who were commissioned by the board of Oberstown to conduct a review, which was independent and based on their expertise in the area.  We regulate and monitor against nationally mandated standards.  However, we did meet both professors when they were conducting their own review.  We fed into that review and indeed, they would have commented - anecdotally -  on our findings, which correlated with their own findings.</p><p>The 90-odd recommendations in the report were aligned to many of our recommendations.  However, I would nuance that by saying we only saw the recommendations and have not seen the report.  Therefore it would be difficult for us to make an assessment of those recommendations without seeing the supporting findings and narrative to the recommendations.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that, I want to understand HIQA's point of view and if she is comfortable now with the cultural and procedural changes and the improvements that have been articulated by the chairman of the board and the chief executive.  They have made a submission to this committee and I am pretty sure that Ms Dunnion has had sight of that submission.  Is there anything in that submission that has been stated previously that she would critique in any way?</p></speech>

We identified two major non-compliances and they were in the context of health care and the single separation.  They were major issues of non-compliance.  We assess any provider on how well they respond to risk.  We received a very positive response from Oberstown in the context of our findings.  While we have not inspected yet, we will do so in the near future and will review, in the context of that review inspection, the action plans as identified through the committee and to ourselves formally from Oberstown.</p></speech>

Obviously there is a process under way where that is being monitored.  What methodology does HIQA use?  Does it involve inspectors going in and talking to staff, inspecting the physical facilities and so on?  How does it actually work?</p></speech>

In respect of single separation, for example, we have the number of children who have experienced single separation and the number of incidents of single separation.  When we are going in, we take a sample over a period of time so we may look at individual children and follow them for a number of days in terms of their experiences, whether they have been in single separation or otherwise and the reasons for it.  We look at the application of the policy, the reason it has been there and how it is documented.  We ascertain whether we can see that the staff have been making every effort to make sure that children are removed from single separation as quickly as possible, because it is very important to bear in mind that single separation is to be a response as a result of extreme risk.  It should be an unusual intervention that is used by the staff team.</p></speech>

Presumably, it will use best international practice.  What is best international practice for the purposes of the HIQA inspections?  HIQA refers to how the authorisations for the approval of the use of single separation and the extension to the time spent in single separation were not always completed by managers in line with policy.  One can overcome that by documenting, time keeping and so on, but one must see the justification in the first instance for single separation.  As HIQA obviously has regard to best international practice, can Ms Boyle enlighten us as to what best international practice is?</p></speech>

The concept of restrictive practice is well known and restrictive practices are where a child's movement is impeded.  Naturally the young people in Oberstown are there by order of the courts or are there on remand, so their movement has been restricted anyway.  It could be medication that is prescribed, if it is a medical restrictive practice or it could be the environment that is restricted.</p><p>That is the case in single separation where the door is locked.  Best international practice shows that restrictive practices should apply for the shortest possible time, should be continuously reviewed and every effort should be made to avoid them.  When considering the issue of single separation and restrictive practices we must also bear in mind the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the need to provide for very basic human rights, for example, the rights to fresh air and reading material. </p></speech>

I perceive that cultural change is taking place in Oberstown and that it is moving towards a more positive disposition with regard to tackling these issues from a staffing point of view.  I also perceive that internal communications have dramatically improved.  Are my perceptions correct?</p></speech>

I saw change when I visited again this year and, while the process has not been completed, I certainly saw progress on many fronts.  In terms of the development of policy initiatives and completing research about the profile of young people, this gives a greater understanding of what children need in terms of placement planning.  While these are works in progress, I have certainly seen an improvement.</p></speech>

If there are real time improvements across all the HIQA standards, it will be necessary for members to see a copy of the Goldson and Hardwick report.  It is not enough that we have the recommendations without seeing what is in the body of the report.  While I understand that legal issues may arise in respect of the report, if the improvements are taking place in real time, I do not see any reason the committee cannot have regard to the report.  We need to have a greater interrogation of the Goldson and Hardwick report.  That may not be the correct name but those are the names of the report's authors.  We need to see what is in the report because it is a missing piece of the jigsaw.  I have no further questions and I thank Ms Boyle for her time.</p></speech>

Staff encourage the child to discuss why he or she acted in a particular and offer a solution.  Staff may decide to move the child from his or her bedroom to a general purpose room where there may be an activity and, initially, the child would interact with staff.  The child may go back to his or her room again, depending on how the interaction went.  Staff may decide to move the child again after a period of observation and talking to the child.  Staff may decide to allow the child to mix with another child.  It would mean there would be another child mixing with the child who has remained in his or her bedroom for single separation.  Depending on how that goes, staff may decide to allow the child to return to the group.  We have see instances where children, prior to being with their group or allowed to mix with another child, have gone to the yard outside for fresh air before returning to their bedroom.</p> <p>  A protection room is used in more extreme situations.  We have seen a reduction in the use of the protection room.  The room is specially designed for single separation.  It literally would not have a bed but a mattress may be put in for a child. </p></speech>

We would question whether single separation was necessary.</p> <p>  When we reviewed the records we discovered that no child had been left in single separation for that extended period while we conducted an inspection in Oberstown this time.

Where are the witnesses going to go from here?  Do they plan to have an unannounced visit in the next three months?  Where does a red line go off here that this could be a continual practice?

The provision of the service and the accountability for that service rests with the management of Oberstown.  Regarding the data that we reviewed that brought up this case, the action plan delivered from Oberstown would be to show adherence to the policy, monitoring of the policy, training staff in the policy and in its application.  When we conduct our unannounced inspection, or announced because we can do either, it will be reviewing the data to show what has been happening.  If there is a child in that position when we are there we will review the case itself.  However, it is looking at the data and ensuring that there is not a repeat of what we published as a major non-compliance in the context of single separation.</p></speech>

I have a few questions myself.  I visited Oberstown shortly after I was appointed Chairman of the committee.  I should have done so long before because it is in my constituency.  Having visited the facility for quite a number of hours there were a number of observations that I made in line with the witnesses' report.  I visited before I read the report.  I found it alarming that the State would invest such significant sums of money in a facility without adhering to the basic principles in other detention facilities albeit I accept entirely that we are talking about juveniles.  However, the basic principles are the same.</p> <p>  One was fire safety.  That was very clear and made very obvious to me when visiting.  At the back of the building one passes a fire door with a notice that it is blocked closed.  I  am not sure 4 x 4 would justify how large this piece of wood was jamming it closed because the security on the door was compromised.  Other basic principles like door sizes, frame sizes being all completely different, and locking systems being similar in my observation to domestic residences.  I know from that visit that Oberstown management were pleased that they had co-operation from the Irish Prison Service in the provision of their locks.  However, the fact that the State had expended so much money on a facility, and multiple elements within the same facility, without doing the basic research to me was not just shocking.  I have no idea what they were thinking.  I found that appalling not just that the witnesses had to go out and highlight the obvious.</p><p>The staff were put in a position whereby they could not guarantee the integrity of the building in which certain juveniles were being detained and-or assessed.  That was an observation I wanted to get off my chest since I visited the facility some months ago.  </p><p> My main question concerns the positives the witnesses have highlighted in the report in term of the response from staff and management in Oberstown.  It is very clear, having visited the centre and seen, for example, the profiling research which has been completed or is underway, that the basic responses which are being implemented on foot of the report are positive.  </p><p> Unfortunately, there are number of themes which I am aware the witnesses have been assessing for many years.  Ms Boyle referred to it being a learning curve, but elements have been left unaddressed.  </p><p> I refer to health, which is listed as an area of major non-compliance.  I do not have a specific question because the report clearly highlights some of the issues.  Can the witnesses tell me the most alarming elements and responses to them from Oberstown management in terms of the resolution to the highlighted sections?</p></speech>

That centred on a child who required a particular medication for an allergy, which staff had not been trained to administer.  In fairness, immediate action was taken and staff were trained.  A nurse gave a briefing to staff and staff on shift were trained, who then trained other staff to ensure the intervention would be put in place if required.</p> <p>  The second immediate action concerned the safe storage of medication.  We found keys left in a medication cabinet and there was concern that a child or young person could gain access to medication.  We were satisfied with the response, which ensured that keys were locked away and held securely.  The problem was dealt with on the day.  </p> <p>  In respect of other areas of concern in terms of health, we were concerned that some children experienced a delay in receiving medical attention and gave two examples in the report.  One child was delayed in getting an X-ray for security reasons.  That was of concern to us.</p> <p>  The campus management team have put in place a process whereby if there is a concern about a child requiring medical attention, such as security concerns, the matter goes to the level of chief operations officer who needs to look at arrangements which can be put in place in order for a child to access and receive appropriate medical attention.  </p></speech>

There is a supervision policy within the Oberstown centre.  Supervision is a two-way process.  It is about the manager ensuring the worker is doing his or her work, but it is also about having an opportunity for that staff member to have a one-to-one with his or her manager to discuss how he or she is progressing within his or her working environment and the direct work he or she is doing with children.  There is a supportive as well as a supervisory element to the process, which was something we highlighted.  We felt there was a need for regular supervision and clear records on the agreed outcomes as a result of the process.  However, we also saw that a critical incident debriefing process had been introduced on the campus.  That was a very positive move which allowed staff some time out after a difficult incident to review and talk about what had worked well and what had not and how they felt about it emotionally.  That was a new initiative, which was positive.  There are also other staff supports available through the human resources department.</p></speech>

I am accompanied today by Ms Iqra Zainul Abedin, Mr. Alex Costello and Mr. Shane McNamee from the Department of Finance who work with me on this file.</p> <p>  I would like to remind the committee of where we have come from in terms of the European model.  The European system of financial supervision, ESFS, was introduced in 2011 to strengthen the supervision frameworks in Europe.  The system as it is includes the European Systemic Risk Board, ESRB, the three European supervisory authorities, namely, the European Banking Authority, EBA, the European Securities Markets Authorities, ESMA, and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA, along national supervisors.</p> <p>  Earlier this year, the Commission published a consultation paper on the framework.  Member states, including Ireland, submitted views with many signalling that at this point, targeted amendments to the framework was the preferred approach, rather than a more fundamental change with additional new roles for the various supervisory bodies.  Following that consultation, the Commission is now proposing legislative measures to amend the ESFS with the stated aim of strengthening the Union's integrated supervision framework in order to promote the capital markets union, market integration and financial stability, and to respond to the new challenges which the Union is facing following the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the Union.</p> <p>  The Commission's proposal is amending a number of pieces of existing legislation and introduces new powers and roles for the European supervisory authorities, ESAs, a number of which will have a significant impact on our financial services sector and on the work of our relevant competent authorities in here in Ireland.   The Commission's proposal maintains the board of supervisors' position as the main body of the ESAs in charge of its overall guidance and decision making.  However, the proposal seeks to change the composition of the board to include full-time members of the relevant ESA.  These full time staff members will be part of a new executive board, the main function of which will be to examine, give an opinion, and make proposals on all matters to be decided by the board of supervisors.  It would also be the decision-making body for certain tasks of a non-regulatory nature, such as dispute settlements, breach of Union law and independent reviews.</p><p>We have previously supported the concept of introducing permanent staff members to the board of supervisors of the different European supervisory authorities, ESAs, but the executive board as proposed by the Commission dilutes the power of the national competent authorities too far.  These are the people with the required expertise and knowledge of their local markets.</p><p> The proposals also aim to significantly strengthen the existing powers of the ESAs through independent reviews of national authorities' activities and early intervention in cases of possible supervisory arbitrage.  The Commission has argued that these extra powers are required to ensure European rules are applied equally by all member states or, in other words, that we ensure supervisory convergence across the union.  We fully support a move towards a greater focus of the ESAs on supervisory convergence, but the Commission is introducing new powers for them which will, in effect, provide them a role in the day-to-day authorisation and supervision of relevant entities.  This is not warranted.  For example, one of the new powers envisaged for the ESAs is the ability to co-ordinate the supervisory actions of national competent authorities in the area of outsourcing and delegation of activities to third-country entities.  The Commission's proposal will compel national regulators to notify an ESA every time they receive a request for authorisation by a firm that delegates part of its activities outside the union.  We see the framework being proposed for the delegation of activities to third countries as adding further unnecessary complexity, when the existing powers available to the ESAs could achieve the same result of ensuring supervisory convergence.  The European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, issued an opinion in July 2017 to support supervisory convergence in the area of asset management which highlighted what national competent authorities should consider when allowing an entity to delegate functions such as asset management.  This is a good example of how the ESAs can use their existing powers to help ensure supervisory convergence across the union.  </p><p> With regard to direct supervision roles, the Commission's proposal intends to give further direct supervisory roles to the ESMA, as it believes the only way to ensure supervisory convergence is to provide a direct supervisory role for ESAs in certain cases.  The Commission's proposal will give the ESMA supervisory responsibility for the approval of certain categories of prospectuses.  They are wholesale non-equity prospectuses, those drawn up by specialist issuers, those of asset-backed securities and those by third country issuers.  In addition, the ESMA will be given responsibility for the authorisation and supervision of certain types of investment funds structures - European venture capital funds, European social entrepreneurship funds and European long-term investment funds.</p><p> As we highlighted in our response to the Commission consultation paper, we see no need for the ESMA to be given a direct supervisory role in the area of investment funds.  We stated in our response that the existing powers of the ESMA are sufficient to ensure the European rules applicable to all investment funds and also to prospectuses are applied equally across the union and thus ensure supervisory convergence between member states.</p><p> The use of peer reviews is a very powerful tool to ensure the single rule book is applied equally.  The existing toolkit should be used more frequently by the ESAs before the Commission considers such a fundamental change as moving supervision of some investment funds and approval of certain prospectuses to a central European body.  </p><p> Along with a majority of member states, we have voiced concerns over the scale and impact of the proposals at council.  In particular, the increased role being proposed for the ESMA has been criticised by a large number of member states.  This file will be progressed under the Bulgarian presidency and we expect further meetings at a technical level to commence in January.  We will continue to engage, make our valid points known, work with other member states and seek to have a more proportionate outcome from this review. </p><p> To conclude, in this proposal, the Commission has introduced significant changes to the European supervisory authorities' framework with the stated aim of creating a stronger and more integrated European financial supervision system for the capital markets union.  Ireland has been an enthusiastic supporter of the capital markets union project, as we see the provision of more non-bank financing would be of significant benefit to the real economy, not only in Ireland but across the union.  However, we believe the proposed changes will not help to achieve the aim of developing Europe&rsquo;s capital markets.  They will instead add further complexity and costs for entities engaging with European markets.  In addition, we also fully believe in the need to prevent regulatory arbitrage and to ensure the rules agreed between the co-legislators are applied equally across the union.  That does not mean we believe in a significantly reduced role for national competent authorities. </p><p> The proposed changes to the ESAs will dilute the input of national competent authorities in decision-making processes.  We must remember that these are the people with the expert knowledge of local markets and, in particular, who have the corporate knowledge of the firms operating there.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues, Gr&aacute;inne McEvoy, head of securities and market authorisations, and Martina Kelly, head of markets policy at the Central Bank.</p> <p>  The proposed measures, if implemented in full, would bring about significant changes to the regulatory and supervisory architecture in the EU.  The three ESAs &ndash; the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, the European Banking Authority, EBA, and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA &ndash; and the ESRB form part of the European System of Financial Supervision, ESFS.  The ESAs were established as independent EU agencies in January 2011 under the 2010 ESA regulations.  </p> <p>  The ESAs are tasked with a range of regulatory and supervisory related responsibilities.  The principal decision-making bodies of the ESAs are their respective boards of supervisors, which consist of heads or alternates of the national competent authorities and are chaired in each case by a chairperson elected by the boards of supervisors for five years, a position which is renewable once.  The proposed changes to this supervisory architecture would affect the governance, role and funding of the ESAs and include an enhanced role for ESMA as a direct supervisory authority over certain activities.  The European Commission&rsquo;s proposals are under consideration by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.  The Department of Finance is representing Ireland at the negotiations in the Council.  The Central Bank&rsquo;s role is twofold.  It is to provide the Department with technical assistance and analysis in support of its engagement in the negotiations and to examine the proposals from a regulatory and supervisory perspective and communicate appropriately in that regard.  The proposals are broad and consequential and analysis by the Central Bank is ongoing.  Our comments today should be taken in that context. </p> <p>  In carrying out our work in respect of the proposals, the Central Bank will be guided by a number of considerations that, from a regulatory perspective, are important when considering proposed changes to the ESAs.  First, the European supervisory architecture was reformed substantially following the crisis.  Since its introduction in 2011, the ESFS framework has in general worked well.  The ESAs have delivered well on their objectives based on a good balance between centralised and local responsibilities.  Therefore, the baseline should be that we are starting from a good position.  Second, reforms to the ESAs should be in line with the broad objectives of financial supervision.  These are the achievement of financial stability; consumer and investor protection and orderly, fair, and well-functioning financial markets, all supporting a sustainably growing economy.  Third, while increased supervisory convergence is desirable, this is distinct from the centralisation of powers.  It is very important that the integrity of supervisory responsibilities and decision-making processes is maintained in order to ensure effectiveness and appropriate accountability of decision-makers.  The introduction of fragmentation or uncertainty in this regard, which leaves any doubt about the decision-making authority of the relevant supervisor, should be avoided. </p> <p>  I will mention some aspects of the proposals the Central Bank is focusing on.  On the question of governance, the proposals would entail significant reform to the current functioning of the ESAs.  The main proposed change in this regard is the introduction of an executive board for each of the ESAs.  The executive boards would have powers including the development of three-year strategic supervisory plans, with which NCAs should comply; preparing decisions of the board of supervisors; carrying out binding mediation between national competent authorities; reviewing the activities of national competent authorities; and assessing third country delegation and outsourcing arrangements by EU regulated entities.  </p> <p>  As we have said, in our response to the European Commission&rsquo;s consultation on ESA reform earlier this year, we consider the current governance arrangements to be working well.  We are concerned by the breadth of powers that would be conferred upon the proposed new executive boards. This would represent a significant shift in responsibilities and risks confusion as to respective roles and competencies. </p> <p>  The Central Bank welcomes the proposed measures to increase the mandates of the ESAs in the area of consumer protection.  The proposals include the obligation to carry out in-depth thematic reviews of market conduct in order to identify potential problems and their impact, as well as developing retail risk indicators for identifying emerging risks of consumer harm. </p> <p>  The Commission is proposing an enhanced role for the ESAs in respect of third country equivalence processes.  In particular, the ESAs will be required to monitor regulatory and supervisory developments and enforcement practices where equivalence decisions for particular third countries have been adopted.  Monitoring ongoing compliance of equivalence decisions would be new and would be welcome.  The Commission&rsquo;s proposal would give the ESAs a significant role in reviewing delegation and outsourcing arrangements by EU regulated entities to third country entities.  This proposal is the focus of considerable scrutiny by stakeholders and raises a number of concerns for the Central Bank.</p><p>These include the risk of introducing artificial barriers to well-functioning products such as undertakings for collective investments in transferable securities, UCITS, and adopting a disproportionate or inconsistent approach in respect of particular aspects or practices related to the authorisation processes of the national competent authorities, NCAs.  It is proposed that approval of European venture capital funds, European social entrepreneurship funds and European long-term investment funds be transferred from national authorities to the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA.  We have concerns about the logic of singling out these types of funds as the approach could result in a confused allocation of responsibilities between authorities.</p><p> Finally, it is proposed that significant prospectus approval powers be moved from national authorities to ESMA.  The Central Bank is the second largest approver of prospectuses in the European Union, EU.  We have developed an approach and a level of experience that is world-leading and which serves issuers and investors well.  Against this backdrop we will be assessing closely the technical detail of the proposals to understand their justification, practicality and implications.  I thank the committee for its attention.</p></speech>

The witness identified the different responsibilities that the executive boards of these ESAs would take on.  Will he explain that in comparison with the governance structure at this time?

Is he referring to all the powers or is it a certain amount of power that could be conferred on them?</p></speech>

With the current framework there is a board of supervisors, with a chair who is a permanent member of staff and a non-voting member.  There are also very senior people from the relevant competent authorities sitting on it, and there are 28 competent authorities.  Decisions would be made in different ways.  Some would be on a simple majority and some would be with qualified majority voting.</p> <p>  What has been proposed by the Commission is that we would have an executive board.  To take a step back, we have a management board structure within the ESAs made up of the chair of the relevant ESA and a certain number of members from the board of supervisors elected.  I cannot remember the exact number.  The European Commission representative would sit on that as well as a non-voting member.  That really deals with more administrative issues.  The Commission is proposing an executive board, which in the case of the European Banking Authority and EIOPA, the insurance authority, would be made up of three permanent members, with the chair of the relevant ESA and the European Commission delegate as an observer.  It will make certain decisions, whether it relates to binding mediation or breach of Union law, for example.  The way it is phrased, it looks as if the papers are being prepared for the board of supervisors.  It would be another group where we have no national competent authorities present with any views being put forward.  In some cases it makes decisions without national competent authorities having a say and prepares papers put forward to the board of supervisors.</p> <p>  Our response in the consultation paper to this in April and may this year was that we saw a need for potentially some permanent members to be on the board of supervisors to give a pan-European view.  This is so a domestic or parochial view could be broken.  We always said there needed to be a majority of supervisors on the board because they are on the ground making decisions and engaging with firms.  They will also be implementing the rules.  We feel it is important they have a strong say.  As I said, we saw a view for a more pan-European focus but the national competent authorities should remain in the majority.  This executive board up-ends that. </p></speech>

What is the counter-argument?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.326" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Gilvarry" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017112800002#F00500"><p>The Commission's response is that this is required to give a more pan-European view and ensure supervisory convergence.  There are significant powers for the ESAs today but they have not been used in a major way.  Part of the reason is because the ESAs are also responsible for doing what is called "level two".  These are the regulatory technical standards that put the flesh on the bones of a directive or regulation.  There have been a significant number of these in the past five years, including the capital requirements directive, the capital requirements regulation, and the MiFID II has been completed recently and transposed.  We have seen the market abuse frameworks.  There has been a large raft of legislative proposals and these ESAs must focus on them to create the rules around them.  They have not been as focused on supervisory convergence so our argument is, rather than creating these new structures and diluting the power of national competent authorities, they should focus more on supervisory convergence.  If there are issues following that, a fundamental reform can be carried out.  As Mr. Cross outlined, the framework came into place in 2011.  Let us give it a bit of time to see if we need fundamental reform.</p></speech>

I am no supporter of the centralisation of these supervisory powers but I must ask these questions.  When we cut through this, is the fact not that we would lose competitiveness?  The divergence currently benefits certain funds in certain member states and Ireland is one of them.  Is that not the real issue behind this?  If this is introduced, a bit of the competitive edge we have could be lost.</p></speech>

We have a framework in place here that we see as a strong framework.  The Central Bank will speak in a moment about active engagement.  We have called for a greater use of the powers that the ESAs have to ensure the rules applied are agreed by the co-legislators, the Parliament and Council, and applied equally across the Union so we avoid this regulatory arbitrage.  We want to see a position where those rules are applied properly and stringently and we do not have a case where other member states might not apply them to their full degree.</p> <p>  There was an ESMA opinion on delegation and outsourcing on asset management.  The Central Bank was heavily involved with that, as were other national competent authorities.  This was to provide a structure on delegation and outsourcing the likes of asset management.  We need greater focus so the rules in the directive or regulation, and brought down via level two measures, are applied equally.  This is so we are all on a level playing field.  Ireland is not a jurisdiction people would pick in the hope of a light-touch regime but people could pick another jurisdictions because it would not apply certain rules in certain ways.  We want to see rules being applied equally across the Union so people make decisions not on regulatory arbitrage but whether it is cost-efficient.</p></speech>

Ireland is seen a location for prospectus approval; we are the second-largest destination in that respect in the Union.  From the European framework we have set timelines for prospectus approval.  Ireland works to a tighter timeline due to the resources applied and systems used.  Our concern is-----</p></speech>

It outlined the pluses and minuses.  That report was positive overall in how the Central Bank operates but there was one issue relating to resourcing and the need for greater resources.  That was dealt with.  It is an example of the process demonstrating that we are a good regime and applying the rules in an appropriate way.  Our concern, which is not purely from the Irish perspective, is that if the process is centralised to ESMA, will we see those timelines slipping?  From an Irish perspective we will lose the listing business but the Union will also lose.  That feeds into the desire to build a capital markets union.</p><p>However, the process damages this because decisions will be made not to list debt instruments or equity in Europe and instead to use another jurisdiction where companies will know the timelines and framework and have certainty.</p><p> Another issue is that changes to the prospectus framework were only agreed by co-legislators in recent months and the Commission is now proposing further changes.  This creates uncertainty regarding the framework in Europe and, again, does not help us to develop a capital markets union. </p></speech>

I will add a couple of thoughts.  The Central Bank approaches this matter very much from a regulatory and supervisory perspective.  We have stated we are very strong supporters of the objective of creating a capital markets union.  The idea of enhanced sources of funding, investment opportunities and diversification funding are highly valuable.  The first question we ask, which is the same as the question being asked by the Department, is whether it is necessary to do what is proposed to achieve these objectives.  In many respects, as Mr. Gilvarry stated, some of the examples of convergence, even in the past few months, are quite striking, in particular, what the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA, has done around Brexit.  ESMA established a supervisory co-ordination network which has significant oversight of how some of these decisions are being made.</p> <p>  Deputy Doherty asked whether we are concerned about the establishment of the board or the powers it would have.  To take one example of these powers, the three-year strategic supervisory plan, we are very much concerned that we may somehow end up with an inconsistent allocation of powers and responsibilities.  The Central Bank has responsibility for supervision in the context of Ireland, accountability to the Oireachtas and securing financial stability and consumer protection in Ireland as well as in the European context.  This becomes complicated and potentially conflicted if the plan we have to follow is set at the European level and we have to stick closely to it and be assessed on it.  One of the concerns that we have, which we also observe in the discussion on funds authorisation, is about different allocation of responsibilities between the national and European authorities in respect of approvals around third country delegations.  Across the piece, what concerns us is the risk of fragmentation and inconsistency of approach which may ultimately result in a divergence between powers and responsibilities. </p></speech>

The European supervisory authorities perform this role along with the European Systemic Risk Board.  Should there be a separate consumer protection organisation as part of this process?  Is there any divergence of opinion between the Central Bank and the Department or is it the position similar to that between the Garda Commissioner and Department of Justice and Equality to the extent that everything is worked out between the Central Bank and Department beforehand?  That is not a serious question.  I am interested, however, in hearing whether there is a divergence of views between the Central Bank and Department.  The various officials will be familiar with the position of their counterparts on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.336" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Oliver Gilvarry" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017112800002#G00400"><p>As my colleagues from the Central Bank have outlined, the bank is still going through issues.  On the points that I have raised, we are aligned on concerns about diluting the power and role of the national competent authorities in the proposed framework and moving supervision of certain parts, for example, prospectus approvals.  We can definitely say we are fully aligned in terms of our desire to have the rules applied equally.  From the Department's perspective, while we operate a stringent regime for applying the rules that are set out, we want a level playing field to be applied across the European Union.</p> <p>  On consumer protection at EU level, the European supervisory authorities, from my understanding, all have a conduct or consumer protection area within them.  The issue is not one that we have considered as part of this process.  Again, this flows back to the point that if this were to move back to a European level, an issue would arise regarding expertise and how it would work.  However, we have not considered whether consumer protection should be included as part of this process and it was not included in the Commission's consultation paper.  That did not prevent the Commission bringing forward some of the proposals but this was not in the original paper.  </p></speech>

We ask whether it will work and where it will leave our regulatory objectives.  I do not believe there are major divergences between where the Central Bank ends up and the Department's position but any divergences are probably on matters of gradation.  There are some issues on which the Department probably has firm views and the Central Bank's position would be more agnostic, and vice versa.  There is significant convergence on some of the main issues we have discussed today.</p> <p>  On the issue of the consumer protection mandate, the Central Bank raised this matter in its submission to the consultation on the ESAs in May.  We considered that there was a gap in the sense that there was not a clear and consistent mandate for the ESAs in respect of consumer protection.  It was not always the case that they could operate very well together across sectors.  There were divergences and differences in definitions across different sectors and we called this out in our submission.  To reply directly to the Deputy's question, we called for the establishment of a cross-sectoral committee with consumer protection responsibilities.</p> <p>  The Commission's proposals probably reflect a slightly different view of the issue.  We believe they move in the right direction, call out more clearly the consumer protection mandate in the case of ESAs, and add to their mandates in terms of carrying out in-depth thematic reviews and developing risk indicators.  The package goes in the right direction, although more could probably be done and it approaches the issue slightly differently from the way we suggested in our submission.  It goes in a positive direction, however.</p></speech>

It quantified the size of the industry for the first time and its potential impact on stability in the State.  Has the risk presented by the industry increased in the meantime and has the sector experienced growth since the assessment was carried out?  Are there any serious risks?  We are all familiar with the risks posed by excessive lending by banks.  The shadow banking sector is massive in this country.  We can talk about the perspective and times and so forth but what we are discussing here is a substantial chunk of the market.  While the Central Bank's report did not identify any significant risks at the time, has anything changed or are the risks becoming greater or smaller?</p></speech>

The Financial Stability Board, FSB, which is the international G20 organisation, carries out an annual survey of shadow banking across the globe.  We participated in that process for the first time two years ago, although we are not an FSB member.  The Deputy is correct that the funds industry in Ireland is sizeable and this comes through in the figures reported by the FSB.  While I do not have figures with me, the funds sector has continued to grow at a moderate pace, rather than exponentially.</p> <p>  Two crucial facts should be noted.  First, because much of the so-called shadow banking sector in Ireland - others use the term "market-based finance" - is actually in the funds space, it is regulated.  The risk profile of that must, therefore, be viewed in light of the fact that it is a regulated concept.</p><p>Second, the Central Bank has been very engaged in leadership ways, for example, the International Organization of Securities Commissions around risks and potential systemic risks in the funds sector.  The work there is continuing but is moving in a good direction.  The sense is that a good understanding is now developing of how risks might materialise in the funds sector.  It is fair to say that this is in a good place and that our participation in the FSB exercises has been very much driven by the desire for us to be transparent about the size and nature of the Irish funds industry.  We continue to participate.  It is also worth noting that the interconnections between the shadow banking sector in Ireland and the domestic economy are also quite limited.  My colleague might want to add something on that.</p></speech>

I will not go into that but I know the Central Bank is understaffed and has authorisation.  My understanding from internal reports in terms of what it should have is that even if it was filled to the authorisation, it would still be understaffed.  I understand that a major concern does not involve the number of entities that may locate here as a result of Brexit, but the complexity of the type of activities in which some of them are engaged.  In respect of the City of London, the complexity and uniqueness of some of those entities are completely unique in an Irish setting and, therefore, the experience may not exist within the Central Bank because we are unfamiliar with that type of territory.  How much of a challenge does that pose or is it just the case that authorisation would be refused in those circumstances?</p></speech>

The advent of a range of firms relocating activities to Ireland in the context of Brexit, some of which we are familiar with and some of which are new, poses a challenge that we need to address and be ready for.  My sense within the bank is that we have planned well for it and have scoped what is expected well.  In our planning for 2017 and ongoing planning, we have foreseen what was expected and have made recruitment and contingency decisions which we have then implemented.</p> <p>  In terms of resourcing, we have kept well apace of the challenge that Brexit is posing in that respect.  It means we must think about and respond to new activities, but that is a challenge with which we are comfortable and about which we are confident.  We have a great wealth of experience within the organisation and are able to deploy resources across different sectors so one of the benefits of the one bank approach, which is very much at the heart of how we operate now, is that we can use resources from our banking experience in the context of asset management and, therefore, when one is looking at broker or dealer activities, it allows both of those perspectives to be brought together.  It is a challenge because these are new activities but it is a challenge for which we have planned well and are in good shape in respect of and things are going as they should.</p></speech>

This means where an insurance company is set up in another jurisdiction and provides services in Ireland.  One of the challenges has been the fact that we as a prudential regulator have not had sight of that. and we have not had the prudential responsibilities or other authority.  That has been a concern.  The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority has taken material steps to try to address that problem recently.  For example, what was previously called the Siena Protocol is now called the General Protocol and has now become a decision of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority sets up a framework and a set of requirements for authorities to engage with each other to provide information that allows them to ask each other questions.  As well as that, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority has developed so-called platforms of co-operation so that where an insurance company in one jurisdiction is doing business in another jurisdiction and issues arise with that, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority will host a platform through which authorities can engage with each other about what is or may be happening and how it may be resolved.  Those are steps that have been taken within the current framework to address that issue.</p> <p>  Another route to go might be centralisation, which is the route proposed by the Commission.  That is a way of saying that we are going to bring the problems away from the local to the centre.  One then faces the question of how much of that one does.  For example, in the context of proposals, it is proposed that the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority would have the power to approve models of cross-border insurance companies but that is just one aspect of their business so does one end up with a situation where responsibilities are less clear?</p><p>At least we now have clarity on responsibilities and we can work around the convergence, co-operation and co-ordination.  Progress has been made in that respect.  The question remains as to whether the centralisation route provides the most effective way of addressing the issue.</p></speech>

In insurance, unlike banking, the cost is borne in the host jurisdiction, which is what we are seeing in the Setanta case.  One could move to a different model in this regard.  The Commission has considered and discussed this from time to time but there has been limited appetite for it in the insurance sector because there are such differences between insurance models.  It is more a question for the political sphere than for the Central Bank to express a view on.</p> <p>  On the question of tracker mortgages, I am not briefed to address the issue in detail.  The question of culture and conduct within banks and financial firms is a key issue for supervisors.  It is something on which we can work together at European level.  For example, in the context of the SSM, there have been quite important discussions on how culture may be effectively supervised within complicated organisations.  These particular proposals are not specifically aimed at addressing that question.  I have mentioned the consumer protection aspect.  That is as far as they go in that regard.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, we called for permanent members with voting rights to be on the board of supervisors, with a view to trying to bring a greater European focus, rather than a domestic focus, to the ESAs.  We saw much greater use of peer reviews to ensure supervisory convergence across the Union, but we have seen the authorities going much further.  Rather than focusing on targeted amendments, they have opted for a very broad-brush approach, which, in our view, is ignoring the positives of having supervision at national competent authority level in respect of investment funds and other areas.  What is occurring is adding complexity, cost and delays in certain parts.</p> <p>  Within the Council, only the French and Dutch support the proposal.  Therefore, a large number of other member states have concerns over the broad reach.  We voice those concerns also.  Ireland and others have voiced our disappointment that the amendments are not targeted to achieve some fixes.  As I stated, the framework is in place only since 2011.  We have seen some areas that might need more focus.  Powers may need to be exercised in regard to the breach of Union law, including in respect of more mediation.  I have referred to peer reviews already.  Let us see how we can do as I describe rather than saying it is not working and bringing it all into the centre without seriously considering the impact on European capital markets and consumers.</p></speech>

With regard to the five or six roles identified, consumer protection and investor protection come last.  We would be interested in knowing how consumer protection manifests itself when a person has a relationship with a bank or investment vehicle of any kind for pension or other purposes.  Most people and SMEs find it very difficult to understand where the bank stands in this regard.  People understand that the Central Bank is absolutely interested in the stability of the banking system, its recovery and meeting international standards and norms, but costs and charges in Ireland, across a range of items, are extraordinarily high by comparison with those in most other countries.  When people fail to meet agreements, the penalties can be extremely high.  People are often left without recourse.</p> <p>  One of the main points for consumers and SMEs is that when they are investing in pension products, it is very difficult for them to evaluate the products properly.  As the witnesses know, very significant sections of the workforce are now in defined contribution structures for their pensions.  Unless an individual really keeps up with the financial press or financial information, how is he or she safeguarded in terms of ensuring his or her investment is as wise and least costly as possible and produces returns that are commensurate with other options.  That is a tall order but, as a society, we have moved from a quite paternalistic defined benefit pension scheme that gave people the advantage of a lot of security at the end of their investment period, provided the pension fund was well managed, although I acknowledge that many were not.  Now there are hundreds of thousands of individuals, and there are to be more in the future, who are managing their own pension funds.  Regarding the ordinary banking arrangements and investments of the ordinary customer or SME owner, what is the Central Bank's concept of consumer and investor protection?</p></speech>

Nonetheless, the broad thrust of the Deputy's question is relevant.  As she knows, consumer protection is one of our core mandates and one to which we have been and continue to be completely committed.  There has been a discussion at a meeting of this committee.  We try to articulate clearly that we are focused on ensuring consumers are treated fairly.  Our role is not capping premiums or controlling prices <i>per se</i>but, rather, ensuring consumers are treated fairly.</p><p>That is essential.  From the point of view of the Central Bank, not only is the mandate of protecting the consumer in itself a key requirement but that also goes directly to the level of confidence in the financial system, which goes to how the financial system supports the economy.  That is core to our mandate and central to how we go about things.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned that it is clear that we have a great interest in prudential and financial stability issues.  Those are driven by a wish for consumer protection.  There is a consistency of thought there.  I would also mention the recent establishment of the new two pillar structure within financial regulations.  Whereas previously we had financial regulation, we now divide it into prudential regulation and financial conduct.  Each has a deputy governor or director general in charge of it.  There are many reasons for that, including the proliferation of workload, but it clearly calls out that commitment to addressing conduct.</p><p> With regard to these proposals, as we have said in our response to the commission's consultation on this earlier in the year, we called this out.  We asked for more effectiveness in this space, stronger mandates and a more consistent mandate.  The proposal does not go directly on that route but it includes aspects which enhance the profile and mandates with regard to consumer protection.  It calls out consumer protection specifically which is important because a past issue was where different European Supervisory Authorities, ESAs, gather their consumer protection mandate.  Now that is clearly called out, as are some of the practices.  We think this goes in the right direction but there is more to be done.</p></speech>

How does a consumer find out whether or not the service the consumer is getting from a bank is more or less expensive than other banks?  It is extremely difficult to compare them.  How are consumers represented in the process in the Central Bank?  How many representatives of consumers are there?  I include small and medium enterprises, SMEs, as "consumers" because the people who often get the roughest deal are SMEs looking for loans and seeking to buy credit for varying durations and finding that if they enter into a deal and something is varied, the cost can rise enormously.  How are consumers represented, particularly at a time when face-to-face banking relationships are disappearing from a consumer and small business point of view?  It has moved to online banking and there is nothing wrong with that but it can be expensive to meet, speak to or contact somebody.  What is the response of the Central Bank and its European colleagues?  The impression there, which many people believe, is that because Irish banks collapsed, the role of the Central Bank has been to bring the banks back to a point of prudential security, safety and that at the same time consumers, a term which I use widely as I set it out, are gouged with charges, penalties and costs.  This even happens in the case of simple things.</p> <p>  The Central Bank instructed banks to confirm who account holders are, which is ongoing.  That can be extraordinarily difficult from the point of view of consumers because banks come out with a bewildering range of things that people have to confirm with regard to the accounts.  Is there somewhere that banks can go?  Does the Central Bank have any contact with services such as the Citizens Information Board or the Money Advice and Budgeting Services, or indeed with credit unions where many people have sought recourse?  I do not think credit unions fit into this section.  Is there an easy way of explaining it?  If somebody has a serious complaint, does that person still have to go through all the bank processes or can he or she get relatively quickly to some kind of Ombudsman service where action may be required sooner rather than later?  Many people give up on complaining because it is a lengthy process which takes a lot of personal resource on the part of people to be able to deal with it.</p></speech>

I felt this was going slightly beyond my brief for today.  The point about what consumers are able to understand in respect of different products and offers is important and it is central to the work that goes on in Europe and the Central Bank.  An example from the recent past is the packaged retail investment products, PRIPs, framework, which has been a long exercise to try to have one or two pages on what exactly the terms of the product on offer are and how to make that meaningful for consumers.  There are many examples.  The Deputy mentioned the issue of online banking.  One thing we published in the recent past is a discussion paper on how to achieve consumer protection in the context of financial services in a digitalised context.  How does it work if people do not read terms and conditions any more because they press "I agree" as we all do?  How would that work?  That is a discussion paper which I think has been well-received and which lays the foundation for us to engage further in that.  The issues the Deputy raises are important and exercise us and colleagues on a European level.  The PRIPs example is one that took place across three ESAs and was a reason why we called for a single committee.  It was quite difficult to have the same discussion across three different ESAs but it was done across all three ESAs.  Noting the concerns the Deputy articulated, which are very familiar with us, those are things we are committed to addressing.</p></speech>

They have been brought in at a European level, we have transposed them and they will come into effect on 3 January.  Under the markets in financial instruments directive, MiFID 2, we have a situation where the information provided to a consumer has to be understood by the consumer.  We will see changes coming through.  As part of that process, the Central Bank has changed its consumer protection code to bring in this concept of what we call inducements.  An issue seen across Europe is provision of services to people.  It may not be the best product that is being provided because one is paying a higher commission.  We are seeing greater disclosure.  There is more disclosure by people about what inducements they are getting paid for selling the product.  That is all looking forward to the future but there have been changes and we have also seen changes with regard to what one might call instruments from the legislation that has gone through the houses in recent times with relation to the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman.  There have been changes in addition to those Mr. Cross has highlighted with regard to PRIPs, which is supposed to give simple language to people that they can understand.  It specifically says in the regulation that it must be in plain English in a very small number of pages.</p></speech>

In his presentation, Mr. Gilvarry said that "the ESMA will be given responsibility for the authorisation and supervision of certain types of investment funds structures - European venture capital funds, European social entrepreneurship funds and European long-term investment funds".  I am seeking clarification with regard to so-called investment funds that are investing in Ireland.  They are known by the ordinary person on the street as "vulture funds".  The regulation of such funds happens by means of the regulation of their agents which are operating in Ireland.  Does that fall in under this ambit?  Is that what we are talking about here or is it something completely different?</p></speech>

I ask the Senator to correct me if I am wrong in my understanding of what he is saying.  If an investment fund buys a portfolio of mortgages, it is separate.  For example, EuSEFs involve social entrepreneurship.  I accept that EuVECAs involve venture capital.  They are very restricted in their frameworks.  Our requirement to have a servicer within the State would not be affected.  That is separate.</p></speech>

My understanding is that from a funds perspective, the fund could be outside this jurisdiction.  The fund could be in Belgium, France or the UK.  I do not know whether it could be outside the Union.  Potentially, it could be in the US, which would mean it would not be caught by the competent authority here.  My understanding is that in such circumstances, the servicer would be caught here.  I am not very heavily involved in this area.  I know that a fund does not need to be in this jurisdiction to be investing in Irish assets or Irish-domiciled assets.  That could be the reason the servicer is caught.</p></speech>

If they were collective investment undertakings and they were established in Ireland, they would probably be regulated by the Central Bank under investment fund legislation, or their managers would have to be subject to our regulation.  If they are outside Ireland and investing into Irish assets, they will not come under the scope of the legislative and regulator framework.</p></speech>

The Bulgarian Presidency has announced two meetings in January.  As I said earlier, very few member states are in favour of this proposal.  The question of how far it goes will need to be revisited.  Along with other member states, we have called for a step back to be taken in this regard.  We need to look at whether targeted amendments can be introduced.  We have not yet mentioned today that there will be changes to the European Systemic Risk Board.  Those uncontroversial and very targeted changes will move much more quickly.  It is possible that those changes will be made within the European Council in the coming months.  It is like asking how long is a piece of string.

I have been in and out of this meeting to vote in the Seanad, so I am not sure whether some of the questions I intend to ask have been asked.  Why does the departure of the UK from the EU mean that some of these changes and new measures need to be introduced?  Why would it have such a big impact on the financial business of Europe?  When one of the 28 member states leaves, would it not just be a matter of downsizing everything?</p></speech>

The point the Commission is making in this regard is that due to the large number of entities moving out of London and looking to set up subsidiaries or other entities within the EU so they can continue to offer their services to their customers within the 27 remaining EU member states, there is significant concern about supervisory arbitrage, or people looking for jurisdictions with a lighter touch framework.  The Commission is saying the only way we can achieve supervisory convergence is by moving supervision of these entities to a centralised level within Europe.  The UK's departure from the EU is advancing that change by acting as a catalyst to force it to happen.  We are countering that by arguing that although the UK is leaving, we do not see why the existing tools - maybe with some modifications - cannot be used to ensure we do not have a situation where one jurisdiction has a light-touch regime and another jurisdiction has a hard-touch regime.  Rather than saying the only way to achieve this goal is to bring everything to Paris or Frankfurt, we are saying the existing powers can be used.</p></speech>

As Mr. Gilvarry has articulated, we will have a very large financial services centre right beside the EU but just outside it.  For that reason, over the past year a great deal of concern has been articulated about the risk that firms will pretend to be in Europe while actually being in the UK, which could allow them to get around European rules.  One of the arguments that has been made is that we need to stop firms outsourcing outside Europe as a way of getting around European rules.  We would not agree with that.  From our perspective, it is important that outsourcing is done well and that there is substance in Europe and in the Irish jurisdiction.  Over the past three years, we have built a whole framework to ensure there is significant presence within the Irish jurisdiction in the case of the funds industry, for example.</p> <p>  The second aspect of this matter I would like to mention is that when the UK decided to leave the EU, the Commission and many other interests asked what the capital markets union would look like without the UK.  That galvanised lots of thinking about the possible need to create a more centralised supervisor as a counterpart to the UK authorities.  I understand that is part of the thinking behind some of the proposals to move powers to the ESMA.  We would say that the right route for this probably involves convergence under the current model rather than significant centralisation.</p></speech>

Is that what the Commission is basically afraid of?</p></speech>

It can just be different.  If we establish a body of rules as the way to protect consumers in Europe, and another jurisdiction decides to do the same thing differently, we will want to have a framework to work out whether the approach being taken in the other jurisdiction meets our standards and achieves the same outcomes.</p><p>So far we have had that third country regime with the equivalence assessments which have applied in respect of countries such as the US, but they are not as clear and present on our doorstep as is the UK.  That has caused people to consider how it works in that context.  It is a question of difference rather than light touch.</p></speech>

We provided a comprehensive written statement in advance, and in the interest of time I will not go through all of it but I will note some of the salient points.   First, as explained in the previous session, this package of measures is of significant concern given the potential impact on consumers, and on regulatory powers.  While there are elements of the proposals that we welcome there are several areas that are of significant concern.  Our association represents some 125 firms that collectively provide a range of services that enable savings.  They do this by offering them through regulated services.  In the process of providing these regulated services where we have investors using Irish funds from 70 countries, managers from 50 different countries providing expertise and the capital is being deployed around the world, there is an interaction and an interplay between local authorisation and supervision, which occurs by virtue of the Central Bank's activities.  The committee heard from it earlier.  It is also anchored in the European directives which facilitate EU market access, through passports and the ability to delegate activities and through equivalence and other requirements.  This interplay between the national competent authorities and the European supervisory authorities, ESMA in our case, works very well because both entities have significant pre-existing powers and its own governance.  This has all contributed to a long-standing ecosystem of regulatory and commercial activity.</p><p>It has been an outstanding success not only in an Irish and European context for over 25 years.  The funds industry employs over 14,000 people and has very compelling proof of Ireland's ability to both develop and scale specialist international financial services.  The ability to bring global expertise to investors is a topic that I will return to later in my comments.  </p><p> Clearly, we are also very significant supporters of the Government's commitment, through the IFS 2020 strategy, to develop employment in the whole area of financial services.  Separately, I have approached members of this committee to discuss the industry's long-standing request for legislative amendments in respect of the investment limited partnership legislation, which was agreed by the Government in July.  I know the proposals need to come to this committee for pre-legislative scrutiny, as a matter of priority, because the opportunity for employment is being squandered.  I wish to convey the good news that our clients want to do more business in Ireland.  We are uncompetitive in the area of investment limited partnerships at this point in time.  I apologise for my detour but given its key priority in my industry it would have been remiss of me to appear here this evening without mentioning the matter. </p><p> Both the Department of Finance and the Central Bank have talked about capital markets union and Brexit.  Both of the topics are interesting backdrops.  We, like others, are very strong supporters of the capital markets union.  The union, as well as being linked to a single and strong supervisory network, focuses on fostering stronger connections with global capital, helping to attract investment and also makes sure that the EU is competitive.  In that regard, we view some of the proposals in the ESA package as inconsistent and in sharp contrast with the idea of facilitating capital flow, particularly into the European Union, which badly needs same.</p><p> In addition, the disruption that may be brought about by Brexit is a topic that was discussed earlier today and I am sure will be the subject of many discussions here.  It is worth noting, particularly around some of the potential for the relocation of activities and how activities are overseen, that the European Securities and Markets Authority has issued a number of opinions specifically on this area.  It also created a supervisory convergence or co-ordination network earlier this year.  All of those things are welcome and serve to emphasise its existing powers.  Therefore, it is slightly surprising that just ten weeks after the opinions were supplied the Commission has made proposals that cover a lot of the same ground.  We welcome some aspects of the proposals but there are some pieces that have the potential to disrupt.  </p><p> We will confine our statements on the actual proposals to those aspects that are linked to the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA.  We believe there are great benefits to be gained from bringing down barriers to things like cross-border distribution and ensuring consistency in the application of rules.  When we consider these proposals overall we tend to consider them using the following three questions.  What is the likely impact on consumers and clients?  How do the proposals improve the functioning of the market?  What is the evidence that supports the changes proposed?  It is clear from each question that it is not in any way certain or obvious that there is anything other than potential risks to consumer choice, that there is scant evidence of anything that might compromise what is already a very well functioning, successful and globally recognised system for deploying capital through investment funds.  </p><p> In terms of the additional powers that exist, the Central Bank and the Department of Finance referred to the areas of both  delegation and outsourcing and the direct authorisation of investment funds.  I will briefly deal with each of them.  My industry delivers a wide range of regulated investment fund products, very much through the existence of delegation and outsourcing arrangements.  That means we have different types of investment managers who employ various types of operating models and investment expertise.  They are based in different parts of the world but submit themselves to EU regulation, authorisation and product rules in order to deliver those capabilities to the end customer.  The fact that these types of arrangements are in place has been a key contributor to the success of undertakings for the collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, and, more recently, alternative investment funds, that were referenced earlier.  Delegation has worked extremely well historically and has been central in making UCITS, Europe and Ireland part of a very big global success story.  It is a key to ensuring that EU investors can access the best international expertise and that capital can come into Europe.</p><p> The proposal, particularly as it relates to delegation and outsourcing, envisages an enhanced role for the ESMA.  Specifically, all of the existing third country outsourcing, delegation and risk transfer arrangements, that might be pursued by member states,  would need to be assessed and approved by the ESMA.  It is important to note that there is an existing EU legislative framework that has robust standards in place for delegation and outsourcing whether it is internally or to third countries.  Therefore, we believe that the proposals for delegation and outsourcing would lead to a more bureaucratic, costly and inefficient process and  lengthen the time it takes to bring to market European fund products.  There is lack of evidence of any market failure, which must be a key hurdle in terms of the proposals to introduce new measures.  In addition, we believe there is less regulatory certainty under what is proposed.  We also believe it would send a negative message across the globe about the openness of the European industry, particularly at a time when the Commission's capital markets union initiative seeks to attract global capital.</p><p> In addition to the burden, a centralised review of delegation and outsourcing arrangements could have a negative impact on the diversity of arrangements that have served investors and industry well for the past 25 years.  The approaches taken to delegation and outsourcing, which operate within the associated EU and local rules, have developed over time via extensive consultation and scrutiny by the Central Bank of Ireland.  We believe that has led to a robust system that has investor protection as a core principle.  Earlier members here asked questions about investor protection.  I can reassure them that investor protection is imbedded in many of our structures.  </p><p> From our perspective, ensuring that the best funds expertise globally is available to investors and delivered via delegation and outsourcing arrangements has been key to the success of the European industry.  From an Irish perspective, the European market access that we offer to global asset managers is a fundamental part of the success that has resulted in us employing 14,000 people in 15 different counties around the country.</p><p> In terms of powers that we would draw the committee's attention to, and that were commented about earlier, is the question about direct authorisation for certain types of fund products.  I will name them and give the acronym.  The European long-term investment fund, EULTIF, the European social entrepreneurship fund, EUSEF, and the European venture capital fund, EUVECA.  The reason we have a particular concern about this matter is that it would move the direct authorisation and supervision of certain investment funds away from the model that is currently in place and operates with ease, efficiency and certainty. </p><p> The package proposed in terms of the authorisation of these products would set a precedent by creating a dual regulatory regime.  For example, the ESMA would be the authorising entity for a European LTIF whereas the Central Bank of Ireland would be the authorising entity for the manager providing those services under the alternative investment fund manager's directive.  Clearly, there is a consequential uncertainty as to which regulatory regime should prevail, particularly in the case of investor detriment.  A dual regulatory regime for these types of investment funds would undoubtedly lead to a more complex, cumbersome and expensive fund authorisation and supervision process.  Clearly, when one reflects on the 25 years that we have been involved in the authorisation and the supervision of funds, it would also require the ESMA centrally to accumulate all of the knowledge of local market prices and local conventions, and the investor protection mechanisms that exist nationally.  It appears to us to be cumbersome and duplicative in terms of effort.  We believe that the current system of supervision by national competent authorities, and in our case it would be the Central Bank of Ireland, are best suited to deal with these structures.  </p><p> Much has been said about governance and accountability and we have commented on the subject in our written statements.  We have always believed that while ESAs should be nimble and capable of efficient action, a balance must be struck between ESAs and the ability of the national competent authorities.  NCAs are answerable to their national parliaments and local investors.</p><p>There is a legitimate concern, as expressed during the earlier questioning, around what is the nature of the representation.  It is our view that some of the resistance and negative feedback on the proposals to date is around a concern about the lack of representational views by member states.</p><p> I will now move on to the funding question.  It is absolutely the case that post the financial crisis there has been a build-up in financial services regulation and supervision.  It created a real up-scaling in resources, including in the Central Bank of Ireland, over a number of years that was funded by consumers and industry.  We have no issue with that.  The proposals that are contained here suggest a recreating of this centrally in the ESMA, where we have already had significant ramping up.  I also point to the fact that there is very little in the way of justification or detail regarding costs for these proposals.  We would not endorse altering the current funding model.  We believe that a reduction in EU funding potentially erodes the ESMA's accountability to the European institutions.</p><p> Much of what I have spoken about is concentrated on what we do not like about the proposals but - as I said earlier - there are elements we support.  Clearly, the provision of information that would allow direct collection of information by the ESMA, which would incorporate the forwarding of data from the national competent authorities, would lay the foundations for common EU data reporting.  With regard to some of the questions that were asked earlier, one of the methods by which one can assess what action might be needed from a regulatory or supervisory point of view is on the basis of the data that is actually available.  The proposals would also support common data standards and comparability, and reduce costs also for all in the market.  We also support greater use of open public consultations on guidelines and on recommendations.  Ultimately, anything that enhances the practical use of the guidance that is available in the ESMA's existing opinions and in their questions and answers would be helpful.  A national competent authority should be able to consult with stakeholders alongside the consultation that the ESMA does.</p><p> Well-meaning as the proposals are in terms of greater cohesion, we believe the package underestimates and ignores the fact that we have a very well-functioning market for cross-border funds.  We have concerns about duplication of existing powers and the potential for confusion as to who exactly has the final ownership and responsibility in the existence of a problem.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to present to the committee.  I am happy to take any questions that members may have.</p></speech>

In his summary I believe he has answered what I wanted to ask.  It seems that the Irish funds industry would not be entirely happy with the status quo of fund regulation at a European level.  What changes would the association like to see?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.429" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Lardner" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017112800002#O00300"><p>I thank the Deputy for the question.  The Commission is undertaking a number of measures that are in play at the moment, which are very positive.  One of the things we have been great advocates for is looking at how we bring down the barriers to enable the cross-border distribution of product.  I will explain what that means.  The funds industry believes that broad choice of product encourages competition and encourages the reduction of costs.  The Commission has been working on how, at a national level, we can bring down the barriers to allow that type of product choice to come in to the market.  That is one practical example.</p> <p>  Earlier, reference was made by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank representatives to regulation.  We have seen a continuous process of regulatory updating and adding to the corpus of regulation that exists.  It is part of what we do as it is a regulated business.  From our perspective, we want to make sure that entities are appropriately regulated, and we believe they are.  We also want to ensure there is the ability to get good solutions in to investors' hands so they can save for retirement and age care.  We want to try to do this in a way that reduces as much friction and duplication as possible.  Ultimately, in providing services and in providing for compliance with regulation, there are costs.  We want to make sure there is appropriate protection, but done in a way that is sensible for investors and the providers of services to the investors.</p></speech>

On the funding mechanism, Mr. Lardner spoke of the proposal altering the current funding model, which is the 40%-60% split.  Will Mr. Lardner explain to the committee the current funding model and where is the 40% and the 60%?  I take it that 40% comes from the EU budget, and 60% is from other sources.  Is that from member states?</p></speech>

The proposals suggest a capping of the EU element - the 40% - but that becomes a balancing figure.

It makes an assumption that whatever funding might go centrally to Europe would then cease to be paid locally.  Again, as has been explained, there is a movement of some powers.  Clearly, there are entities that are authorised in Ireland and there is a responsibility on behalf of the local regulator, to Parliament and to local investors.  It is outside my direct area of knowledge and the bank probably has a better understanding of that aspect.  We have no question or comment on the fact that the industry should be involved in funding the regulator - that is not the point.  The question is that in all cases there should be an element of who provides scrutiny and oversight of how that spending occurs and if there is an element of disconnect.  With these proposals, one step is being, effectively, removed.  This is one step back to the industry in lots of countries.  It is about central power and who is actually looking at it.  I believe there should be appropriate oversight, as with most things.</p></speech>

To be clear about the layering and the order of magnitude, we have more significant concerns around the issues of delegation, outsourcing and governance, which I believe has been the topic of most of the discussion.</p><p>We mention funding because in the absence of seeing evidence of how that works, it is reasonable for us to raise a question about it.  There is a 183-page impact assessment that went with the proposal but there is very little detail around how the mechanisms will work, hence our raising it in our comments on the proposals.</p></speech>

We do not have any issue with funding regulation.  We think, though, that there are multiple stakeholders in that regulation, not just industry.  The Government is a stakeholder in it, on behalf of its citizens.  In responses to industry and Central Bank consultations on this, we have not objected to higher levels of funding.  We tend to like to see two things.  The first of these is that all stakeholders retain a level of supervision and accountability, "skin in the game", for want of a better expression.  With the move to increase funding, we also believe that there should be appropriate scrutiny of the types of services and service levels provided, as would anyone who pays for, or contributes to the cost of a service.</p></speech>

The first point is that the size of the assets that are in the funds reflects assets that are deployed all over the world.  They are invested in global stock markets and bond markets all over the world.  I would not equate the value of money in the funds with the amount of supervisory oversight.  For example, a fund could invest in money market instruments, which are cash or cash-like and bear very little market risk, but could be quite sizeable by quantum of assets.  The approach that the Central Bank takes is a prism whereby it risk-weights entities, and the extent to which regulatory time must be devoted to supervision and oversight is reflected in what is paid in regulatory fees.  One cannot make a simple one-to-one or linear relationship between the quantum in a fund and the amount of effort that is required to supervise it.  That also applies to an entity, for that matter.</p></speech>

I am making the comparison between the net assets, whether of Irish-domiciled funds or otherwise, which make up about half of all the funds in the State, and the amount of tax they pay.  One of Ireland's big attractions for the fund industry, which has gone from assets of about &euro;600 million in 2006 up to about &euro;4.4 billion, is the tax structure.  We also have good services for the fund industry.  We have bespoke legislation, which the Irish Government are willing to facilitate.  We have flexibility on regulation from the Central Bank, which goes to the heart of the issue that we are talking about.</p> <p>  One of my big concerns is the risk that this causes.  The trajectory here is going in one direction, and going in one direction fast.  I am not sure how much more ambitious the State can be on the size of administered funds that we are likely to have.  However, there is obviously a risk with that.  I believe in the idea of a national competent authority regulating the industry, but I also know how that has failed abysmally in the past.  When the media talked about the "wild west", they were not talking about Anglo Irish Bank or AIB, but about insurance companies in the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC.  Nobody really pays much attention to that part, and that is where the label came from.  Does this proposal not make the industry which Mr. Lardner represents less competitive?</p></speech>

At this stage, Ireland represents about 14.6% of European fund assets, and a little bit less than 5% of global fund assets.  We are significant, and thankfully, due to a number of the aspects that Deputy Doherty outlined, we have been competitive.  However, it is important to say that the funds industry and investment in funds generally have been growing at a strong rate globally.  For example, this year alone we have seen over &euro;600 billion worth of additional monies coming into European funds, not funds in Ireland.  That is because of two things.  The first of those is people's need to provide savings.  A Deputy referenced the move from defined-benefit to defined-contribution schemes.  Clearly, people are making more provision for their own retirement.  I would not want the committee to think that the upward trajectory of growth that we are experiencing is something different, or-----</p></speech>

The yearly figures were  8%, 18%, 8%, 22%, 13%, 9% and 9%.  I presume that is well above the European average over the same period.</p></speech>

We are talking about deploying money into risk capital markets.  Clearly, there is risk involved.  However, to be clear, the risks that exist here are not the type of risks that exist within the banking sector, because the money here is not sitting on the balance sheet of an entity.  It is held in trust separately, for clients, under rules around deposits and oversight of that money.  That is not to say there is not investment risk in those monies.  There is clearly investment risk.  However, on the point raised by the Department of Finance officials about investment disclosure, etc., those are all parts of European regulation.  I would not want in any way to characterise the types of risks that might be perceived around the banking industry-----</p></speech>

That is fair, and that leads on to the point that Mr. Cross of the Central Bank of Ireland was making.  Both the Financial Stability Board, established by the G20, and the International Organization of Securities Commissions, IOSCO, have looked at the question of whether there are systemic risks or vulnerabilities associated with the asset management industry, which is a part obviously of what we do.  They have not seen it as systemically risky in the way that one might see other sectors, but they are focusing on particular issues.  They focused on questions about the liquidity of funds.  How liquid are they are if one needs to take one's money out?  They examined the extent to which things like leverage might be used.  Clearly, there are risks which are incorporated within global, European and local supervision, and that is where we participate very actively, to make sure we provide the information.</p> <p>  The Deputy's last point raised a question about the extent to which the proposals make our industry less competitive or otherwise.  Our primary problem with some of these proposals is that the orderly function of the market is one of the responsibilities of the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA.  We already have a functioning market.  We do not see any evidence provided in the proposals that suggests there is a lack of function, or a problem requiring some of the changes required.  That is our primary objective.</p><p> If some of these proposals come through there might be less choice for investors in Europe around product, which is a bad outcome.  It would also not be as easy to provide access to European investors, which is one of the reasons companies decide to locate funds in Ireland and other places.  That would have a detrimental impact.  However, we are not, in our comments on this, separating the fact that it would disrupt what is already a functioning market, distort investor choice, reduce competition and increase costs in the absence of significant evidence otherwise.  That is the basis for our approach to this particular issue.  Anything which impacts on the European funds industry generally, given the growth rates outlined, clearly impacts on us as well.</p></speech>

Did the witness's association lobby the Minister on the dividend withholding tax exemption for capital gains tax, CGT, the five year rule, last year when it was brought in?  Did it lobby for the changes made in this year's Finance Bill?</p></speech>

When the question of the IREF came up, we did not want to see anything that would discourage managers and providers of investment product investing anywhere in the world that was starting to see taxation or inappropriate leakage of return to investors.  We made representations.  They were made to ensure that the funds industry would not be damaged.  Well over 90% of all assets in Irish domiciled funds have nothing to do with investment in this country.  We are not making a virtue of that in itself, but it speaks to the whole point of what the cross-border funds industry is, which is to connect global investment managers with a range of global investors who want to deploy capital globally.  Some of that money may find its way to Ireland.  Well in excess of 90% of the assets of Irish domiciled funds that are sold on a cross-border basis invest globally.  I am sorry that I cannot be more specific.</p></speech>

I am talking about the couple of billion that is in Ireland, particularly the money connected to property.  The first lesson in taxation is that property should be taxed in the jurisdiction it is in.  However, the structures the Irish fund industry has been able to carve out for itself meant that this was not being taxed at all because of the qualified investor-alternative investment funds.  When the new entity was set up we had an exemption from dividend withholding tax on the basis of holding the asset for five years or more.  I am interested in whether the association lobbied for that exemption last year.</p></speech>

I am happy to come back and clarify.  The focus of our interaction with officials around that was to ensure that nothing would be done to jeopardise what is a much broader industry that is not focused on investing in Ireland and which employs 14,000 to 15,000 people in many counties, towns and constituencies around the country.  That was one of our concerns.</p> <p>  The Deputy made a point about our growth rates earlier.  Ireland has spent 25 very productive, appropriate and responsible years building up an industry which is rightly the envy of many places.  It is not easy, it is just that we are very good at it.  We would always be concerned, in terms of our members and the contribution back into the economy and society here, that having built the industry so well for 25 years we do not inadvertently - or otherwise - cause damage to it .  The industry is something which is not only a national jewel for us in financial services.  Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities, UCITS, is a creation of the European Union, but UCITS funds are sold right around the world.  There are relatively few areas across the European Union where there is a global brand such as UCITS.  At the very time when the European Union is trying to attract capital into its borders for various things, why would it do anything which could complicate, confuse or frustrate the ability to build on this very big European success?</p></speech>

The uncertainty is how financial services or product providers can access the European markets.  The very fact that uncertainty exists is causing organisations and entities to re-look at how they structure themselves and how those services are delivered.  That inevitably is providing opportunity, but there is also risk.  Many Irish domiciled funds are sold into the United Kingdom and many UK based investment managers provide investment expertise to Irish funds.  We have advocated strongly, both to Government and the Central Bank and they are well aware, from their own statistics collected from authorised entities, of the extent of this.  It is important that there is a continued ability to distribute Irish domiciled funds into the UK, because it is a big investor market, and that there is the continued ability to delegate - which is the subject of these proposals - not only to the UK but also to third countries.</p></speech>

An Asia-based manager or US-based manager may be used instead.  The whole idea is that delegation is used so that the right expertise can be used.</p> <p>  We have been very active in our promotional activity.  We have done over 30 events around the world this year.  The investment limited partnership legislation is key, not only to firms in Limerick but also around the country, because a lot of investment goes through English investment limited partnerships, and we foresee that if we can get our own legislation updated - we are very happy to work with this committee and Government to help do that - it would improve our toolkit and mean that we can hopefully ensure more activity and more employment.</p></speech>

As members are aware, a review of Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax code was announced by the Government on 2 September 2016.  On 11 October, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, set out the terms of reference and announced my appointment to undertake the review.  It was delivered to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on 30 June 2017 and published on 12 September.  The terms of reference of the review encompassed meeting international standards for tax transparency, ensuring that the corporation tax code does not provide preferential treatment to any taxpayer, implementing Ireland&rsquo;s commitments under the OECD&rsquo;s base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, project and various EU tax directives, delivering tax certainty for business and maintaining the competitiveness of Ireland&rsquo;s corporation tax offering.  During Committee Stage of the Finance Act 2016, several members of this Committee raised the matter of the role and sustainability of corporation tax receipts and that was added to the terms of reference of the review.</p> <p>  As regards tax transparency, Ireland was subject to a global forum peer review in 2010 facilitated by the OECD.  Ireland was one of 16 jurisdictions to receive a rating of compliant, which is the highest rating achievable.  In August of this year, the global forum published its peer review report for Ireland as part of the second round of reviews, which are assessed against enhanced standards.  Again, Ireland received the highest rating achievable - compliant.  However, it should take account of the recommendations of the peer review.</p> <p>  As regards preferential treatment, the criteria applied by both the OECD forum on harmful tax practices and the EU code of conduct for business taxation to identify a potentially harmful tax regime provide the internationally accepted criteria for identifying whether features of the tax code constitute harmful tax competition.  Any proposed measures to be introduced for Ireland's corporation tax code should be carefully scrutinised to ensure that they do not constitute a potentially harmful preferential tax regime.</p> <p>  In terms of transfer pricing, Ireland is required to legislate to apply the 2017 OECD transfer pricing guidelines in domestic legislation and it may, therefore, be timely to consider additional changes that may be made to Ireland&rsquo;s domestic transfer pricing rules.  At present, Ireland&rsquo;s position in the global value chain of multinational enterprises, MNEs, in sectors which rely heavily on intellectual property, IP, is such that large amounts of royalties are paid out of Ireland by MNE affiliates to members of the same group in other jurisdictions.  The recipient of the royalty payments receives a significant return relating to the ownership of the IP.  Where the recipient of the royalty payments does not perform the requisite DEMPE functions, which are the development, enhancement, maintenance, protection or exploitation of intellectual property, or control economically significant risks, the application of the OECD 2017 transfer pricing guidelines may result in the recipient of the royalty payments being attributed a return which only reflects the risk-free or risk-adjusted return with respect to the recipient&rsquo;s funding activities.  Assuming transfer pricing rules apply to all trading transactions, the introduction of the 2017 OECD transfer pricing guidelines may have the impact of adjusting the consideration payable, which is the outbound royalty, downwards, having regard to the DEMPE functions and control of the associated risks by the recipient of the royalty payments.  Depending on the facts and circumstances, that could have a significant impact on MNEs operating in Ireland and the quantity of outbound royalty payments which are deductible for Irish tax purposes.</p> <p>  On transfer pricing, Ireland should provide for the application of the OECD 2017 transfer pricing guidelines incorporating BEPS actions 8, 9 and 10 in Irish legislation.  Domestic transfer pricing legislation should be applied to arrangements the terms of which were agreed before 1 July 2010.  Consideration should be given to extending transfer pricing rules to SMEs.  Consideration should be given to extending domestic transfer pricing rules to non-traded income where it would reduce the risk of aggressive tax planning.  Consideration should also be given to extending transfer pricing rules to capital transactions.  If it is decided to implement any or all of these recommendations on transfer pricing, that should take place no later than the end of 2020.</p> <p>  There are various components of the EU anti-tax avoidance directive that Ireland will have to transpose into domestic law over the coming years, including an interest limitation rule, anti-hybrid rules, the introduction of controlled foreign corporation rules, an exit tax and a general anti-avoidance rule.  Various deadlines have been set for those to be achieved and, in transposing them, Ireland should have regard to the recommendations of the reports on BEPS actions 2, 3 and 4.  The exit tax was proposed to provide that member states are in a position to tax the economic value of any capital gain created in their territory where the gain has not been realised at the time of the transfer out of the member state.  The anti-tax avoidance directive provides that member states must impose an exit tax on the transfer of an asset out of its territory, the chargeable basis of the tax being the market value of the transferred assets less their value for tax purposes.  The directive does not specify the calculation of the value of the assets for tax purposes or the rate of the exit tax but, rather, leaves discretion in those areas to member states.</p> <p>  During the public consultation, a number of stakeholders suggested moving Ireland's corporation tax base from a worldwide to a territorial base.  The difficulty of computing the credit for foreign income, in particular when income arises from multiple jurisdictions, was highlighted as a competitive disadvantage.  Schedule 24 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, which gives effect to the computation of the foreign credit, has been amended multiple times since 1997 in light of policy changes and to take account of judicial decisions.  Accordingly, the operation of the relief for foreign credit has become more complex, which is seen as a burden on business.  In the context of the introduction of the controlled foreign company rule provided by the anti-tax avoidance directive, consideration should be given to whether it is appropriate to move Ireland's corporate tax base to a territorial regime in respect of the income of the foreign branches of Irish-resident companies and, in respect of connected companies, the payment of foreign-source dividends. </p> <p>  An alternative to a territorial corporation tax base is to review schedule 24 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 with a view to effecting a policy and revenue-neutral simplification of the computation of the foreign tax credit for all forms of foreign income.  That would achieve the competitiveness advantages associated with moving to a territorial corporation tax base while avoiding the introduction of additional complexity to the corporation tax code by new anti-avoidance measures.</p> <p>  A number of submissions to the public consultation emphasised the importance of public consultation and stakeholder engagement in the design and implementation of tax legislation.  That can increase certainty for taxpayers and ensure that the views of all sections of the community are taken into account, including the views of NGOs active in developing countries.  It is recommended that a number of proposed changes suggested in the review are carried out subject to consultation to reduce uncertainty regarding the proposed changes and to better inform policy making.  To reduce uncertainty and ensure that Ireland protects its corporation tax base, Ireland should ensure an adequately resourced competent authority.</p> <p>  Several independent factors that arose together that contributed to the level shift increase in corporation tax receipts in 2015.  It is unlikely that any reversal of those factors would similarly coincide.  While that suggests that corporation tax receipts are sustainable at a new higher level, at least in the medium term to 2020, the inherent volatility of corporation tax receipts will remain and some of the factors that led to the 2015 level shift could unwind individually.  Given that uncertainty, we can never be sure of the sources and permanency of such revenues and it would be wise that policy should be suitably cautious in terms of introducing increases in spending or permanent reductions in taxation.</p> <p>  In order to ensure some smoothing of corporation tax revenues over time, the review recommended that the limitation on the quantum of relevant income against which capital allowances for intangible assets and any related interest expense may be deducted in a tax year be reduced to 80%.</p><p>This recommendation is being implemented via section 21 of the Finance Bill 2017.  I look forward to our discussion and hope I can address any questions on the review.</p></speech>

I will be very brief in light of the time.  Does the witness think that transfer pricing will lead to more revenues and, if so, how much?  Will it have a behavioural impact on our multinationals?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.509" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Coffey" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017112800002#S00400"><p>I am unsure on the impact it will have on revenue.  That will depend on the second element of the Deputy's question, the behavioural impact on the multinationals.  There is no doubt that it will change the practices of the multinationals.   One of the guiding principles of the whole BEPS process has been to have a greater alignment of profit and substance.  What many US multinationals, in particular, have been able to achieve is to have a large amount of their non-US profits routed to what are essentially cash box operations in small islands where they have no substance.  The rules propose that such cash box operations should only get a return based on the funding that they provide.  I refer to interest rates and return on capital, not on the actual profits the company generates, the substance of which happens elsewhere.  There is no doubt that the companies will adjust.  One change that we have seen some evidence of to date in Ireland is that they could move their intangible assets to Ireland simply because they already have the substance here.  That could lead to an increase in tax revenues in Ireland.  It will definitely lead to an increase in the gross profits declared in Ireland.  It could have knock-on positive consequences for revenue.  I do think a behavioural response will be seen.  The impact on revenue is less clear but it could be positive.</p></speech>

Mr. Coffey states in his summary that "given this uncertainty we can never be sure of the sources and permanency of such revenues and it would be wise that policy should be suitably cautious in terms of introducing increases in spending or permanent reductions in taxation".  How fast does the witness think that could all unwind?</p></speech>

I do not expect that we will see the set of events that came together in 2015 unwinding together.  However, they could unwind over time.  Corporation tax is the most volatile of our main taxes.  If a tax can rise by 50% in a given year, it shows the uncertainty that is there.  I think at least to 2020 it will remain at the higher level.  Depending on how international changes go that could be sustainable for longer.  We will see inherent volatility.  We have not seen a reduction in corporation tax receipts on an annual basis for a number of years.  I think that is unlikely to happen soon.  It will remain at the new higher level.  It is hard to identify.  I looked at the elements that led to the increase in 2015.  They were relatively broad, yet dominated by the multinationals.  It did not necessarily lead to an increase in concentration.  Our corporation tax receipts are concentrated but that did not increase in 2015.  It was spread across a number of companies and it was related to a number of different factors.  I do see risks there.  It is more a medium term risk.  It is unlikely that we will see a 50% drop in a single year, even though we did see a 50% rise.  Any return to the lower level would happen over time.</p></speech>

Does he see that as a good way forward?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.513" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Coffey" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017112800002#S00800"><p>Yes, there are various proposals on how Ireland could or should establish a rainy day fund.  I favour looking at the amount of corporation tax receipts we collect and setting a certain amount of that aside.  The contributions to the fund could be based on the corporation tax receipts.  I have a previous proposal that looked at setting aside 50% of the corporation tax that comes from the multinationals.  That would offer two things.  It would offer savings in future and if there was volatility at least half of it would be taken out by setting those revenues aside.  We cannot be guaranteed that these revenues would flow into the future.  When we do need them to achieve other economic objectives then the fund will be there.  I see advantages in looking at an annual budgetary process, stripping out some of the corporation tax receipts from the multinational sector and operating a balanced budget on the basis of what is left.  That is actually saving the money.</p> <p>  Previously, we had a savings fund in the last decade, the National Pension Reserve Fund.  The money was not necessarily taken out of the budgetary process.  A commitment was made to make contributions.  However, it all remained within the general Government sector.  The Government deficit and balance itself was calculated on the basis of spending money outside of the general Government.  I would take those funds out of the budgetary process and balance the Budget outside of that.  I made that proposal back in 2015 and there have been variations in the rainy day fund since.  The key issue is to consider what the rainy day fund is to achieve.  The proposal I outlined would be about treating the corporation tax receipts as a sort of temporary bonus, like some countries do with setting aside oil revenues.  Alternatively, a rainy day fund can be used for counter-cyclical purposes.  Money can be taken out of the economy when it is performing well.  It does look like the current proposal is going in that direction, if not to a huge degree.</p></speech>

None of us thought we would be here at this hour.  We thought we would be putting up our election posters in west Donegal.  I have a couple of questions.  I want to commend the witness in regard to his work and also in regard to the blog that he put up which teased out one of his proposals.  That is the 80% cap that has been enacted on budget day.  It allows for the intangible assets transferred here to remain within the 100% ceiling.  Has the witness concerns in regard to that?  I know from Mr. Coffey's blog that he estimated that if that provision did not exist in our Finance Bill, then we could potentially, based on a number of scenarios looking forward and looking back, achieve about an extra &euro;850 million in tax per year.  Is there any reason why that should not happen?  Would it not be retrospective taxation as some would claim?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.516" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Coffey" time="19:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017112800002#S01100"><p>No, I do not believe it is retrospective taxation.  It does not change the amount of capital allowances that are available.  The total quantum of capital allowances remains the same.  All that changes is the amount that can be claimed in future years.  That is limited to 80% of the taxable income that is earned.  It is not retrospective taxation.  More taxation is not being collected from the investment by reducing the limit because the amount of the capital allowance remains the same.  Those who would suggest that it is a retrospective change should be questioned as to why they think the tax would not be collected in the future.  A retrospective change would imply that more tax was being collected and when the capital allowances run out we would not be collecting the money.  In my view, the only way there can be a retrospective change is if more tax is being collected from the investment decision.  The internal rate of return on those investments remains the same, whether there is an 80% cap or a 100% cap.  If more tax is collected with the 80% cap it does suggest that the tax was not going to be collected when the capital allowances run out.</p></speech>

I agree with what Mr. Coffey said.  On this committee I have to question things that I do not agree with.  Would companies have taken their intellectual properties onshore based on 100%, which was the existing law at the time?  They took these corporate decisions based on the capital allowances that they believe would be available for them for them over the next number of years?  Would changing those rates not be seen as an act of bad faith from the State?</p></speech>

It would not change the overall amount of tax that should be paid.  There are companies who would have moved their intangible assets here before 2015 when the 80% cap last applied, albeit that the vast majority of the claims currently being made are for intangible assets that came post-2015.</p><p>The extent to which such a change is seen as being in bad faith is hard to determine.  The Deputy would have to ask the companies themselves that but the overall impact on their tax should not be huge.  It should be a matter of timing unless it is expected that the tax will not be paid when the capital allowances run out.</p></speech>

The change itself is not necessarily offering preferential treatment with regard to the regime.  The granting of capital allowances for acquisitions of intangibles is common across almost all tax regimes, particularly those that apply tax depreciation.  We looked at 27 of the 28 EU countries that offer it and the country that does not has a cash deduction system - an upfront deduction for the amount one spends.  The common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, has capital allowances for intangible assets and there is no cap on it.  The cap is a base protection measure.  Even at 100%, the cap offers protection that other countries will not necessarily have in place because we do not want a situation where if a company was to overpay for an asset and did not generate profits, if it still had the capital allowances, it could claim them every year and generate losses.  The treatment of losses in the tax code is different to the treatment of capital allowances because losses can be distributed around a group so if a company overpaid for an asset and did not have profits, those losses could be used to offset profits elsewhere.  The 100% cap prevents those losses from being generated.  It limits the capital allowances used to the amount of profit.  The cap itself is a base protection measure that some other countries may not have.  I do not see risks of state aid in general from the change from 80% to 100%.</p></speech>

If they both spend &euro;100 on an intangible asset under either cap, they are both entitled to claim &euro;100 of the capital allowance.  It is a reflection of the amount of expenditure the company incurs.  Regardless of whether the cap is 80% or 100%, the total capital allowance remains the same.  It is not offering preferential treatment with regard to the overall tax.  A year is just an arbitrary period we use to calculate tax.  Over the term of an investment, an 80% or 100% cap should not affect the overall amount of tax paid.  In general, I do not see a state aid risk.</p></speech>

If there are identical companies, one of which had brought the assets onshore prior to the recent change, it could offset its entire taxable income using capital allowances, whereas if a company does it now, it will be 80%.

The issue itself probably relates more to the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case because the regime has a provision to ensure, from our perspective, that capital allowances and expenditure are not incurred in any way towards tax avoidance and there is a specific provision in our legislation that looks at that.  One approach to state aid could be to see whether that specific provision in specific cases was applied correctly.</p></speech>

On a previous point with regard to applying the 80% for all intangible assets that have been onshored, how would that make it more reliable, for want of a better word, for our tax base?</p></speech>

With the 80% cap, one is ensuring that some amount of the gross profit is included in taxable income every year.  One is collecting some corporation tax in each year the asset is here and each year it is generating a profit, whereas under the 100% cap, depending on the way the profits go, one could end up with a position where very little tax is collected on an ongoing basis because the capital allowances almost fully offset the profits.  One then faces a big jump.  As long as the asset remains and the profit remains, one goes from having maybe all of it being offset by the capital allowance to very little.  If one had a cap at a certain level, each year some corporation tax would be collected, and then if there is a jump at the end, it would be at a lower level, because there would be a move from having some profit in taxable income to having a greater amount, but at least there is some to begin with.  It reduces the volatility of corporation tax which, as I said earlier, is our most volatile main tax.  It would offer benefits.</p></speech>

I will not debate what is real and what is perceived but does Mr. Coffey believe the discussion on this change - which also coincided with the Paradise Papers, Apple's tax structure and <i>The New York Times</i>, for example, linking this change from 80% to 100% to it - has caused any reputational damage to the State?  Issues Ireland has been fast and loose with have been revisited.  It closed down the residency rule and has started to phase out the double Irish.  Have we brought more reputational damage on ourselves?  If that is the case, does Mr. Coffey believe there is any risk with regard to companies or corporations locating here?</p></speech>

I felt it had become an issue even before I started the review and I would have discussed it at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight in September 2016 about the likely increase we would see in the amount of capital allowances we claimed.  The data only came out perhaps seven or eight months later and even during the review, I felt it could possibly get a lot of attention before the review was published.  Even when the review was published, I was surprised it did not get a significant amount of attention, given the scale of the increases and the potential amount of tax revenue involved.  Everything needs a hook to grasp that attention and the stories published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists offer that hook.  It provided some focus on the issue.</p> <p>  The question of reputational damage also arose around the time of the Apple state aid case.  We have not seen companies viewing Ireland in a negative fashion and not wanting to invest here because of the spotlight on Ireland.  The foreign direct investment and employment continues to increase.  We seem to be in a sweet spot at present.  We are getting investment in physical goods.  I know we have the intangibles but we are also getting investment in physical goods, the plant and the machinery.  We are now also getting the corporation tax receipts.  We cannot be sure how long that sweet spot will last but I do not think, with regard to investment decisions companies are making, that we are seeing knock-on reputational damage in a negative sense because investment continues to flow.</p></speech>

I questioned Mr. Coffey on the day he published his report on intangible assets but it did not get much traction because that hook is needed.  I have a question about Mr. Coffey's recommendation on consideration to extending domestic transfer pricing rules to non-trading income where it would reduce the risk of aggressive tax planning.  Will Mr. Coffey talk to the committee about what he means by that or what aggressive tax arrangements regarding non-trading income these domestic transfer pricing rules could deal with?  Is he familiar with or aware of any structures or schemes being used for Irish non-trading income?</p></speech>

If one looks at the Irish data on the balance of payments received, there was a substantial increase in lending both in and out of Ireland, running to hundreds of billions of euro in recent years, but we are not seeing a change in interest flows.  It suggests, to a certain extent, that many of these are interest free loans that have been set up because transfer pricing rules do not apply to these non-trading transactions.</p><p>It seems these loans are being set up because transfer pricing rules do not apply to these non-trading transactions.  The scale of it is now quite large and it runs into hundreds of billions.  That is the impact of it.</p><p> It is hard to know what companies are undertaking because there is not much visibility about it.  There is a suggestion that it is possibly related to the activities of some of the so-called inverted companies that have set up headquarters in Ireland in recent years, simply because they are of the size and on the scale of companies involved.  One consequence of applying transfer pricing to non-traded income arises.  There are legitimate reasons for companies to loan between each other.  It may not be the case at present that they do that on an interest-free basis.  If we start applying transfer pricing rules and companies have to start charging interest, the company collecting the interest will be a non-trading entity.  It is a lending company and it may be subject to tax at 25%.  The company paying the interest would be a trading entity and would get at deduction of 12.5%.  Therefore, we could have a transaction happening wholly within a parent company that is getting a 12.5% deduction while the subsidiary paying the interest is paying tax at 25%.  That may be a concern for indigenous companies that have a cash company at their centre moving money from one entity to another.  I would advise caution on the move to apply transfer pricing rules to non-trading companies on that basis.  Given the scale and nature of the loans we are seeing in and out in Ireland, it is something worth considering.</p></speech>

The first relates to what is being proposed in Italy by way of flat-rate taxes on sales from digital and online advertising.  We know a group of countries is trying to move ahead with reform of taxation of the global giants.  Ireland is resisting that because we are the beneficiary of taxes from Google and Facebook.</p> <p>  If I understand it properly, Italy is proposing that when a company buys an advertisement from Facebook or Google, a flat-rate tax will apply.  It will amount to approximately 6% of the value of the sale.  That amount will be withheld and paid to the Italian authorities.  We know that the likes of France and Germany are looking at similar legislation.</p> <p>  I realise it is only one part of the picture, but it is a sizable part because it relates to the tech industry.  Does that threaten in any way the sustainability of our tax base?  If we cannot get that type of movement or co-operation in Europe, then individual countries can start introducing a withholding tax, which is what Italy is looking at and what other member states could possibly do.  Therefore, the attractiveness of what we offer would somewhat diminish.  Does Mr. Coffey have any concerns in that regard?</p></speech>

Maybe as the proposals are fleshed out we might get to see what the countries envisage.  One key difference is that it appears to be some sort of turnover tax rather than a profits tax.  It may be another layer of taxation that is different to what is in force for profits at present.  The legality of some of these proposals may be subject to question, especially for sales within the EU.  Various EU directives prevent the charging of withholding taxes on flows between EU member states.  Maybe the royalties directive could be changed.  At present, withholding tax could not be charged on those transactions.</p> <p>  To what extent would it have an impact on Ireland?  It could potentially be significant but it is very difficult to say.  How does this relate to our overall corporation tax and corporation tax base?  The information and communications technology companies do not make up the most substantial proportion of our corporate tax base.  Far more important for us is the manufacturing sector.  The foreign direct investment sector is the largest source of our tax base and the largest source of tax revenue.  The largest individual sector that pays corporation tax is now the financial sector.  The financial sector has surpassed manufacturing as the largest sector, with the ICT sector placed third.</p> <p>  I am unsure of the impact on or of the behavioural response of these companies.  Currently, they have central trading companies set up in Ireland that operate their sales through all their various markets.  Would a turnover tax along the lines suggested limit the impact of these?  I am unsure how the companies would respond.  It is an issue and something that we should be concerned about, but I would find it difficult to quantify the impact and to predict the behavioural response of the companies.  At the outset I would question the legality, especially for intra-EU transactions, of introducing such turnover taxes.  If there is agreement at EU level to change some of the directives, they could be implemented.</p></speech>

One of the members of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists mentioned by Mr. Coffey is the journalist Simon Bowers.  He was before the European Parliament today.  He gave testimony on "many references by corporations in the data included in the Paradise Papers to using the Single Malt as a possible workaround to the phaseout of the Double Irish".  It has been named the "single malt".  The structure has been known about but there has not been much traction with the name.  Perhaps we need to start giving these tax avoidance schemes fancier names to get some traction for them.</p> <p>  First, it is an issue in terms of Irish legislation and how our tax law interacts with other legislation.  It causes serious reputational damage to the State as well.  It should not be happening.  Does Mr. Coffey have any concerns in respect of this type of tax avoidance scheme?  It is a matter between ourselves and Malta but it could equally apply between ourselves and several other jurisdictions.  It need not necessarily be Malta.  What can be done to tackle it?</p> <p>  I am unsure whether it was the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform who said to me last week that he was going to start to look to see whether this was being used.  We all know it has been used for some time.  Does Mr. Coffey have any concerns or views on the matter?</p></speech>

Previously, I commented on not referencing the Deputy's raising of the intangibles issue.  Deputy Doherty's party has raised the issue of using Malta for similar structures in various fora.  I will offer a general comment.  When the double-Irish was being discussed, it was frequently said that it was not a provision of Irish tax law and that Ireland could not change it on a unilateral basis.  I tended to agree with that.  It is not a surprise to find other countries outside the tax havens in the Caribbean where it can be established or set up.  However, it is simply not a feature of Irish tax law.  It arises from the interaction between the tax codes from several jurisdictions.  Even if we were to change the arrangement with Malta, I imagine we could find other countries where similar tax outcomes could be achieved.  The key issue is the amount of tax that is levied at the destination.  If Malta chooses not to levy profits tax on intellectual property generated outside its jurisdiction, that is Malta's choice and I am unsure what we can do about it.  It is a Maltese decision not to levy tax on these profits.</p> <p>  What do we want Ireland to do?  We are looking at companies and their residence, which is a central part of this from the perspective of US companies.  However, the residence does not really matter.  The primary reason that US companies use subsidiaries registered in the same country is because in the US tax code there is a provision called the same-country exemption.  It means that if an organisation moves money between companies in the same country, it does not trigger the US tax payment but maintains the deferral.  However, if an organisation moves royalties between two companies registered in two different countries, that organisation is potentially liable to pay the US tax at 35%.  There is a plethora of ways an organising can generate the deferral, for example, the check-the-box and the look-through rules.  However, one issue with these is that they are temporary provisions of the US tax code and they are subject to a sunset clause - they could end.  In contrast, the same-country exemption is a permanent feature of the US tax code and would require a vote in the US Congress to change.  US companies go for two companies registered in the same country because of that.</p> <p>  The recent Amazon state aid case in Luxembourg featured a similar structure.  The two companies were registered in Luxembourg.  Money was flowing from one to the other.  Again, it was a decision taken in Luxembourg not to levy tax on the profits accumulated by the ultimate company.</p> <p>  Again, the single malt is something that has been achievable for years.  It was not introduced necessarily in Ireland.  In any event, it is a Maltese decision not to levy tax on those profits.  If a company was registered in Malta and carried out all its business in Ireland, where should it be resident?</p></speech>

If a company is registered in Malta, and does all its business in Ireland, where should it be tax resident?  We would want that company to be tax resident here.  If all it has in Malta is its registration and all its business is carried on here, we would want it to be subject to our tax rules, not theirs.  If we have a company that is registered here and does all its business there, we cannot be inconsistent about it.  That is what the tax treaty aims to achieve.  It addresses issues where there is a conflict between two countries claiming taxing rights over a company.  It is a common provision around the world that if two countries claim the tax residence of a company, the tie-breaker is the place of effective management and control.  Those rules are being reformed, in a sense, through the various base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, actions at the OECD.  Countries can now negotiate it on the facts of each company.  The Irish tax authority might be able to question it and look into it in a different fashion, but it will still come down to a tie-breaker, that is, where a company does its business.  As these companies do their business in Malta, we cannot be inconsistent about it.  Their operations are in Malta.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance then made changes to the residency rules and said he was shutting down the double Irish arrangement.  Those two statements cannot be true.  One of them has to be wrong.  Either it is not a provision of Ireland's tax code and we cannot change it, or the Minister can change something and say we are getting rid of it.  The Minister was wrong on one of those occasions.  I believe he was right to say we could not change it, because as we have seen, the structures still exist, and the single malt-----</p></speech>

The test of incorporation is the first base that companies use.  If a company is registered in Ireland and does all its business in France, the French authorities will first apply the test of incorporation.  However, if a company is registered in Ireland and does all its business in France, the French look to that company and say that it is resident in France because its place of effective management and control is there.  That is the tie-breaker between the two.  It is not the case that national authorities just use the test of incorporation.  They do use it.  However, if companies do all their business in those jurisdictions, they will seek to make those companies resident in those jurisdictions.  That is a standard feature right around the world.  I am sure there are hundreds of double tax treaties that have that provision at their heart.  One might say that the USA does not have this doctrine.  The USA is an outlier in some of these areas.  Most other countries would, however.</p></speech>

The OECD project is essentially about trying to align profits with substance.  One of the big difficulties concerns the US treatment of the transfer pricing.  Does the US tax US companies on the basis of what they do in the US jurisdiction?  The US has a different view of transfer pricing to most of the rest of the world and has very different views of transfer pricing than those proposed in the 2017 guidelines.</p></speech>

If a company effectively deals with the tax laws that are <i>in situ </i>at any point in time, it has not broken the law.  Is that a fair comment?</p></speech>

One of the issues here is that some of the laws and processes involved in taxing companies simply have not kept pace with the way companies have changed.  Transfer pricing emerged in the 1920s and 1930s.  The principles of residence have developed from case law and moved on to reflect incorporation.  The companies and their advisers are looking for gaps that they can fall through.  The BEPS project of aligning profit with substance will close an awful lot of those.  However, a problem will remain with US companies.  They will be able to attribute a large part of their non-US profit - their sales to non-US customers, whose location should not determine where tax is owing, as opposed to their non-US activities - to licence holders or companies that have intellectual property.  Those are companies that do not need substance.  Everybody else is trying to align profit with substance, and the US is not moving.  That is creating some of these problems.</p></speech>

With a lot of these companies, the problem is not that they pay no tax.  A lot of it is the question of where they pay the tax.  Should it be paid where the original activity is?  In the case of the US companies, that activity is the research and development that generates their intellectual property, that is, the brands and reputation.  Alternatively, should it be taxed where the customers are?  Traditionally, corporation tax has been paid where the activity is.  The US is not collecting a lot of that tax, so other countries wonder if they can collect it.  The companies themselves are paying significant amounts of tax.  The issue is around where it is being paid.</p></speech>

In the recommendations in his report, Mr. Coffey wrote:</p><blockquote>Although it is impossible to be definitive and the volatility in receipts will remain the level-shift increase in Corporation Tax receipts seen in 2015 can be expected to be sustainable over the medium term to 2020.</blockquote> <p>Why did he make that bold statement?

The year 2020 is when the current BEPS project is supposed to reach its conclusion.  That is when the OECD will try to assess the impact of it and see if they have achieved their goals.  At that point, we may see the move to a BEPS II, that is, a different project that tries to address further some of the problems that have arisen.  One of the unintended winners of the currently ongoing BEPS process is Ireland.  The level shift in corporation tax that we have seen could perhaps be attributed to some of the proposals that came out of the BEPS project.  Companies set themselves up in a different fashion to pay more tax in Ireland.  Again, this concerns changing the location where tax is paid.  If there is a subsequent change to the rules, maybe-----</p></speech>

In whose country are the profits located?  There is likely to be an increased incidence of such disputes.

We have a worldwide system that takes the income that Irish resident companies earn abroad and includes it in our tax base.  The issue is that for almost all of that income, the companies have paid tax at more than 12.5% so there is no additional tax due in Ireland.  It is a completely different situation from that prevailing in the US.  It has a 35% rate and a similar system so there would be substantial additional tax due.  There are certain issues around the size of the foreign tax credit being claimed.  There are also issues around companies that have low effective tax rates of 0% or close to zero.  A lot of those companies do not have substantial activities in Ireland and the income on which zero tax is being paid in Ireland is foreign income on which the companies have already paid tax.  We would not necessarily be losing revenue if we were to move to a territorial system.  However, we would have to be careful that companies did not move money out.  That is why-----</p></speech>

We have introduced some measures in this area but have not gone far enough.  It is one of the most significant ones because countries can determine that they will not apply transfer pricing to various types of transactions and we should broaden that.  That would be the key area.  A second one would be the measures in the anti-tax avoidance directive, the anti-hybrid, the interest limitation and the exit tax.  The last could be crucial for Ireland.  Given the amount of assets that are coming here, the design and rate of any exit tax would be important.  Another area is the CFC rules.  If we do choose to go to a territorial system, we want to ensure that companies have the right profits here and are not shifting profits offshore just to bring them back in and declare that they earned those profits abroad and do not owe any tax on them.</p></speech>

I think a worldwide regime does mean that one has certain protections and one does not need the CFC rules.  If we have a worldwide regime, then profits are taxed wherever they are earned.  If they are taxed at a lower rate than our 12.5%, when the company brings the profits back to Ireland, we can top the tax bill up.  The issue with the territorial system is that we are one of the few countries that maintain a worldwide regime.  Over recent years, several of the other countries that had worldwide regimes have moved to territorial systems because of the improvements in CFC legislation.  Now tax authorities can look at companies abroad and determine whether relationships are genuine or just being set up to move profits abroad.  I do not think it would make a huge difference.  Our worldwide regime possibly adds to our reputation because as soon as a company is resident here, it is taxable on its worldwide income.  However, it is down to the complexity of undertaking the foreign tax credit.</p></speech>

One is crossing the boundaries between the corporate profits tax and the income tax.  We have made some provisions in Ireland for start-up companies but the interaction between the corporate profits tax and the personal income tax is hard to track.  In Ireland, if one adds it up, the rates are towards the top.  A lot of that is driven by our relatively high rates of personal income tax.</p></speech>

The Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, CSNA, is the representative group for 1,500 stores with nearly 1,300 members throughout the country.  We were asked to enunciate in order of priority the areas of concern for our members.  In our submission we have listed the areas of greatest concern as being labour, energy, insurance, banking, commercial rates, compliance and security costs and carriage charges.  We have also outlined for the committee what we would like it to do.  </p> <p>  I will leave it at that to allow for more interaction.</p></speech>

They are very good supporters of their local communities, spending about &euro;41 million annually on sponsorship and donations.  It is a tough market and many are very concerned about the impact of Brexit.  While they think it is an unknown entity at present, there is an opportunity to tackle some of the increasing business costs.  We believe that making us lean, mean and ready to tackle the challenges Brexit will bring is the thing to do.  Much like the members of the Convenience Stores and Newsagents Association, the members of RGDATA have the same concerns.  We put particular emphasis on banking and shop insurance costs.  We believe there is a significant problem for our members with insurance premia which have been increasing for a typical convenience store from less than &euro;10,000 a few years ago to up to &euro;100,000 today.  The other concern is that our members must pay the first portion of any claim which could range from &euro;5,000 to &euro;10,000.  Some of our members have been subject to several claims from the same family, costing them up to &euro;100,000.  This is a significant and challenging problem which is causing great distress for individuals who are trying very hard to run businesses in towns and villages all over the country where the rise in economic activity has not reached them.  We have made some suggestions to the working group on insurance costs.  We will give the committee the list of our suggestions and obviously would like it to support some of the actions proposed.</p></speech>

We share the same concerns as the previous delegates.  The major concerns of 350 family owned businesses in the independent off-licence sector which provides 6.000 jobs are the increases in excise duty in the past few years which have been detrimental to our business.  We also see problems arising from Brexit.  We echo the concerns expressed by the other delegates about rates and so on.  We are different in that we totally endorse and hope to see full implementation of the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015.</p></speech>

Ms Buckley referred to banking charges.  The joint committee is doing quite a body of work on the cost of doing business.  We have already decided to hold a meeting in January with the banking federation and the banks as we are hearing a great deal about how difficult it is for some people to access finance and meet the associated costs.  We will continue into the new year our work on the cost of doing business.  In fairness, everybody is very anxious to see the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015 pass through the Houses and enacted as soon as possible.  </p> <p>  I invite Senator Kevin Humphreys to ask questions.</p></speech>

Many of the products we sell in the cash end have a low margin.  The transaction might notionally earn us 19 cent but we may be paying 25 cent or 30 cent for it.  If we take &euro;50, we give the bank 25 cent although we have only earned 19 cent for the transaction.  That is the Lotto transaction and things like that.</p> <p>  We dealt with the Central Bank and the financial ombudsman.  There were people and departments looking after the consumer end of things to ensure charges applied to them had to go through a series of mechanisms to get the nod.  A case had to be made.  In the commercial end of things it is far less transparent.  I suggest there is nobody in charge of setting the commercial rates.  Many of our members are paying enormous amounts of money - perhaps &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 per year - in cash lodgement charges.  We were able to obviate that somewhat with ATMs in stores but it is still a significant problem for people.  There are security elements that run with cash transactions as well.  I fail to see how lodging a &euro;200 note should attract a &euro;1.20 charge but if I hand in 40 &euro;5 notes all over the place in a plastic bag that people must sort out, it is the same &euro;1.20.  It does not seem to make sense.  We are talking about lodgements of &euro;10,000, &euro;20,000 or &euro;30,000.  Paying a multiple per &euro;100 is a really excessive cost.  I am very encouraged that the committee is homing in on banking as that part for the small retailer is a big draw.</p></speech>

Our real concern is that the people we would seek to protect us - the financial ombudsman, Central Bank or Financial Regulator - are not saying it is their job to do so.  There is a similar issue with credit cards.</p></speech>

Will the witnesses share any research they have done on the cost of cash lodgements in this country versus other countries?  Is there any independent research that can indicate the real cost of that to a bank?  In other words, is there an empirical approach that would indicate what it costs the bank to handle X, Y or Z?  It must be independent as we can all play games with figures.</p> <p>  There is a similar issue with the plastic card.  There is the correct questioning of how the costs of the card are arrived at.  We will not quote any infamous bankers but where was the figure plucked from?  How did it come about and where is the evidence base for it?  We would be very interested in that because, as the Chairman states, we are bringing in people from the banks.  The more information we have to challenge them with, the better we can take them to task for the charges being imposed on people.  As pointed out in the document, we all know they have become more remote and less inclined to have face-to-face interactions with customers.</p> <p>  I was informed by somebody near and dear to me that there is a policy in some banks to watch out for grey heads so they can be helped.  Everybody else would have to use the automatic machines.  On a serious note, this is a major cost to business and we would like to be able to challenge the banks.  When the committee has heard the evidence, perhaps we can make a case for an identifiable body to act as an arbiter on costs that should be levied on business by banks and financial institutions.  We will have people from credit unions in as well, whose charges are different.</p></speech>

The trouble was that the two main credit card companies ran rings around the Central Bank and the intention of the Minister when he put through a much better derogation in terms of interchange fees, where previously the vast majority of people were benefitting from contactless charge with a percentage rate on debit and credit cards, the companies changed the playing pitch.  Effectively, it became revenue-neutral for them.  We were very closely involved with the Central Bank and warned it about it.  It went through and in the six months following the alteration of interchange bank rates, consumers did not benefit and customers did not benefit.  The credit card companies were most certainly the beneficiaries of the changes.  That was a complete change from the policy enunciated on budget day by the Minister.</p></speech>

I was talking to the owner of quite a large business in my town of Mullingar, who employs 80 people.  He has gone back to paying his staff in cash as a means of getting rid of it.  That is dynamite stuff, as one can appreciate.  With any large amount of cash, perhaps &euro;10,000 or &euro;20,000, he has to get Securicor to come and collect it.  That is bank policy and it does not want to see him landing with much cash.  I can speak of my own experience working in a small business.  Guys with lodgements of between &euro;2,000 and &euro;6,000 or &euro;7,000 have to feed it into machines, which is crazy even from a security perspective.  It is for the birds and the banks must look at this differently or there will be problems.  Somebody will be held up or there will be problems down the line relating to where the cash goes and chances that people are taking.  I am sure the witnesses are coming across this.</p> <p>  I recently spoke with a vintner and the insurance matters were only really made clear at that stage yesterday.  He was paying &euro;3,000 for insurance and this went to &euro;7,000 last year.  He had one claim over ten years of &euro;23,000, with a &euro;3,000 excess that he paid.  This year the company wanted &euro;19,500.</p><p>He only had one claim in ten years.  Some of these insurance figures are being pulled out of the sky.  He got a quote somewhere else.  He is now paying approximately &euro;8,000.  It is hard to believe.  There seems to be no accountability with regard to insurance costs.  There has been a great deal of discussion about motor insurance.  We need to have a similar debate about insurance costs for business.  The way businesses are being treated by the banks is of relevance in that context.  The banks have a lack of staff and have absolutely no respect for business users.</p></speech>

I knew representatives of small retailers were coming before the committee today, so I made a few inquiries among people running similar businesses.</p></speech>

I have a small supermarket in Mountrath, County Laois.  We almost have to make an appointment to get into the only operational bank in the town.  The bank will not accept coins outside certain hours on certain days.  We cannot lodge money at the counter.  We have to put it into a machine.</p></speech>

When I brought a cheque for &euro;120 to the bank yesterday, it came up on the screen as &euro;7,000.  I thought it was great because I could go on my holidays.  It was up to me to regulate that.  The move to contactless payments, which Mr. Jennings has mentioned, means we are not generating cash.  Cash is still needed for ATMs, however.  It is a constant juggle.  The bank is of no use to us.  When the girl who usually does our lodgments was on holidays, I went to the bank to do it for the first time in approximately six months.  My business is not big, but relatively speaking it is one of the bigger businesses in our small town.  I do not know who the bank manager is.  If I need to get a loan or something like that, they will send me to Tullamore.  There is no sense that the bank is there to support us in our day-to-day banking or in the bigger things we need to do.  It is faceless.  Consumers sometimes ask us to take coins they have saved - their kids have emptied their money boxes, or whatever - because the banks will not let them in.  They will not take coins from people.  I choose not to go to the bank when I need coins because it costs a fortune-----</p></speech>

When I first went into business at home, a porter from the bank would bring the coins down for me.  The lack of security or policing in my town is a big issue when one is going to the bank.  I know I am being watched by certain elements in our small town.  Security is one of many issues raised by the bank being so inaccessible to me.  I am not always there, so I have to put a member of staff in peril by asking him or her to move cash.  It is no longer an asset to our business to have a bank in the town.  It is good that the committee is going to examine how banks can help us to run our small businesses and help to keep small businesses open in small towns.</p></speech>

At our first meeting, there was a huge emphasis on commercial rates.  We spent most of the meeting discussing that issue.  When I owned a small shop for 17 years, I was a proud member of RGDATA.  I compliment RGDATA, NOffLA and the CSNA.  It is nice for small independent shops that are not part of a chain like Centra or Spar to have the support of such organisations.  When one gets the circulars, one is informed about the various scams that are going on and one is kept up to date on what is happening.  It is nice for an independent shopkeeper to be part of an umbrella group.  I compliment the organisations on the work they are doing from this point of view.</p></speech>

The balancing act that is the annual budgeting process of local authorities is a bugbear of mine.  I refer to the manner in which the commercial stakeholders in a local authority area get fitted up so that the budget can be balanced.  What are the members of the representative groups saying?  What has been the associations' experience when they have spoken to county and city managers, who now have the illustrious title of "chief executive officers"?</p></speech>

I accept the point that I am still in business.  Even though I appealed it, I had to meet the cost of funding the increase in one go.  I am not really sure what I get for it.  My road is not swept.  I pay a private bin charge, a private glass collection charge and a private water charge.  I do not see any benefit from the commercial rates I pay.  The letter that arrives to tell me my rates are due is not particularly nice.  It usually comes with a statement in red clarifying that the rates are due in June or July.  There is no contact.  I cannot see anything that I get from the rates.  I cannot see where this money goes.  It is another cost to me.  I do not see this as a benefit anymore.  It is something I have to pay.  It is around my neck.  A percentage of my weekly turnover goes to fund this charge and another percentage is used to pay for the collection of glass and waste and for water utilities.  All of these services used to be provided from a single fee.  Our members find that the subject of rates is not a particularly nice one to think about or talk about.  The rates imposed in certain areas are more punitive than the rates imposed in the area where my business is.  The level of rates I pay was doubled in one fell swoop.  When I looked for some of my rates to be clawed back, all I got back was &euro;900.</p></speech>

We are looking at changing the system in this country.  Can the witnesses recommend a system that would work better for businesses while protecting local authorities, which need to know what they are getting into?  The revaluation process, which we have been discussing, has caused massive concern for a number of businesses.  Massive rate increases affected a number of businesses in County Limerick in 2014 or 2015.  In some instances, there were increases of over 100%.  What would be the best way to reform the system?  What type of rates system should we bring in?  What particular services should be delivered by local authorities in return for rates?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.647" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Vincent Jennings" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017112800002#E01300"><p>We cannot turn the clock back.  It is unlikely that the days when we paid local authorities for water and refuse collection will return.  The Deputy has asked what we would like, but it is not up to us to devise a system.  We can point out the inherent unfairness of the operation of the current system and the previous system.  The valuation system is based on rental values, having been designed to bring about a revenue-neutral situation, but it has enormous losers as well as winners.  We would like this committee to consider looking for statistics with regard to the five main pillars of commercial rates - retail, commercial parks, hotels, hospitality and offices - to ascertain which of the approximately 16 local authority areas in which valuations have been done have subsequently seen increases and which of them have seen reductions.  It is absolutely the case that hotel businesses which were probably paying a small fortune in rates previously are now the beneficiaries of the new system.  As the new system is revenue-neutral, and the local authorities have not been willing to give up a penny, they have had to find other money.  We have found that the retail sector, in particular, has been disproportionately targeted.  Rates are based on a rental value, but there is no real rental business.  Every one of us knows that between 20% and 33% of the spaces on our high streets are empty.  In many areas, rates are based on the Celtic tiger era.  When the Fingal area was first reviewed at the time when people were crashing, the rate that was agreed was based on 2003 figures.  There did not seem to be any ability to say that something was wrong.  The Valuation Office had to do it in a certain way because of what the legislation said.  We need to have legislation that is able to move with the times and respond when there are problems.  One of the biggest difficulties with the system was that it did not give individuals the ability to say in a truthful fashion that it was beyond their ability to make the payments demanded of them.  Many people who have no difficulty with paying rates are simply not making enough money to enable them to do so, perhaps because the towns they are based in have been bypassed.</p><p>Those are the issues that need to be addressed and legislation needs to be sufficiently fluid to allow for the changed circumstances of people and society.</p></speech>

Over the years we were promised that there would be a more shared burden of costs across the community when property tax was introduced.  It galls many retailers to see councils voting to reduce property tax by 15% while commercial rates are still increasing.  They would like to see the two tied together.</p> <p>  A bit like Mr. Redmond, we think that the system should not be such that a business owner who is probably struggling to keep the show on the road could be given a 50%, 60% or 70% increase in one year.  That is really difficult for business to handle.  Those are two of the issues we would like to see addressed in the new legislation.</p></speech>

My husband is involved in properties.  Since the Celtic tiger, fledgling indigenous businesses such as a dry cleaners or a small hairdressing salon would open up in the town.  They trade for eight, nine or ten months and build up their trade when suddenly they get the rates bill.  They had been trying to pay the rent and keep the business open and they think that they will not be able to pay this bill too.  However, they will struggle on and they might pay it for the first year.  The business is not there though.  It would be a good idea to incorporate in any new plan a breathing space for new fledgling businesses.  What happens then is the business closes and the unit becomes available.  Someone says they would like to open up a small business selling, for instance, children's toys, clothes, shoes, etc.  They do the business plan and see the rates and wonder what was last there and why it closed.  I know this personally.  People come to me and tell me that they cannot pay the rates because they also have to pay their electricity bills, labour costs, etc.  There has to be some sort of scope.  We will only get small businesses back into small towns if we make them viable.  The rental value of properties was mentioned.  In my street, 75% of the units are empty but my shop was given a big increase in its valuation.  We need to consider the possibility of having a breathing space for small new fledgling businesses.</p></speech>

These shops are becoming more sophisticated.  They come in at Hallowe'en time and Christmas time and absolutely suck all of the business out of that occasion.  We are there 52 weeks a year and are paying our rates, yet we get no facility from the local authority.  We make contact with it but these proprietors are not listed and walk away after a six-week period, leaving rates bills behind them.  However, they will have taken an enormous amount of money.  There needs to be a clear path for ratepayers to have direct access to the local authority to make them aware of this and for action to be taken.  We cannot deal with our customers in a high brow fashion, and we feel that we are customers of the local authority but we are not getting a hearing.</p></speech>

I am from Waterford.  When I was on the council a few years ago there were incentives by Waterford City Council to try to encourage new businesses.  It was quite constrained but there were some rates holidays for specific areas.  For the first year, there might have been a 12-month holiday, the second, six months and then something for the third year.  Some local authorities have tried to do that.  It is interesting to note that there is so much conversation about rates under the cost of doing business.  A person can look at his or her electricity bill and try to shop around for a slightly better rate or manage electricity use in the store or a person can try to negotiate a better price with whoever is collecting the rubbish.  However, with the rates, the bill comes in and that is it.  That is the issue I hear from people.  People can try to reduce other costs but they feel that they are trying to pay the rates bill but are not really getting anything back for it.  We have been hearing that through and through.  When I was in business, I felt the same.</p></speech>

However, our biggest pop-up shop competitor would be the below cost selling from the multiples which is sucking potential customers away from me and other businesses like mine.  They then do a VAT reclaim off the Exchequer.  We have a pop-up scenario but it is in a different format.  All of that impacts on our profitability, turnover and ability to meet our ongoing costs.</p></speech>

I have read some of the briefing documents that were circulated during the week.  A bugbear of mine since I was elected is the cost of insurance for businesses.  Whether it is motor insurance or otherwise, it has been absolutely astronomical, particularly for businesses.  Business owners are in fear of the insurance bill and increases of 20% or 30%.  Usually, when forecasting costs in a business, the forecast is based on inflation but increases in insurance have been nowhere near the inflation rate.  As the witnesses stated, it is not possible to plan ahead because business owners are waiting for the shock to come through and are wondering if it will end up closing their doors.  It has a knock-on effect on the business, particularly small business owners who have to grapple with the accounts, HR and staff as well as the actual core business function.</p><p>I was a sole trader working in sales consultancy.  Many plumbers or carpenters want just to do plumbing, etc.  It is not that they do not want to deal with the business-side of it but they are not <i>au fait</i>with it.  They are good at what it is they do.  I know we are examining the cost of business generally but we should examine what would help smaller businesses in particular.  This would help rural areas of Ireland.  We currently have an unemployment rate of 5.8% or 5.9%.  What would incentivise them to come back to work?  We should examine having some sort of back-up service to help them with compliance, accounts and HR.  </p><p>Based on today's presentations, I think that we also need to examine the cost of hiring staff.  This does not refer to the minimum wage.  I want to see the minimum wage increased.  This relates to compliance and the complexities of hiring staff and the costs involved.  To get to full employment, we need to examine that issue.  I know from trades people, whether a builder or a carpenter, that they are flat out working seven days a week.  However, to take that next jump to hire someone is too big a step for them, so they pull back and turn away business.  A big issue arising from the recovery is to get those sole traders' businesses to pop up so that they can hire two or three more people.  The conduit between that and hiring staff needs to be examined by the committee.  That is based on some of what I have read here today.  </p><p>I have a question similar to that of Deputy Quinlivan.  We see all the costs of doing business between accommodation, insurance, rates, etc.  If we were to prioritise, where are the quick wins?  The witnesses are at the coal face and have done their research.  From their experience, where are the quick wins?  Would it be in tackling rates or insurance costs?  I know we want to tackle it all but if we were to tier them, has there been any analysis on where the quick wins are?</p></speech>

That, for me, is a major cost because on budget night I have to find that excise to buy my next case of wine.</p> <p>  It is not in my profit forecast for this year but suddenly it has gone up in the budget &euro;1 or 50 cent a bottle.  The following day to buy the same bottle of wine I have to find that increase.  That comes out of my bottom line.  It is not found with a magic wand.  I cannot go to the bank for it.  For me rates and excise are important. </p></speech>

They are completely unsustainable.  A couple of shops have already closed because of this.  Most of these stores cannot shop around for insurance.  They have only one place to go and their premiums increase every year.  They have to pay excesses as well.  We have made many suggestions to the working group on insurance costs.  It has promised a second report on employers' liability and occupiers' liability.  That list is in our statement and we hope this committee will support us in this.  We told the working group that radical action is required and we have to make some hard choices.  There is no business owner who does not believe that they need insurance for catastrophic incidents and if something happens and they are at fault, they want the person affected to be compensated.  Unfortunately, we pay huge sums of money on minor trips and slips, bruises, and soft tissue injuries without any challenge.  It seems to us that there are exaggerated and sometimes false claims.  Money appears to be handed out too easily.  It is causing serious heartache for business owners in respect of costs and implications for their business.</p></speech>

The answer is no.  There are things the Legislature and Government should do, and should not do.  It is our money as employers that is paying wages.  It is not the Government's money.  Commitments should not be made in programmes for Government on a set increase for the national minimum wage by a certain date, when the Low Pay Commission, LPC, is charged with making only evidence-based recommendations.  The LPC should not be charged with increasing the rate.  It should be considering the evidence and, if there is sufficient evidence to merit and warrant those increases, it will so recommend.  There have been times, and it is happening now, when the increases exceed those of inflation.  That is what really upsets the employers.  We are not mean people.  We may be thrifty.  We are told that our chance of recouping the entire moneys in additional wages will happen because of the increase we will get in our stock but that will not happen.  We are now committed to pay from 1 January well above the rate of inflation in excess of the evidence and it seems, and this was reiterated recently, that the minimum wage will be rising and we will oversee that.  Stop making comments about our money and allow the evidence to flow.</p> <p>  The Low Pay Commission in the United Kingdom has been operating for 18 years.  There has never once been a minority report attached to it.  It has always made recommendations in line with the expectation of inflation.  It has always been unanimous.  In this country we have had three reports with four minority reports attached.  That goes to show there are serious difficulties in bedding down the LPC. </p></speech>

They all hurt me.  To follow up on what Mr. Jennings said, the thing that affects my business most is labour costs, particularly with the minimum wage.  I come from a small rural town where we have always supported students,  young people in part-time jobs, so that they can go to college.  The minimum wage and the pay related social insurance, PRSI, charges make having two students in for Saturday and Sunday very expensive for me.  We are working with very tight margins.  People think I am loaded because they see all the money in the till but that belongs to the Government, the county council, the insurance company.  A bit more relief for small-time employers in respect of PRSI payments, which we had before, would help to keep indigenous industries and small businesses in small rural towns, as Deputy Neville said.  That is a challenge even in the business I am in.  If we could address the labour costs I would be happy.</p></speech>

While some of these are for products, more are for services such as insurance, rateable valuations and other services for which one can organise collectively.</p> <p>  I am pleased the Chairman teed me up on one of the issues in the report.  This association and other associations should be allowed to negotiate with suppliers.  Competition law currently prevents us from doing so.  I am not knocking trade unions but they have negotiating rights which we do not have.  Our members are continually dealing with ever larger companies which tell them what terms and conditions will apply if they want to sell newspapers or another product.  We must do what these companies say and pay for goods in the way they say.  They crack the whip and will cut off a retailer or refuse to provide a product if the retailer does not act in the manner prescribed.  If, as is the case in Australia, the associations were allowed to secure negotiating licences, we would be able to represent our members, although I accept we should not be allowed to organise boycotts and so on.</p> <p>  Senator Reilly will be aware of the difficulties that ensued in terms of Chinese walls and so on when the medical profession tried to organise collectively.  It is a significant problem that the small guy cannot be represented and must deal with a monolith.  It may not be the State but it will be large supplier.  Some kind of level playing pitch is needed because the small guy is always crushed. </p></speech>

I am also an employer.  There is no doubt that very few employers pay the minimum wage and most pay above the minimum wage.  The area of relativity is a major problem in many sectors.  However, one can see how this can be turned on its head in some sectors, in other words, the idea of equal work for equal pay applies.  This is not a simple problem to solve.  It is a complex issue and I fully subscribe to the idea that if someone is working for a company for a long time, he or she will be more valuable to the business than someone who has been working for one year.  This difference needs to be reflected, although it is not a simple matter.  I could not let the comment on the minimum wage go unchallenged.</p> <p>  On the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, I fail to see the reason for preventing smaller operators from coming together to purchase when there is a choice of different suppliers.  I have no doubt wiser heads and legal minds in the commission will have a different view.  In principle, however, I do not see why the smaller retailers cannot play on the same pitch.  The witnesses referred to Musgraves, which has substantial buying power when it is negotiating a deal to buy X product.  Individual operators cannot possibly compete and must, therefore, compete in a different way.</p> <p>  The joint committee wants to support small and medium enterprises and the shops in villages and towns.  As this is a public meeting, I am happy to place on record my view that people must be realistic.  While they may be able to buy goods more cheaply in a multiple in a large town ten miles away, if they want to be able to nip down to a local shop for bread, butter, milk or a newspaper, they must support it and be prepared to accept that such shops cannot buy in the same bulk as the large multiple ten or 15 miles away.  If these shops are not supported, they will no longer be available.  That needs to be stated.  I have always tried to buy certain goods in smaller shops, even though they cost more, because I know the shop will not be there for much longer if we do not do so. </p></speech>

Small shops have a social value.  We sold our family business.  I remember there was a particular lady who could buy everything in one go but she used to come in seven days per week because I was the only person she spoke to every day.  As with the post offices, one can never underestimate the social value of the small shop.  Members are very much on the side of small retailers.</p></speech>

After a certain period, they will find out who are the customers who come in every day.  We are training young people to have a word with customers and talk about the weather and so on.  I always tell them to bear in mind that an old person may not speak to another person on a given day.  We must keep rural shops and post offices open.</p></speech>

I am a small shopkeeper, as are my members and those of the other associations represented, and we are all community based.  The problem we have is with low cost selling and the ability to claim back VAT because as this creates an unfair advantage of which our customers and members of the public are often not aware.</p><p>From our side, yes, we would love the groceries order to return.  I would love a ban on selling at below invoice cost.  It would help our trade greatly.  It would also help the mixed traders who operate in euro.</p></speech>

A minimum unit cost is a major part of it.  The fact that so much attention has been paid to one small element is disappointing when there are such huge gains to be had in respect of ensuring that young people under the age of 18 are not exposed to alcohol.  We know that if they are exposed, they will develop problems later in life at a much greater rate than those who were not.  Equally, it will allow members of Mr. Redmond's organisation to sell their products in a way that offers a more personalised service.  Having said all that, this is about business and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises.</p><p>I accept Mr. Redmond's point on competition.  I have asked that we bring the Irish Farmers Association before the committee.  Mr. Redmond will be wondering what in the name of God I am on about.  Farmers, and particularly those involved in horticulture who produce vegetables, are being nailed every single year by the multiples.  Their margins are being cut and cut.  We are now at the point where something like 35 farmers are responsible for nearly 70% of our vegetable production.  Some of them may employ a couple of hundred people, but there is a real fine expertise in vegetable production and if it is lost, and if the 40 ft lorries stop coming across the Border from the UK, we will rue that day.  One thing of which we should be proud and for which we should aim is self-sufficiency.  Goddamn it - I hope the Chair will pardon my language - if we cannot have it in food, where will we ever have it?</p><p>I think we are all <i>ad idem</i>here in supporting small and medium enterprise.  We also accept the need for multiples, but we need fair play.  We understand the power they have over smaller operators and we want to see a level playing pitch.  That goes for the big banks as well.</p></speech>

First, I thank the Chairperson, Deputy Mary Butler, and all members for this opportunity.  The Institute of Professional Auctioneers and Valuers, IPAV, is delighted to take up the invitation to appear before the committee this evening to discuss the issues raised in our submission to the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  I am the CEO of IPAV.</p><p>IPAV's areas of concern are outlined in our submission, which I expect committee members have, and I wish to highlight some of the key concerns in the short time available to me.</p><p> The majority of IPAV members operate in the SME sector.  We have had an ongoing concern that, despite much rhetoric emanating from official circles about the importance of the SME sector to the Irish economy, little real progress has been achieved.  In terms of doing business in small and medium-sized rural towns today, we need to consider the broader economic impact that the recession has had on rural towns and the economic realities arising from neglect of those towns, a lack of investment, the large numbers of empty retail units, infrastructural deficits - water and sewage services, broadband, schools and roads - and the exit of banks, Garda stations and post offices.</p><p> While the economy went through a sharp correction during the recession, resulting in some businesses being devastated and most struggling to survive, there was no such correlation across a significant number of overheads, for instance, taxes, employment tax and employers' PRSI.  The latter is a large cost at 10.75% on all earnings over a low threshold.  Other overheads include building insurance, public and employers' liability and professional indemnity insurance; motor insurance and motor tax, which have been increasing per annum by anything from 18% to 20%; telephone, broadband and electricity; auctioneers' licences for employers and employees and regulation and compliance costs; increasing bank charges and the cost of finance for business development; and one of the old favourites, namely, commercial rates, which are a cost that awaits a business even before it opens its door.  A range of services were once provided for such charges, like bins, water and street cleaning.</p><p> In the countrywide rates revaluation, the rate purse of &euro;1.5 billion has remained the same, notwithstanding the fact of a devastating recession in the 2007 to 2012 period, during which time many IPAV members experienced a fall of 50% in their fee incomes as the price of property halved, and is still 40% behind where it was in 2006 except in some parts of Dublin.  All that the revaluation is doing is merely taking from Peter to give to Paul.</p><p> In the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015, IPAV placed significant importance on what we believed was the intended outcome, namely, the linking of commercial rates to the actual rents being paid for commercial buildings.  The rental income from some commercial buildings in rural Ireland is so low that very little in commercial rates should be payable at all, but the intended outcome has not happened.  The issue with these properties is that the Valuation Office will either not accept the reality of the low rents or it will analyse the passing rents incorrectly and then link the valuations on these properties to the tone of the valuation list that the Valuation Office has itself created.</p><p> The 2015 Act has made two important changes among others.  Section 30 of the Valuation Act 2001, which allowed a second appeal to the Valuation Office, has been abolished, and section 19 of the 2001 Act has been amended by a subsection (5) inserted by section 7(b) of the 2015 Act, which means that the grounds of appeal that ordinary ratepayers can make in the valuation tribunals are now limited to appealing against the tone of the valuation list.  Appealing against the tone means that, when the valuation certificates are issued by the Valuation Office, one can only appeal on the basis that a valuation is incorrect relative to other comparable valuations on the list and one cannot contest the rental values that make up those valuations regardless of whether those rental values are excessive, hence completely undermining one of the most important intentions of the Act, that being, treating all ratepayers in a fair way.  Indeed, in many of the revaluations, the proposed valuation certificates were appealed by property owners or tenants, but many of the appeals were not listened to by the Valuation Office during the revaluation process.  My belief is that the reason for this change in the Act was that the Valuation Office's viewpoint had been overturned by the tribunal much of the time.</p><p> IPAV recently contacted the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Phelan, seeking clarification on his remarks made at an IPAV conference that indicated an intention to take away the temporary abatement for vacant premises, which is an allowance that property owners can claim if a commercial building is unoccupied.  This is at a time when none of the 31 rating authorities are able to collect their full current rates.  Looking at the audited figures, the percentage rates collected range from 63% in Donegal to 96% in Fingal.  I am not aware how much money is involved in this regard or in the Minister of State's new proposals but, from IPAV's point of view, this would be a damaging course of action and serve as another nail in the rural Ireland coffin.</p><p> For property owners who cannot secure a tenant, and there are many, the Minister of State suggests that property owners should change the use of their buildings.  Where can they obtain the finance to do this?  In addition to financial constraints, planning laws, development plans and processes are also prohibitive in changing the use of commercial buildings.  The big question is how and when are ratepayers going to get a fair crack of the whip?  On top of this, many businesses are continuing to struggle with high debt levels, much of which has still not been resolved in a realistic way by lenders.</p><p> These are some of the issues that we wish to put before the committee.  I thank the committee for allowing me the time to address them and bringing them to members' attention.  I am happy to take whatever questions they may have.</p></speech>

We welcome the opportunity to inform the committee's work on this issue and have consulted our members to gather their views on the areas of most concern.</p> <p>  By way of background, Insurance Ireland is the representative body for the insurance industry in Ireland, comprising the general insurance, health insurance, life insurance, reinsurance and captive management sectors.  Insurance Ireland represents more than 130 members, and total industry employment is approximately 28,000 people, comprising those who are employed directly and indirectly.  Insurance Ireland members pay out more than &euro;13 billion in claims and benefits to Irish consumers each year.  The industry holds &euro;200 billion in assets under management, with &euro;35 billion invested in Irish infrastructure or Government debt.  Our members pay &euro;1.6 billion in tax and one in four jobs in financial services is in insurance.</p> <p>  Given the scale of the industry and how insurance is vital to almost all economic activity, our members are major service users, employers and utility customers, among other areas.  Like all businesses, they aim to maintain close control of costs to ensure that they are predictable and do not compromise competitiveness.  This involves benchmarking their expense bases against their costs from previous periods and, for international insurers, against similar-sized operations in different jurisdictions.  Insurance is an internationally traded service and competitiveness is, therefore, central to maintaining and growing the industry in Ireland.  The insurance industry is keenly aware of costs in the economy and the following submission highlights the key concerns of our member companies.</p> <p>  Regarding labour costs and given the return to strong growth in the economy, insurance is facing increased pressures in competing to attract and retain staff.  This is leading to wage pressures and difficulties in attracting suitably skilled and experienced staff.  According to the National Competitiveness Council's report, Cost of Doing Business in Ireland 2017, there has been modest wage inflation in the finance and insurance categories, and the Irish figure for 2016 is noted to have been lower than the euro area figure.  However, it should be noted that this is a cross-section of all grades across the country.  Insurers, while acutely aware of headline figures, are especially cognisant of wage levels for posts requiring technical experience and skill sets such as underwriting, actuarial and claims specialists, as well as IT and in-house professional services such as accountants. Some of our members have noted that the cost of many of these professional roles in Ireland is significantly higher than in other countries.  If the projections of future economic growth materialise, our members expect further pressure on labour costs.</p> <p>  Regarding legal costs, and given the nature of the business of insurance, there is a significant requirement for the use of legal services.  Insurance Ireland has pointed out the impact of rising legal fees in the claims settlement process and the costs associated with a claim proceeding to litigation in generating additional fees and costs for consultants and expert witnesses.  As the Department of Finance's key information report on motor insurance showed, legal and other expenses add &euro;42,400 to the cost of settling a &euro;100,000 motor injury award.</p><p>Increasing legal costs are, therefore, a material factor in the price paid by customers for their insurance and in the cost base for insurers.  Indeed, the National Competitiveness Council's Cost of Doing Business Report 2017 states that in Q3 of 2016, legal service prices were 10.4% higher than the corresponding quarter in 2013.  It further states: &quot;Ireland remains an expensive location in which to enforce a business contract and is the 6th most expensive in the OECD.  The World Bank also estimate that the total cost of contract enforcement in Ireland amounts to 26.9 per cent of a claim, compared with 22.1 per cent in the OECD&quot;.  The report continues: &quot;It also takes significant time (650 days) to enforce a contract in Ireland compared with an OECD average of 551 days&quot;.  This experience is borne out by the feedback given by our members who have noted extreme examples.  One member has  highlighted a 70% increase in the average cost to settle a non-nil claim since 2013.  Insurance Ireland believes that Irish legal fees are a considerable competitiveness issue.  Insurance Ireland also believes that reform is required to reduce legal fees and the requirement for legal services in the claims settlement process. <br/><br/>Commercial property costs are a growing concern for insurers.  The Competitiveness Council's Cost of Doing Business Report 2017 states:</p><blockquote>Growth Rates associated with Office Rents were 14.1 per cent in Dublin (D2 and D4 districts) and 7 per cent in Cork.  The growth rates in Dublin were over three times the equivalent rates in both London City and London's West End.  Commercial property prices in Ireland, however, still compare favourably to comparable cities in the UK but concerns persist about the availability of prime office space for rent in large urban centres in the short term as the market tightens and vacancy rates decline.  This could result in future rent increases and any shortage of supply of new commercial space could adversely impact our competitiveness.</blockquote><p>Our members have seen these figures through inflation in per square foot charges, particularly over the past 12 months of in the region of 10% and they expect it to increase further.  Dublin does compare favourably with London, Paris and Brussels in this regard, which is important especially in the context of winning Brexit-related business.  There is undoubtedly a Dublin premium leading to insurers seeking alternative operational sites in some instances.  This is noteworthy as the role of an operation in Ireland will be benchmarked against capital cities but also against competing locations for back office operations. <br/><br/>Our members are concerned about the impact of rising accommodation costs on their staff in the form of rising rental costs and house prices.  The availability of accommodation is a significant concern and we note the August 2017 report by <i>Daft.ie</i>that stated Dublin rents are now 13% higher than their 2008 peak with fewer than 3,000 properties to rent nationwide, the lowest figure they have on record for the country.<br/><br/>House prices are also on a trajectory that could jeopardise competitiveness.  A Central Bank survey of estate agents, auctioneers, economists and surveyors in August 2017 expects house prices to rise by 15% over the next three years on top of the increases in recent years.  Our member companies are part of international groups and have experience of many European markets.  They have highlighted this as a major issue in terms of the ability of their staff to afford rental accommodation and this is especially true for entry level positions.  For companies that need to bring in staff with linguistic skills, this can significantly impact on the attractiveness of the jobs.<br/><br/>Our members have highlighted the increased cost of regulatory compliance in Ireland and expect such costs to increase.  There is a constant flow of new regulation from Europe in addition to local requirements that stem from the Central Bank of Ireland and other regulators.  Recent examples include the introduction of Solvency II. </p></speech>

Insurance Ireland is keenly aware of the public concern about rising costs.  We have sought to inform public policy responses to address the cores issue of the rising cost of claims.  Specifically, on motor insurance, we set out our desired policy solutions in mid-2015 that included the international benchmarking of high personal injury awards and giving new powers to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, to handle more claims thus reducing the number of claims proceeding to expensive litigation.  This led to us engaging with the Government's cost of insurance working group report, which was published in January 2017.  It details 73 policy actions and the timeline for their implementation.</p> <p>  Insurance Ireland is keen to see fundamental and sustainable reform of our claims environment to reduce volatility in the market as it has an impact on our customers.  Insurance Ireland also fully engages with the Government on employers' liability and public liability insurance.  The fundamental issues of the cost of claims remain the same and many of the actions in the motor report can help to reduce costs in employers' liability and public liability. </p> <p>  The following are some relevant figures to illustrate the trends in this area: There has been a 48% increase in the average Circuit Court award, from &euro;11,941 in 2013 to &euro;17,722 in 2016, according to the Courts Service's annual report for 2016; there is a paragraph relating to Q3 of 2016, provided by the National Competitiveness Council, that I quoted earlier; according to the PIAB annual reports for 2011-16 there has been a 30% increase in the average PIAB employers' liability award from 2011 to 2016 and a 35% increase in PIAB public liability claims from 2011 to 2016; and according to the PIAB annual reports for 2011-16 there has been a 17% increase in the average PIAB public liability award from 2011 to 2016.  As with the cost of claims in terms of motor insurance, Insurance Ireland will work with the Government and all stakeholders to help inform the policy responses in this area. </p> <p>  I hope my presentation has enlightened the committee about the issues faced by insurers.  We are happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

The cost of insurance was the topic for my inaugural speech because it was one of the issues that was mentioned the most when my party and I talked to people on their doorsteps.  I am sure the delegation is aware of the situation.  However, I must keep putting it on the record that the cost of insurance is still a huge issue for people.  In particular, it compromises our competitiveness and must be tackled.  The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, worked on the issue when he was the Minister of State at the Department of Finance.  His successor, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, is working on the issue and has been very open to suggestions.</p> <p>  My questions are on the insurance industry as a whole.  I constantly hear that legal fees and costs have increased and this matter has been debated.  The problem that I have is that there is buoyancy in terms of insurance products.  I mean by this that product development and product take-up has also increased presumably due to this country's economic progression.  The same applies to car sales, house sales and products in general, so clearly business has increased.</p> <p>  Let us say an insurer has an insurance product with a specific risk, brand name and fee.  I have learned that some people in the sector take that same insurance product and risk but give it a different brand name and charge a different fee.  Can the witnesses confirm whether that is happening in the sector?</p></speech>

All I can say is that the premiums, regardless of whether it is motor insurance, employers' liability insurance or public liability insurance, are a function of claims.  The driving pricing factor for any insurer is the cost of claims.  As we know from the submissions provided by the Courts Service and the PIAB, the cost of claims is increasing as are the associated costs for the claims such as medical costs but, more importantly, the legal costs.  Insurers will seek to charge an adequate premium to cover the cost with the predominant cost being the cost of claims.  I am not aware of the activity highlighted by the Deputy.  In some ways, insurance is quite a simple model.  We have to take in enough premiums to pay the costs.</p></speech>

If the person had a bit of extra money, they would go ahead and do that but without realising the first year's premium was going straight to the broker in commission.  I understand that practice has stopped-----</p></speech>

We do not represent the broker market, that is, the adviser market; we represent the insurers themselves.  What we do know is that for a broker to give advice for someone to change their product, that advice has to comply with the consumer protection code and has to be in the best interests of the consumer.  Those regulations are in place.</p></speech>

In our view, in the current environment in which we operate, people are looking for a premium which they can afford, which in itself instils an element of competition into the marketplace.  If we look at employer liability, public liability and even motor insurance, these are annually renewable contracts.  The contracts come up for renewal every year, they are brought to the market at a moment in time and companies compete for that business.  There is competition within the marketplace which, to my mind, does not support the practice the Deputy indicated may exist, but which we have no knowledge of.</p></speech>

It seems as if the book of quantum is being thrown to the wind at this stage, given what we read in the newspapers on settlement figures and all the rest.  I am curious as to why this is the case and why the book of quantum seems to be used a lot less.  How does Insurance Ireland view that problem, from the perspective of representing the underwriters?  Why are so many cases being settled without use of the book of quantum or the figures within it?</p><p>There has been no record of all of the claims that are being made.  One group will blame somebody else, and maybe underwriters are blaming brokers while brokers are blaming someone else, and all the rest, but if we had a way of recording who is claiming and how much they are being paid, these serial claimers would not be long in coming to light.  This has been a problem in the industry because this information has not been shown.  I know some of the insurance companies are doing work behind the scenes but it is in an <i>ad hoc</i>manner.  In addition, governments, past and present, have been keen to get some sort of a record in this regard so they know who is claiming, what amounts are being claimed for various injuries and the names of the people who are claiming.  If people are claiming regularly, or if members of the same family are claiming, we could shine a greater light on this.  That is the second part of the question.</p><p>On a further point, I was shocked to hear a story at first hand when it was brought up at the committee.  An insurance company - that is, the underwriter, not the broker - made a settlement when somebody made a claim against an insured party.  The man who made the claim had a little tip in a car and took the other driver's insurance details.  One insurance company contacted the other insurance company but the man never heard a word about it and was not asked about the incident, although he said there was hardly a mark on the car and it was just a little bang.  The next thing, by chance, somebody told him the other man had got &euro;20,000 out of this.  He was gob-smacked.  Although it was claimed against his insurance, he did not know about it until he came to pay his insurance premium.  I found it hard to believe that, given a claim was being made against a person's policy, somebody would not lift a telephone to tell the person what was going on.  That is probably not par for the course but it must happen.  In this case, this man was adamant it happened and the committee has heard of a similar case.</p><p>Those are three issues which I think would come under Mr. Thompson's remit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.730" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Thompson" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017112800002#M01300"><p>First, the book of quantum reflects the prevailing level of awards.  As an industry, we welcome the updating of the book of quantum, which basically reflects what is happening in regard to the amounts being paid.  We look to reference that book of quantum, as does the injuries board.  The Judiciary is not compelled but it is minded to make reference to the book of quantum.  One aspect we are happy with is that the book of quantum brings an element of stability to the claims environment.  In recent years we have seen a lot of volatility in the claims environment, in particular in terms of the variance in awards for a similar injury.  As this is not good for insurers or for business, the book of quantum has been good in this respect.  As an industry, we look to use it where we can, as does the injuries board.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what we have seen is that a high proportion of the cases which go through the injuries board are rejected and end up in the court settlement channel.  As we know, and this was borne out by the Department of Finance report under the cost of insurance working group, once it goes through the claims settlement channel in the courts, it becomes a lot more expensive, which, ultimately, has to feed through to premiums.  What we would like to see is a more timely updating of the book of quantum.  To be fair to the Government, the cost of insurance working group report, published in January of this year, also recommended that this should be the case.  In regard to the prevailing level of awards, it also recommended that these awards should be benchmarked against other jurisdictions.  That is part of the recommendations on which we are working with Government, through the Personal Injuries Commission, under retired President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Nicholas Kearns.  Hopefully, that will help in terms of knowing where award levels should be set.<br/><br/>The Senator makes a fair point in regard to the claims database in that there is no database which will give the information, claim per claim.  Again, that issue was identified within the cost of insurance working group report in January 2017 and it is one of the recommendations that a national claims database should be set up under the auspices of the Central Bank.  As an industry, we are working with the Government and the Central Bank to develop that claims database, although it will take time to develop.  A similar model was developed in the UK and it took close to ten years to complete.  That is not to say it will take us that long because there is impetus from our side and from other stakeholders, particularly the Government and the Central Bank, to make sure we can bring it to fruition.  As an interim step, what we have done to try to highlight what is going on within the claims environment is to work with the Department of Finance, which has been publishing <i>ad hoc</i>claims information on a quarterly basis, albeit at an aggregate level.  That has also worked well.<br/><br/>On the Senator's third point on the settlement of claims, where he gave the example of the person who had a tip in his car, I acknowledge it is a difficult area.  While it is hard for me to comment on specific cases, the committee members will have seen recently that insurers have adopted a more robust approach in regard to claims settlement.  It is difficult for insurers because they have to tread a fine line.  We have to remember that the majority of claimants are honest claimants, and when they make a claim, they should be paid quickly and at the appropriate level for their injury.</p><p>Equally, however, there is a degree to which insurers will have to adopt a more robust approach.  I think we are seeing that emerge, most recently in cases which have been published in the media.  The industry is investing heavily in more robust claims settlement and in fighting fraudulent claims.  That trend will continue and will hopefully alleviate the cost of claims, which will ultimately lead to lower premiums.</p></speech>

It is a no-brainer for me.</p></speech>

What we do know is that a claims officer would assimilate a certain amount of information, and would adjudicate on that claim to the best of their ability.  As I say, insurers are becoming more robust in their claims settlement, albeit treading a fine line to make sure they do not penalise genuine claimants.</p></speech>

We have run four or five such conferences now.  There were about 350 people there, claims experts, investigators and so forth.  Every year it provides a forum, and it is growing in importance.  The conference facilitates analysis of how insurers can work together to identify trends, and to inform policy that responds to issues of concern to the customers and to business.  One area that insurers are particularly looking at is improving data analytics as a way to invest in their investigative units and analytical tools.  These improvements to investigation can help identify inconsistencies in claims at an earlier point in the process.  That prevents a claim going further down the line and incurring extra costs, such as litigation costs, the cost of expert witnesses, and so on.  It is important for insurers that there is a deterrent and that they are effective in their investigations, because it affects public confidence in the claims settlement process.  That is just one area that insurers are looking at.</p></speech>

I have a few questions for Mr. Davitt.  He has mentioned the relationship between the rental values of properties and rates.  It is hard to believe that when a customer feels aggrieved at the new rates he has been quoted after a revaluation, the associated rental values would not be talked about.  Perhaps Mr. Davitt could enlighten the committee about that, as he seems to know a bit about that process.</p> <p>  There is also the issue of rates in rural Ireland and their effects on smaller businesses.  Earlier today, before our witnesses appeared, the committee talked a little bit about the banking industry, and the current difficulties it presents for small businesses.  The members of Mr. Davitt's organisation are also finding problems and complications between the banking industry and small business.  Mr. Davitt touched on a few other points, but if he could enlighten the committee on those two topics I would appreciate it. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.738" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Patrick Davitt" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JEJ2017112800002#N00800"><p>It is important to say that there have been no tribunal cases yet under the Valuation (Amendment) Act.  However, we believe that parties that go to the tribunal will not be able to argue on the basis of the rent of their premises.  They will only be able to argue on the basis of tone.  The tone of the valuation sounds very tricky and very difficult to understand.  It is made up on the basis of valuation averages.</p> <p>  We might imagine four properties for instance, with two at a high rental value and two at a low rental value.  The Valuation Office will try to pick a value in the middle.  However, no matter how it picks it, the owner of a property with low rental value is going to have a high valuation and a high rate.  Conversely, owners with higher rental value, will get a fall in the rates.  Hence we say that the Valuation Office takes from one to give to the other.  However, there have been no tribunal hearings yet.  It will be interesting to see what happens.  We fear that when the hearings start, this is exactly what is going to happen.  A property owner will not be able to argue that his rates are X and his rent is Y, and seek to link them.  The issue turns on the tone of the valuation, which does not seem very fair. </p> <p>  The Senator also referred to rural Ireland.  Rates in themselves have a huge effect on rural Ireland and its business holders and shop-owners.  They have to pay the rates, and must raise that money through rents or otherwise.  If the rates increase, it will put those people at risk of going out of business.  That is a huge problem for small business owners, and especially for some of our members, who are small business owners throughout the country.  If in 2006 a house cost &euro;300,000, and in 2012 or 2013 it cost &euro;150,000 or even &euro;50,000, fees will obviously fall considerably.  That leaves these people earning a lot less in fees.  However, the whole valuation figure of &euro;1.5 billion sought by the Government has not changed, even though these businesses' fee income has down drastically.  This could close a lot of businesses in rural Ireland.</p> <p>  Moreover, there may be a new provision whereby an owner cannot claim that their property is not rented.  If that comes in, people will have to pay rates whether their property is rented or not.  It seems very unfair, and I plead with the Minister not to bring this in, because rural Ireland faces a very different situation.  We took a survey in one small town, Strokestown, where 17 properties are vacant at the moment.  If that abatement comes in, the owners of those properties will have to pay rates for those properties, as if they were rented.  How are people going to pay for it?  In some instances, the value of those properties has gone from &euro;250,000 to &euro;30,000.  It is incredible.</p> <p>  This morning I was speaking at a banking meeting, and I saw two properties on the Internet that were sold at auction during the week.  They were two-bedroom apartments that made &euro;25,000 each in one of these towns.  They were bought in order to be rented.  We hear of the high prices for properties and that may be true in Dublin or the big cities, but in rural Ireland it is a different kettle of fish.  There are many people in rural Ireland who have problems with banks and loans, and they have not been dealt with at all.  There are people whose businesses have had a loan outstanding for years.  They cannot pay it back and it does not look like they will be able to do so, because at the end of the day they are not making enough money.  It is practically impossible to get a settlement with the bank or even to speak to somebody there.  It is still the same today.  From a business-owner's point of view, and certainly from that of many of our members, something will have to happen. The banks must be contactable by these people.  They must sort out their loans and come to some sort of arrangement with these business owners, or a lot of them are going to go out of business. </p></speech>

We accept that.  I wish to ask Mr. Davitt a question about rates.  Does he have suggestions as to how he would change the current assessment mechanism to better reflect the huge difference between some parts of rural Ireland and the bigger cities which he rightly points out?</p></speech>

Each rate-payer should have to pay rates on the rents of his or her property, or its rental value.  Low rents should be taken into consideration as well as high rents.  If we get into a situation where appeals start going to the tribunals, somebody who owns a property should be able to appeal that property and outline the rent they are earning from it.  They should be able to submit the rents, letting agreements and pertinent information and this should be taken into consideration.  If that does not happen it will be exceptionally unfair, because people will have to pay rates on the basis of somebody else's rents, not their own.</p></speech>

It depends on what the yield of the building would be, because the rates are calculated on the yield of the building.  Some of rate-payers the Chair mentions have appealed their rates, but a lot of the appeals were not heard.  They can go to the tribunal, but it costs money.  The worst of it is, if they go to the tribunal and come out on the right side of it, they can be taken to the High Court.</p><p>Obviously, one can go to tribunal if one wants, but it costs money to do so.  The worst part is that even if one goes to tribunal and comes out the right side of it, the rates office or the valuation office can take one to the High Court.  Most people who go to tribunal cannot go on because they cannot pay that sort of money.</p></speech>

First, I thank both witnesses for coming here today because the work that we are doing needs to be informed.  The witness mentioned labour costs and insurance.  Indeed, labour costs are mentioned by all business people as a concern but the cost of insurance is particularly concerning at the moment.  RGDATA representatives met this committee recently and mentioned a particular business that was paying &euro;10,000 in insurance ten years ago.  This year that business has been asked for &euro;110,000 which is a phenomenal increase in ten years.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the levels of increase in insurance costs.</p> <p>  On legal costs, the witness referred to &euro;42,000 in the context of a &euro;100,000 settlement.  Is the &euro;42,000 part of the &euro;100,000 or on top of it? </p></speech>

I ask him to explain why it is important to locate in large urban centres rather than on the periphery, given the IT nature of insurance nowadays and so forth.</p> <p>  The last issue I wish to raise is that of bench-marking awards.  When one looks at the UK, for example, the average award for a simple whiplash injury with no complications is around &pound;6,000 or &pound;7,000 whereas in this country, it is around &euro;20,000.  That is a huge difference.  On the matter of the book of quantum, it seems to be ever rising.  The awards seem to be getting bigger, legal costs seem to be rising and other costs are also increasing.  What is astonishing is that there was such an increase between 2013 and 2017 when everyone else was suffering a reduction.  I would welcome the witnesses' comments.</p></speech>

Reference was made to an increase in insurance premiums for a particular business.  In some ways, the explanation is quite simple.  The average level of awards, even according to the Courts Service's own publication from 2016, has increased by 48% and that ultimately feeds through to premiums.  In addition, we have also seen inconsistency within those awards and I will explain how that affects insurance premiums.  If, for example, 100 claims are notified to an insurer within a year, the insurer will not settle all of those claims on day one.  In the first year, the insurer may only settle 20% of those claims and will make payments based on prevailing award levels.  The insurer posts a reserve or capital for the remaining claims based on its best estimate.  If awards are increasing and there is volatility in the level of awards for whiplash, for example, this can cause difficulties.  If the insurer has reserved X amount but a decision in court results in an award of X plus Y, the insurer then has to go back to the back book and make an additional provision which has to be accommodated in the current pricing, that is, in the current premiums.  Unfortunately, we have seen the level of awards increase and the volatility around those awards increase which has fed through to premiums.</p> <p>  On the positive side, we do have a framework now, through the cost of insurance working group report published by the Minister in January, which makes some key recommendations.  The first is one touched on by Senator Reilly, namely the inconsistency between the level of awards in the UK and here.  The establishment of the personal injuries commission and the bench marking exercise should bring forward clear recommendations to address that issue on behalf of all consumers.  In terms of driving costs out of the claims settlement process, the reinforcement of the powers of the PIAB is a key recommendation.  We know that legislation-----</p></speech>

We are trying to attract new, additional players into the Irish insurance market, particularly in the context of Brexit and one finds that new entrants will generally coalesce around centres of excellence such as the IFSC and similar places.  That is not to say, however, that the insurance sector is not supportive of decentralisation.   We actively work with the IDA to try to decentralise.  If new companies are considering entering the market, we actively promote regional centres to them as well.  We try to do what we can in that regard.</p></speech>

Our members have a huge problem in attracting younger staff to their offices.  Auctioneers who are trying to bring their sons and daughters back from Dublin or from abroad to work for them face enormous insurance costs.  When they want to insure younger staff, they often find they cannot afford to do so.  This means that younger staff members cannot travel to conduct viewings and so on.  I am talking here about young people between the ages of 20 and 25 with full or provisional licences.  It could cost up to &euro;6,000 to insure them, even as named drivers.  This is a huge cost for our members and it arises in both rural and urban settings.  In fact, prices in cities are probably higher.  One has to ask why this is the case.  Often younger people are better drivers than their older colleagues.  Mr. Thompson may not be able to give me an answer on this today but it is a large cost for our members.  It is particularly difficult for our members if they are trying to encourage their own young sons or daughters to come into the business.</p></speech>

Mr. Davitt made reference to people coming back to the country.  We have, through the cost of insurance working group and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, developed a protocol which all insurers will follow.  It covers the evidence that people returning to the country will need to give to insurers in order to obtain insurance at a reasonable rate.</p> <p>  I accept Mr. Davitt's point on younger drivers.  While I cannot comment on individual cases, insurers will price according to the risk presented to them.  That said, we represent all of the carriers in the marketplace and would strongly encourage people to shop around.  We also encourage them not to accept the first quote they get from an insurer.  They should seek quotes from other insurers.</p></speech>

It is a valid point.  The witnesses can have a discussion or a set-to about the cost of insurance outside after this meeting.  I thank them for attending and engaging with the committee.  This is the third in our series of meetings on this topic.  Our next meeting will be held on 12 December and it is intended a further meeting will be held in January.  We have talked about the banks and credit unions today also and we intend to produce a report in the new year.  That concludes our business for today.</p></speech>
