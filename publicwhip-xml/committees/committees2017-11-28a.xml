    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1268" speakername="Pat Deering" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017112800002#A00300"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputy Thomas Pringle.  I ask those present to ensure that all mobile phones are turned off.  The meeting has been convened to consider a Supplementary Estimate for Vote 30 - Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which was referred by the D&aacute;il to the committee on 21 November 2017 with an instruction to report back to the D&aacute;il no later than 6 December 2017.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed.  I also welcome his departmental officials and thank them for circulating briefing papers beforehand.  The Minister will make a brief address to the committee after which members who indicate they wish to speak will have an opportunity to make a brief response.  We can then consider the Supplementary Estimate.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I remind members that, in accordance with Standing Orders, discussion should be confined to the item constituting the Supplementary Estimate only.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017112800002#A00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to present this request for a technical Supplementary Estimate for 2017.  I am seeking the committee's approval to use savings on the Department's Vote to fund other desired expenditure.  As these proposed transfers and expenditure involve significant changes to the original 2017 voted allocations, it is important to seek the committee's input and approval.</p><p>This technical Supplementary Estimate will transfer savings of &euro;9 million in certain areas of the Vote to fund the Brexit loan scheme I announced in budget 2018.  In addition, I am requesting the committee's agreement to transfer &euro;14.5 million of savings in certain areas of the Vote to the agriculture environmental schemes to ensure that there is sufficient funding available to pay 85% advance funding to all farmers who have established their eligibility.  A further &euro;4.5 million will be moved to the areas of natural constraints, ANC, scheme and &euro;6.6 million will be transferred to Bord Bia to assist with ongoing promotional work in addressing the market challenges relating to Brexit.  Finally, a further &euro;14 million will be transferred to the World Food Programme to support its humanitarian work across the world.</p><p>The &euro;48.6 million current funds required will be transferred from various subheads where, due to changed circumstances, savings have emerged, most notably in the context of the administrative budget pay subhead, the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP, the knowledge transfer programme, the animal welfare scheme for sheep, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF, seafood development programme, research, the early retirement scheme and the development of agriculture and food.</p><p>On the payroll underspend, the savings arise from a lower than estimated pay bill due to recruitment of additional replacement staff not proceeding as quickly as planned.  The delay in the recruitment process will give rise to a saving of approximately &euro;12 million in 2017 payroll allocation.</p><p>On the &euro;8.2 million in savings in development of agriculture and food, these are primarily due to funding which had been allocated to this subhead of the Department's Vote pending the development of a programme of activities to support the food and drink sectors in addressing the market challenges relating to Brexit by Bord Bia.  It is proposed to transfer this to Bord Bia under the Supplementary Estimate.  Other savings are arising because there has been a lower than projected spend on lean reviews by food companies.  In addition, a specialist food producer scheme which is currently in development has yet to be launched.  It is now expected that this will be launched in 2018.</p><p>On the animal welfare scheme for sheep and the sum of &euro;8 million, this scheme was launched in December 2016 and is centred on a payment of &euro;10 per breeding ewe on foot of the flock owner undertaking two animal health-related actions.  The original Vote allocation provided for full payment in respect of all ewes in the national flock.  While a high percentage of sheep farmers are participating, not all potential participants choose to do so.  Year 1 advance payments commenced on schedule in mid-November and some &euro;16 million has issued to more than 20,000 farmers.  Balancing payments will issue in 2018.</p><p>On the BDGP and the sum of &euro;3 million, 23,150 farmers are currently participating in BDGP 1<b>.  </b>The programme was reopened in 2017.  However, fewer than anticipated numbers applied to participate.  Some applicants were ineligible to participate while others did not comply with the mandatory requirements of BDGP 2.  Ultimately, 1,550 farmers are participating in BDGP 2.  The &euro;3 million reduction in the Estimate for 2017 is attributable to the take-up and the compliance with mandatory requirements relating to BDGP 1 and 2 being less than projected.  Payments in respect of BDGP 1 and 2 will commence in December to those herds who are compliant with the requirements of the schemes.</p><p><b></b>On the knowledge transfer programme and the sum of &euro;2.8 million, the programme is designed not only to help develop the skills base of Irish farmers but also to support a number of other themes and measures in Ireland&rsquo;s rural development programme.  The original allocation of &euro;25.6 million provided for 20,000 participants satisfying all scheme requirements.  A saving will arise because approximately 19,000 farmers are currently enrolled in knowledge transfer groups and a minority of these have not complied with all the conditions required to receive full payments.  Payments under the knowledge transfer programme commenced at the end of October and, to date, more than 13,700 farmer payments have issued.</p><p>I made &euro;43.6 million available in 2017 for the EMFF operational programme in the budgets of my Department and its agencies.  However, there are some savings as schemes roll out.  There will be a saving of &euro;4.5 million in respect of the current expenditure budget of Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, primarily regarding the sustainable fisheries scheme and the skills and training measure.  There will also be savings of &euro;2.5 million on other EMFF budgets managed by my Department, mainly on a marine development team and marine spatial planning project.  These savings will not affect the overall budget available for the seafood sector under the EMFF because these investments will occur over the latter years of the programme.</p><p>Other savings are in the early retirement scheme, where participants receiving the State pension reduces the early retirement scheme spend by a corresponding amount, and research grants, where, due to a later than scheduled launch of the 2017 research call, &euro;7 million of expenditure will not arise until 2018.</p><p>Overall, these current expenditure savings amount to &euro;48.6 million and, with the select committee's approval, they will be transferred to fund the following measures.  A total of &euro;9 million of the savings identified will be used to contribute to the &euro;23 million Brexit loan scheme I announced on budget day.  This scheme will be operated in partnership with the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation.  The aim behind it is to make up to &euro;300 million of working capital finance available to SMEs and mid-cap businesses that have up to 499 employees.  Given their unique exposure to the UK market, my Department&rsquo;s funding ensures that at least 40% of the fund will be available to food businesses.  The finance will be easier to access, will be more competitively priced - with a proposed interest rate of 4% - and will be offered at more favourable terms than current offerings.  This will give businesses impacted upon by Brexit time and space to adapt and grow into the future.</p><p>The new scheme will be delivered by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, through commercial lenders.  SBCI issued an open call on 21 November inviting lending institutions to participate.  The scheme is expected to be in place in March 2018 and it is anticipated that it will remain open until March 2020.  Supporting lower-cost, flexible finance is a key response to Brexit.  The very successful agriculture cashflow loan scheme has provided a template for such schemes, including this one for businesses.  I also announced in the budget that I have secured funding of &euro;25 million for my Department to facilitate the development of new Brexit response loan schemes during 2018 for farmers, fishermen and food businesses.</p><p>On the GLAS scheme and the sum of &euro;14.5 million, there are now in excess of 50,000 farmers approved into the GLAS scheme over the three tranches, that is, GLAS 1, 2 and 3.  The environmental benefits to date are evident.  In September, the European Commission agreed to my request that provision be made for an increase to the advance payments for Pillar 2 rural development schemes, with the rate increased up to 85% under those schemes.  GLAS advance payments will begin this week at the higher advance rate of 85%.  The additional &euro;14.5 million sought in this Supplementary Estimate will facilitate this.  I urge all participants to ensure that they submit all outstanding documentation so that they can avail of this advance payment in 2017.</p><p>The sum of &euro;6 million for Bord Bia will ensure that it can fund a programme of additional activities to support the food and drink sectors in addressing the market challenges relating to Brexit.  The funding, which is additional to the substantial funding already provided to Bord Bia for 2017, includes further market promotion and support activities internationally, in the UK and in other markets within the EU.</p><p>The programme of activities draws on analysis of data from the Bord Bia Brexit barometer exercise which was completed by 139 food, drink and horticulture companies and follows my Department's request to Bord Bia to undertake a major market prioritisation exercise to identify the best prospects for sustainable growth in individual sectors.</p><p> Areas of natural constraint, ANC, require &euro;4.5 million.  The significant level of financial support delivered through the ANC scheme over the years recognises the issues which pose a significant threat to the future viability of these farming communities.  In budget 2018, I was pleased to fulfil the programme for Government commitment to allocate an additional &euro;25 million to the scheme.  Almost &euro;200 million has been paid out under the ANC scheme this year and this extra &euro;4.5 million allocation will ensure the maximum number of eligible participants is paid this year.</p><p> The World Food Programme requires &euro;14 million.  Including the advance payment of &euro;10 million that I am requesting here, Ireland will have contributed &euro;60 million to the World Food Programme for the years 2016 to 2018.  The additional &euro;10 million provided for the World Food Programme in this Supplementary Estimate represents an advance payment of next year's commitment under Ireland's strategic partnership agreement with the World Food Programme.  This earlier disbursement is at the request of the World Food Programme's executive director, who has written to inform me that this funding will significantly contribute to enhance the World Food Programme's capability to plan its interventions and better address the several growing humanitarian crises around the world.  I also propose to provide an additional &euro;4 million to the World Food Programme which will contribute to its lifesaving work around the world, including helping 4.3 million people who are facing crisis or emergency levels of food insecurity in the Kasai region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  They include 350,000 children in the region who are at risk of severe acute malnutrition.  This funding, while generally targeted at the World Food Programme's emergency and protracted relief operations, is provided on a non-earmarked basis which gives the World Food Programme the flexibility to plan and target this funding in the most strategic, efficient and effective manner and provide lifesaving assistance for people living on the front lines of hunger, conflict and climate change.  Ireland will become a member of the World Food Programme's executive board in February 2018.</p><p> This is a technical Supplementary Estimate.  The savings I have outlined will be used to fund the World Food Programme, the Brexit loan scheme, green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and ANC payments, and Bord Bia and I earnestly recommend this Supplementary Estimate to the committee for its support.  I am happy to respond to members' questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017112800002#B00200"><p>On the &euro;4.5 million for ANC, I would have thought &euro;200 million was adequate to cover applicants.  Will the Minister clarify why &euro;4.5 million is needed for the ANC scheme?  I welcome the extra money for Bord Bia because with the challenges we are facing with Brexit, which we do not have to elaborate on here, Bord Bia needs all the funding it can get to withstand the market challenges it would face in a hard Brexit.  We had farmers who were aggrieved that they did not qualify for the loan scheme the last time.  Will it be at the same interest rate as the last time?  Will people who failed to qualify get priority for this extra &euro;25 million?</p> <p>  It is charitable for a country such as ours to provide &euro;14 million to the World Food Programme but Fianna F&aacute;il raised a Topical Issue matter last week which highlighted the fodder crisis in the west of Ireland and the pressure that will be there in the spring of 2018.  This was an ideal opportunity for the Minister to put aside money for aid for those farmers and I am disappointed that there is no provision for funding for that impending crisis.  There will be a severe further shortage in the west.  A number of funding sources are available and I would be disappointed if one of those was not used to address this crisis.  Eight of us spoke on it last week in a Topical Issue debate in the D&aacute;il and that is the one significant disappointment I have with this reallocation of funds and it is a serious missed opportunity.  I welcome the money for Bord Bia, which is sensible, but I would like clarification on the &euro;25 million for ANC.  Will that be at the same interest rate and will farmers who failed last time around get priority?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017112800002#B00300"><p>Each year, the vast majority of participants in the ANC scheme are paid in the calendar year but some cannot establish eligibility until the end of the year so payment is delayed until the following year.  Some &euro;9 million of the payments that have issued to date in the 2017 budget was used to pay successful applicants who established their entitlement from 2016 so there is a roll-over.  The &euro;4.5 that is being provided for now is to pay people who have carried over liability from a previous year and established their entitlement at a later stage.  There are stocking density requirements, retention periods and such that have to be met for ANC.  Some people establish their entitlements at a later stage.  Last year, for people who established their eligibility for the 2016 payment in 2017, there was a provision of &euro;9 million, and this year the requirement is for &euro;4.5 million in roll-over.</p> <p>  No decisions have been made about the loan scheme and interest rate yet.  A decision was made on the scheme that is available for small and medium enterprises, SMEs, which will be at a 4% interest rate.  The variables that will decide the size of the loan fund will include the terminal loan and the interest rate that is charged.  We will be trying to draw on the lessons of the last scheme for the loan scheme for fishermen and farmers next year.  Is there something to be gained from pitching the interest rate at a different level that will encourage the banks to compete as well?  A lesson that could be learned from the last scheme was that, at the interest rate of 2.95%, banks just did not compete.  Outside of the pillar banks that were used by the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, was there an opportunity if it had been pitched slightly higher to draw in more competition from other sectors?  There is a suggestion that, at that rate of interest, other banks outside of those involved in administering it would not compete.  All those decisions on the interest rate have yet to be made.</p> <p>  I welcome the Deputy's comments on Bord Bia.  From my own engagement with it, it is putting its time to good use, seeking out new market opportunities, working with companies and so on.</p> <p>  On the fodder crisis, as I discussed in D&aacute;il, I have asked the Department's agents on the ground to assess the situation which is a fundamental exercise to carry out before we do anything else.  If we were to do something on foot of that, I have every confidence that funding would be available but we have to gather the information and as I have said previously, Teagasc is in the field to do that assessment.  We will have feedback from that in due course and we will consider the options available to the Department then.  I am satisfied that, should the need arise from its analysis of the situation on the ground, we will be in a position to respond.</p></speech>

Is there a timeline for farmers waiting for the follow-on from last year's &euro;25 million extra?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017112800002#B00500"><p>It is likely to be in the second quarter of 2018.  There is a sequential process and we are trying to get the industry scheme up and running.  I would say it is likely to be the second quarter of 2018.</p></speech>

Is it possible in that scheme to reinvent a certain amount of funding for a particular sector?</p></speech>

We will have to reflect on the best use of the funding.  Deputy Cahill raised an interesting point about those who did not get funding the last time around.  Is there a significant cohort in any particular sector that was refused?  Was it due to a credit history issue?  What were the reasons?  We will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the last scheme to see if we can learn from it.  Bear in mind that that was the maiden voyage for subsidised loan schemes.</p><p>Broadly speaking it is recognised as being a significant success.  We have lessons to learn from it in respect of what the interest rate might be, should the conditions of the loan be short term or long term, and what sectors should be covered.  We will take all these issues into account.</p></speech>

I am happy to support the Supplementary Estimate.  I have some questions.  I welcome the fact that the specialist food producer scheme will be launched in 2018.  Will the Minister clarify what type of producer will be targeted in terms of applying for that scheme?  With regard to the animal welfare scheme for sheep, why are all the potential participants not availing of it?  The Minister outlined that there could have been other applicants.</p></speech>

The welfare scheme for sheep.  I also want to refer to the World Food Programme and I welcome Ireland's participation in that.  We do not want to lose perspective.

It keeps a degree of context on the scale of challenges that are being faced.  It is one challenge to which Ireland is glad to respond.  It is part of a three-year cycle of commitments we have made to the World Food Programme.</p> <p>  With regard to the specialist food producer scheme, we are focusing on the artisan food sector.  The scheme has yet to be designed and that is why the savings are currently there.  We recognise that the artisan food sector is part of the colour of Ireland's food offering and tourism product.  There is great interest now in provenance and the specialist food sector has a great story to tell.  The sector is also putting its foot in the export market but it is substantially for the domestic consumer.  It is quite a significant sector and the scheme is primarily geared towards the artisan food sector.</p> <p>  On the issue of the sheep welfare scheme applicants, a simple calculation was done.  On the basis of there being 2.5 million ewes in the State the scheme was estimated to cost &euro;25 million.  For one reason or another, despite the best efforts of the Department to advertise the availability of the scheme, and the despite the fact that the scheme was widely recognised as simple to avail of, not all sheep farmers who were eligible for the scheme applied for it.  That is a disappointment.  The scheme will reopen next year and will have a provision for new applicants.  Maybe word of mouth might see the uptake increase.  The saving is there because it was demand led.  We budgeted for the maximum, with everybody participating.  We have made an 85% payment on it.  This leaves us with 85% of the number of applicants.  Having budgeted for &euro;25 million the balancing payment will issue in 2018.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017112800002#C01100"><p>On the figure for the underspend for last year for the Department, I cannot recall exactly but I believe the leftover at the end of the year was to the tune of &euro;70 million.  Will the Minister indicate what that figure was at the year end and what was done with those funds?  Were they left in the Department?  Were they carried over?</p> <p>  I am aware that the Minister is moving &euro;48 million today from a certain number of funds and destinations to others.  Does the Minister expect an underspend in the Department at the end of the year aside from this?  I do not see any reference to TAMS in today's figures but TAMS certainly seems to be underspent this year.  Does the Minister have any data on that?</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill made reference to the &euro;6.5 million allocation.  It is very welcome and necessary and is something we pushed for over a period of time.  Is it going to be built into the base fund going forward, or is the &euro;6.5 million a once off?</p> <p>  The Minister is transferring &euro;8 million from the sheep welfare scheme into other programmes.  There was a very sensible suggestion put forward relating to hill sheep - an additional &euro;5 given on hill sheep - especially given the pressure the sector is under with margins being so low.  I thought this was a worthy suggestion.  Has the Minister considered this proposal?  Perhaps he will clarify why he is not going down that route.</p> <p>  The Minister proposes to move additional funds into GLAS to bring it up to the 85% forward payment.  There were significant issues and difficulties last year in relation to GLAS but the Minister is moving &euro;14.5 million into it.  Given that the payments are due to start issuing next week, as the Minister indicated in his opening statement, how confident does he feel that the difficulties experienced last year will not be repeated this year?  With the commonage management plans, up to 9,000 applicants, or 20%, potentially have commonage.  An issue is brewing where payments may be delayed to those who have not been able to get their commonage management plans completed, which is the vast majority.  I honestly believe that a way should be found to pay them in advance pending the plans being completed.  They should not have to wait.  There were delays in the Department also in getting the system up and running and in making sure it was all in order.  It is important farmers are not left to feel the financial pain as a result of that.</p> <p>  I am aware that it is slightly off-topic but will the Minister comment on the areas that were burned?  Those farmers' payments are delayed.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to the hill burning that occurred earlier in 2017 with gorse burning.  Hills and commonages in particular were burned.  As a result farmers' single farm payments are delayed because their areas are declared ineligible.  It is a real issue for those involved.  It is tricky and messy and we need to find a resolution.  There are many genuine cases where things happen which are outside people's control.  While they may have had nothing to do with it, they had their hill burned and are now finding difficulties with their payment.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill made reference to the fodder scheme.  I echo his comments in that regard.  The Minister has said that he will look at the scheme in due course.  Perhaps the Minister will define what he means by "in due course".  Given the fact that the issue is recognised, would it not be appropriate to put a small fund in place sufficient to provide assistance to these farmers?  This would mean that where the Teagasc assessment identifies farmers in difficulty early engagement and assistance would be given.  This is especially relevant in the provision of concentrates.  By providing some concentrates, or funding towards concentrates, at an early stage it can take the pressure off, increasing prices for roughage fodder.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-11-28a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1285" speakername="Michael Creed" time="18:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGS2017112800002#C01200"><p>I thank Deputy McConalogue for his questions.  With regard to the underspend, it is important to put it in the context of the Department's overall budget of &euro;2.5 billion.  The underspend is less than 2%.</p><p>In the context of trying to manage departmental expenditure of this scale, it is quite a fine act to bring in the expenditure as close as that.  The fact that 70% of the Department's expenditure is concentrated in the last quarter of the year makes the management of that expenditure quite a challenge.</p><p> The issue of GLAS payments has been mentioned.  I am advised that our systems will be fit for purpose when we hit the "pay" button later this week.  Obviously, certain issues are outside the control of the Department.  Last year's issues are well documented.  We are hoping against hope that all of the thousands of outstanding nutrient management plans will come in to enable us to pay all farmers for whom that is the issue.  A completed commonage management plan is no longer required.  My understanding is that as long as the adviser has commenced the uploading of the plan, and this is registered with the Department's online system, that should be sufficient to clear the way for payment.  The advice we received during our engagement with planners was that they started the process of compiling commonage management plans a considerable time ago.  All that remains is for them to engage with the Department's online system to upload those plans.  When we have received evidence of such engagement, the commonage management plans will not be an impediment to the releasing of payments.  We are on target to pay the maximum possible number of people the 85% advance on the basis that the planners have started commencing the nutrient management and commonage management plans.  Approximately 3,300 nutrient management plans are still outstanding.  They are coming in at a good rate.  We will hit the "pay" button this week.  We will do another payment next week.  As they come in, we will be able to approve them for payment.  The additional funding for Bord Bia is a once-off payment.</p><p> The sheep welfare scheme is designed and approved by the Commission on the basis of costs incurred and income foregone.  I appreciate the difficulties that are being experienced in the hill sheep sector.  If we wanted to top up the payment, we would need to have incurred an expenditure of an equivalent amount to the top-up amount.  This would involve going back to the Commission.  If one looks at the simple mathematics of it, one will see that it involved &euro;10 for 2.5 million ewes.  We did not get 2.5 million ewes.  We will open the scheme again if more people want to participate in it.  It is not open to us to make the payment for which the Deputy is calling.</p><p> There is not much I can add in respect of the fodder issue.  I think it is appropriate to ask.  If we did this in reverse - if we committed public funds without the appropriate input - we would be rightly questioned about that in the Oireachtas and by other public expenditure watchdogs.  We have to make sure everything we do is based on an analysis of the situation.  That is what Teagasc is currently doing.</p><p> I am aware that burnt land is an issue.  I understand that a couple of hundred farmers, or maybe fewer, are involved.  Deputies will recall that in the first half of this year, an outcry followed the media coverage of hill burning that was taking place outside the timelines for burning.  I suppose this is a follow-through on it.  The Department deals with these files on a case-by-case basis.  It assesses the evidence available to it in each case.  Landowners are entitled to exhaust an appeals process.  Nobody wants to see a bona fide victim of unauthorised burning by somebody else having his or her basic payment reduced for that reason.  Equally, we do not want to see a wanton disregard for the terms and conditions of the scheme.  The number of people affected has been distilled down from a far larger number of land owners to a relatively small cohort of people who are entitled to and should avail of the appeals process that is open to them.  I hope we reach a point where everybody gets a fair hearing in respect of what has happened on his or her individual holdings.  The Department's eligible land is also subject to audit by EU auditors in respect of this issue.  We have to be able to stand over our systems so that we do not end up costing the State money as a consequence of non-compliance with land eligibility issues.  It is a question of trying to find an appropriate balance.  The scale of these problems is relatively small.  Obviously, it is a blow for any individual farmer to receive a letter like this.  At the time, these fires attracted considerable adverse publicity because they were significantly outside the time permitted for burning and were of a scale that led to many difficulties.  The Department was obliged to respond.  Farmers should exhaust the process that exists in order to ascertain what the outcome will be at the end of the day.</p></speech>

It was not mentioned in the budget.  Is the spending on target?  People have complained to me that approvals are coming very slowly at the moment.  The Minister has not mentioned whether expenditure on TAMS is in deficit.  Perhaps there has been an overspend.  TAMS has not been mentioned.</p></speech>

There is no doubt we have a challenge with TAMS.  There is no issue on the Department's side with TAMS payments.  The issue relates to delays in the submission of claims data.  We are issuing approvals for farmers in respect of the tranche 8 of TAMS, which is the latest tranche.  The provision we have made on the capital side in the current year is more than the amount that will be actually drawn down on the capital side.  We have a capacity to carry more than &euro;24 million in capital from one year to the next.  We have issued approvals, but some farmers have not applied for one reason or another.  They might not apply for good reasons; for example, they might not be in a financial position to carry out the works at a given time.  Since tranche 6 or tranche 7, we have been making the approvals subject to timelines.  There is a 12-month approval for buildings and a six-month approval for plants.  We have done this to improve our capacity to manage the cashflow in the Department.  In that context, there is provision for applicants to reapply when the timeline is exhausted or to apply for an extension of the works that have commenced but not concluded.</p></speech>

If I understood him correctly, he indicated that the plans will not have to be uploaded and completed in full and suggested that if a planner has engaged with the online system in some way, it will be possible for the payment to be processed.  I ask him to let us know how much engagement is required to satisfy what is needed for payments to be made.</p> <p>  I acknowledge the diligence of the staff of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Like many other members of this committee, I submit many queries.  I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of the officials.  We can have disputes at times, but I acknowledge that the staff are certainly responsive and do their best to engage with and respond to the issues that are raised.  I thank them.</p></speech>

Payments will issue in these cases and in all other cases</p> <p>as commonage management plans are commenced on the system.  My understanding, which is subject to correction, is that this process can be commenced but not completed.  In some cases, there might be a degree of work to be done to complete the plan.</p><p>However, once a farmer engages, he or she leaves an electronic thumbprint, I presume, and there is some measurement of the advisor on the system that is sufficient to clear those farmers for payment.  The fact is that it has been out there so long.  We do not require full completion.  As long as farmers have engaged with the system and put something up, they will be cleared for payment.  That is not an unreasonable compromise in the circumstances.</p><p> We hope that the outstanding nutrient management plans and commonage management plans will arrive in sufficient numbers to enable us to pay practically all applicants.</p></speech>

I have always found the officials most helpful - I wish to recognise that.  Indeed, often I go off-script to ask them about various things.

I hope that when I leave here I will have something to leave behind.</p></speech>

The underspend is significant.  I support unequivocally what the Minister is doing in terms of subsuming the savings into various critical areas that need additional funding.  The aim is to meet targets like the 85% advances, which is most useful.  There is a &euro;12 million underspend in that area.  Is it difficult to recruit in that area?  What was the projected level of recruitment?  What specific areas were targeted?  Was the recruitment for Teagasc advisers or specialists or researchers?  Many good young agricultural graduates are coming on stream and I imagine they would be delighted to get into the Department to learn and get some experience before moving out.</p> <p>  Considerable work is done on inspections.  We know the Department is reviewing the Agriculture Appeals Act.  The quicker the review, the better.  I read with some alarm two articles by Darragh McCullough in the past two weeks.  The reports would make a person's hair stand on end.  I know that Department officials and those dealing with it are somewhat numbed as well in so far as they appear to be perplexed by the complexity of the various things they have to deal with.  These things are imposed by Europe - I am not saying they are imposed by Department officials.  Certainly, we need to streamline this area, especially if people are dropping out because of the associated complexity and because the eligibility criteria are so strict.</p> <p>  My next question relates to targeted agricultural modernisation schemes.  Let us suppose someone is spending &euro;45,000 or &euro;50,000 and buys a big bulk tank or new milking machine.  What happens if Department officials arrive the following day and the farmer has everything there and is using the machinery, but then is knocked back?  A person can have all the degrees in the world &ndash; I have gathered a few in my time &ndash; but if there is no common sense then no degree is worth a sugar.  I know that myself.  I have one case going into the Department and the details of it are frightening.  The person is an extremely hard worker and is working desperately.  He is spending &euro;60,000 or &euro;70,000.  He is in for 40%.  His is putting in new robotic milking apparatus.  I think someone arrived.  The matter is with the Minister now.  We are in the middle of appeals and whinges and everything else.  I think we have to bring some common sense to these matters.  He bought the machinery because of the incentive provided by the TAMS measure.  Otherwise, he would not be on the pitch at all.  The Department's position will come as some slap to him and he will be &euro;30,000 or &euro;40,000 out.  We have to bring some common sense to it.  I realise we must have rules and regulations, but he did not start it one month, three weeks or a week in advance - it was one day ahead.  </p> <p>  A great friend of mine down in Mullingar used to scourge everyone.  His name is Eunan Bannon.  He was a sheep man.  He always wanted this welfare arrangement.  He was a great advocate of the welfare sheep.</p></speech>

I am actually surprised by it.  This relates to one of the things we had before the current Minister assumed office.  His predecessor had a major campaign to get this scheme brought in.  In fairness, the Department provided the money.  Now, however, it is not being taken up.  I would be delighted to remind the former Minister about it &ndash; I will probably meet him tomorrow night somewhere.  I will tell him that people did not take it up.  Is it because of two health-related actions?  Are they part of the problem?  I cannot see it.  Have Department officials given any thought to what has led to this significant shortfall in the anticipated numbers that would participate?</p> <p>  I am a great advocate of the beef genomics scheme.  I am glad to see Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v raising the matter.  Deputy McConalogue, Deputy Cahill and myself have had some significant clashes on it.  I was a strong advocate and I think it is important.  In fairness, it is useful but there are large numbers of technical requirements.  I have a brother involved and he is a relaxed person.  There is such a level of technicality involved that one could overstep and lose.  That is the problem.  I am beginning to wonder about some of the management requirements.  Will the Minister arrange for some officials to examine which of the management requirements are the biggest blocks to people participating?  The numbers involved in part 2 of the beef data and genomics programme are disappointing.  I thought the programme would get another 5,000 or 6,000 participants.  I believe the potential of this scheme is over 30,000 or thereabouts.</p></speech>

He is great.   I would like to know what the major drawback is.</p> <p>  Another thing surprises me.  The Minister came through the system.  He was in Macra na Feirme and many other organisations.  Macra na Feirme has been advocating for a renewal of the installation aid scheme.  The Minister has done a good deal for young farmers, in fairness.  When a young person is taking over a farm many hidden extras arise.  In fairness, the Minister has done a good deal in the recent budget and recent changes have been most helpful.  I was a great advocate of the installation aid scheme.  It was only &euro;7,500 but that aid was vital.  I know many young farmers took over during the 1990s and that was great.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill made reference to the Brexit loan scheme and I know what he means.  He referred to the scheme by analogy as a cash flow scheme brought in by the Minister.  I hope the &euro;25 million will help ordinary farmers with the response to Brexit.  I hope it is not too curtailed.  I presume the Department will use the banks again for the Brexit loan scheme.  I presume it will be modelled on the previous scheme but I hope it is not as restrictive.</p> <p>  I am delighted with the Bord Bia measure.  One organisation I always advocate for is Bord Bia.  Bord Bia has done a great job and has a great record.  During Aidan Cotter's time in the organisation the amount of positive work done was extraordinary, as was the number of graduates trained.  Many of those who graduated through Bord Bia are all over the world.  A significant number are in America and they are being head-hunted.  That is a tribute to the skills they acquired from Bord Bia.  I would like to see more of them kept within Bord Bia.</p><p>With the wage structures available and the category of graduates coming from Bord Bia, they will be snapped up by other organisations.  We need them now and over the next three to five years.  This may be heresy but it is important that the Minister would go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and make a case for trying to retain a number of those people.  They are exceptionally good graduates and they are very talented.  I am acutely aware that a number of them are being head-hunted by various organisations in America.  As soon as they are in one job in America, they are head-hunted from that job.  It is not the most popular thing to say but because of what we must face over the next two or three years in the context of Brexit, we need those types of people with particular skills and expertise.  I would like to see us in the position to retain and reward them accordingly.</p></speech>

On the recruitment and savings element, my own take is that the embargo on recruitment for a number of years meant the age profile increased significantly.  We are now trying to recruit but we are also losing quite rapidly at the other end with people going to retirement early and just because they have reached the age.  We are running to stand still.  We are just about getting ahead of it now and part of that comes from recruiting people in mid-year or the back end of the year, so we are not getting the full-year cost.  I am advised there is no particular sector where there is a specific shortage but it is across the Department.  We were hoping to get our staff numbers from just under 3,000 to 3,200 over the course of the past year.  We are starting to make better progress but it is, as I stated, a case of running flat out to just about get ahead of the attrition rate.</p> <p>  On the installation aid matter, a value-for-money audit was done on the scheme that was quite critical of it as an untargeted approach.  I do not know if the Department or the Comptroller and Auditor General did it.  At that stage one got the money and there was no specific obligation on what to do with it.  In recent years with the national reserve and young farmer top-up it costs as much and probably more than the installation aid but it has a specific focus.  If there is on-farm investment, there will be a 60% grant and priority access to the national reserve for young farmers.  These are practical and more focused elements.  I appreciate there are hidden expenses to taking over a farm and installation aid money was important for that.  Some of those expenses were related to improving the infrastructure on the farm, which now has a higher rate of targeted grant aid.</p> <p>  I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy's comments about Bord Bia.  Not to tell the committee its business but perhaps it would be a very useful exercise to invite delegates from Bord Bia before it.</p></speech>

They are being resourced to do it.  They are highly motivated people.  The matter of staff recruitment and retention is inexorably tied up with public sector pay and it would be very difficult to specifically ring-fence this for Bord Bia when there is a host of other sectors in the economy seeking higher than the average pay increases.  They do an excellent job.</p> <p>  We are not quite sure why there has not been full take-up in the sheep welfare scheme.  The scheme was designed in very close consultation with farm organisations and it is very practical.  It is designed for the needs of both the hill sheep farmer side and the lowland farmer.  There are options that can be used.  We were surprised we did not have closer to a full take-up.  In any scheme that might happen.  Now that the first tranche of claimants are out there and we will re-open it, we hope to see more people coming in.  It is a very simple scheme to comply with.</p> <p>  The review of the appeal system is up and running.  I have a slightly different view that we should be careful what we wish for.  I believe the system worked reasonably well but the review is up and running and has eminent people involved with it.  Let us see where the chips will fall.  The agricultural appeals model is different from others and perhaps we should be glad it was somewhat different.  Let us see how this plays out.</p> <p>  On specific cases of the targeted agricultural modernisation schemes, TAMS, there is a requirement for a level of inspections.  I would like to think Department staff are, by and large, very practical people with such inspections.  That is my experience.  There are regulations, compliance and audits of which we must be cognisant.  If the Deputy has an individual case he would like to bring to our attention, we are certainly prepared to look at it.</p> <p>  I also believe in the beef data and genomics programme, BDGP.  It can bring a degree of scientific evidence to the industry that is required.  We have a very commercially focused dairy sector.  If we could get 30,000 to 40,000 highly focused commercial beef people, we would have a great foundation for an industry.  The problem is the industry is currently haphazard and fractured, with too many cattle movements and not enough cradle-to-grave operations on the beef side.  On that basis, too many people are trying to make a slice from an animal.  The BDGP has the potential to do for the beef side what genetic improvement has done for the dairy side over many years.  In any scheme, in due course we must look at it to see if it delivers and whether we need to tweak it.  We would have thought there would have been more applicants.  Apart from the few that came in, thousands of people were in it and left voluntarily.  There were nearly 5,000 who originally applied and did not activate their application.  The big challenge in the Irish agricultural industry is to drive a substantial cohort of commercial beef operations.  All the evidence is there, from the Teagasc farms on different soil types, that although the incomes may not be comparable with dairy, one can have a decent income in the beef sector if all the correct management decisions are being made.  BDGP is only one aspect and grassland management etc. is another.  It is a good scheme and in due course we will have to look at it and see if it is delivering and whether it should be tweaked etc.  It has great potential to deliver.</p></speech>

The people pay a deposit to secure equipment.  When they look for a grant they are penalised because they have part paid before they apply for the grant.  In the modern world, these people are forced to pay a deposit to secure a deal and this is a problem when they apply for a grant for the equipment.  It is occurring more frequently now and it must be addressed.  These people are not breaking any rules and the equipment has not been delivered.  They have put down a deposit to secure the deal and run into problems with grant approvals.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>May I also remind all parties to turn off their mobile phones as it interferes with the parliamentary reporters and the recording system, and our web streaming is adversely affected.</p><p>I wish to advise that any submissions or opening statements that you have made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>Our witnesses have kindly provided us with an opening statement but members have requested that the statement be taken as read.

A report was completed in 2015 and another report has just been completed.  What powers of enforcement does HIQA have, if any, in instances where service providers do not address findings of non-compliance?  I am asking this in the context of the failure on the part of Oberstown to demonstrate that single separation was being used in line with policy and that accurate records were being maintained on the use of single separation.  This was highlighted in the earlier report and is highlighted again in the most recent one.  What actions can HIQA take, given that it is a red-line issue in two reports?</p></speech>

We can take no action.  HIQA and the directorate of regulation has several different functions but in the context of children and children's services, we monitor.  In monitoring, we monitor against nationally mandated standards, we report our findings, we can escalate the risk within the context of the service provider and to Tusla and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs but we have absolutely no enforcement powers in that context.  We report and publish our findings and we escalate risk appropriately.  If it is an immediate risk, we will always ensure that it has been addressed because it has been escalated immediately.  However, the responsibility of the provider is to give us an action plan outlining what it intends to do.  We can re-monitor but we do not have any enforcement powers.</p></speech>

We regulate and monitor against nationally mandated standards.  However, we did meet both professors when they were conducting their own review.  We fed into that review and indeed, they would have commented - anecdotally -  on our findings, which correlated with their own findings.</p><p>The 90-odd recommendations in the report were aligned to many of our recommendations.  However, I would nuance that by saying we only saw the recommendations and have not seen the report.  Therefore it would be difficult for us to make an assessment of those recommendations without seeing the supporting findings and narrative to the recommendations.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding that, I want to understand HIQA's point of view and if she is comfortable now with the cultural and procedural changes and the improvements that have been articulated by the chairman of the board and the chief executive.  They have made a submission to this committee and I am pretty sure that Ms Dunnion has had sight of that submission.

We identified two major non-compliances and they were in the context of health care and the single separation.  They were major issues of non-compliance.  We assess any provider on how well they respond to risk.  We received a very positive response from Oberstown in the context of our findings.  While we have not inspected yet, we will do so in the near future and will review, in the context of that review inspection, the action plans as identified through the committee and to ourselves formally from Oberstown.</p></speech>

In respect of single separation, for example, we have the number of children who have experienced single separation and the number of incidents of single separation.  When we are going in, we take a sample over a period of time so we may look at individual children and follow them for a number of days in terms of their experiences, whether they have been in single separation or otherwise and the reasons for it.  We look at the application of the policy, the reason it has been there and how it is documented.  We ascertain whether we can see that the staff have been making every effort to make sure that children are removed from single separation as quickly as possible, because it is very important to bear in mind that single separation is to be a response as a result of extreme risk.  It should be an unusual intervention that is used by the staff team.</p></speech>

Presumably, it will use best international practice.  What is best international practice for the purposes of the HIQA inspections?  HIQA refers to how the authorisations for the approval of the use of single separation and the extension to the time spent in single separation were not always completed by managers in line with policy.  One can overcome that by documenting, time keeping and so on, but one must see the justification in the first instance for single separation.  As HIQA obviously has regard to best international practice, can Ms Boyle enlighten us as to what best international practice is?</p></speech>

The concept of restrictive practice is well known and restrictive practices are where a child's movement is impeded.  Naturally the young people in Oberstown are there by order of the courts or are there on remand, so their movement has been restricted anyway.  It could be medication that is prescribed, if it is a medical restrictive practice or it could be the environment that is restricted.</p><p>That is the case in single separation where the door is locked.  Best international practice shows that restrictive practices should apply for the shortest possible time, should be continuously reviewed and every effort should be made to avoid them.  When considering the issue of single separation and restrictive practices we must also bear in mind the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the need to provide for very basic human rights, for example, the rights to fresh air and reading material. </p></speech>

I perceive that cultural change is taking place in Oberstown and that it is moving towards a more positive disposition with regard to tackling these issues from a staffing point of view.  I also perceive that internal communications have dramatically improved.  Are my perceptions correct?</p></speech>

I saw change when I visited again this year and, while the process has not been completed, I certainly saw progress on many fronts.  In terms of the development of policy initiatives and completing research about the profile of young people, this gives a greater understanding of what children need in terms of placement planning.  While these are works in progress, I have certainly seen an improvement.</p></speech>

If there are real time improvements across all the HIQA standards, it will be necessary for members to see a copy of the Goldson and Hardwick report.  It is not enough that we have the recommendations without seeing what is in the body of the report.  While I understand that legal issues may arise in respect of the report, if the improvements are taking place in real time, I do not see any reason the committee cannot have regard to the report.  We need to have a greater interrogation of the Goldson and Hardwick report.  That may not be the correct name but those are the names of the report's authors.  We need to see what is in the report because it is a missing piece of the jigsaw.  I have no further questions and I thank Ms Boyle for her time.</p></speech>

Staff encourage the child to discuss why he or she acted in a particular and offer a solution.  Staff may decide to move the child from his or her bedroom to a general purpose room where there may be an activity and, initially, the child would interact with staff.  The child may go back to his or her room again, depending on how the interaction went.  Staff may decide to move the child again after a period of observation and talking to the child.  Staff may decide to allow the child to mix with another child.  It would mean there would be another child mixing with the child who has remained in his or her bedroom for single separation.  Depending on how that goes, staff may decide to allow the child to return to the group.  We have see instances where children, prior to being with their group or allowed to mix with another child, have gone to the yard outside for fresh air before returning to their bedroom.</p> <p>  A protection room is used in more extreme situations.  We have seen a reduction in the use of the protection room.  The room is specially designed for single separation.  It literally would not have a bed but a mattress may be put in for a child. </p></speech>

What resources and measures were put in place to prevent it happening even into half of that day, the rest of that day, not to mind going all the way to day eight before we managed to get fresh air?  Where are the witnesses going to go from here?  Do they plan to have an unannounced visit in the next three months?  Where does a red line go off here that this could be a continual practice?  Ms Boyle is saying that there was a good atmosphere so I am taking it that things are moving on.  To reassure the general public that this practice is becoming a forgotten practice in Oberstown unannounced visits need to start happening, do they not?</p></speech>

The provision of the service and the accountability for that service rests with the management of Oberstown.  Regarding the data that we reviewed that brought up this case, the action plan delivered from Oberstown would be to show adherence to the policy, monitoring of the policy, training staff in the policy and in its application.  When we conduct our unannounced inspection, or announced because we can do either, it will be reviewing the data to show what has been happening.  If there is a child in that position when we are there we will review the case itself.  However, it is looking at the data and ensuring that there is not a repeat of what we published as a major non-compliance in the context of single separation.</p></speech>

I have a few questions myself.  I visited Oberstown shortly after I was appointed Chairman of the committee.  I should have done so long before because it is in my constituency.  Having visited the facility for quite a number of hours there were a number of observations that I made in line with the witnesses' report.  I visited before I read the report.  I found it alarming that the State would invest such significant sums of money in a facility without adhering to the basic principles in other detention facilities albeit I accept entirely that we are talking about juveniles.  However, the basic principles are the same.</p> <p>  One was fire safety.  That was very clear and made very obvious to me when visiting.  At the back of the building one passes a fire door with a notice that it is blocked closed.  I  am not sure 4 x 4 would justify how large this piece of wood was jamming it closed because the security on the door was compromised.  Other basic principles like door sizes, frame sizes being all completely different, and locking systems being similar in my observation to domestic residences.  I know from that visit that Oberstown management were pleased that they had co-operation from the Irish Prison Service in the provision of their locks.  However, the fact that the State had expended so much money on a facility, and multiple elements within the same facility, without doing the basic research to me was not just shocking.  I have no idea what they were thinking.  I found that appalling not just that the witnesses had to go out and highlight the obvious.</p><p>The staff were put in a position whereby they could not guarantee the integrity of the building in which certain juveniles were being detained and-or assessed.  That was an observation I wanted to get off my chest since I visited the facility some months ago.  </p><p> My main question concerns the positives the witnesses have highlighted in the report in term of the response from staff and management in Oberstown.  It is very clear, having visited the centre and seen, for example, the profiling research which has been completed or is underway, that the basic responses which are being implemented on foot of the report are positive.  </p><p> Unfortunately, there are number of themes which I am aware the witnesses have been assessing for many years.  Ms Boyle referred to it being a learning curve, but elements have been left unaddressed.  </p><p> I refer to health, which is listed as an area of major non-compliance.  I do not have a specific question because the report clearly highlights some of the issues.  Can the witnesses tell me the most alarming elements and responses to them from Oberstown management in terms of the resolution to the highlighted sections?</p></speech>

That centred on a child who required a particular medication for an allergy, which staff had not been trained to administer.  In fairness, immediate action was taken and staff were trained.  A nurse gave a briefing to staff and staff on shift were trained, who then trained other staff to ensure the intervention would be put in place if required.</p> <p>  The second immediate action concerned the safe storage of medication.  We found keys left in a medication cabinet and there was concern that a child or young person could gain access to medication.  We were satisfied with the response, which ensured that keys were locked away and held securely.  The problem was dealt with on the day.  </p> <p>  In respect of other areas of concern in terms of health, we were concerned that some children experienced a delay in receiving medical attention and gave two examples in the report.  One child was delayed in getting an X-ray for security reasons.  That was of concern to us.</p> <p>  The campus management team have put in place a process whereby if there is a concern about a child requiring medical attention, such as security concerns, the matter goes to the level of chief operations officer who needs to look at arrangements which can be put in place in order for a child to access and receive appropriate medical attention.  </p></speech>

In regard to the overall process of implementation of the recommendations within the report, the witnesses mentioned that there will be areas where the facility will be compliant.  Since this report was written and any follow-ups completed, are there any particular areas to which the witnesses believe more attention should be given?</p></speech>

We received an updated action plan at the end of October, and we sought some clarification on particular issues in November.  As we have mentioned, the issue of the fire door will continue into next year.  Obviously, our preference would be for that to be completed within the calendar year, but we have been given reasons that was not possible.  However, it is making progress.</p></speech>

There is a supervision policy within the Oberstown centre.  Supervision is a two-way process.  It is about the manager ensuring the worker is doing his or her work, but it is also about having an opportunity for that staff member to have a one-to-one with his or her manager to discuss how he or she is progressing within his or her working environment and the direct work he or she is doing with children.  There is a supportive as well as a supervisory element to the process, which was something we highlighted.  We felt there was a need for regular supervision and clear records on the agreed outcomes as a result of the process.  However, we also saw that a critical incident debriefing process had been introduced on the campus.  That was a very positive move which allowed staff some time out after a difficult incident to review and talk about what had worked well and what had not and how they felt about it emotionally.  That was a new initiative, which was positive.  There are also other staff supports available through the human resources department.</p></speech>
