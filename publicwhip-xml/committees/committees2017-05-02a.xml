The Irish Council Against Blood Sports was founded in 1966 and is a voluntary organisation campaigning for an end to the hunting of wild animals with dogs and other cruel sports that exploit and abuse animals.  Greyhound racing and coursing are inherently cruel, resulting in the premature deaths of thousands of greyhounds annually, while in the region of 5,000 hares annually suffer terror and stress by being snatched from the wild, kept captive and used as live lures for greyhounds at coursing matches.  England, Scotland, Wales and our near neighbours, Northern Ireland, have banned hare coursing, leaving our Republic as the last outpost for this barbarism.<br/><br/>Last year there was an opportunity, with Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s Private Members' Bill, to rid the country of this wildlife abuse but, regrettably and shamefully, the majority of our legislators turned a blind eye to the cruelty and voted the Bill down.  This is despite the fact the majority of our citizens want to see hare coursing outlawed, as borne out in the most recent poll, scientifically conducted for RTE's Claire Byrne programme last February, which showed 64% wanted hare coursing banned.<br/><br/>Many people seem to think that because the greyhounds are muzzled in coursing, hares are not being injured and killed.  This is certainly not the case, as reports from national park rangers, who attend some of the meetings, show.  Hares are being struck, pinned down and mauled, and we ourselves have filmed such maulings.  Members may have seen the RTE footage of a hare being severely mauled by muzzled greyhounds at the national finals in Clonmel last February.  Let us hope that when this issue next comes before the Dail, our legislators will do the right thing and consign this barbarity to history.<br/><br/>What of the greyhounds themselves?  The natural lifespan of a greyhound averages 14 years but, in greyhound racing and coursing, for many, it is said to be a mere three to four years and many are also culled as pups if they are not deemed suitable for the track or coursing.  The ones that do go on to race must be winners to survive; if not, they are put down.  In fact, the Irish Coursing Club advises greyhound owners not to give away unwanted greyhounds - it says it is better to put them painlessly to sleep.  A greyhound trainer candidly remarked: &quot;I've seen dogs being shot.  It has to be done as there's too many of them to re-home.&rdquo;  The ones that are not put painlessly to sleep face a cruel fate.  In the recent RTE &quot;Prime Time&quot; programme on the greyhound industry, Marion Fitzgibbon of Limerick Animal Welfare, a tireless campaigner who has been rescuing abandoned greyhounds for decades, said:</p><blockquote>Very little money is diverted into greyhound welfare, and it&rsquo;s left to the small charities around Ireland to try and rescue as many of these as we possibly can, but we&rsquo;re fighting a losing battle.  We believe that there are maybe eight, nine, ten thousand put to sleep.  They can be killed in all sorts of fashions.  We&rsquo;ve had instances of finding them shot, ears cut off and brutalised, drowned or sold on to live in appalling states.</blockquote> <p>I would like to take this opportunity to commend RTE&rsquo;s &quot;Prime Time&quot; and Sharon N&iacute; Bheol&aacute;in for highlighting the dark side of greyhound racing, the doping and the cruelty.  This was a great example of public service broadcasting.  The public now know where their taxes are going &ndash; to fund a cruel, cheating, debt-ridden industry.<br/><br/>Although it is kept well hidden, the blooding of greyhounds, a common training method in the greyhound racing industry, using rabbits, hares and other small animals, is an open secret within the industry.  It is widely believed by greyhound owners and trainers that to keep a dog keen to follow the mechanical lure at the track, it must be blooded.  Many will have been appalled at the horrific footage, shown on RTE&rsquo;s &quot;Prime Time&quot; recently, of a tiny piglet, which was strapped to a moving lure at an Australian training track in 2014, being savaged by greyhounds as part of a blooding exercise.  An Irish greyhound handler, working for an Australian trainer, was shown taking part in the cruelty.  He is now back in Ireland and is active in the greyhound industry.  In 1994, there was a high profile case of blooding of greyhounds at a training track in Donaskeigh, County Tipperary.  Well known broadcaster and journalist, Donal MacIntyre, came to the private track to film for a BBC documentary on greyhound racing.  Cages of rabbits were brought to the track and the BBC cameraman was instructed to turn off the camera while the blooding took place.  However, the camera remained running and the horrific cruelty was recorded.  The dogs being blooded were those of a top Irish trainer at that time, whose son was present while the cruelty took place.<br/><br/>Greyhound commentator and journalist, the late John Martin, who was known for his warts and all assessments of the greyhound industry, wrote in the <i>Irish Independent</i>: </p><blockquote>The bald truth is that greyhound racing would not continue to exist without blooding.  It follows that, with a constant greyhound population of close on 30,000, blooding must be widespread.  Do not expect an admission of that from Bord na gCon.  To concede the point would be to accept that they are custodians of a sport whose very existence is based on blooding.</blockquote> <p>There are also growing concerns about the export of greyhounds to destinations with low standards of animal welfare and little or no enforcement of whatever weak legislation is in place.  It emerged last year that Irish greyhounds were being exported to the Canidrome track in Macau, the only region of China where gambling is legal, with racing five nights a week on a track that is deemed to be too hard, resulting in injuries to dogs.  If a greyhound does not finish in the top three in five races in a row, it is destroyed.  It is reported that around 400 dogs are killed by lethal injection each year and every greyhound arriving at the track is dead within three years, according to animal welfare groups on the ground there.  There are also grave concerns about the export of Irish greyhounds to other Asian countries, including Pakistan, a country where horrendous animal cruelty takes place and where greyhounds are raced in tremendous heat.  We have compiled a list of 200 Irish dogs now in Pakistan and we suspect there are many more.  Irish greyhounds are also exported to Spain, where greyhounds or galgos are used to hunt hares in the countryside.  At the end of the hunting season, when they are no longer needed, they are abandoned, released onto busy motorways, hung from trees, thrown down wells and even burned to death or left with broken bones to starve to death.  Deputy Tommy Broughan has recently introduced a Private Member&rsquo;s amendment Bill to prevent the export of greyhounds to destinations<br/><br/>with poor animal welfare legislation and standards and it is to be hoped this will be addressed in the Greyhound Industry Bill 2017.</p><p> There is a serious problem in this country regarding the doping of greyhounds.  The Morris review, commissioned by Bord na gCon, and published in July 2016, was particularly damning.  It was critical of Bord na gCon's oversight of the problem, stating that the board's current sampling strategy was "too routine" with a perception of "no element of surprise" and that the existing functions of the control committee were "seriously hampered".  The RTE "Prime Time" programme cited a number of high profile cases of doping, and demonstrated how easy it was for cheating dog owners to buy performance enhancing drugs online.  It is the unfortunate greyhounds that suffer, having hard core drugs pumped into them, which can have long-lasting detrimental effects on their health.  It seems Britain, which imports a huge number of dogs from Ireland, view Ireland as the doping capital of the world when it comes to greyhounds.</p><p> It simply cannot be denied that cruelty is inherent and endemic in the greyhound racing and coursing industry, with a racing greyhound's life cut short, the killing and abandonment of greyhounds that have outlived their usefulness, the doping of greyhounds, hares used as live bait in coursing, and the use of live animals to blood greyhounds.  We believe it is an industry that cannot be cleaned up or rehabilitated.  We do not believe that the proposed Greyhound Industry Bill 2017 will see any improvements for the welfare of greyhounds and hares.  The cruelty will continue, as will the cheating, but at the very least, there should be complete transparency and accountability in terms of what becomes of an unwanted greyhound, once it is no longer winning on the track or the coursing field.  The entire life of a greyhound bred for the greyhound industry should be tracked from birth to death, including to where it is exported.  We strongly contend that greyhound racing should not be funded by the people of Ireland, the majority of whom are opposed to the abuse and exploitation of defenceless animals.  Instead, that considerable funding should be redirected to the hard pressed and underfunded animal rescue groups, most of which are getting crumbs from the table in grants from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Una Jansen" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017050200002#E00200"><p>I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee.  I am spokesperson for the Greyhound Rescue Association Ireland, GRAI.  I am accompanied by my colleagues, Ms Jessica Reid and Ms Margaret Moran.  Our organisation was set up in 2010.  We are an entirely voluntary organisation.  We were founded as an umbrella group of animal rescues, which were taking in large numbers of Irish racing greyhounds, and people who were concerned about greyhound welfare in Ireland.  Our primary purpose at the outset was to promote greyhounds as pets in Ireland and to advocate for improvements in greyhound welfare, and I am pleased that there has been progress in both of these areas in recent years.  We believe, however, that we have a lot further to go before we can honestly say that we have a reasonable level of greyhound welfare in Ireland.</p> <p>  Since our organisation was established, there has been a substantial increase in the engagement of the public with animal welfare matters.  We have recently witnessed public outrage over the puppy farm scandals and international protests at dog meat festivals in China.  An estimated 74% of Irish people use social media and it is thanks to sites like Facebook and Twitter that more and more people are becoming aware of, and interested in, animal welfare.  Social media has had a big role to play in the decline of greyhound racing in Ireland.  As greyhounds become more popular as pets, public perception of the breed is changing and people no longer view them just as racing dogs.  The reputation of greyhound racing has suffered greatly as a result of numerous scandals involving doping, animal cruelty and mismanagement of funds.  RTE's "Prime Time" recently aired a feature on the doping of greyhounds within the industry, and several newspaper articles have exposed what has been coined as "the grim underbelly of the greyhound industry".  The impact of these scandals has been felt at every track and it is the reason that when somebody suggests holding the work Christmas party at a greyhound track, in almost every office now, there is somebody else who will have ethical reservations.  </p> <p>  Along with many individuals and organisations, GRAI has tried for many years to put an accurate number of the number of registered greyhounds in Ireland to no avail, due to the fact that litters, rather than individual greyhounds, are registered with the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, and only details of the individual greyhounds registered-named for racing can be viewed on the IGB and ICC websites.  The status of each greyhound named and registered is not always accurate.  Greyhounds can be sold abroad, retired for breeding, die of natural causes, be abandoned, or be destroyed legally or illegally, and the data are never recorded.  It is unacceptable in this day and age that registered racing greyhounds go missing.  A system exists for cattle whereby every head is accounted for and, therefore, we know it can be done.  Until a system accounting for every registered greyhound is put in place, we cannot seriously say that we have true concern for greyhound welfare in Ireland.</p> <p>  The IGB and the greyhound industry has received a total of &euro;99.36 million from the public purse since 2010.  That is almost &euro;100 million for an organisation that is unable to accurately state the number of dogs involved in the industry.  With public funding comes public accountability and a need for transparency in the form of a proper system capable of monitoring every greyhound in Ireland from whelping until death.  Greyhound owners must be held accountable for the dogs in their care.  If a dog is destroyed, then the owners should provide a certificate from a veterinarian to prove that it was done humanely.  If a dog is sold, a change of ownership form should be submitted to the IGB and if an owner or trainer is inspected and he or she cannot account for dogs registered to their care, there needs to be serious and long lasting repercussions for him or her.</p> <p>  Greyhounds continue to turn up in pounds and rescues across the country in their hundreds and the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust, IGRT, has none of the resources required to deal with these dogs.  We are told time and again by greyhound owners and trainers that they are not prepared to wait for months for an IGRT place to come up.  Greyhounds that are healthy and could be re-homed are being destroyed because there are no kennels to go to.  There are many small, independent dog rescues around Ireland doing their best to help out with these dogs but with no financial support from the IGB, it is impossible to keep up with the flood of dogs needing homes.  In spite of this, in April 2016, the IGB implemented a &euro;700,000 breeding incentive programme to encourage people to breed more greyhounds.  GRAI was deeply disappointed to hear of this programme.  In a shrinking greyhound industry, it makes absolutely no sense to increase breeding and it was even more disheartening that no additional funding whatsoever was allocated to re-homing.  The IRGT does not even have one re-homing centre; its British counterpart has 65.   The trust receives the most recent data available.  By comparison, in the same year, the British RGT received &pound;1.4 million.  Indeed, the Indecon report of 2014 recommended a significant increase in funding to re-homing organisations but we have seen nothing to date.</p> <p>  There are other issues in the industry which GRAI believes need to be addressed but we believe that the three of most concern are lack of traceability, lack of funding for re-homing organisations and the need for greyhound breeding to be decreased.  We appreciate that the issue of exports could not be accommodated in these amendments at this time.  However, areas of exports do raise huge concerns for GRAI and we look forward to the progression of the recently proposed amendments for this Bill tabled by Deputy Tommy Broughan.  We hope to see deserved time and support given to it.  It is most encouraging to see that the Department is reviewing greyhound welfare legislation and we are cautiously optimistic about the results of today's session.</p></speech>

I will direct my first question to the council.  It is clear from its presentation that it has reached the conclusion that there is no future for the greyhound racing industry and it is beyond reform.  I would like to tease that out.  GRAI appears to be more measured in its outlook with respect to traceability and so on.  Perhaps I am wrong but GRAI's view seems to be that if strong legislation is put in place, traceability can be addressed and doping eliminated.</p><p>I am sure there is general agreement that we should ban the export of animals to countries that do not treat them humanely but we should first sort out our own practices and ensure they are humane.  Is there a happy medium in terms of animal welfare?  Does the council believe that greyhound racing should be banned in Ireland?  Can it suggest legislative proposals that will address their concerns?  I am sure decent people agree with many of its concerns.  A high percentage of people in Ireland own dogs and are increasingly concerned about the welfare of dogs.  It is unacceptable to have a sport that does not guarantee their welfare.  I want to tease this matter out with the council.    </p><p> I have a similar question for the Greyhound Rescue Association of Ireland.  Have I misrepresented or misinterpreted its point of view?  Does it believe there is a space for greyhound racing if we address a range of concerns, in particular accountability and traceability, and practices are put in place?  Do both organisations believe there is a happy medium?   </p></speech>

I was struck by the fact that there is no traceability.  We must deal with the issue and consider where it can be applied.  Can the delegations give examples of best practice in other countries that have traceability and identify them?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.17" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aideen Yourell" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017050200002#F00400"><p>We do not object to dogs racing around a track per se.  We are concerned about what goes on behind the scenes.  The practice of blooding greyhounds by using small animals shall continue and will never be stamped out.  People believe that they must blood greyhounds in order to keep them keen for the track.  The practice is well hidden.  Perhaps the members of committee saw the very distressing Australian example that was shown in a "Prime Time" programme where people deliberately blooded their greyhounds.  They strapped a little piglet to a mechanical lure to attract a dog and let the dog savage it.  Such activities are quite normal for these people and, sadly, it is quite normal in this country.  Greyhound racing is okay but how they are trained is the problem.  I do not know how one can stamp out blooding with legislation because it cannot be enforced as it is done out of sight.  What can be done?</p> <p>  Doping will continue because people keep discovering drugs that can beat the system.  I know that the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, has bought a big machine, which is supposed to be wonderful.  How can technology keep up and tackle the problem of doping?   </p></speech>

We make laws in this building all of the time.  We measure the success of every law by the way that it is enforced.  Ms Yourell has expressed her concern about whether suitable legislation can be enforced.  Is there a way forward?  She has indicated that her organisation is not opposed to the principle of dogs racing around a track but it would like assurances in legislation.  I interpreted her presentation as saying greyhound racing is beyond saving.</p></speech>

Let us consider what happens overseas.  As many as 40 states of America have banned dog racing and the remaining states have no tracks.  Argentina has completely banned dog racing.  The industry in Australia is on its knees and it is only a matter of time before the rug is whipped out from underneath the industry.  I want to express my thanks to former New South Wales Premier Baird for raising concerns about animal welfare.  Cruelty will be a feature of any industry that views animals as entertainment and a way to make a profit.</p> <p>  The greyhound racing tracks in the UK are falling like dominos.  Greyhound racing tracks, like the one at Harold's Cross, formed a stable part of the industry in the past but they have now admitted defeat and shut their doors.  People who operated within the industry bubble never foresaw a decline.  The industry has declined too far to be saved.  I shall touch on what has been said about social media.  The public worldwide has brought the industry to its knees and it cannot be saved.  </p> <p>  In terms of exports, an enormous amount of dogs are still being thrown in on top of an industry that is on its knees, cannot cope, cannot recover and does not have public support.  The industry no longer has the support of companies that were once very willing to provide sponsorship.  Those companies now know that their business and personal credibility would take a nosedive overnight if they were involved in the industry.  They do not want to be associated with the industry in any shape or form. </p> <p>  We are still on top of many issues, including overbreeding.  A vulgar amount of taxpayers' money is piled in on top of this issue that is like an abyss.  The money acts like a quick catch-up until the next year comes around but the same debts arise again.  The industry is never going to recover.  We have reached the point where we must admit defeat.  The greyhound industry is old fashioned and very cruel.  The dogs never win and are never prioritised.  The industry's only priority is making a profit, which is how it has always been.  The dogs are an afterthought . </p> <p>  I have given a home to two greyhounds so I can talk about how incredibly docile, friendly and sociable these dogs are.  The breed has a great nature and personality.  I am appalled by what they must endure and have been forced to do all in the name of entertainment.   The racing itself takes a toll on their bodies.  All of that pales into insignificance when compared with what these animals can give back in a home environment.  I have three young kids and I also have a cat and two other dogs.  One of my rescued greyhounds is a survivor of the dogmeat trade in China.  He came from the underbelly of the slaughterhouses that are located on the outskirts of Shanghai.  Due to the horrific demands placed on his body and the conditions he had to endure he was dispensed with.  When his previous owner or breeder did not see a return for their training he was sold to the slaughterhouses in China.  He was next on the list to be dispatched when he was rescued.  My dog's name is Legend and he is the most amazing, friendly and sociable dog but he is just one dog of many that have suffered.  I have been around so many greyhounds in high energy circumstances.  Greyhounds are an incredible breed.  I have witnessed how they positively react to social settings such as public campaigns to raise awareness of their plight.  We must no longer view them as money making machines and just view them the same as any other domestic breed.</p><p>They are entitled to that.  This industry has done them no good.  It continues to leave them last on its list of priorities.  The industry needs to step back and, once and for all, help this country's rescued dogs in particular.  The situation in terms of pounds and rescued dogs is at crisis level.  They are depending on public support.  I do not know how they manage expenses such as vet bills and neutering dogs on a daily basis.</p><p> It should be top of the list of priorities that our dogs are neutered before being sent abroad.  This is another horrific side of the industry.  Why are all dogs not neutered before being sent abroad?  They are being sent to heinous conditions and surroundings and to temperatures that their respiratory systems cannot deal with.  Greyhounds are a unique breed in that it has been scientifically proven that high temperatures make their systems overheat at a much faster rate than any other dog.  However, our country and our Government ship our unwanted dogs abroad instead of investing in them and helping our country's rescued dogs.  The Government should do right by our dogs and our so-called unwanted dogs and help the public perception shift a little bit more.  Is that not the very least that we owe these dogs?</p></speech>

It is in Bord na gCon's interest to improve things.  People will respond to that.  Many people have a question mark in their minds over whether the industry is ethical or not.  They wonder what happens to dogs after the track.  If some reassurances were to be given and if the greyhound industry was to balance things out by giving more funding to rescue organisations and by putting in place a proper retired greyhound trust similar to that in operation in the United Kingdom, people&rsquo;s concerns would be reduced a little.  If the legislation is amended, these changes are implemented and the required measures put in place, it would ultimately benefit the industry both financially and in terms of getting rid of abuses such as drugging and the welfare issues.</p> <p>  Senator Mac Lochlainn&rsquo;s interpretation of our stance is correct.  We believe there is an opportunity to improve things in the greyhound industry.</p> <p>  Perhaps Deputy Martin Kenny could remind me of his question.</p></speech>

However, there is a system in this country for monitoring every single head of livestock.  It has been in operation for a significant period of time.  Micro-chipping has been compulsory since last year and every registered greyhound in this country has a tattoo.  Therefore, we have the data and we have the software which can be used to put a proper traceability system into operation.  We cannot accurately monitor how we are doing until we have that system in operation.  We cannot measure welfare in this country until we can accurately state how many racing greyhounds we have, where they are, and what is happening to them.  As there is not a good system in place elsewhere, there is an opportunity for Ireland to be a world leader in this regard.</p></speech>

They have put forward very good cases on their respective behalves.  I am a greyhound owner and I am a director of a greyhound track.</p> <p>  The point on animal welfare is well made.  If our industry is to prosper in the future, more resources must be allocated to dog welfare.  This Bill will address that issue.  In the past, Bord na gCon has not put enough resources into dog welfare.</p> <p>  A point was made that doping is widespread in the greyhound industry.  According to the Indecon report, in 2011 some 0.9% of tested dogs tested positive.  That dropped to 0.8% in 2012 and 0.7% in 2013.  An analysis of the majority of the dogs which tested positive showed that traces of substances in the dogs&rsquo; feed resulted in the positive tests.  This has been conclusively proven.  Unfortunately, there have been several high profile cases where dog trainers took legal action regarding the test results and proved conclusively that the positive doping test was due to the animal feed.  The myth that doping is widespread in the greyhound industry has to be put to bed.  The figures are there to show that is not the case.</p> <p>  The other myth is that dogs are not looked after.  There will always be exceptions in an industry as widespread as this one.  A small minority of owners will not look after the welfare of their greyhounds.  However, in the vast majority of cases, dogs are very well looked after and very well minded.  It has been said that dogs are money-making machines.  In my experience of greyhounds, they are definitely not.  The vast majority of greyhound owners look after their dogs very well.  If one were to go to a greyhound establishment where a bitch is being whelped, one would see the level of comfort that is provided.  There would be an infrared lamp over the pups, the litter under the dogs would be very dry and they would be minded exceptionally well.  The owner would get up two or three times a night to look after the pups during their first week to ensure that they are adequately fed and comfortable.  A sweeping statement that greyhounds are not being treated well is incorrect.  There will always be exceptions to the rule.  When this legislation is enacted, hopefully we will be able to root out those who are doing the industry&rsquo;s reputation no good whatsoever.  There have been instances of dogs being stolen from premises and of people poaching dogs.  That is illegal and hopefully it can be stamped out.</p> <p>  This Bill will go some way towards addressing the concerns of today&rsquo;s witnesses.  The welfare of greyhounds is paramount for us all.  To get public opinion behind our sport, it is essential that the Bill looks after the welfare of dogs.  When this Bill is enacted, the myths about widespread doping will be put to bed once and for all.  That will be to the benefit of us all.</p> <p>  I am looking forward to working constructively with the witnesses to scrutinise the Bill.  When it is enacted, it will hopefully be to the benefit of an industry which I will not put into the graveyard just yet.</p></speech>

As Deputy Cahill has said, head 2 provides a basis for administrative sanctions as opposed to criminal sanctions for breach of the greyhound racing rules.  Would administrative sanctions be sufficient deterrent to those in breach of the greyhound racing rules?  The witnesses might also comment on the appropriateness of administrative sanctions as opposed to criminal ones.</p><p>They might give us their opinion on what nature of sanctions they would like to see the Irish Greyhound Board applying for welfare-related offences.</p></speech>

Until very recently, the Irish Greyhound Board did not have laboratories that were able to test properly for stanozolol, an anabolic steroid commonly used in greyhound racing.  Up until this year, the board was only able to test for the presence of a water-based dose in a urine sample.  As all greyhound trainers and owners are aware, that steroid does not show up in those tests.  It can only be identified in a blood test for an oil-based dose.  As the greyhound industry laboratories were not able to test properly for this drug, we did not have accurate figures for its use.  Last year, the Greyhound Board of Great Britain issued a statement to its members advising them to exercise extreme caution in buying dogs from Ireland because of the endemic use of this anabolic steroid.  Additionally, as is documented in appendix 2 of our written submission, there have been several cases of greyhound trainers and owners, some of whom are extremely high profile, having judgments passed against them for drug use by the disciplinary committee of the Greyhound Board of Great Britain.  Until we have laboratories here that can test properly for drugs, we will not accurately know how deep the problem is.  We are hearing from greyhound trainers and owners all the time that drug use is endemic in the sport.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Cahill's comments on greyhound welfare.  Some greyhound owners and trainers treat their dogs extremely well.  However, we do have a huge issue of dogs disappearing.  Until we have a traceability system in place, we cannot accurately say that welfare is good.  While I do not dispute the fact that there are good greyhound owners, we also know that people are getting rid of dogs by shooting them or using bolt guns or are selling them into countries in which adequate welfare legislation is not in place.  We need to stamp out these practices in greyhound racing.</p></speech>

We would like to see much higher fines for what are serious issues.  We tend to see slap-on-the-wrist type fines of a couple of hundred euro here and there.  For a lot of trainers, it is considered the cost of doing business at this point.  We would like to see trainers who have significant breaches, whether in welfare, doping or other issues, banned from owning and racing dogs.  At the moment, the sanctions are considered laughable within the industry because they are so minute in terms of actual repercussions.  Anyone in the UK who is caught with a welfare or doping breach suffers much more severe penalties.  This is not reflected in the Irish system.</p></speech>

For example, if one dog tests positive for a substance, the owner's other dogs should also be tested.  There should be routine checks on these people for up to two or three years afterwards to ensure they have not reverted back to that behaviour.</p></speech>

The Irish Council Against Blood Sports seems basically to say that the industry is close to being irredeemable, particularly at an international level; that it is beyond the point of rescue and the only way forward is to effectively ban it outright.  That is what I take from the witnesses' submission.  It is a dangerous precedent to tar everybody with the same brush in the greyhound industry.  A lot of owners and so on look after their animals with great care and it is important to make that distinction.</p> <p>  It is important that the legislative objectives of the greyhound industry Bill 2017 should be considered.  Implicit in the Bill are the objectives of the Indecon and Morris reports and indeed those of the 2016 report brought forward from this committee, which proposed a number of measures to secure significant improvements in welfare and to deter and cut out this doping, which is rampant - there is no doubt about that.  I accept what people are saying about doping in their submissions.  The aim of the legislation is to effect a cradle-to-grave level of supervision and protection of animals involved in the industry.  That means dealing with traceability, microchipping, dog breeding, sales of dogs, greyhound welfare, puppy farming, smuggling and breeding, which we have read about, as well as the exporting of greyhounds.  This Bill is weak on the issue of exporting dogs.  Both groups have raised the question and it was very fairly put.  Why would we send our greyhounds to countries that have little or no animal welfare legislation?  It is a very important point and was well made by both groups.  It is addressed in the Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill 2017.  It would be remiss of us not to focus on the issue and incorporate elements of that Bill when we make a submission.  There are detailed measures to prevent cruelty and things like that.</p> <p>  Head 9 in the general scheme of the Bill, which deals with an amendment to the principal Act, allows the greyhound board to use funds to enhance the welfare of greyhounds.  Can any of the witnesses comment generally on the need for additional funding to improve racing greyhound welfare?  What level of additional funding do they feel is necessary to ensure and secure its enhancement?  How would those funds be best employed?  I know the Dogs Trust and the local greyhound rescue groups - I see Ms Margaret Moran here - so I am aware of the work they do and the fundraising they must partake in to achieve their objectives.  </p> <p>  Abandonment of greyhounds is obviously a huge issue.  I know the witnesses are involved in that.  Could they give us an outline of the current level of abandonment as they are aware of it?  How could we deal with it in the legislation?  Are there particular measures that should be included in the Bill to augment or supplement current welfare legislation?</p><p>We have about ten pieces of legislation dealing with animal welfare.  Some legislation has achieved its objective but others Acts need refinement, upgrading and improvement.  We have legislation in place, some of which needs upgrading, but it begs the question put by the witness as to why we should send our greyhounds to places with no animal welfare legislation.  We are not in the top rankings, but if our dogs are sent to places with no regulation, it makes the case that this Bill can be significantly strengthened to achieve some of the objectives. </p><p> I would not subscribe to banning sport in any industry.  Improvements can be made.  We recognised the need for improvement when we prepared a report in that regard in 2016.  I thank the witnesses for highlighting issues that are enlightening and of help to members in the consideration of this Bill.</p></speech>

Their input has been very important to the pre-legislation scrutiny of the general scheme of the greyhound industry Bill.  From my work with animal welfare groups, I know the witnesses deal with greyhounds which is the worst side of the industry.  From the discussion, I am aware that many people who breed greyhounds care for their animals and treat them very well.  I have no involvement in the industry but I know a few people who own greyhounds who consider their dogs very precious.  It is important that point is made.</p> <p>  It is very important that issues are highlighted and the role of advocacy, which the animal welfare groups engage in, serves to make it more socially unacceptable and shameful for people whose mindset is to neglect and abuse animals.  We do not want that sort of society and we strive constantly to root out that behaviour but it is a major problem across the board in respect of dogs and other animals.  It is a cost to society.  It is desirable that we have a proper regime.</p> <p>  Issues have been teased out but notwithstanding reservations about where the industry is at, I understand the witnesses are happy that the Legislature is trying to address issues of animal welfare and work towards that goal.  People have a passion for this sport, aside from making money from it.</p> <p>  The witnesses have addressed the importance of social media in highlighting issues.  To what extent does social media and people witnessing cruelty at sporting events play a part in achieving prosecutions and convictions?  Events are posted on social media, but I wonder if these gruesome images are churned around or does anything come of it?  Is there a correlation between these images on social media and the prosecution of an offender?  The witnesses have raised concerns about the treatment of animals but how often is this resulting in catching people who are dong wrong to animals?</p></speech>

There is an online community of very hard working and passionate people on animal rescue throughout the country.  Social media has become an endemic part of contact for everybody in all corners of the country.  It is the quickest method to share a message about the needs of an animal in distress.  For example, if a dog is in severe distress, it may be located in a county that has foster care on standby.  We have collaborated and joined forces to transport greyhounds from one spot to another when they are no longer able to race.  As the Deputy touched on, some trainers and breeders care for their dogs and will not be the first to use the bolt gun to assassinate them when they do not run fast enough.  These trainers and breeders communicate with the rescue societies and the pounds and those in between to try to offer the dogs some form of rehoming and retirement away from the track.  That is only right and is the very least that should be done.  On a daily basis, we see a significant number of really badly neglected, malnourished and uncared for animals turning up at the county pounds and tied to the front door or the gates of the rescue premises, often times abandoned after the close of business.  Dogs with blue ropes attached around their necks have been found in the bogs, where the bolt gun has been used in an attempt to kill them but has not worked.  This issue is very serious and we must tackle the question of making bolt guns illegal.  Social media operates on a daily basis to tackle those issues.</p></speech>

We go to coursing meetings and we film live hares being mauled and battered into the ground.  There is nothing we can do to bring those people to book because it is a legal activity.  We cannot prosecute anybody because they are allowed to set greyhounds on hares, pin them down and batter and maul them - try to get one's head around that.  What will the Legislature do about that?  It is quite definitely cruelty to animals by any yardstick, yet it is exempt from prosecution in this day and age.</p> <p>  On the question of blooding animals, for example, a case was prosecuted in Australia in which an Irishman was involved in such an incident with a piglet - the man is now back in Ireland - and he was disqualified in Australia and the UK.  The judge hoped he would be disqualified in other countries, but nothing has happened here to him yet, although I understand there may be a disqualification.</p> <p>  A case was taken to court in 1994, and people were given a sentences of six months, but I am not sure whether they served a day of the sentence because I think the case was appealed.</p></speech>

In my opening statement, I mentioned that they received &pound;1.4 million in 2014 in comparison to the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust which received &euro;200,000.  There is a massive discrepancy between that, in spite of the fact that the two industries are of a reasonably similar size.  One would like to see an increase in funding.  We would like to see the establishment of a retired greyhound trust that is far more organised and has rehoming centres and has much more resources available to it.  We would like to see more funding for private independent rescue centres around the country that are struggling to deal with the flood of greyhounds coming into them.</p> <p>  On the statistics, between the years 2010 and 2015, some 2,896 greyhounds were surrendered into Irish pounds.  Some 2,497 greyhounds were destroyed in Irish dog pounds and 399 greyhounds were homed or collected via the Irish dog pounds.  That does not cover the dogs that we know are disappearing.  That does not cover dogs that are being DIY euthanised or that are disappearing or being sold on to disreputable people or being sold for export to countries such as Spain, China, Pakistan and so on. </p> <p>  In response to Senator Mulherin's question, Greyhound Rescue Association Ireland, GRAI, does not really engage too much in sharing gruesome images on social media.  I cannot honestly say we would have any experience of monitoring how these images would translate into convictions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.53" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Jessica Reid" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017050200002#J00800"><p>I know of convictions not necessarily specific to greyhound, but other animal welfare breaches.</p><p>One has to be very careful if one has a situation where one thinks there can be a prosecution.  It is advised to keep that off social media because it can lead to a problem with evidence that is given in court, if it is taken as a criminal prosecution.  There was a case in Galway with a rescue.  A serious case was taken against them and because the case proceeded over a number of years anyone who was involved in seizing the animals off that property, that were taken in horrible situations, could not speak about it publicly for some time.  In some cases, if images are being shared it is just for public awareness.</p><p> In the case of greyhounds, it comes down to a numbers game.  Because we do not know exactly how many dogs are being bred every year, all we have is a registered number of litters to work off, so it is an extrapolation of 15,000 to 20,000 greyhounds being bred in Ireland every year and out of that number, approximately 1,000 greyhounds per year are being re-homed.  We know that a certain number get sold on to race in the UK and then a certain number are being sold to other places.  We have done the figures as best as we possibly can from the information that is available.  One of our biggest issues is the fact that the information is not readily available on a concrete specific number of dogs.  We are still looking at thousands if not tens of thousands of dogs - healthy young dogs - that have been euthanised.  Some of them are being euthanised privately through vets.  Some of them are undergoing DIY euthanasia.  There are all sorts of different cases.  There is no way we can know how many, given the current numbers of dogs being bred.  We know the numbers that are being homed but there is a huge gap in the middle and we do not know what happens to all of them, although we can guess.  It is hard to produce numbers based on guesswork because at the end of the day those are always in question.  One of our biggest issues is the fact that we cannot get those numbers because they do not seem to be recorded at this point.  One cannot tackle a problem properly until one knows the full scope of it. </p><p> We know that it happens daily or weekly with rescues.  We operate a waiting list of dogs coming in.  Trainers contact us to ask if we can take dogs.  We put them on a waiting list and try to find spaces for them.  However, when we contact that trainer to say we have a spot for the dogs now, we may be told: "Sorry, those dogs are gone. I couldn't wait long enough, so I had them put down."  That happens daily in this country.  That is where the numbers of hundreds and thousands of dogs that are being lost come from because we physically do not have the space, resources or volunteer time to deal with these dogs that are coming in such overwhelming numbers.  Trainers may ring up and say: "If you can't take this dog this week he gets the needle.  We already have an appointment to have the dog euthanised with the vet at the end of the week, so if you can't take it by then that is the outcome."  One is left with that sort of emotional blackmail.  </p><p> Individual rescuers are doing this work in their volunteer hours.  That is not to say that the dogs are necessarily being kept in bad shape.  They can be in good physical condition when they are brought in.  It is simply a numbers game.  The committee has seen the numbers we have provided of the allocated resources, which are so poorly insufficient for the number of dogs still being bred.  They are running in this industry but are not being taken care of at the end of the day.</p></speech>

I am supportive of the greyhound sector both in coursing and at greyhound tracks.  I fully respect the views and concerns of the two deputations present.  I commend their good work in ensuring the welfare of dogs, particularly abandoned animals.</p> <p>  What is the percentage of greyhounds in various dog pounds throughout the country?  Are dog pounds full of greyhounds or are there all breeds of dog there?  We are scrutinising the legislation and hopefully we will be able to regulate those involved in coursing and at tracks.  However, nobody seems to want to regulate those involved in lurching at dawn and dusk in the countryside.  Nothing is said about lurchers, which seem to disappear.  Those are the people who are clearing our countryside of invaluable hare species.  We should discuss the welfare of those dogs because no one is currently watching them.</p> <p>  We are a nation of exporters, including the agricultural and drinks industries.  We also produce good dogs so the issue is whether we should provide more controls and regulation over which countries we export them to.  I have to laugh because people have given out about some countries to which dogs are exported, yet we have no problem with, or complaints about, doing deals with them in other business sectors.  Surely, therefore, what is good for one sector is good for another.  </p> <p>  I agree that it is a problem but things have come a long way with drug testing of coursing dogs.  I understand that the coursing federation has its samples sent abroad to an independent laboratory for analysis.  In case somebody might think there is a quick fix, in fairness there is not.  </p> <p>  We got adverse publicity from the RTE programme but, following Deputy Penrose's question, I would like to know what percentage of greyhounds are currently in dog pounds.  </p></speech>

I was keeping a watchful eye on what was going on here.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance and I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words.  I appreciate the concerns that have been raised.  However, the people I know - and I do not even like to use the term "who are involved in the industry" - are people who love their greyhounds.  They love what they do and take care of their dogs.  There are genuinely committed people, not blackguards.  They would not inflict cruelty on their animals.  I am sure the witnesses respect that fact also.</p> <p>  Most farmers are kind to their animals, including sheep, horses and cows.  Of course, one may get a rogue person who will not take care of his or her animals or even his or her\ family, but one cannot paint everyone with the same brush.  The people I know who train greyhounds for coursing and racing are kind, committed and steeped in the tradition of the sport they are involved in.  I am glad to know plenty of middle-aged and older people who have children and grandchildren with an interest in dogs.  They will be participating in this sport.  I do not call it an industry.  They will continue doing so because they like their dogs and the sport involved.  That important point should be acknowledged here today.  </p> <p>  We all have differing views on the Irish Greyhound Board but I am talking about the people who own greyhounds.  As far as I am concerned, they are good people who do their best at all times. </p></speech>

The majority are probably being done privately by veterinarians.  We mentioned the dog pound figures because those are the only recorded ones for greyhounds euthanised in Ireland officially.  We have no way of accessing figures for the number of dogs euthanised through other means, for example, vets.  These numbers are low as a result.  As to the overall number of dogs in pounds, that probably comes down to general animal welfare legislation, but greyhounds are considered separate and an agricultural commodity owing to the 2011 Act.</p></speech>

Any greyhound-type dog that is found in a terrible condition and does not have a tattoo is pushed into general animal welfare legislation, as there is no way to prove that it is a full-bred greyhound.  Many of the dogs in question are considered lurchers, which is a cross-breed of any sighthound, not specifically greyhounds.  Many of the lurchers used for that activity are of Saluki and other sighthound stock, possibly bred with greyhounds or other working dogs.  We would love to see a large amount of concern for that matter, but it is almost a separate issue at this point because such animals are not within the remit of the IGB if they are not tattooed.</p></speech>

A large number of dogs have been rehomed in Italy, the UK and so on.  Cara Rescue Dogs, PAWS and the group that the girls are with, Homes for Unwanted Greyhounds, HUG, have set up a two-way system with other countries where these dogs are viewed as family pets and people are willing to open up their homes once the rescue dogs have been personality traited, had their temperaments, drive and instinct to chase tested and after the best circumstances in which to rehome each dog have been determined.</p> <p>  In this context, we must examine the overbreeding in Ireland.  We should not have to look to outside our country to clean up our mess because the overspill is too large to be handled.  If the system is overloaded, breeding must be cut back.  That must be communicated by the rescue organisations and across the board within the greyhound industry.  Given that there is an overspill, we cannot keep the issue in a bubble anymore.</p></speech>

They still have tags of "vicious", "bloodthirsty" and "out for the hunt".  In countries like Italy, they are seen as graceful dogs and a different connotation attaches to them.</p></speech>

It is done on an individual basis to ensure every dog sent abroad is brought to a home and not sold on for other purposes.  It is a requirement for the Irish rescues of which we are aware that all dogs are spayed or neutered before they leave the country so that there is no possibility of breeding in other countries.  Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regulations on microchipping, vaccinations, pet passports, Balai certificates and all other paperwork for every dog that leaves the country must be sorted with the rescue organisation before a dog is allowed to be sent abroad.  These dogs are not being exported to be sold but to be homed as pets.  This is done on an individual basis.  Each rescue sends six dogs and knows all of their names, histories and personalities so that they can be matched with appropriate homes.</p></speech>

Most primarily use fund-raising to send dogs across.  It probably costs in the region of &euro;300 per dog to prep it, have it spayed or neutered and vaccinated, kennel it and pay for transport fees.  This does not include extra medical requirements, for example, broken bones.</p></speech>

We saved 139 dogs last year, and just over 100 of those were exported.  Regardless of whether dogs are sent abroad or homed in Ireland, every dog is spayed or neutered, microchipped and vaccinated, leading to a cost of &euro;200 to &euro;300 per dog rehomed.

Most rescues take dogs from certain geographical areas.  For example, some take dogs from Cork and Kerry while others take dogs from Limerick.</p><p>Obviously, there is a cost to transporting a dog all the way across the country for rescue purposes.  We would have ongoing positive relationships with many trainers because, at the end of the day, many of them are very happy to have their dogs sorted and to know they do not have to be euthanized, that there is another option and that there are people in other countries, and even in Ireland, who will see them as pets and be happy to have them on their sofa.  When the dogs go to Italy, they are greeted with a red carpet arrival - they literally walk individual dogs down the red carpet to meet their new families and they film it all.  It is wonderful to see a place like that, where the dogs are treated with respect and desired as pets.  That is what we are working towards here, namely, greater awareness among the public of greyhounds as pets so that they would be seen as desirable pets to have in a family home.</p></speech>

We welcome the opportunity to talk to the committee about the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme and to take any questions members have on this or, indeed, any aspect of the SBCI&rsquo;s work in the food and agriculture sector.  Joining me today is my colleague, Ms Suzanne Sweeney, head of lending at the SBCI.</p> <p>  To introduce ourselves, the SBCI is Ireland&rsquo;s new promotional finance institution.  Between March 2015 and December 2016, working with eight front-line lending institutions, we have supported over 12,500 SMEs with over &euro;540 million in low-cost loans and other forms of finance, using our supply of long-term, low-cost liquidity.  This includes significant involvement in the agriculture and food sector.  Farming has been the largest sector using this form of SBCI finance, representing 23% of total take-up to date, with more than 5,000 farm businesses having drawn down &euro;141 million in lower-cost SBCI loans up to the end of December 2016.  This is in addition to the &euro;150 million that has been made available through the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme.</p> <p>  We first became involved in the agriculture cashflow support loan initiative in July last year, when we engaged with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on the Minister&rsquo;s priority to address the impacts of changes in the sterling exchange rate and lower commodity prices on the farming sector, impacts that included very significant cash flow challenges for many farmers.  This engagement accelerated with the news of the exceptional aid made available by the European Commission.  This was confirmed in September 2016 in Commission Delegated Regulation 2016/1613, providing for exceptional adjustment aid to milk producers and farmers in other livestock sectors.  The Department carried out a sector analysis which provided a vital insight into those cash flow challenges.  The main findings were that farmers would face a shortage of cash towards the end of the year and into 2017 as a consequence of lower selling prices and-or crop yields, and that they were heavily exposed to costly trade credit and overdrafts to bridge cash flow requirements.</p> <p>  We also engaged with the banks, which confirmed their interest in working with farmers in terms of converting costly trade credit and other capital expenditure borrowings into more sustainable term loans.  However, the challenge in tapping into that appetite was to create a more flexible and competitively priced product than what was available in the market at the time and, critically, to address the "red tape" that farmers regularly face when applying for loans.  Given the outlook on prices, it was also important that the new product would be available during early 2017.</p> <p>  We had three overriding objectives when we sat down with the Department to the devise the scheme: to develop a product that responded to the liquidity problem that farmers were facing; to do so in a manner that achieved sufficient impact for farmers; and to do so in a way that achieved the greatest possible economic value-add within the parameters we were working in.  Alongside the Department, we developed what became the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme by leveraging the &euro;25 million available to us from the Department, which included &euro;11 million from of exceptional aid from the European Commission, alongside the SBCI balance sheet to create a &euro;150 million lending scheme.</p><p><font color="#00201F">While the banks provided the additional cash from their own balance sheets, without which we would not have been able to maximise the impact of the scheme, the SBCI, along with the European Investment Fund&rsquo;s COSME programme, jointly provided the guarantee required to underpin the flexibility of the loans and their lower cost.  Using the funding provided by the Department and its own balance sheet, the SBCI is providing an interest subsidy and a partial guarantee on the loans.  The interest rate is 2.95%, which is fixed for the life of the loan.  This compares with rates of between 6% and 14% for alternative products such as overdrafts, standard variable loans and merchant credit.  Loans up to a maximum of &euro;150,000 per farm are available with terms of one to six years and optional interest-only repayment periods.  The loans are unsecured, which has the added advantage of allowing farmers greater flexibility to engage with banks other than their main lender.  The loans can be used for future working capital requirements, for example, for feed, fertiliser, trading stock or tax.  They can be used as an alternative to more expensive trade credit, to replenish working capital already used on the farm to support capital expenditure and to refinance existing farm creditors.  The loans are available to all livestock farmers, tillage farmers, horticulture producers and others involved in primary agricultural production.</font><br/><br/><font color="#00201F"> The involvement of three major banks with nationwide reach has been a critical factor in the success of the scheme.  At a most obvious level, the banks have made significant funding available from their own balance sheets.  There is also the fact that most farmers have an existing relationship with one or other of the participating banks, which has greatly facilitated the loan application process.  Because of their nationwide spread the banks have played an important role in promoting awareness of the loans through their respective branch networks.</font><br/><br/>The significance of the scheme is worth reflecting on for a moment, particularly as a precedent for future use of risk sharing and other financial instruments as a means to deliver new policy measures in this space.  This is a ground-breaking policy measure in the Irish market and the first use of the COSME programme, which is also part of the Juncker plan or the European Fund for Strategic Investments.  Crucially for the SBCI, it represents the first time that the corporation itself has taken on risk sharing with front-line lenders - in this case, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank.  This complements the SBCI&rsquo;s role as operator and manager of the credit guarantee scheme on behalf of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.<br/><br/>The SBCI will continue to source other European supports and funding to facilitate the delivery of new policy measures in the future as market failures are identified.  By building a central conduit for the market for risk sharing and other financial instruments, we can also ensure the efficient flow of European SME supports to the Irish market.<br/><br/>I will now turn to deployment under the scheme.  Based on loans that have been drawn down by farmers, to date &euro;60.2 million has been advanced.  The average loan size is &euro;32,000.  The banks advise that all of the remaining &euro;150 million is committed and is in the process of being drawn down.  Based on progress to date, we anticipate that circa 4,000 farmers will benefit from the scheme.  In the supporting documentation that we submitted in advance of today&rsquo;s hearing we have provided a breakdown of the loans drawdown to date by loan term, sector and region.  This picture will continue to evolve as the data are reported to us by the banks.  As members will see, however, the loans are broadly spread in geographical location and by farm sector.<br/><br/>I refer the committee to slides ten, 11 and 12 at the end of the presentation provided and will briefly talk through the main information on these slides.  Slide ten shows the summary of loan deployment to 28 April 2017 broken down by the term of the loans.  Loans of more than four years' duration are currently 54% of loans at &euro;32.4 million, which is 41,551 loans.  It is worth noting that the average size of a loan is larger at the longer end and smaller at the shorter end.  Looking at slide 11 where the sectors are split, we can see that the dairy and beef sectors are by far the largest users of this form of funding.  The dairy sector draws down an average loan of almost &euro;37,000.  The average beef sector loan is slightly smaller at about &euro;27,500.  It is significant that in the other sectors tillage is substantial at 8%, with 90 loans going out there.  Slide 12 illustrates the regional split and shows the regional spread to be healthy with loans not concentrated too much in one area.  The region with the largest proportion of loans is the south west with 22% and this also reflects our experience on the agricultural investment loans scheme where the south west has the largest share of the borrowing.  This would be for investment purposes as well as for working capital.<br/><br/>That concludes my opening remarks and I am very happy to take any questions from members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.96" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1350" speakername="Jackie Cahill" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017050200002#N00200"><p>I thank Mr. Ashmore for his presentation.  We had an argument at this committee a couple of weeks ago about the term of the loan and how it would affect the subsidy that was put in to the scheme.  Part of Mr. Ashmore's presentation around the agriculture cashflow support loan scheme states "An interest subsidy of 2% is paid to the banks each quarter on the outstanding balance of the loans, which is paid in arrears."  We got stuck into this with the Minister when he was at the committee a few weeks ago.  We could not get our heads around whether there was a pre-determined split to the terms of the loan to ensure the subsidy equated to the amount that was available from the EU to subsidise the scheme.  The vast majority of farmers who looked for this loan were looking for as long a term as possible.  In my experience of farmers who applied for the loan, there was a concerted effort on the part of the banks to reduce the term of the loan.  We can see from the information presented by Mr. Ashmore that 54% of the loans given out so far are for terms of under four years.  This is key to the issues we had when the Minister was here and I would like to hear some elaboration on that.  There is a subsidy paid each quarter to the participating banks.  Were criteria laid down at the start to say that X amount of loans had to be over certain periods or was each case judged on its merits?</p> <p>  I am extremely disappointed at the numbers of pig farmers and horticulture growers who have used the scheme.  Only seven pig farmers to date and six horticulture growers have participated.  Both of these sectors have been under severe financial strain.  In the future hopefully we would get a similar scheme to this one.  If we do, we must examine the criteria because I very much doubt that farmers in these sectors did not try to get this money because both sectors are very heavily indebted.  The criteria would have disqualified them.  Much of that sector's debt would probably have been aged debt and they would not have been able to qualify.  Those figures are disturbing.  The amount of qualifying participants from both of those sectors is in single figures.  Half of the money has been given out at this stage.  Given the way in which the scheme closed up so fast, I would have thought that by the end of April, more of the money would have reached farmers' accounts.  Is there a reason for the delay or is it purely administrative?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have an indication as to further demand? The demand was strong and the appetite out there for the scheme was immense.  The scheme was closed in a matter of weeks after being opened and &euro;150 million was committed.  Is there a handle on what would have been the demand or requests for capital under this scheme if the scheme was still open and being applied for?  Is that figure available?</p></speech>

The entire fund is vouched for at this stage, but why has such a small percentage transferred into farm bank accounts? My key question, which Deputy Cahill has also asked, is how many people were refused?  The scheme operated on a first-come first-served basis but how far could it have gone?  Such information could give us a better indication of the extant financial woes.  Many people sought to be included in the scheme and unfortunately there was not enough funding to facilitate them.  Does Mr. Ashmore have any indication of those figures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Ashmore" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017050200002#O00100"><p>Coming to the first question around the term of the loan and how it affects the subsidy, to be clear, the &euro;25 million funding provided resides with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, and is only paid out to the banks as it is required.  They have to prove that they have loans in place that we are covering to justify the receipt of the subsidy.  It is scaled to make sure that it reflects the actual loan portfolio and there is no risk of any further funds going to the banks than are absolutely necessary.  It is the same if they claim under the guarantee.  They have to try first to restructure the loans but we will they pay out for loans that go into default.</p> <p>  There was no predetermined split whereby we were telling them they had to do so many loans of this or that duration.  It was really demand dependent, matching the loan term to the use of the funding.  The larger loans have a longer duration and equate often to the refinancing of capital expenditure that the farmers have already made.  They have used their own cash, their own working capital to buy a tractor or invest in a new facility, and those loans are refinanced out at the cheaper rate to restore their working capital position and inject liquidity back into the business.  They tend to be larger loans.  The shorter-term loans tend to be refinancing working capital, merchant credit, other creditors and that type of thing, and therefore there is a shorter duration applied, in keeping with the normalised lending approach.  Those loans are delivered by the banks, subject to their normal lending criteria and procedures.</p> <p>  What we have achieved with the guarantee is to remove the need for security.  While we have added a little bit of bureaucracy with the paperwork on those loans, to meet the information requirements of the Department and the Commission, the fact that there is no need then to append the loans to security over land or other assets is actually a major saving in terms of paperwork and time.</p></speech>

I am sorry for harping on the issue.  On the &euro;25 million that was available in subsidy, would I be correct in saying that if 80% to 85% of the loans were over a six year period, the demand on the subsidy would be greater?  How was the SBCI able to do its sums, or has it done its sums?  Is Mr. Ashmore confident that the &euro;25 million subsidy will cater for the duration of this scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Ashmore" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017050200002#O00300"><p>This is the first time something like this has been done in the Irish context, besides being a new institution.  We have to be prudent in underpinning a scheme like this.  We could not necessarily make an assumption around the mix of lending and duration within the portfolio.  We had to err on the side of caution and we have put aside enough loss reserves to cover full payment of the guarantee under the scheme but also covering the full potential degree of subsidy.  Should we find out in due course that the loan book is different from that original prudent assumption, that turn of events may release some cash back to the Exchequer.  That funding will go back to the Department of Agriculture, either to go back into the pot or to be available for recycling into a future scheme.  Whatever happens, the funding will not go to the banks unless it is absolutely required.</p> <p>  We could not predict going in and still cannot predict at this stage what the mix and duration of the loans will be and what exactly the loan book will look like.  We are finding that as time goes on the duration is getting longer, because the longer loans are larger and they take longer to process.  The smaller loans are put out more quickly.  We are seeing that evolution.</p> <p>  It is a question of trying to balance the mix to make sure we are well covered and can absolutely fulfil the obligations placed on the SBCI in providing this guarantee.  Sourcing the European funding from COSME has been a critical piece of that.  We are one of the few institutions anywhere in Europe that has been able to apply the COSME programme to the agricultural sector, which is a major step forward and innovation.</p> <p>  In terms of the pig sector and the horticulture sector, it is notable that these loans are larger on average and as we said, the larger loans are taking longer to come through the system.  It may well be that we will see more of those sectors coming through later in the drawdowns.  As and when we have more data, we will provide a further update, probably monthly from here on out.  The banks tend to provide us with the data in batches rather than in real time.  We can provide an update in due course.  Were there any further questions?</p></speech>

Of all the loans that were presented to the SBCI through the IT system we built with the banks, we did not turn any down for failing the criteria.  Trying to track loan applications, formal or informal, at the actual bank branch level or over the phone is very tricky.  It is one of the really difficult areas to try to capture that last piece of information.  When we structure these schemes, we try to gather absolutely the essential information to deliver the policy measure.  Unfortunately, the more information we ask for, the less likely the banks are to work with us and process the loans efficiently.  It becomes very bureaucratic and complicated.  We do not capture quite the degree of interaction information that the banks have and that we might ultimately like to have.  We have really focused on making sure that the loans that are there are qualifying, and are going to the right farmers under the right terms and conditions.  That is where we focus our information gathering and our work.</p> <p>  Coming to the question of how far the scheme could have gone, we do not have that information.  We can go back and make a further query with the banks to ask them if they have an idea.  Ultimately, they did say to farmers at a point in time that they were done.  There may have been other applications that could have come after that, but we simply would never know about them.  Unfortunately, it is a very difficult question.  It would be a great question to be able to answer to feed into further policy measures or actions.</p></speech>

We knew we needed a reasonably rapid uptake because we have a time limit.  We have to be done and dusted by the end of August to meet the state aid window.  We were a little bit concerned that we might end up having to drive the marketing and information.  We had the same experience when we started the SBCI.  The agriculture community is incredibly financially savvy and interest rate sensitive.  They are the first to spot a good deal that helps them and they just went for it.  It did catch us by surprise, I have to say, and I think it caught the banks a little bit by surprise as well.  It was very well flagged.  We worked very hard to talk to the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA.  We made sure we engaged with those stakeholders as much as we could so they were able then to inform their members.  We were also helped by the media and Agriland, which got the word out very well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1386" speakername="Tim Lombard" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017050200002#O01000"><p>I apologise for being late.  I was detained at another meeting.  I welcome the witnesses to this space.  It is a very important initiative and it has been very positive.  I wish to ask about the duration of the loans.  It is becoming an issue with the farming public.  In the documentation, 19% of farmers are looking for loans over six years.  Was that predetermined by the banks which put together the applications or did the farmers look for the loans to come in at six years?  What I am finding is that the farmers who looked at the scheme and were very welcoming of it thought that the first two years should be interest free and the next four years would pay off the principal.  When they went to the banks, they got a very cold response and that is why we only have 19% of them qualifying for the six years.  What information does Mr. Ashmore have about those issues?  Was he just given a <i>fait accompli</i>with the application form or did he have interaction with farmers on the ground?  I do not know too many farmers who would be looking to pay off a complete loan in under one year.  Most try to spread their liabilities over a period of time and the six year term was money that they thought they would never get so cheaply.</p><p>They looked for it but they did not get it.</p><p> Is Mr. Ashmore confident that the entire sum will be drawn down?  It might be allocated but will it be drawn down by the institutions?  I have heard stories of farmers being given approval for these loans but then being told they have to clear their stocking loans, which they have had for many years.  They say they will not go near this scheme because they want to retain their stocking loans going forward.  Has he information regarding the terms and conditions the banks are applying to these loans in order that farmers can qualify for the loans?  The worry is that if some aspects of the terms and conditions are unattainable, the loans cannot be drawn down where the farmers are approved for them, which is a serious issue for the community.  Has an audit of the terms and conditions been conducted by the SBCI to ascertain if they are outside the criteria?</p><p> Mr. Ashmore referred to security in his presentation.  Have the banks looked for security in these cases?  Will the SBCI seek an audit to ensure that no security was sought?</p><p> Mr. Ashmore hopes the draw down of funds will be completed by August.  If not, the money will be returned to the Department or go back into a black hole.  Does he expect the money to be fully drawn down?  If not, how much does he expect the shortfall to be?  Will it be 10% or 5% of the overall amount?  It is amazing to be able to access money at an interest rate of 2.95%.</p><p> I am not critical in case Mr. Ashmore thinks that.  This is one of the most unique schemes that has been introduced for the agricultural community.  Given the interest in it, the scheme was closed to applications in under 20 days by the three major banks.  That shows how unique it is.  This needs to be examined, however, because there is an appetite for money that is made available like this.  As policymakers, it is one of the key drivers we need to examine.  However, farmers feel short changed by the six-year limit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.109" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1425" speakername="Michelle Mulherin" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017050200002#P00200"><p>I thank Mr. Ashmore for his presentation.  I very much welcome the scheme and farmers are benefiting from it.  The way the opportunity was grabbed by so many so quickly, while welcome, is also a reminder of the untenable rates being offers by banks for term loans and overdrafts, which farmers and businesses in general have to contend with as they try to keep their operations going.   My questions relates to how the scheme is operated by the banks.  What interest rates do financial institutions charge for similar products?  Does the fact that the banks are in receipt of a 2% subsidy per quarter mean they are effectively generating an interest rate of 4.95% on this money?  Compared to their normal operating practice where they draw down money and they pay something back on the strength of that, I presume they are paying the State nothing for this money and are just facilitating the process.  Are the State or some European institution getting a cut of this or are the banks just facilitating it?</p> <p>  With regard to terms and conditions, I gather from what Mr. Ashmore said that nobody is being asked to offer security in respect of these loans.  I presume this because they are 80% guaranteed by the State.  Will he confirm that this is correct?  The entire amount was committed within 20 days of the money being offered but, for non-securitised lending, it seems to be taking a long time for it to be released to borrowers.</p> <p>  I was trying to follow the information the SBCI is getting from the banks.  Mr. Ashmore said certain information is not captured regarding how many more people might have availed of this if they could have and, therefore, we should try to assess how many farmers were not in a position to avail of the scheme and are now paying the full whack in commercial interest rates.  How much are the banks charging on average for a similar product?</p> <p>  He said it creates further complications with the banks to ask them more questions and to glean more information.  They are getting a good deal on this in respect of what is being guaranteed and they are still applying the criteria for sound lending while 80% of the funds are guaranteed.  They are, therefore, only taking on 20% of the risk.  They should be fully co-operative with the SBCI, as an agency of the State, regarding information it might seek about this novel product.</p> <p>  The SBCI was established to provide funding to SMEs and to address the problems persisting with the banks.  It would not be in existence if there were not problems with the banks.  The SBCI provides low cost funding to financial institutions, which they pass on to SMEs, according to its website.  Banks are accessing cheap money currently on the markets and our problem is they are not passing it on yet when the SBCI can access money, they will pass it on subject to terms and conditions.  Other than to get us through a difficult period, how can the agency's activities bring pressure to bear on the banks to reduce their interest rates or will they just simply benefit from a scheme the State has set up in response to a difficulty that farmers and small businesses face to which they are not responding?</p> <p>  It is also stipulated that the SBCI provides "market access for new entrants to the SME lending market creating real competition".  How does it assess its ability to create competition given there does not seem to be any competition?  The banks are doling out this money on behalf of the SBCI but they are still not reducing interest rates.  To what extent are new borrowers being facilitated under this scheme as opposed to existing borrowers?  How does that tie in with the agency's founding objectives to help farmers and SMEs?  Mr. Ashmore might have gathered that I am sceptical about the banks in general based on their track record and the way they operate currently, particularly in view of the fact that they have access to cheap money but will not pass it on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.110" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1345" speakername="Martin Kenny" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017050200002#P00300"><p>Mr. Ashmore is most welcome.  It is stated, "The normal lending assessment criteria will apply".  A number of applicants with whom I have spoken found it as difficult to access this facility as when they sought other loans in the past when they had to jump through all sorts of hoops.  The exception relates to the requirement for security.  Most people who have had relationships with the banks will probably have letters of guarantee and security lodged with them for other stuff they are doing.  It is, therefore, difficult to ascertain the benefit of that in general.</p><p>Certainly the issue is there may be a lot of people who looked at this, backed away and decided it is not for them and is not going to work because if normal lending criteria apply, the banks are setting a very high bar at present and if they are unable to get a normal loan, they will be unable to get this one either.  That is one issue I have come across with many people.  </p><p> The next point is similar to the point raised by Senator Mulherin regarding the SBCI's core business.  Is the SBCI doing a lot of work with the agrifood sector and small businesses?  There are many people involved in the small agrifood industry such as artisan producers developing small products who are starved of capital and who cannot get off the ground because they find it so difficult to get the banks to deal with them.  In respect of the SBCI's small businesses, big plans programme, is the SBCI doing much work with them?  Are there opportunities to find more space for funding for that sector?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Ashmore" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017050200002#Q00200"><p>I will try to work my way through the points raised.  In respect of Senator Lombard's question about duration, we talked about duration earlier.  This was really determined by the demand and the use of the funding.  The loans are available from one to six years.  The duration is determined by what farmers applied for and what they were using the loans for.  If those loans were for things like lower-cost stocking finance or working capital, they tended to be of shorter duration because it is about trying to apply the right loan solution to the right use.  If it was refinancing a tractor that had been purchased or a piece of equipment, it tended to be of longer duration because it is to finance the purchase of a larger asset.  What one sees with the size of the loans is that those loans of longer duration tend to be larger loans as well.  We do not have a predetermined expectation of what that mix would be so we wanted to allow for those situations.  It concerned the juxtaposition between the banks' normal lending criteria and the normal way they apply loans to farmers.  I think there might be a mismatch of expectations given that the scheme was explained in simple terms.  With loans of up to six years, farmers are naturally going to apply for the longer term in certain cases.  We do not have that split of farmers who applied for longer-term loans and got shorter-term loans and farmers who just applied for shorter-term loans.  One feature of the market is that borrowers remain wary of banks.  We are still seeing the SME community as a whole, including farmers, pay down debt at a very rapid rate.  There is still wariness regarding being in debt to the banks for longer periods.  We think there may be a fair proportion of farmers who would only have applied for shorter-term loans because they do not want to be looking over their shoulders for the next six years.  They would rather go in, get what they need and get out again.  The farmers who tried to get something but did not get what they wanted are more likely to come forward and ask about their situation.  We very much recognise that.  There are lessons we will learn from this exercise that we will try to apply going forward.  As I said, this is the first time we have done a loan scheme of this nature.  Many lessons have been learned.</p> <p>  On Senator Lombard's point about it being a unique scheme and being able to use it in different ways, the EU uses these schemes all the time all over Europe and has done so for a long time because many other European countries' banking markets are built on guarantee programmes.  Portugal is a massive user in this space.  Italy has something like 2% or 3% of GDP in guarantees to SMEs.  It is not being used in the Irish model because the banking system grew up here in a different way.  It was much more of a relationship-based model and was not built on mutual guarantee schemes in the way that the Italian or French banking systems were.  European schemes are often structured this way and go straight through those systems into those markets very efficiently.  They do not work the same way here and this is the first time we have been able to get one to really work.  It is a great precedent to set.  It is a good market to be able to demonstrate to the banks and other lenders in the future that this is how we can do this and it can work really well.  Other supports at a European level that can be deployed in this way are available.  The European Commission is moving and applying pressure to move away from grants towards the use of these types of financial instruments.  In many cases, it can provide a simpler solution.  Maybe it is a single application for a long-term low-cost easy loan to fund a piece of capital expenditure rather than a grant application plus a loan application because it is a 50:50 piece.  We see other options and ways of doing things in this context that may be more useful or easier to use down the line.  </p> <p>  In respect of the point about terms and conditions and whether we can review those, those loans are unsecured.  If we find in a situation where a bank has required security that it does not qualify for our scheme, we will withdraw the guarantee.  The onus is on the banks to make sure they have met the criteria and have applied the loan and lending in the right way.  We have extensive audit rights under this scheme.  We will have to see whether we would catch someone at that point but we certainly can include that in our audit criteria and review.  We will have to do an audit of this scheme at some point.  With measures like this, it is very important that we and the Department assess the impact going in and the impact coming out.  We would certainly be supportive of a review after the fact to go back and see whether it did what we wanted it to do, whether it got to the right farmers and how many farmers would say in response to a survey that they wanted to get it but could not.  Every farmer's situation will be slightly different.  If there are situations where they are not comfortable with the terms and conditions of the loan and have chosen not to draw it down, it is quite hard to legislate for every situation.  However, we would be happy to look at any individual situation if anyone wants to bring it to our attention.  </p> <p>  We are confident that the scheme will be drawn in time given that a full set of applications is in and we know farmers will not be shy about giving the banks a hard time as to why they have not got their money yet.  In some cases, there will be paperwork that takes a bit longer.  We are seeing the loans come through in volume at the moment.  We hope it will be wrapped up in the next couple of months and fully drawn down.  We expect it to be fully drawn down.  </p> <p>  In respect of Senator Mulherin's question about other schemes and other interest rates, this funding is comparable with a number of different options.  They include overdrafts, the Glanbia MilkFlex product, which relates more to supporting investment loans, merchant credit and standard variable loans.  Banks overdrafts are 9% to 12%, the Glanbia MilkFlex fund is about 4.2% and merchant credit is anywhere between 9% and 10% up to 14%.  This is quite insidious because many farmers do not actually realise what they are paying in that context.  Standard variable rates average somewhere around 6% or 6.5%.  This is not comparable with the normal SBCI agricultural investment loan scheme loans, which average around 4.5%, because those are only for investment purposes.  They are not for working capital purposes.  We had to go down that route for state aid reasons.  </p> <p>  The banks are specifically not generating any extra profit out of this scheme.  This is designed to be cost-neutral for the banks.  That is very important for state aid rules.  We had to go through a lot of work with the banks to ensure we had the right mechanisms in place to make sure we could verify that they were not upping the price or doing something to be able to avail of some of the support that was coming through.  We operate in the same way.  The SBCI is a pass-through entity.  We do not make a profit or major return on this.  We simply charge on the small amount of administration costs of the scheme and a premium for the small amount of risk we share within the overall scheme.  We design it in such a way that it is absolutely neutral from the banks' point of view so they are not making any more money but they are not making less money either.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.114" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Nick Ashmore" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2017050200002#Q00400"><p>There is a trade-off and it is something we had to deal with when the SBCI was first set up.  With schemes like this, there is real impetus to get it to market as quickly as possible.  They have this unique asset, which is massive distribution channels.  When we started the SBCI with our low-cost liquidity loans, we started with the banks and then started to add competitors after that.</p><p>We now have five non-bank competitors to the banks providing SBCI funding into the market and active competition.  As a result we have seen a much more active leasing and HP finance market for small businesses.  This is the first instance of this one.  We would have dearly loved having a non-bank competitor for the banks in this space but these are term loans.  In fact, almost all the non-bank competitors in the market that would compete with the banks are focused on asset-based financing, leasing and invoice discounting.  It is a real challenge and is one of our core long-term objectives.  We would love to get a competing term lender into the market but it is challenging because there are a number of very significant barriers to entry.  First, a lender would need a distribution network.  Second, it would need the right expertise.  Third, it is a small market so a high quality team might seek to set up in the UK or somewhere else.</p><p> There were a couple other applicants for this scheme.  Unfortunately, they did not meet the qualifying criteria.  We very much hope to incorporate a non-bank competitor in a subsequent scheme.  It is a question of developing the market over time.  Unfortunately, we cannot fix that aspect straight away.  We have seen much greater competition where we have brought non-bank lenders into the SME space on the other side.  We hope for risk sharing the next time out and then, maybe in time with the credit guarantee scheme, we will be able to work with groups that are not banks to provide real competition.  That is the most significant and effective way to address the interest rate premium that Irish SMEs and farmers must pay versus other countries.  The Central Bank has carried out very good research on why the premium exists.  It concluded that the reason is mainly down to an historic loss rate and profile within the Irish market, which is brutal, to be frank.  It also identified another element as being a lack of competition.  There are indications, if we can get more competitors into the market in this area, that we should be able to bring down interest rates, but it is not something that we can do very quickly.</p><p> We collect certain data from the banks to meet the requirements of the European Commission for the deployment of its funding.  We have to collect certain data for the European Investment Fund and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We must also collect data for our own purposes so that we can track the loan portfolio and the risk we are taking.  We get high level data about the loans and their duration, term, interest rate, credit rating, region, sector and size.  All that is standard information.  Then we get an update on the status of the loan every quarter.  It shows the new balance and whether there has been a change in the loan and that kind of thing.  We also have to collect verification that the farmers have made the right declaration that confirms they qualify for the loan and comply with the qualifying criteria provided by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, for which members may have seen the package provided.  The declaration pertains to things like the membership of environmental schemes and other qualifying options which were part of the qualifying conditions for funding by the European Commission.  We collect a good data set.  We are quite careful that we cannot use the individualisation of that data under data protection rules.  Therefore, we cannot survey participants on how they like the loan.  We are limited in that context.  We can survey, on a random basis, to track that information.</p><p> In terms of the normal lending criteria, we focused in this instance on making the loans easier to obtain by reducing the security requirement.  It is another thing and much more challenging to change the credit criteria as a result of a guarantee.  These guarantees are capped portfolio guarantees.  There are two types of guarantees on the market.  There is one uncapped.  A capped portfolio guarantee says that we will take or guarantee 80% of the losses up to the first 15% of the loans to fail.  We set that roughly where we think the loss rate may reach.  We have designed this item to use the cash both for the subsidy but also to reserve it for the loss reserve and the COSME guarantee.  We do not put them in place because they are nice to have.  We put them in place because we think these losses will occur.  If loan losses go beyond 15% of the portfolio, the bank is 100% at risk at that point.  We are not taking away all the risk, up to 80%.  We are only taking it on the first expected loss rate within the portfolio.  There are other alternative European measures that provide uncapped counter-guarantees but they are more focused on innovative companies rather than smaller businesses like farms.</p><p> I will respond to the questions on the sector in general, the small food producers and food companies.  The SBCI broader lending portfolio covers term lending, leasing, vehicle finance, fleet finance and invoice discounting.  At the moment the portfolio shows an average loan size of around &euro;40,000.  We have a high proportion of micro businesses that actively borrow using that lower cost funding.  Within that there is exposure to the food and food production sector.  We are also very conscious of the impending impact of Brexit.  We are not a policy setting body but a policy delivering body.  It is important we understand what is going on in the market.  Recently the SBCI actively formed its own research to collate and gather as much research and information on the SME and farming sectors as we could so that we could feed into the policy-making process and understand the issues.  We hope that all this will help us design policy measures that are targeted, effective and work in the Irish market.</p><p> One of the big challenges is that while there are many supports available at a European level, without adapting them to work in Ireland, it is very difficult to get them to work here.  The Irish market differs from the markets across Europe.  It is different in the nature of the banking system, the attitude of borrowers to lending and borrowing, their approach to investment and the historical impact of the recession on attitudes and people's relationships with the banks, which Senator Mulherin alluded to.  Repairing relationships is a work in progress.  It will be some time further before SMEs are really comfortable, stop paying down debt quickly and start to borrow to invest again.  At the moment far more of them use their own resources to make investments rather than borrow.</p></speech>

It is a flexible and adaptable platform to deploy policy measures in different formats that are appropriate for issues as they arise.  What is more, they must be structured in a way that works in the Irish market.</p> <p>  It is difficult to confirm a timescale at the moment.  I draw the Chairman's attention to the fact that in the past hour, as this committee sat, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation released a press statement on the fact the SBCI works with her Department, the Department of Finance and other agencies to consider similar measures that would work for Brexit.  One measure will work on a cashflow basis and the other will work on an investment loan support basis.  They are very much development activities and no concrete details have been confirmed.  A decision has been made to progress with developing those types of initiatives.  They are certainly not something we will bring to the market very quickly.  Typically, as we have seen with the agri-scheme, it can take up to six months to do these things.  A lot of work still needs to be done on them.</p> <p>  We do not know the number of farmers who did not qualify for the scheme.  We know that all the ones who have come through to us on the system have qualified.  One query may have gone back for further information.</p></speech>

It is important to note that the scheme was built off the back of a piece of exceptional aid from the Commission.  That aid came not just with cash but with an opportunity to put in a further matching amount from the State.  The scheme opened a window in the state aid rules that allowed the funding to be deployed in this way.</p><p>That accounted for approximately &euro;21 million of the funding, the remainder of which was allocated to be able to support non-livestock farmers, that is, farmers in horticulture, tillage and so forth.  We deployed loans in that sector under the <i>de minimis</i>rules.  The state-aid window applied only for that point in time.  The lack of such a window thereafter meant we could not, off our own bats, decide to do another scheme like this in the same way.  <i>De minimis</i>is an open-ended arrangement but in this case it is available for a much smaller proportion of activity.  We found that these exercises need to have a certain amount of scale if they are to work.

In the past, we have not used <i>de minimis</i>state-aid options for lending because, for instance, many beef farmers get a lot of emergency fodder in and one does not know from one year to the next whether they will need it.

The particular context for this hearing is the recent dissemination of a research paper by Charles Larkin and Shaen Corbet questioning the viability of income-contingent loans in the Irish context from a public finance viewpoint.  The committee has previously heard deliberations regarding the importance of the various parameters involved in the design of an income-contingent loan, ICL, system.  As a result of the context for this hearing, the focus here will be on how the variation in these parameters impacts on the public finances and how ICLs compare to other forms of funding.</p> <p>  We first provide an overview of the rationale for income-contingent student loans in the Irish context.  We then respond to the paper by Larkin and Corbet.  Finally, Dr. Doris will present some public debt and deficit analysis of a variety of funding options to provide some evidence on this issue.</p> <p>  In the context of higher education funding, both the level of such funding and the current mix of State support and upfront student fees are widely accepted to be unsustainable.  The need for further investment, competition with other areas of public spending, and concerns about accessibility and affordability has turned the main focus of this debate towards alternative funding systems.</p> <p>  As the committee is aware, the report of the expert group on future funding for higher education - the Cassells report - outlined three possible options, namely: a full State model of funding; increased State funding with a continuation of upfront student fees; and increased State funding combined with an ICL system. </p> <p>  Although a fully taxpayer-funded system may seem attractive because it provides access to education at no upfront cost to the student, it is ultimately the most regressive option as it entails a transfer of resources from those who have not benefited from higher education - the lower paid - to those who have - the better paid.  Moreover, this option would entail a continued heavy reliance on tax revenue for any future investment in the sector.  In addition, it would entail the highest cost to the Exchequer of all of the options considered.</p> <p>  The second option, combining State support with upfront fees, may alleviate some of the public cost in the short and long-term, but raises concerns about affordability and accessibility due to the upfront nature of the costs.  The purpose of an ICL system is to remove such concerns while also sharing the burden of financing higher education in an efficient and equitable manner.  ICL repayments, which are automatically deducted from the graduate&rsquo;s pay cheque on the basis of their monthly earnings, are low or zero for low earners and increase as earnings increase, so they are designed to be affordable.  Income-contingent debt is, therefore, unlike other forms of debt.</p> <p>  It is important to note that all three options outlined in the Cassells Report involve an increased public cost.  This is inevitable, given the recommendation in the report that higher education funding be substantially increased.  However, it is also salient that options 1 and 2 are estimated in the report to incur a higher direct cost to the State by 2030 relative to the specific ICL proposal outlined in the report.  This is not surprising, since all graduates contribute to the cost of their education under option 3, but not under the other two options.</p> <p>  A note of concern that is specific to the introduction of an ICL system in Ireland relates to the public costs in the initial stage of implementation.  These arise because revenue will be lost due to existing upfront fees being removed, while the revenue generated from graduate repayments will take time to flow.  The exact design of any ICL system can have a significant impact on the scale of these costs.  We will illustrate this point with some examples in the final section of this submission.</p> <p>  Larkin and Corbet purport to analyse lCLs as they would apply in the Irish case, and claim to show that an ICL could not work in Ireland due to the high probability of default.  There are serious shortcomings in the methodology used in their modelling of ICLs, many of which are too technical to detail here.  One problem can readily be explained, however.  In the international literature on ICLs, it is recognised that the default rate is the result of how graduate earnings evolve over time and how repayments are calculated in each particular ICL scheme.  Rather than calculating the level of default that would prevail in Ireland, Larkin and Corbet assume that a high level of default would apply and on that basis dismiss all ICLs, ignoring the fact that the default rate of any ICL scheme is a function of its parameters.</p> <p>  A fundamental problem with Larkin and Corbet&rsquo;s work is that they model the costs of an ICL but do not model the costs of the alternatives.  Moreover, they appear to confuse issues of financing with issues of cost.  For example, they propose an education levy on earned income that could fund an increase in expenditure resulting from the implementation of option 1.</p><p>Apart from the fact that this ignores the significant negative effects on efficiency of such a substantial increase in income taxation and that such an increase is unlikely to be politically feasible, it should be noted that an increase in tax revenue could also be used to fund any outlay associated with ICLs or, indeed, any other method of increasing higher education funding.</p><p> It should be stressed that the conclusions of Dr. Larkin and Dr. Corbet are not substantiated by their analysis.  Their particularly eye-catching conclusion that an Irish student loan company would create an "Anglo in slow motion" simply cannot be supported.</p><p> Despite its shortcomings, the Larkin and Corbet paper has served to focus the debate on the costs to the Exchequer of ICLs.  It is obvious that if an increase in higher education funding is provided by means of an ICL, there will be an initial period in which loans issued will not be matched by repayments.  The Cassells review addresses the point about the initial deficit, concluding that there would be a build-up of debt of more than &euro;10 billion in the first 20 years of an ICL scheme.  This number is based on detailed graduate age-earnings profiles and non-repayment rates that are estimated from data rather than assumed.</p><p> Although the figure of &euro;10 billion may seem high, it is worth noting that it would be spread over a long period.  Moreover, it is important to note that it arises because the ICL would be associated with a substantial increase in higher education funding, not because of the nature of an ICL scheme.  An equivalent increase in higher education funding raised through general taxation would be even more costly, a point to which we will return in our analysis.</p><p> It is also important to note that appendix No. 3 of the Cassells report includes a discussion, provided by the Department of Finance, of whether such costs are feasible within the constraints of the fiscal treaty and concludes that they are.  However, neither the discussion in the Cassells report nor that in the Larkin and Corbet paper provide a full analysis of the fiscal implications over time of alternative ways of providing for an increase in higher education funding.  We have therefore undertaken to provide such an analysis in what follows.  Dr. Doris will provide the details.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.143" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017050200002#C00200"><p>For this analysis, I added to the model that I had been working on in my research with Professor Bruce Chapman.  In this, we assume that policy makers wish to increase the income from core funding of higher education institutions by &euro;2,000 per student.  There are many alternative ways of achieving this, with three options given in the Cassells report.  The first is to remove the &euro;3,000 in fees that are currently paid by approximately 50% of students and make a payment of &euro;5,000 per student from central government funding.  The second is to retain the &euro;3,000 fees paid by the 50% and apply an increase of &euro;2,000 for all students coming from central government funding.  The third is to increase fees from &euro;3,000 to &euro;5,000, apply them to all students and make an ICL facility available.  This is the ICL described in the Cassells report.</p> <p>  As well as this basic ICL, we also show results for two alternative ICLs that are designed to have a lower impact on public debt.  The fourth option is to incentivise students or their families to pay upfront by giving a 10% discount on fees, resulting in an assumed 10% of students not availing of the ICL.  Under the fifth option, in addition to allowing for upfront payment, fees are increased gradually over the early years of the ICL scheme.  In the first two years, fees would remain at &euro;3,000 but would be payable by all students rather than the current 50% and are covered by an ICL.  In the following years, fees would increase by &euro;500 every two years until they reach &euro;5,000 after eight years.  This is a gradual implementation.</p> <p>  To consider the costs of each of these options, it is important to specify the alternative with which they are being compared.  Here, each option is compared with the alternative of maintaining the current level and system of higher education funding, that is, leaving fees at the current level of &euro;3,000 per student and increasing annually at the rate of inflation, with 50% of those fees payable by the Government because the students qualify for grants.  Using this comparison allows us to take into account the fact that, because of demographic pressures, the cost of higher education funding is set to increase in the coming years even if funding is left as it is without a per-student increase.  The analysis, therefore, isolates the effect of increasing funding per student by different methods and only examines the alternative methods.</p> <p>  I have provided graphs in the appendix to this submission that show the effects of the five alternatives on the annual budget deficit and accumulated public debt.  It is clear from them that all three ICLs have an advantage over the other options in terms of their effect on the annual budget deficit.  It is also clear that all ICLs have a substantial advantage over option No. 1 - the free fees alternative - in terms of their effect on public debt, and over option No. 2 in the long run.  In the near term, the effect on public debt of option No. 2 is lower than for the ICL given by option No. 3.  However, the calculations for options Nos. 4 and 5 show that it is possible to design ICLs that will have a lower effect on public debt than option No. 2 even in the immediate aftermath of their introduction.</p> <p>  Given the overall picture presented by this analysis, it is important to emphasise that an increase in higher education institution funding by &euro;2,000 per student will be costly no matter how it is done.  However, if done through an ICL, the costs to the taxpayer are substantially lower, with the burden being shared with those that benefit financially from higher education.  Moreover, an ICL is more equitable.  The subsidisation of higher education by those who have never benefitted from such an education is reduced and education is free at the point of access for all students.</p> <p>  In countries that have adopted an ICL to date, their situations at the point of adoption were different to that which pertains in Ireland.  In all cases, they were moving from having no fees to a situation in which deferred fees were payable.  Therefore, no revenue stream was being eliminated.  Moreover, they were not motivated by needing to increase higher education funding per student dramatically.  While concern around the public costs of ICL schemes in other countries has been voiced, these concerns largely stem from issues such as graduate emigration, the interest rate attached to the loans and supply-side reforms.  These are issues that can be mitigated when designing an ICL, given that we can learn from other countries' experiences in this regard.</p> <p>  There is nothing about an ICL system that is inherently costly in terms of Government finances.  In fact, because students repay most of their debt, costs are lower under an ICL system than under systems based entirely on taxpayer funding.  The costs incurred if an ICL is introduced in Ireland will not be the costs of the ICL system itself but of moving to a system where no fees are payable upfront for equity reasons and where funding needs to be increased dramatically for quality reasons.</p> <p>  A careful analysis of the fiscal implications of ICLs shows they are entirely feasible in Ireland.  The design of any ICL scheme should be carefully considered, as the choice of the parameters of the scheme will determine the extent of the subsidy required.  An ICL scheme can be designed so as to minimise the immediate costs of the introduction of the scheme.  This should also be a consideration of the design of any ICL, if that is the route chosen.</p> <p>  Our conclusion is that an ICL would allow a substantial increase in higher education funding without reducing access and at a lower cost to the Exchequer compared with other alternatives.  The resulting savings can then be used to improve funding for earlier education from preschool through to secondary school, which is where the main barriers to participation in higher education lie.</p></speech>

I understand that the process has been lengthy for the committee and that this is an indulgence on members' part to hear more evidence.  At the outset, I praise Mr. Peter Cassells and his team for their work in highlighting and developing the consensus that now exists on the crisis in higher education funding.  I also praise the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, Professor Chapman, Dr. Doris and Dr. Flannery for their contributions towards the thoughtful analysis of the report and subsequent discussion.<br/><br/>My co-author, Dr. Corbet, will discuss the impact of securitisation in the UK and New Zealand and examples from the rest of Europe.  At the outset, I will set some context before examining the ICL structure and a number of issues relating to the Exchequer.  Throughout this discussion, I would like committee members to think about the question of who they find to be the most important in this exchange: the student, the educational institution or the Exchequer.  Each has a stake in this and each could wind up holding the cost, not holding the cost or being risk-free in the process.<br/><br/>Begging the committee's indulgence, I will start with a quote from <i>Financing Higher Education Worldwide: Who Pays?  Who Should Pay?</i>by Professor Bruce Johnstone and Dr. Pamela Marcucci.  Professor Johnstone of the State University of New York, SUNY, is a co-author of Professor Chapman's and has a useful way of framing the conversation.  He writes:</p><blockquote>income contingent loans would seem to be less applicable when:... non-governmental revenue is needed [immediately], making the parental contribution to tuition (even with [some] discounting [and excluding amounts for low-income families]) [an important] source of needed revenue supplementation.<br /><br />The scarcity of governmental revenue precludes government from being the sole lender (which places a premium on student loans that have some--albeit discounted--value on the private capital market).<br /><br />[Many graduates] (borrowers) are likely to hold multiple short-term jobs, to be employed in the informal economic sector, where records are most unreliable, or to be emigrating.<br /><br />There is no tradition of voluntary, reliable self-reporting of incomes, and state systems for monitoring and verifying incomes for the purpose of income tax withholding and/or pension or social security contributions are non-existent or unreliable.</blockquote><p>That is a useful way of beginning to frame the conversation.  We have to look at this as a question of income-contingent loans <i>per se</i>.  There is ample evidence that they are a very effective and equitable way of dealing with the problem of financing education.  We also have to look at the issue from the point of view of Ireland.  In the Irish context, many of the things that were outlined by Professors Johnstone and Marcucci are clearly present.<br/><br/>That brings us to part of the foreground of the background, namely, cost.  We have to decide what education is for.  Is it fit for purpose?  What are we asking the system to do?  Costs are increasing.  This is partly due to the increased rate of participation in the sector.  It is also due to the burdens of mainstreaming the cost of research, which is typically subsidised from teaching income.  As institutions become more financially strapped, and it is very clear that, especially in the institutes of technology sector, this is going to be imminent over the next five years, the system of education switches its purpose from developing individuals, the economy and society to sustaining itself and maintaining operations.  This is where politics comes in, the decision-making that has to be done with respect to the social planning aspect of higher education.<br/><br/>Now that we have talked about the foreground, let us set the scene.  To use the philosophy of the late great New York Yankee Yogi Berra, &quot;The future ain&rsquo;t what it used to be&quot;.  In the United States, there is $1.2 trillion in student loans and no higher education institution in America has any skin in that game.  They have received the money upfront.  The risk is borne by the student, the financial system and the state.  That brings us to the possibility of earning.  Going to college is a very good idea if one wants to earn but, in the US, 56% of 22 year olds are underemployed.  That only improves to 40% by the age of 27.  When we begin talking about Ireland, we have a serious problem of education mismatch.  Profiling different parts of the education system, we note that the mismatch becomes quite acute when we talk about arts students.  Seamus McGuinness of the Economic and Social Research Institute has showed that the education-labour market mismatch has reached a height of 33%, one of the highest in Europe.  Ireland is not alone.  The same circumstances exist in the UK.  Baroness Wolf, in her report Remaking Tertiary Education, published last November, highlights this as a major problem for their system.<br/><br/>We also have to look at the other aspects of the economic conditions around us.  Last week in its world economic outlook, the International Monetary Fund highlighted a general reduction in labour income as a proportion of overall output.  This finding is supported by Professor Robert Gordon.  The proportion has been declining since the 1970s.  Part of this has to do with the fact that advanced economies have had a particularly sharp decline in middle-skilled labour.  Routine, advanced abstract thinking jobs are disappearing, for example paralegals and junior solicitors.  Those jobs are being replaced by algorithms and these are the people we expect to be earning enough to repay student loans.  The response to this has already been clear in the US.  They have been moving from a &quot;K through 12&quot; &ndash; kindergarten through to age 12 &ndash; system to a &quot;K through 14&quot; model.  The idea is that universal level 7 higher education is going to become a reality in the city of Chicago within the next two years.<br/><br/>We have certain particular Irish problems.  One is the level of dropouts.  One in six third level students drop out, increasing to roughly 26% when we begin discussing the institutes of technology.  We also know that there are great information asymmetries and uncertainties built into the system.  There are deep information asymmetries on the part of the student with respect to the educational product and the labour market.  In the US, there is strong evidence that even when students overcome these asymmetries - 60% do not - they overestimate their salaries by 13%.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the matter of cycles.  According to the latest estimate by the IMF, advanced economies will experience a significant economic shock to their fiscal system of approximately 9% of GDP every 12 to 18 years.  That means an event such as the recession of the late 1980s or the one we just went through, with the IMF-EU-ECB bailout, will not be an occurrence that happens once in a human lifetime but will be experienced several times in the lifetime of any given graduate or person in this room.  Those who survived 2010 had better build a survival kit because it will happen again.<br/><br/>That brings us to what happens with the student.  We will call our examples &quot;Sean&quot; and &quot;Maura&quot;.  Sean is located in Dublin and is studying a finance course at one of the universities there.  He intends to go off to the City of London and become a high earner.  He has limited desire to return to Ireland.  He also lives at home.  From his point of view, the income-contingent loan covers his fees.  He will go off to his high-earning job and his ability to repay will be based entirely upon his compliance with the Irish authorities when he is away from home.  In addition, the major cost of his education, approximately &euro;13,000 per year, will be accommodation and living expenses, which are now covered by his living at home.<br/><br/>Maura is going an institute of technology and comes from a somewhat poorer background but does not qualify for a grant.  She has an income-contingent loan.  She has a desire to do social studies and wants to become a social worker.  It is a decently paid, solid job but it is not highly paid.  She goes into the workforce and will eventually pay her income-contingent loan because she is in the Irish tax system.  As a PAYE worker, she has no escape.  If there is a crisis and her income drops by 20% or 28%, as happened during the recent crisis, it will become more difficult.  This is before we discuss her leaving the labour market for brief periods to have children.<br/><br/>That gives a picture of some of the complexities that will need to be worked out in legislation, statutory instruments and regulations in order to make an income-contingent loan system work in Ireland.  This is before we begin to discuss the issue of the student experience and whether what we are providing as higher education is fit for purpose.  We are fixated upon trying to pay for it but have not really asked if the students are getting the best deal.  Is the quality still there?  We know the system is in crisis and, if it crashes, there will be a massive reputational effect for Ireland from which it will be difficult to recover.  Throughout this conversation, however, we have not really asked if we are creating an appropriate higher education system that will work for the 21st century.<br/><br/>From the point of view of the institutions, we know that this system will not be capable of funding capital expenditure.  The solutions that have been found in income-contingent loan systems such as the British one have relied on the capital markets.  In Britain, they have also relied on the Bank of England to provide support in that context.  We know that rankings require much more money than an income-contingent loan system could provide.  At present, the best universities in Ireland, on an income-per-staff-member basis, still have half the income of those against which they are competing in the United States and under a quarter of those in Asia.<br/><br/>We must then look to the Exchequer.  Not only does it have to finance this in advance, it also has to find a means for cost recovery.  Dr. Corbet will focus on the securitisation process, which is crucial if Ireland is not to wind up financing this entirely itself.  Ireland has very limited headroom.  Part of the process that has taken place since the crisis is a move towards fiscal stress tests.  They work tirelessly to remove contingent liabilities from the State's balance sheet.  That is the case that would exist with income-contingent loans, which is why Dr. Corbet and I have looked at this.</p><p>Within our analysis, we have found that only 38.5% of the loan profile is of investment grade, subject to securitisation over a 20-year time horizon.  In order to make the system effective, one would have to keep the default rates below 15%, institute a minimum payment cap of &euro;2,000 per annum, and keep an interest rate between 7% and 8% over baseline sovereign rate.  One would have to have an EIB loan or a special purpose vehicle generating roughly &euro;600 million to &euro;700 million per annum and overall it would generate &euro;7 billion in net losses until it reaches a point of stabilisation in year 18.  If one wants to do that faster, one will have to increase the interest rates to more than 10% and drop the default rate to zero.  Ultimately, the interest rate is paramount in the system because of continuous compounding.  It has a damaging impact on inequality since it will place those in the &euro;25,000 to &euro;35,000 income bracket into a debt spiral very easily.</p><p> It is also important to note that wider issues of access and inequality are structural.  They require investment in the earlier years of education and in other components of the education system.  To entirely look upon the higher education system for the solutions is essentially looking for a plaster.  Our research has found that approximately 50% of graduates would be unable to pay the full net present value of the income-contingent loan over a 20-year time horizon.  We can only be sure that approximately 31% will pay entirely.</p><p> On the matter of reporting, which was mentioned at the outset, in the United Kingdom the Student Loans Company has an operating budget of &pound;138 million and it dedicates &pound;15.7 million of that every year to fighting fraud.  For those in that system who are abroad, a full 41% of them are either in arrears or uncontactable so the cost of administrating that becomes rapidly very expensive.  Also, in New Zealand they have had to resort to the criminal code in order to ensure compliance on the part of those who owe income to the New Zealand system, in certain cases going as far as arresting people at the airport.</p><p> Overall, our research shows that income contingent loans are a risky course of action.  They have the potential to create large contingent liabilities for the Exchequer and would modify significantly the social planning objectives that have been worked out between the Government and the higher education institutions.  If income contingent loans were investigated, it could very quickly become the case that cost recovery becomes the principal objective of the higher education system and issues of equity, social policy and the higher objectives of education will become secondary.  Overall, they would not provide the &euro;5.5 billion in capital expenditure required for the capital deficit that still exists in the higher education space.  The Government would need to propose substantial legislative changes not only on the accounting side in institutions, but also create a loan company and a loan recovery system and it would be of the complexity and the cost of something along the lines of the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p><p> These conclusions are based upon evidence but they also indicate that further investigation is required.  Many of the decisions lie in the political system and those decisions of social planning relate to the setting out of the parameters that the system will operate under and that changes the model substantially.  Ultimately, the political system has to give us guidance in order to model it in a way that is effective.</p><p> Income contingent loans in our views are only one part of what would have to become a suite of different solutions to a deep and wide-ranging problem in the higher education sector.  Taxation, increased student and family involvement and income-contingent loans, in addition to other dead instruments, would all have to be used in concert in order to solve what are very serious and in many ways intractable problems.</p><p> At the end of the day higher education has to be paid for and there are only three options: the student, firms and the Exchequer.  In all circumstances it is about revenue and not debt, as debts ultimately have to be repaid by revenues generated by income, profits or taxes.  In conclusion, the view is that, first, we must decide what type of higher education system we want and then we can decide how we can finance it.  I will now hand over to Dr. Corbet to discuss the complexities of that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.149" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Shaen Corbet" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017050200002#E00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me here today.  I have worked with Dr. Larkin to present our estimates of how a potential ICL system would perform if it were introduced in Ireland.  We have conducted an analysis of the 2014 to 2015 graduating student cohort to investigate the viability of a potential ICL system where the results of some of the analyses which we have conducted are contained within our submitted report.  We will present evidence of a variety of scenarios in the near future and wish to stress that our estimates are based on a working methodology.</p> <p>  I will not go through the results in detail.  Instead, I will give a broad overview of our key findings to date and the evidence of the risks and issues that have been identified in international ICL systems.  We are faced with the dilemma of implementing a system that provides equity to all participants, that promotes student access and which will not impose losses upon the Exchequer.  ICLs possess the capacity to generate affordability of repayments.  However, we focus upon the potential costs and specific risks that are contained within the system, particularly as ICLs are usually guaranteed and in some cases directly funded by the state.  A potential ICL system must recognise that we are losing a significant proportion of our most qualified students to emigration and that some of our academic institutions possess substantial non-progression rates.  We must note the student loan growth in the UK has been associated with a substantial increase in household debt.  That has occurred as recently as late 2016.  UK university fees have now increased and have been capped at &pound;9,250.  It is estimated that the average graduate will now leave higher education with approximately &pound;44,000 debt.</p> <p>  We must then consider the potential scenario of a couple, for example, who would leave college with approximately &pound;88,000 debt and what a bank manager would say should the couple seek to obtain a mortgage.  It would be perceived to be highly problematic and we would hypothesise that this type of debt could manifest itself into episodes of real economic shocks, perhaps in the property sector in the near future, without considerable research and effective planning.  We must also consider research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in the UK, which recently concluded that approximately 70% of the graduating students there in 2015 were expected never to finish repaying their student debt.</p> <p>  Our updated methodology, presented today, utilises available pre-crisis datasets to identify the correlation between age and salary, which have been enhanced through the inclusion of data sourced from Irish employment vacancy sources, consultation with recruitment companies, student bodies, university career advisory services and publicly available data to estimate Irish salary growth using recentered influence functions, RIF, among a number of other methodologies.  The estimated salary distributions are then modelled upon gross earning ventiles which are separated by the course the student has completed, as denoted by the ISCED field of study.  These ventiles incorporate specific information based upon the gender, level of education and facility in which the student attended.  We have selected a wide range of potential career avenues that students within each discipline are considered to undertake, through analysis of university course advertisements, national educational advisory sources and further aided by the Georgetown University report from 2015, The Economic Volume of College Majors, from which we could allocate a 20-year earning estimate based upon our estimates of graduate salary.  As a robustness test, our modelled salaries are found to be in line with the recent HEA report, What do Graduates do?, based upon the graduating cohort of 2015.  We have modelled our baseline ICL repayment threshold on the median graduate salary, which is estimated to be &euro;25,000, when considering the number of students graduating within each discipline.  The assumption that all graduates can complete 20 years of employment was made.  In terms of age, we are starting with baseline graduates.</p></speech>

The 20-year models were selected due to evidence based upon the most likely period of debt securitisation, which is the process commonly used in other jurisdictions such as the UK.  We have implemented an expected loss methodology upon these forecasts based upon the proportion of the loan book that would be repaid over 20 years.</p><p>The expected loss is calculated as a function of the graduating estimate of &euro;18,000 owed, which is calculated as &euro;3,000 for four undergraduate years in university and &euro;6,000 for one postgraduate year.  We then built our ICL model on these forecasts, applying similar repayment thresholds and replaying categories such as those found in the UK ICL system.  Once salaries reach the income-contingent level of &euro;25,000, we assume the student will then proceed to repay the loan.  We estimate the methodologies upon the repayment of 10% of gross income being repaid to the ICL upon an interest rate of 1.5% on income in excess of &euro;25,000 and 3.5% on income in excess of &euro;45,000.</p><p> Our decision to present our estimates excluding grant recipients was based on our stakeholder consultation to date, which has presented considerable opposition to any changes in the grant structure.  Our methodology incorporates the estimated graduate emigration and incompletion rates as provided by multiple sources, including individual universities and the HEA.  We estimate that the top five ventiles or 19.8% of students will achieve break even within 20 years.  We accept that this group will generate a profit over the period.  However, we find that the expected loss of the lowest ventiles, 19 and 20, is more than 98%, incorporating 5.7% of the graduating students.  These would be considered to be lowest earners upon graduation.</p><p> We also present our estimates for profit and loss within the proposed ICL system.  We can clearly observe that, outside the grants paid by governments each year, the system would necessitate annual liquidity provision of between &euro;600 million and &euro;700 million for the first seven years.  However, we find the system would reach a break-even point at year 18 where it would return a profit after reaching an estimated running loss of &euro;7.1 billion.  These estimates are completed under the assumption that the economy continues to grow unaffected between the start up of the ICL and the break-even point.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Shaen Corbet" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017050200002#F00300"><p>The rate of growth is assumed to be 1%.  This is a highly unlikely scenario, particularly as a shock such as that experienced in the recent economic collapse would render the ICL system in immediate danger due to two significant side effects.  One is raising the necessary capital and the second is student non-repayment due to a host of reasons, such as unemployment and wage reductions, as witnessed during the recent financial crisis.  There is also evidence to suggest that there exists a functional ICL system for postgraduate education across most education facilities.  This appears, based on these preliminary estimates, to merit further investigation.<br/><br/>Five key characteristics increase the probability of negative outcomes should an ICL system be implemented.  The first is emigration, which has presented itself to be one of the major issues associated with the New Zealand system, which has manifested itself into approximately NZ$1 billion in overdue overseas student loans.  The second issue is the non-progression rate.  Further research is necessary to estimate the potential effects of non-progression on a potential ICL system.  Currently, it is assumed to be 21% of IOT students and 11% of university students.  The third issue is based on salary shocks.  One substantial issue identified within wage shocks is they do not influence each sector equally.  Analysis of the earning hours and employment cost survey indicates the extent to which there has been inequality in wage recovery.  Continued wage restoration to pre-crisis levels has not presented in the education and health sectors by approximately 5.7% and 6.2%, respectively.  The fourth issue is based on potential securitisation to generate liquidity.  In the UK in late 2013, it was widely reported that a company called Erudio Student Loans had been named the successful bidder on the 1990 to 1998 loan book, which was estimated to be worth &pound;890 million.  It eventually sold for &pound;160 million, a discount of approximately 82%.<br/><br/>Another key issue is economic contagion.  In mid-2016, the<i>Financial Times</i>reported that following a dramatic increase in university fees in the UK, student loan debt had increased by &pound;12.6 billion in 2015-2016, standing at &pound;86.2 billion.  This increase in fees has a direct effect on household that, reiterating my earlier point.  There are some key points to note.  Policy options have a shelf life.  This may have worked between 2003 and 2006 during the Celtic tiger era but it may not have been acceptable between 2008 and 2014.  We do not know at the minute; more research is needed.<br/><br/>I previously worked as an equity and commodities trader and I also worked with in the financial stability division of the Central Bank.  I teach postgraduate classes in DCU in financial theory, derivatives and financial engineering.  Student conversations these days are based mostly on living conditions and commuting and they are not generally about fees.  It is about the cost of living associated with going to college.  We must continuously focus on our high taxation and household debt when compared to our European counterparts.  We do not have much space to increase household debt further and certainly not in line with the UK estimates and the way its system has expanded.<br/><br/>In my time at DCU, we have noticed the pressures on our system.  At our business school, for example, under the leadership; and direction of Professor Anne Sinnott, we have improved efficiency and quality, which has been represented in our recent Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, AACSB, accreditation leaving us in the top 5% of the international business schools.  This occurred in the midst of the funding crisis.  This presents evidence that some university departments have adapted to circumstance.  This crisis is about adaptability and resource management combined with funding.  In line with funding options, perhaps solutions could be found in the efficiency and performance of the system as a whole.  The question is: who is more important - the student, the educational facility or, indeed, the Exchequer?<br/><br/>Based on our estimates, we find that an ICL system would be a risky course of action for Ireland.  It has the potential to generate significant liabilities for the Exchequer while generating future economic distortions through the additional debt imposed on our graduates.  Further research is necessary to test potential side effects of such a system.  We must remember that this is an education system and not a banking or lending system.  We must accept that an ICL system would modify the significant social planning objectives that have been put in place and we must note that it is reliant on economic stability and cannot be guaranteed in the long term.  As identified across other ICL systems, there are inherent issues for a variety of reasons, including emigration and the ability to absorb further unsecured debt.  We conclude that seeking a single panacea to higher education funding in the form of ICLs may not be an appropriate choice due to the system's vulnerability and certain social and economic characteristics which are found in Ireland.</p></speech>

We have had four excellent presentations.  We are all agreed that we are in crisis in respect of third-level fees, both currently and given the demographics coming down the line.  Ultimately, we have to do what is fair to students, their families, universities, and the taxpayer, particularly as the taxpayer has a significant stake in this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.156" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1404" speakername="Lynn Ruane" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017050200002#F00500"><p>I thank everyone for their presentations.  I tried as best I could to dissect them before the meeting but I did not understand some of the figures and I will seek clarification on them.  The moment we allow the State to even step out slightly in respect of education, we will move towards the privatisation of our education system, which will not be a positive.  I would like Dr. Corbet and Dr. Larkin to respond to my initial questions before I turn to Dr. Doris and Dr. Flannery.</p> <p>  Could Dr. Corbet and Dr. Larkin elaborate on the New Zealand model given that the government there is considering the arrest of defaulting emigrants at its airports?  People will be criminalised for returning home.  Could they also refer to the Hungarian system?  What impact could the introduction of loans have on the future borrowing ability of graduates?</p><p>What effect will the high current and expected household debt in Ireland have on the proposed ICL system?  It was pointed out to me today that Australia's household debt is similar to Ireland's but the figures seem to be compared more as they are now than in 1989, when income-contingent loans were introduced and when, I believe, disposable income was quite steady.  It was during the 1990s that Australia started to see a shift in its economy.  I also ask the witnesses to explain how they believe the ICL model would not solve the third level funding crisis, in particular given the initial cost of the model.  It was said it would take up to 17 years before we even began to break even.  If the system is in crisis, what happens between now and 17 years' time?  It is still not clear whether the training levy would be an additional resource to education or a replacement for lost resources, so there might not even be any revenue there either in the interim.  What effect will an ICL model have on a future equitable or social policy in education?</p><p> There is a point in the written statement submitted by Dr. Doris and Dr. Flannery that the fully taxpayer-funded system may seem attractive because it provides access to education at no upfront cost to the student but that that is regressive.  Do they not feel that those who earn more should pay more?  In my view, this would be a progressive, not a regressive, system.  In response to another point in their statement that the amount one repays is based on one's monthly earnings, as we can see from the research by Dr. Larkin and Dr. Corbet, there is expected to be a high rate of default.  Who do Dr. Doris and Dr. Flannery expect to pick up the default?  Is it the taxpayer?  Who would absorb that cost?</p><p> There are two points in the presentation by Dr. Doris and Dr. Flannery at which reference was made to incentives.  I find it quite worrying that anyone would feel it appropriate to propose to give a 10% discount to those who could afford to pay upfront.  That is inappropriate.  I think they are proposing to reward those from wealthier backgrounds who will be in a position to pay upfront and almost punishing students from poorer backgrounds who will not be in a position to avail of a 10% discount.  Even the inclusion of a proposal for such an incentive in the two witnesses' presentation is very worrying in respect of how they view equity of access to education.</p><p> I have one more question to put perhaps to both sides of the debate.  The issue of gender, which I had not thought of, was raised in respect of gaps in women's participation in the workforce and how the debt will hang over them much longer if they have to take longer periods out of work to care for children.  Is this already an unfair system when gender is considered, but also in respect of people with disabilities who will enter university burdened perhaps already with high costs in terms of their living costs, medication and wheelchairs if they have them or anything else additional they may need for their health?  Have Dr. Doris and Dr. Flannery considered that people with disabilities will be put off having a further loan put on top of them if they have any kinds of health-related issues?</p><p> I am very concerned that the burden of debt is placed on the poor.  My child, for example, is in leaving certificate year.  Were an income-contingent loan introduced today, I would pay her fees upfront with or without a 10% discount.  The poor person, the person coming from a one-parent household or the person with no income coming into the house does not have choice; such people are forced into debt.  The debt will therefore end up transferred onto the person with the lowest income because the person who has wealth has a choice whether to take an income-contingent loan.  I feel that income-contingent loans on this basis alone should not be considered at all.</p></speech>

I come from the position that we must stop viewing education as a cost but as the investment it is.  I wish to delve more into the potential impact of these income-contingent loans on emigration.  We are a country that suffers from emigration and with a youth unemployment rate of 14%, are we not at huge risk of shedding our talented graduates?  It is very alarming to see how New Zealand is dealing with this.  It is basically monitoring graduates living outside New Zealand for arrest when they return.  We do not want to see that happen to our graduates in Ireland.  We want to hold them in our country and encourage them to stay here.</p> <p>  Before I was elected to the D&aacute;il, I was a teacher for 16 years in a DEIS school.  Consequently, I am very aware of the student who is first in his or her family.  It is a complete departure to consider entering third level.  They need to be held and encouraged along the line by family and by school.  It took my breath away to see in Dr. Doris's and Dr. Flannery's submission the proposal for an incentive to pay upfront.  Obviously, there is not a tad of understanding for the student who can never, ever imagine paying upfront.  It is completely unfair when we should be addressing equality of access and opportunity in education.  Talk about being blind to the very children we should be targeting to bring into third level.  These are gifted children for whom the cost is stopping them from entering third level.  Not only do I feel it is wrong for the student but I also believe there is a risk to the State when we consider countries in which the payback rate is as low as 30%; the one in six dropouts, as was referred to, a rate which rises to 26% in our institutes of technology, IOTs, the potential for default through emigration and two recessions 20 years apart.  Then we see on page 84 of the Cassells report that the estimation is &euro;10 billion of debt in the first 20 years.  That leads us into the next cycle, which, as mentioned, could be a recession.  Is that &euro;10 billion of debt therefore vastly underestimated when one takes all of this into consideration?</p> <p>  Finally, Senator Ruane raised the issue of gender but it struck me today: what happens to the stay-at-home parents, be they mothers or fathers, who go to work and then decide instead they want to stay at home with their children?  What happens in that scenario?</p></speech>

It would be great if all public policy was decided like this, with some of our top academics coming to a televised session to be interviewed by politicians.  I think we would have better public policy if that were the case.  It is absolutely wonderful that we have four PhD-holders here giving us their views even though they are different.  I hope we are interrogating both sides to try to get some answers because it is ultimately us who must make the decisions.  I wanted to say that because it is fantastic and it is a pleasure to be here listening to them.</p> <p>  I agree with Dr. Doris on one point and had never really thought about it like this previously.  I am in principle in favour of free education - we all are - but it is true that one earns more the more highly educated one is.  Therefore, it is a transfer of resources from the lower paid to the higher paid.  There is no question about that.  I have never heard that expressed before but I agree that it is the case.  That is worth bearing in mind in all of this debate.</p> <p>  We in Fianna F&aacute;il have kept an open mind on the Cassells report, and I have kept an open mind here today and will continue to do so.  I have not yet been convinced by either side of the debate, which I think is good because I do not think we have got enough information to make a decision yet.</p> <p>  We have to hand Dr. Larkin's and Dr. Corbet's report.  I heard Dr. Larkin speak at the Technological Higher Education Association, THEA, conference, and both met me subsequently.  I thought this was very useful and I thank them for making their time available to many of us.  We also have a response we requested from Dr. Doris and Dr. Flannery, which is also extremely useful.  However, by Dr. Larkin's and Dr. Corbet's own admissions, this is not finished; it is a work in progress.  I do not know how but I was under the impression that this was a finished product and that of Dr. Doris and Dr. Flannery is a response.  Should the committee or the Chairman ask somebody else - perhaps the ESRI or a similar body - to examine all these issues and this massive body of work that has already been produced from these four generous individuals here?  I wonder is that a route the committee should go down, but that is an aside.</p> <p>  There seem to be many assumptions built into Dr. Larkin's and Dr. Corbet's paper.  Something that struck me was the 1% economic growth projection.  I know there are recessions and so on but perhaps they could explain that a little more.  It is not the figure political parties use in their manifestos but perhaps there is a happy medium somewhere else.  I do not know.</p><p>Dr. Corbet and Dr. Larkin refer to graduates being available to repay the loan over a 20-year horizon.  Will they elaborate on that point?  Does it mean graduates would have a 20-year window within which to work?  I would be a little surprised if that were the assumption.</p><p> Dr. Corbet and Dr. Larkin discovered through their research or made an assumption that 50% of graduates would be unable to pay the full net present value of the income contingent loan over a 20-year horizon.  Their modelling, according to their presentation, "shows that we can be assured of repayment in only 31% of graduates".  This strikes me as an extremely pessimistic view.  If 50% of graduates were unable to repay the full value of the loan and repayment was only assured in 31% of cases, what would anybody be able to pay?  While the loan would be substantial, it would not be the largest debt a graduate would have as a mortgage repayment would be larger.  According to these projections, a very high percentage of graduates will be unable to repay the loans.  Given the pessimistic scenarios presented, who would pay the general taxation that would be required under an alternative model?  It seems we would not be able to do anything under these assumptions.</p><p> I am asking questions purely to elicit information.  I am very grateful for the work the witnesses have done because it has got us thinking on a new level, which is what we need to do.</p></speech>

I remain totally unconvinced that an income contingent loan system is a means to address the financial crisis in the higher education system.  I share the view of many others that such a system would impact on under-represented groups and children who grow up in disadvantage.  It would exacerbate the cycle of disadvantage and I do not see any merit in the proposal.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses provide an overview of exactly how much it would cost the Government to operate an income contingent loan scheme for the next ten years?  What level of State investment would be required?  Will they advise further as to whether the proposed model would be a Government backed scheme or special purpose vehicle or would it be privatised, as Senator Boylan indicated?  If a Government backed scheme were implemented and the default rate was higher than anticipated, what options would be available?  Would student numbers have to be cut or fees increased and would unprofitable loans be sold off to private investors?  How would the Government retain control of the terms and conditions attached to loans?</p> <p>  If a special purpose vehicle were established, what conditions would be required to ensure this vehicle remained off balance sheet?  How would the State retain control of overall policy?  Would it be possible for the special purpose vehicle to remain in State ownership, rather than being privatised?  Would the terms and conditions attaching to loans be set by the Government and, if so, how would this be achieved?</p> <p>  A paper should be drawn up to answer the questions I have asked because the proposal gives rise to many questions.  It is impossible for the joint committee to make a recommendation in light of the many questions that the model for student loans generates.  We have not been given sufficient clarity to even consider the income contingent loan model further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.162" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1377" speakername="Trevor &Oacute; Clochartaigh" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017050200002#H00300"><p>T&aacute; c&eacute;ad m&iacute;le f&aacute;ilte romhaibh.  I was delving into my past during the presentations.  For a while, it felt as if I was back in my bachelor of commerce class in University College Galway.  Unfortunately, much of the material went over my head, although I tried to follow it as best I could.  While the presentation was very interesting, it brings to mind the expression that while the doctors differ, the patient dies.  Opinions on this issue diverge and it is difficult to identify where the true path lies.</p> <p>  On the social reading for the data and what it will do for key adult milestones, for example, mortgage acquisition and starting a family, the evidence from New Zealand and Australia, which was outlined previously to the joint committee by the Union of Students of Ireland, is that income contingent loans are having a negative effect on these milestones and delaying them by years.  How do Dr. Doris and Dr. Flannery respond to the evidence that people are starting families and taking out mortgages later as a result of income contingent loans?</p> <p>  Given that participation rates by mature students and part-time learners plummeted to 40% after income contingent loans were introduced in the United Kingdom, what impact would such loans have on these groups in Ireland?  It should be noted that mature students and part-time learners have been targeted in the Access Plan 2015 to 2018 as groups to be incentivised to enter higher education.  </p> <p>  According to the submission made by Dr. Doris and Dr. Flannery, there is nothing about an income contingent loan system that is inherently costly in terms of government finances because students repay most of their debt.  However, the evidence from every jurisdiction in which income contingent loan systems have been introduced is that they are incredibly costly to the State, as evidenced by the need to increase fees every year beyond inflation levels to recuperate costs.  How can we expect circumstances in Ireland to be different from those prevailing in other countries?</p> <p>  As previous speakers noted, interest rates will mean that students who cannot afford to pay &euro;5,000 per annum will end up paying much more for higher education that those who can afford to pay &euro;5,000 per annum.  Is the proposal to provide a further 10% discount to those who pay upfront not simply an incentive for the wealthy, one which places lower income families at a further disadvantage?</p> <p>  I listened with great interest to Dr. Larkin and Dr. Corbet.  What I picked up from Dr. Larkin's contribution was that we must look at the overall cost of education and follow the money.  His basic argument appeared to be that rather than an education system, we have corporations in which there is significant waste and that much of the money being provided to these corporations is not being used to educate students.  Will he indicate where the money is going?  Dr. Corbet stated the model in place in Dublin City University was changed.  How was it changed?  How were the university's finances reorganised and where was funding spent and savings made?</p> <p>  There seems to be no end to the money available in third level institutions to spend on legal fees and hiring consultants, whereas money is not available to provide materials for science laboratories, etc.  What does this say about priorities? </p> <p>  I am interested in the education-labour market mismatch to which Dr. Larkin's and Dr. Corbet's paper refers.  It notes a mismatch of 33% in the case of Ireland.  I taught in two third level institutions and I was shocked by the number of students who appeared to be doing the wrong courses.  How do we address this issue?  How much money is being wasted in the system?  If we addressed waste and reduced the rate of drop-out at third level, we would reduce the need for income. </p> <p>  Reading Dr. Larkin's and Dr. Corbet's paper, it struck me that an income contingent loan scheme could be an Irish Water for education.   That may be a simplistic conclusion but it appears that it is proposed to pump up to a &euro;1 billion per annum into a system and ask people to pay for it before the system itself is fixed.  In the case of Irish Water, large amounts were spent on creating the infrastructure of the company but we did not fix the pipes.  Is it Dr. Larkin's and Dr. Corbet's view that we must first fix what is broken in the third level education system and ensure money is being spent in the right places before pumping money into it to prop up the current system and cost model?</p> <p>  Dr. Corbet referred to the context of household debt.  One cannot view the income contingent loan as being the only loan a person will have.  We all meet large numbers of graduates with arts degrees who are working in coffee shops, restaurants and hotels and earn the minimum wage or less.  These people will want to raise families, get on the property ladder and take out mortgages.  Would they have a future under a system of income contingent loans or would the system add to household debt and create an even greater divide between the haves and have nots?</p> <p>  Dr. Corbet also alluded to adaptability and resource management and summed up by describing third level as an education system as opposed to a banking system.  This is the first time I have considered the issue from that perspective.  I would welcome the witnesses' responses to my questions.</p></speech>

This morning, I listened to a debate on my local radio station which featured Dr. Ed Walsh, the former president of the University of Limerick.  Dr. Walsh pushed the idea that graduates should get a job and repay their student loans once they reached a certain income threshold.  Interestingly, this proposal received more support than any of the other options presented in the debate in a live poll.  It was interesting that the loan proposal appeared to be the most attractive.</p></speech>

I will not take up too much time myself as we need to get back to the four experts and professionals.  However, areas of concern to me would include equity of access and ensuring that, no matter what, we are not putting more barriers in the way of students.  I was going to say young people but sometimes older people want access as well.  The issue of choice was referred to by Deputy Martin.  I would be interested in the witnesses' thoughts on students who start to work, become parents and then make a decision for one reason or another to stay at home and care for their children.</p><p>There is a huge concern about what has happened in the United States and New Zealand.  None of us could or would ever condone a situation, and we would ensure we never have it, where people who have not paid back their loans have the bailiff or the sheriff knocking on their doors.</p><p>We cannot say that loans do not happen at this point.  This has been lost a little bit.  I know of many situations - I am sure all of us do - where parents took out significant loans to ensure their children go to college, particularly those who are just over the SUSI threshold and those who live outside of a city where there is easy access to college.  Members of my family have taken out loans with high interest rates for further education such as a masters degree.  We have been lucky to go on and get good jobs and be able to pay them back.  Loans are a matter of fact at this point but they are not income contingent.</p><p>There was an interesting article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>about a study by Professor Chapman and Dr. Doris.  The size of a loan was set at &euro;16,000, which would be &euro;4,000 per year of study, and its repayment would kick into play, possibly, when a graduate would reach the average graduate salary of &euro;26,000.  Repayment would therefore be completed by the age of 33.  To put a bit of balance into the debate, this goes against some of the figures.</p></speech>

Therefore, those figures are wrong because they are based on &euro;4,000 a year while the fees would actually go up to &euro;5,000 per year.</p></speech>

We are in a situation where we need the Government of the day to invest in higher education.  No matter what happens in terms of finance down the road, we absolutely need investment at this point.  We sat here and listened to the leaders in the area from the universities and the institutes of technology say that they are at absolute crisis.  It has to be a given that the Minister for Education and Skills sells that to the Cabinet when decisions are made.  We would have hoped for a commitment to more investment in the last budget but that did not happen.  We will be putting on huge pressure to ensure that investment comes in at the next level.  However, we still go back to the issue of supporting the students of today and the students of the future and ensuring equity of access, which is very important.</p> <p>  I will revert to the four witnesses.  Would they like to speak in the same order?  Otherwise, they can indicate.  I am in their hands.  We will start with Dr. Doris.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Aed&iacute;n Doris" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2017050200002#J00400"><p>Deputy Nolan and others - I have lost track - asked about the overall cost of income contingent loans.  There is a concern that this will be very costly.  The concern was also raised by Dr. Larkin and Dr. Corbet.  What is being missed is that, if we accept we need an increase in higher education funding, which, working in the sector, I certainly accept, there is no way to do it cheaply.  The alternative of funding it through higher taxation will also add to the national debt and the deficit.  What I showed in the analysis in the paper is that it will add substantially more to it, which will reduce the resources available for other uses, including the kind of uses that would be much more effective at promoting access.</p> <p>  I completely agree with Senator Ruane that access is paramount.  I would never be in favour of these loans if I believed they damaged access.  I said the same thing at the committee.  We have a lot of evidence from other countries, thankfully, that we can benefit from.  When fees in the UK went from &euro;3,000 to &euro;9,000 overnight, which was a huge increase in the prospective debt faced by students, there was no negative effect on access at all.  Students understand that the investment they will undertake will pay back.  They understand the high return on education.  They also understand that these repayments will be made in the future and only if they can afford them.  Australia and New Zealand found the same thing, which is that there is no negative effect on access.  I agree with Senator Ruane that they should not be considered if there were.</p></speech>

I agree absolutely with the Senator.  However, it does not damage access.  What improves access are measures taken at first, second and preschool level.  There is a huge amount of research on what prevents students from going to higher education.  It is about the quality of primary and secondary schooling and the expectations there are of them.  There are things we can do to change those expectations and to change the performance of some schools where expectations are not high and the supports are not in place.</p> <p>  There are things we can do, but they are earlier in the system.  By the time students get to the point of having their CAO points and going to university, it is almost too late.  There is a little bit that can be done at the edges and it is important to do it.  I completely accept that there is a little bit that can be done and it is important that it is done, but the much bigger issues lie much earlier in the system.  That is where the focus should be when it comes to access.  The Senator is right that it does not improve access, but it is not designed to improve access.</p></speech>

It is not about inequity of access to college but an inequality in terms of who is left burdened with debt.</p></speech>

What she has in mind when she speaks about the inequality of the system is parental income and how that affects who pays the most.  If we think about it, graduates are adults by the time they graduate.  At that stage, we judge them on their own income.  Some people from very poor backgrounds become corporate lawyers and those corporate lawyers should repay the cost of their education.</p></speech>

We can see from all the research on earnings in the workforce that, even if we hold the level of education and things like CAO points constant, the kids of better-off parents do better in the workplace.  It is an advantage to have better-off parents.  We will not get rid of that overnight.  I would like it to happen but it will not happen.  Therefore, when we are targeting resources, the important thing is to get the people who turn out to have benefited most from education to pay for it.  Students whose parents pay their fees upfront may also be those whose parents paid for their private education.  These parents will also be the ones who will provide the deposit for these students' houses when the time comes.</p><p>Well-to-do people help their kids in many ways.  If parents do not spend their savings on fees, they will spend it on something else.  When fees were removed back in the 1990s attendance at private schools and the use of grinds increased not by the poor kids but the well-to-do kids.  Parents used the resources that they would have spent on education fees to give their kids advantages in other ways.  These kids are going to be advantaged.  Whether they are advantaged by their parents paying their fees, paying for grinds or helping to pay a deposit for a house, the final outcome does not matter in terms of how well off they end up.  It is a matter of shifting between pots.  Does the Senator see what I mean?</p></speech>

We need a system to ensure that when a family's earning power falls below a certain amount that there is an option not to pay fees.  The free fees system simply shifts the wealth to grinds and private school fees.  The exact same thing will happen if we introduce income-contingent loans.  The poor children will be the only ones who pay the debt.  They will pay for the education system through an income-contingent loan.  Such a situation will affect their future prospects, their ability to get on the property ladder and their ability to make parental decisions.  The scheme would reinforce the ability of better-off children to have more freedom in their lives and not leave college with a financial burden because their parents will pay.  The situation would be unequal.</p></speech>

It seems completely unfair to me that so much of the taxes paid by people who have never gone to college or whose kids have no intention of ever going to college are used to pay for higher education to give people a leg-up through the income distribution.  It is a much greater unfairness than asking people from poor backgrounds but who end up doing well in the labour market as a result of having a degree to pay a contribution towards those costs.  It is a matter of emphasis.</p></speech>

We concentrated on the public finance implications for introducing an ICL.  The only purpose for the inclusion of the 10% proposal was to show that if one is really concerned about the public finance implications, there are ways of getting around them.  Whether one chooses that particular route is another matter.  It is a matter of political choice.  We wanted to show that there is no inevitability about massive deficits in an ICL system once it is introduced.  Even if there were massive deficits in an ICL system, the same amount of funding, funded through any other system, will have an even bigger deficit.  That is the reality.</p></speech>

The UK system offers a discount and figures show that 10% of students in the UK avail of the discount.  The majority of students are encouraged not to avail of the discount because the cost of their education is lower if they take out a loan.  The cost is spread across a long period and the interest rate is lower than how fast their graduate wages will grow.  It means that students can chip away at their debt.  The people who pay upfront end up paying more in real terms for their education than those who pay back their loan over a longer period.  Students who wish to pursue higher education in the UK are advised that the smartest financial thing to do is to take out a loan.  It may sound counter-intuitive but students enjoy a greater Government subsidy because the cost is spread over a longer period.  Students in the UK benefit more compared with the people who pay upfront.  One would imagine that more people would drift towards paying 10% upfront but figures suggest that only 10% of students avail of the scheme in the UK.  A similar scheme was abolished in Australia.  As Dr. Doris has suggested, the upfront payment was used as a mechanism to boost initial funding.  Initially, the uptake of that upfront payment was approximately 15% in Australia.</p> <p>  Senator Ruane mentioned the impact that household debt has on education.  It is important that I mention the issue of repayment burdens.  The Australian and Hungarian systems have in-built repayment burdens.  Therefore, repayments in a given month or year cannot go above a certain percentage of income.  The parameter can be flexible and decided upon.  Mitigation of some of the impact on household debt in a given year or period is built into the system.  In Australia the system is gradual and has various steps.  The repayment burden increases to a maximum of 10% for higher-earner graduates.  Lower-earner graduates above a certain threshold may pay only 2% in a given year or month, depending on their situation.</p> <p>  Senator Ruane made a few points about the redistribution effect of a free fees system and how the public should finance fees through a combination of upfront fees and State assistance.   As we mentioned in our submission, one issue with the current system in Ireland is that in times of recession, spending on higher education must compete with all the other sectors.  The issue becomes more acute in higher education.  What tends to happen in a time of recession is that demand increases but funding decreases.  There is a contradiction in Ireland because education heavily relies on direct public funding.  </p> <p>  Senator Ruane mentioned Hungary and New Zealand.  She directed her questions at Dr. Larkin and Dr. Corbet but I shall answer too.  The Hungarian system is probably not the best comparator with Ireland because it initially introduced loans for maintenance grants.  In other words, Hungary abolished maintenance grants and simply provided loans for maintenance grants.  The matter has not been talked about here in any context, as far as I am aware.  Hungary introduced loans for student fees post-2012.  The impact has yet to be analysed because the students will only graduate this year.  Also, the system was completely privately financed.  The Hungarian Government gave a guarantee but the model is privately financed, which differs from the systems in the UK and Australia.  </p> <p>  Emigration was mentioned a couple of times as a problem in New Zealand, which it is and was.  Research has shown, however, that a bigger issue in respect of the public finances and the sustainability of the New Zealand system was the interest rate applied there.  The New Zealand Government applied a zero nominal interest rate that was way below the cost of Government borrowing.  The interest rate was way below the amount of money that the Government took out to loan to students.  A far lower interest rate was attached to the scheme than it borrowed at, which caused repayment problems.  The interest rate was by far a greater problem than the graduate emigration problem.  Lately, some adjustments have been made to the system.  I suspect the reason such a scheme was introduced was because an election was in the offing.  </p> <p>  Shall I respond to the questions posed by the other Deputies?</p></speech>

The Deputy stated that education is an investment.  It strikes me that the loan system treats education like an investment because the people who get the most return from the investment are the ones who end up paying back.  The people who do not get a return on the investment do not pay back the investment.  They are inherently guarded by the system, which is income contingent by nature.</p><p>The implications for a stay-at-home parent were mentioned a couple of times.  A stay at home parent can be insulated by putting an income threshold in place and if their income is below that, they will be accommodated.  If people make that choice from a household or any other point of view, this higher education funding mechanism would ensure that they would not face these repayments simply by making that choice.</p></speech>

To answer Deputy Nolan in regard to the impact on access, as Dr. Doris suggested in terms of social inequalities and such issues, the system is inherently free at the point of access, as a fully taxpayer-funded system would be.  Our submission shows the deficit and the funding implications of comparing those two systems.  It shows that one system has significantly more adverse impacts from a debt or deficit perspective than the other.</p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne asked what would happen if there were to be a recession.  Third-level graduates have probably the most safeguards against the impact of a recession.  If one looks at the previous recession in Ireland, graduates were affected but other people in society were particularly negatively affected.  The system can remain sustainable across periods of recession.</p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned the idea of a build-up of debt and milestones in terms of mortgage and family formation.  If one looks at the alternatives, for example, if higher education funding were increased, people might not face repayments in terms of income contingent loan system but may face higher taxes.

One could come up with anecdotal stories of people who say they were left in that situation and made a decision but, looking at the mean, as these studies tend to do, there has not been an effect.  Family formation has been happening later in Australia but that is following a trend that was happening before income contingent loans were brought in.  Family formation is also happening later in Ireland.  There is an international trend that women are more educated and are having their babies later.  When one discounts that trend, income contingent loans have not had an impact on family formation.</p></speech>

Dr. Corbet will respond to Senator Ruane in respect of New Zealand and Hungary.</p> <p>  In terms of high debt levels and household debt, Ireland is still in the repayment paying down mode.  If one looks at systems that have been brought on line, as Dr. Corbet said, there is a shelf life for policies.  When these policies were introduced in other countries, in many cases the countries had very low household debt levels which have increased over time.  One counter-example to that is the UK, which had a high household debt level to begin with.</p> <p>  The training levy is still an open question politically.  Therefore, nobody really knows where that &euro;200 million is going to go.  In terms of overall higher education funding, that &euro;200 million is an exceptionally small plaster to keep the higher education system operational.</p> <p>  In terms of equity issues, an income-contingent loan has to be kept simple.  Complexity is problematic for those from poorer backgrounds with respect to financial instruments.  They are very risk-averse against them.  I have shown that, following the crisis, the upcoming generation has a greater level of risk-adversity than their parents.  There has been a change in how people behave as a result of the crisis, which is not surprising.</p> <p>  We build a pay differential between genders into our model.  Unfortunately, Ireland does not have legislation requiring men and women to be paid equally and that must be taken into account.</p> <p>  The income-contingent loan structure means that people who are disabled or leave the workforce at different points in time would not have to pay during that period.  It does not eliminate the debt hanging over them.  The real question is what to do about individuals who leave the labour market.  If they have a mortgage-style loan, they have to continue paying, whereas if they have an income contingent loan, they do not have to pay.  If the cost of their education is provided through a grant or some sort of fee remission scheme then they do not have that repayment anyway.</p></speech>

There needs to be a revenue collection system that operates at a zero marginal cost to add this structure to it.<br/><br/>To answer Deputy Catherine Martin, youth unemployment is a very serious issue.  It is part of the reason why Rahm Emanuel has brought in a new policy in Chicago of moving towards a K-14 or kindergarten to the second year of college as opposed to a K-12 of kindergarten to 12th grade education system to try to reduce the number of people not in education, training or employment, or &quot;NIETEs&quot;, as <i>The Economist</i>called them.  The youth unemployment solution is more education.  Many similar arguments can be found in economic history tomes about the debate which took place at the end of the 19th century regarding public finance of secondary education or the high school movement as it was called.<br/><br/>In terms of the monitoring of graduates in New Zealand, new bilateral agreements have been made between the New Zealand and Australian governments in order to share revenue information.  One way that the immigration could be solved would be to redesign the Irish taxation system to make it American, which means that that tax is collected globally.  If one is an American citizen, regardless of where one works or where on earth one is, one has to pay taxes to Uncle Sam.  It is as simple as that.  If that type of taxation system were used in Ireland, many of these problems would disappear.  However, I am not sure if that is a policy decision the Government is ready to make.<br/><br/>The issue of the stay-at-home parent concerns similar issues to those I addressed in answer to Senator Ruane.<br/><br/>The issue of economic conditions is very important.  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has been very, very clear that Ireland is a highly volatile economy.  It is a small open economy which is subject to exogenous shocks.  The shocks have upwards of two standard deviations effect on economic growth figures.  There are very few countries which have that sort of sensitivity to external shocks.</p><p>As a result, the understanding of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council about what to do with respect to Irish public policy amounts to wrapping it in as much cotton wool as possible because the fiscal position can change rapidly.  That has been the lesson from the financial crisis and that is part of what informs the policy.</p><p> Deputy Byrne raised another question.  I think his idea of having the ESRI carry out a comprehensive study of all the different scenarios and all the different plausible policy options is important.  Evidence-based policy is essential, especially in this area because the price of getting it wrong is so high.</p><p> The 20 year time horizon was built into the model because of the idea of the plausibility of repayment and securitisation.  When we are considering the net present value, the problem is compound interest over time.  If we start with compound interest rates, even at low levels, then what I call the unpleasant fiscal arithmetic becomes very difficult very quickly.</p><p> Reference was made to general taxation alternatives.  There are different ways of looking at the question.  Ireland has a taxation system that is progressive, but it results in high levels of taxation as we go above 150% of average income.  Average income is &euro;35,000.  In addition, Ireland, despite that skewed scenario, has a low revenue to GNP level in comparison with similar advanced western economies.  That is something to take note of.  It is also important to note that in many of the countries where an income contingent loan system has been successful, far lower headline rates of taxation apply and there is far more disposable income in the hands of the individual repaying loans.  We have to be careful about the incentivisation for individuals to stay within the jurisdiction and pay.</p><p> Deputy Nolan asked another question relating to the issue of looking at Government balance sheet operations and special purpose vehicles or privatisation.  Essentially, much of this is determined by the way in which we can approach the investment clauses in the European treaties.  If we are going to create a special purpose vehicle, we must have a relatively high return that is equal to the five year moving average of the cost of funds to the State.  Moreover, we must have it designed in such a way that 51% of the risk burden is held by private entity rather than the Exchequer.  As a general rule, Government-guaranteed or Government-associated special purpose vehicles are frowned upon not only by the OECD in its fiscal assessment but by the IMF in its fiscal stress tests as well.  They believe these vehicles are structured in such a way that they could become highly pro-cyclical at the very point when pro-cyclicality is not welcome.</p><p> I will address Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh's question.  There is some good research when it comes to looking at the effects on households.  In fact, two speeches given by the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the past fortnight have adverted to the impact of student loans on household formation.  Such loans delay household formation for up to four years, if not more in certain circumstances.  In the US context, these are mortgage-style loans, so the pain can be more acute.  However, there is also evidence in the UK that the overall volume of the loan is taken into account in the assessment for scoring for mortgages.  A person does not have to repay a loan following job loss.  However, if that person is carrying a certain quantum of debt, then it is taken into account when lenders are scoring mortgages, just as if they were looking at other debt instruments.</p><p> The question of whether income contingent loans are not inherently costly is an open one.  Many things may not be inherently costly but circumstances can make them so.  That is part of what we argue about.</p><p> There was a question on the modelling of where the money is going.  Part of what we have found in our analysis is that there has been a substantial increase in the amount of income going into the sector over time.  However, this is not necessarily related to an increase in the amount going towards student education.  Part of this has to do with the design of the system.  Considerable cross-subsidisation is built into the structure.  Part of the reason we have a large number of arts students in our system is because their full economic cost is rather low.  The saving can go to subvent people who are in medicine and sciences, which are expensive.  Unfortunately, this creates a situation whereby it can become encouraging to have a large number of those students, but those students will have employment mismatch upon graduation.  This scenario has strong welfare effects as well.  If we could analyse the Irish system in the way the US state university system is analysed, we could see how it becomes highly problematic because of the welfare losses brought about by this level of cross-subsidisation.  Ideally, prices would be individually designed for each individual course.  That is how it is done in state universities in the USA.  That maximises the amount of welfare.</p><p> Reference was made to wrong courses and drop-out levels.  This has elements of information asymmetry.  It is also a question of avenues of progression.  I know that other parts of the Department of Education and Skills are examining alternatives in apprenticeships and structures with the object of bringing people from levels 6 and 7 into levels 8, 9 and 10.</p><p> I noted the point that the movement of cost in education has in part been a function of access to debt.  The increases in prices in the USA and the UK have been functions of the fact that they do not produce sticker shock.  Due to the fact that we do not have a fully operational market in Ireland, we cannot easily determine what the price elasticity and income elasticity in respect of different prices for higher education would be, since other jurisdictions have a fully operational supply and demand function with prices.</p><p> Reference was made to the proposal being the Irish Water for education.  That is a slightly problematic comparison.  I would say that-----</p></speech>

I will do my best to go through them quickly.  Deputy Byrne referred to excessive pessimism.  Our supporting document presents the figures of the UK income contingent loan system in the context of student loan companies.  The information is contained in table 1 on page 14.  Let us consider one of the first years when there were more than 250,000 students.  For example, 2003 has 271,000 students.  We have combined all the figures from Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England in respect of that cohort.  At present we have a figure of 42.5% repayment.  That is quite successful.  It is a good system at that stage.  What we have in this system is 29.2% above the threshold who continue to pay at present.  We also have 13.2% below threshold.  What we are seeing across the board is that 57.5% have not paid the money some 13 years later.  That is on the record from the UK.  That is the estimate.</p> <p>  I want to touch briefly on one point that Dr. Larkin made.  I thought it was incredible when I discovered it myself.  The Chairman made a comment about the bailiffs and sheriffs coming in the door.  There needs to be a whip at some point to get debt back in terms of the banks and what actually happens.</p><p>I do not mean that we send sheriffs and people to knock on the front door.  If one openly tells someone who owes one money that one will not chase the debt, it is a big issue.  I do not know what strategy to adopt there.  If someone is on the west coast of America and they do not respond to letters from the Irish Government, it will be up to the Government to go to them to get the money back.  That is a big issue.  We have seen an issue develop within the New Zealand ICL system to the tune of NZ$1 billion, which is a considerable sum.  It has been developing over time.  Our submission includes figures for the age of overdue payments and they show that for the periods of between one to two years, two to five years and longer than five years, there is more than NZ$700 million in long-term arrears without any response.  It was reported in December 2016 that a crackdown on student loan borrowers identified 57,000 New Zealand students living in Australia where two-thirds were in default.  These people simply were ignoring contact from the New Zealand Government.  That is a big issue.</p><p> We were asked about the next crisis.  After Brexit, for example, there could be a disastrous situation if an ICL system was brought in with that amount of instability in the Irish economic environment.  </p></speech>

So far, we have been taking the answers for someone coming straight out of school and into third level education but what about someone who comes into education later, in their 30s or 40s, for instance, having raised children, or are going in part time?  Will they have to pay as big an amount?</p></speech>

In general, if one looks at what higher education will look like in the future, the traditional student will be a smaller part of that picture than is the case at present.  Many assumptions will have to be rethought about both how the HE system works and the financing of it.  That is not something we looked at very extensively.  It is something we do need to look at because the demand for higher education in the future will be more about people plugging in and out rather than getting one bloc of education, walking away aged 25 years and never looking at it again.  The average student who comes in to third level in 2020 will probably have at least three or four encounters with post-secondary education before they reach retirement age in their mid-70s.</p></speech>

I agree wholeheartedly about the need to have a meaningful Estimates process.  We have tried to do that in how we have presented them and have provided information on inputs, outputs and, where possible, outcomes.  Through the Action Plan for Education process, we are trying to create a more meaningful environment in which outsiders can see what we are setting as priorities, how we are pursuing them and what we are measuring ourselves against in terms of what represents success.  I am keen on this process.  Having spent most of my time on that side of the counter, it is important that the Estimates process become more meaningful.</p> <p>  I will go through the basics.  If all of the members have to hand my statement, I do not need to repeat it.  We have a 5% increase in our budget - &euro;465 million - this year.  It comes after a difficult period.  We lost a number of years during which investments that everyone would have liked to have been able to make in various ways were not possible.  The demands for extra money are legion.  It is a question of deciding which areas deserve priority and allocating the money as best we can.</p> <p>  Between last and next September, we will have 4,600 additional teachers.  Most members will agree that these teachers are filling important gaps that emerged in our education services, for example, guidance counselling, a matter in which Deputy Byrne is interested.  Some gaps arose in the field of special educational needs, in which respect we are this year providing for the introduction of a new resource allocation model.  It was drawn up by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and piloted in a number of schools and is a better and fairer way of allocating resources in an area of significant priority.</p> <p>  We also found additional money for the DEIS programme.  For the first time, we have introduced a model based on statistical analysis.  Under this, schools do not have to lodge applications.  Instead, the number of pupils enrolling and the profiles of the areas from which they are drawn allow the Department to identify schools with the greatest concentrations of disadvantage.  This has identified 79 new schools for which we are providing additional resources in order to include them in the programme and 30 schools have been upgraded from band 2 to band 1.</p> <p>  This is the start of a process.  As is the experience of most Deputies, I know of plenty of schools that have not been included in the programme because the cut-off point for the 79 new schools was the highest level of concentration under the old model.  It is our ambition to improve, refine and examine our instruments.  For example, we are prioritising access to educational psychological services for DEIS schools.</p> <p>  In terms of special education, I should have mentioned that we are also trying to create an integrated support service, ISS, within the NCSE.  We must build schools' capacity to manage children with special needs.  The integrated service will be a significant addition.  Deputies can see from the text the considerable investment in recent years in resource teachers and special needs assistants, SNAs.  This has been a priority for me and the Department.</p> <p>  The difficult years also impacted on the middle management of schools.  This year and last, we have started restoring middle management at deputy principal level and other posts.  Undoubtedly, we must evolve a middle management structure that is fit for the 21st century.  That work will take considerable time.  A centre for school leadership has been established to support and provide leadership capacity building in schools.  This is a priority area.</p> <p>  We are investing additional resources in the roll-out of the junior cycle.  We have made provision for time off each year.  It is the equivalent of 550 posts.  This will allow teachers to have 22 hours off in the year to prepare for the introduction of the new junior cycle curricula, which require a different approach to teaching and learning.  It is important that teachers get time to prepare - upskilling and professional development - and execute the new model.  This issue is controversial for some but the direction the junior cycle is seeking to take the education system is the right one.  It values a wider range of intelligences among participating pupils and does not rely exclusively on a memory test at the end of three years of study.</p> <p>  As we all know, higher education got no resources from the State for nine years.  That has had a considerable impact.  This year, we have been able to invest &euro;36.5 million in third level and secured a commitment to the provision of an increase in the budget every year to reflect the significant growth in student numbers.  The projection is for a 25% to 30% growth in the coming years.</p> <p>  Recently, we published a consultation document on the proposal to provide an additional &euro;200 million through an Exchequer-employer mechanism to support the expansion of third level.  The third element of the Cassells report, that of income-contingent payments for students, is being examined by this committee but we are not waiting for the outcome of that examination to proceed.  We are making provision.</p> <p>  My final point will be on capital.  Every year, we must create more than 20,000 additional places in primary and secondary levels.  As the bulge moves from primary to secondary, the provision of those places becomes more expensive per unit, given that building costs are greater at secondary level than they are at primary.  This is putting pressure on our budgets but we have a good record of proceeding with projects and building to high standards.  I have had the privilege of seeing that.  In terms of higher education, Grangegorman is the flagship project.</p> <p>  I will leave it at that and not take up the committee's time.</p></speech>

His statement was appreciated.  In future, it might be useful for us to have his opening statement prior to the meeting in order that members would have an opportunity to scrutinise it.</p> <p>  I suggest that we deal with subhead A3, primary teacher salaries, on page 10 of the committee secretariat's briefing document.</p><p>Deputy Byrne had indicated that he wished to speak about this.

I ask the Minister to comment on the issue of pay equality.  Is he willing to advocate at the Cabinet table for pay equality for newly qualified primary school teachers?  In fact, they are nearly newly qualified at this stage because many of them are developing into well-thought-of and long-established members of their schools.  I call them young teachers but really they are newly qualified, or nearly newly qualified.  That is why they have become such a voice and such a vocal campaign on this issue.  There are so many of them now, and I think they feel that the Minister needs to advocate for them, that they should not have to just rely on themselves or their unions and that either the Minister or the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, should take up the cudgels on their behalf at Cabinet to seek pay equality because it is a basic principle of equality.  It is the kind of policy nobody could really be against, in truth, so why has the Minister been reticent to commit to it?</p> <p>  My next questions also come under this subhead.  The Minister has said the additional teachers are filling important gaps, but can he tell us the number of teachers that are actually filling gaps and are not simply addressing demographic issues?  How many extra teachers are in the system above the demographic requirement?</p></speech>

It is no longer a matter of newly qualified teachers, NQTs, but lesser-paid teachers, LPTs.  If we are truly to value education and the job primary school teachers do, in particular in shaping our young children, we should hear the Minister commit - just that word - to the principle of equal pay for equal work.</p></speech>

I have visited a number of schools, as I know many of us have, particularly over the past year, and have been incredibly impressed by the commitment, dedication and enthusiasm of the new teachers whom we are very lucky to have in the system.  They are being treated very poorly in respect of their pay and conditions.  I also ask that the Minister and his Department commit absolutely to restore pay equity to them.  Regarding primary teachers' salaries, and considering the metrics, I also make the point that sometimes we can consider purely the instruction time within a classroom from the teacher's perspective but not really consider the teacher's working day.  The teacher's working day can very often be much longer than the actual instruction time a teacher gives to his or her pupils.  I now return to the Minister for his comments regarding this subhead.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-02a.253" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1293" speakername="Richard Bruton" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESS2017050200002#C02100"><p>I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  I am very glad to have been able to sit down with the three teachers' unions and hammer out a deal with them which effectively restored three quarters of the gap for newly qualified teachers.  The two scales are now identical at the later points, so we have made very substantial progress on that in these negotiations.  Furthermore, we have secured for teachers earlier access to permanency, new promotion opportunities, flexibility in the use of Croke Park hours and flexibility as to whether teachers do substitution and supervision duties.  Across a range of concerns for the trade unions, we negotiated a deal under the arrangements available under the Lansdowne Road agreement which, as members will be aware, two of the three unions have accepted.  It was narrowly defeated by one union.</p> <p>  Regarding the continuing demands of the unions for progress in the pay and conditions of their members, a Public Service Pay Commission has now been established and is due to report very shortly.  I know that both the INTO and the TUI have made very robust submissions to that process.  When the commission reports, negotiations will commence between Government and trade unions on these issues.  The issues involve not just the teaching sector, but many other sectors that have been affected by FEMPI.  Members will have seen that the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has pointed out that if FEMPI were to be unwound entirely, which is clearly an ambition of Government, it would cost &euro;1.5 billion.  That would absorb all the flexibility for not just one budget, but several budgets.  In the pursuit of equality and fairness, I must also balance the needs of many others who have legitimate demands on the &euro;450-odd million available to me.  That balance must be struck.  Every year, we have 15,000 additional pupils to cater for, we must provide for the places and the teachers for them and we must invest in areas such as disadvantage, special need, guidance counselling and so on, which I think most members would regard as having an equally high demand.  My job is to try to balance these different demands.  Of course, trade unions representing the teachers will continue to pursue these.  We now have a framework within which the unions that have accepted what was possible under the Lansdowne Road agreement are continuing to pursue those, and the Government has said it has the ambition to unwind FEMPI over the period.</p> <p>  Regarding the other issue raised, at primary level, demographics last year accounted for about 440 additional teachers, which is roughly the figure per year.  We have been providing teachers, between primary and secondary, at a rate of 2,260 this year, and 2,400 are to be provided this coming year.  Yes, demographics account for a significant part of this provision, but not the majority, not even 50% of what we are providing.  For example, at primary level, we are providing 580 special educational teachers this year.  September coming the figure will be 580; last September it was 445.  We also reduced the pupil-teacher ratio, PTR, last September for primary schools.  There were 300 additional teachers.  This year, we will provide 100 additional teachers in DEIS schools.  A significant number of teaching posts come from demographics, but they must be found.  We are finding money for much more than that for the additional needs where we are trying to provide additional services.  This provision is balanced and shows that we are getting additional-----</p></speech>

The Minister knows how vulnerable many children in these schools are.  I am aware of one DEIS school where the principal has had to take on the role of student council liaison teacher, traditionally a B post.  The same principal now holds, due to retirement, the A post of first year head.  He is dealing with first years transitioning from primary to second level.  It is a crucial role.  The usual route for disciplinary procedures in a school is from class teacher to year head to vice principal to principal, but for students in first year in this school their year head is their principal.  From a discipline point of view it is chaos.  It is a recipe for disaster.  That needs to be addressed as soon as possible as there are vulnerable children suffering.</p> <p>  I welcome the two thirds restoration in the guidance allocation.  What is the timeframe for the full restoration of guidance teachers?  I am sure it was just a turn of phrase but, with all due respect, I do not think teachers would appreciate the phrase "time off" in respect of training for junior cycle.  It is not time off.  Teachers are preparing to do their jobs.  It is work.  I assume that was just a turn of phrase and there was no negative intent.</p></speech>

It is a huge issue for many schools and it is unfair to give principals the responsibility of allocating guidance counsellors within the staffing schedule.  If we are to think of our disadvantaged students and the impact the cuts over recent years have had, the least we should be doing is putting guidance counsellors in place ex quota.</p></speech>

It would be useful, when we have the opportunity to examine the Estimates, to have metrics such as the ratio of guidance teachers to pupils in schools.  That would certainly be very helpful.  It is regrettable that the ASTI is still outside the agreements, because we are not really going to progress an awful lot while it is.  There are relatively positive indications that there could be some type of resolution and that certainly has to be taken into account.</p></speech>

Not to cause problems for anybody, but is it possible to set out clearly the position of union members who leave a union?  If an ASTI member leaves, and I am not encouraging anyone to do so, and stays outside the union, does he or she get the benefits of the Lansdowne Road agreement?  Does such a person have to join the TUI to get the benefits of the agreement?  Is that happening on any scale?</p> <p>  Guidance was mentioned, and of course second level is the right place to bring it up.  Again the Minister in his contribution used the quota.  This is deliberate confusion because when most people hear ex quota in respect of guidance, they think it means the situation that pertained up to 2012 before Ruair&iacute; Quinn cut that ex quota guidance counsellor provision.  They think it means guidance as a separate allocation outside the quota.  The quota means in practice that if the maths teacher or the French teacher can give the guidance, once he or she has given guidance the Minister is happy with that.  In our confidence and supply agreement we specified the reintroduction of guidance counselling.  That can only have meant the restoration of ex quota guidance counselling.  This budget will have to tell a tale in that regard.  Strong words have been expressed to the Minister on this issue and it needs to be delivered upon.  There has been some improvement.  We acknowledge that and we are happy with it, but we want to go the whole hog with this.  This deliberate confusion and setting out to confuse people is very clever of the person who wrote it, but it is not impressing people when they dig deep and really begin to understand it.</p></speech>

This has been the subject of several parliamentary questions that I have put down.  I have been in correspondence with the Secretary General on the matter in recent times.  I am rather confused about this issue.  Deputy Thomas Byrne posed a question as to whether there are situations involving teachers who have left the ASTI and who have been refused entry to the TUI.  They are told in no uncertain terms that the other union will not take them and, <i>vice versa</i>, if a member leaves the TUI, there is a corresponding agreement between the two unions.</p><p>One of the teachers I have been posing questions about wanted to continue the job as year head.  This went against the union directive, so he had to resign his union membership to take up the job of year head.  Whether that was right or wrong &ndash; I think it was right, for what it matters - he chose to put the children's welfare and his job as a year head before his union membership.  He has been blacklisted from the other union and cannot join it.  As I understand it, the Department does not recognise him.  He does not accrue the benefits under the Lansdowne Road agreement because he is not a member of a union.  That is my understanding and his understanding, although I stand to be corrected on the matter.  I am keen to know the Minister's thoughts on the matter.  I think it is a bizarre situation to have teachers who, because they are not members of a union, are not enjoying the full benefits that accrue to others who are members.  Effectively, that amounts to the Department insisting that a teacher must be a member of a union.  Perhaps the Minister will outline his thoughts on the matter and on the question, as posed by Deputy Thomas Byrne.</p></speech>

I am absolutely committed to the full restoration of guidance.  There is in no question of trying to play weasel words.  I am not only committed to that but I am committed to expanding the National Educational Psychological Service by 25% as well to support the student needs to which Deputy Catherine Martin has referred.  This is in addition to rolling out a well-being programme in the junior cycle that will represent significant additional hours.  I have had a number of meetings throughout the country with people at the coalface seeking to shape these programmes in order to maximise their impact.</p> <p>  The approach being taken by the Department is to ring-fence the additional resource for guidance, but the idea is that it would be required to be delivered within the guidance plan.  As Deputy Thomas Byrne said, this allows that at some level there can be others providing guidance.  However, the predominant delivery of guidance will be-----</p></speech>

We are going to conduct a survey that will identify: the extent to which guidance counselling is being delivered; the extent to which one-to-one services are being delivered; the extent to which other elements are in the guidance plan; and the extent to which the delivery is as we intend it.  Bearing in mind the concern, we are conducting a survey to see what exactly is done in schools so that we can be in a position to ensure that what we have amounts to best practice.  There is nothing wrong with a science teacher providing some element of career guidance in respect of science choices.  There is nothing wrong with the guidance plan having some flexibility around what is delivered.  That is why we have had a guidance plan at the heart of the process since 2004.  I hear what Deputies are saying.  We are conducting the survey to establish exactly where we stand.</p> <p>  The issue of where teachers are allocated at second level was raised.  Demographics at second level will represent 450 of the additional teacher places this year, which will come to 1,620.  At post-primary level, the vast majority - almost 1,200 - of additional teachers are going to be in areas between middle management, curricular development, the DEIS programme, special educational needs, guidance and so on.</p> <p>  The issue of the 550 posts was raised.  We have made provision not only for TUI teachers but ASTI as well.  The ASTI proportion of the 550 teachers would probably be the equivalent of 300 or 320 in order to allow those hours to be considered professional time to be worked by teachers preparing for the junior cycle, as Deputy Catherine Martin said.  The same is true of salary increases.  We have made provision for &euro;140 million to meet the cost of the agreement we have negotiated with the three unions.  It makes provisions for ASTI members as well as the others.</p> <p>  I am conscious of the question regarding principals who find themselves stretched.  We are trying to rebuild.  Between this September and next September we will have restored 420 deputy principals.  There will also be 1,000 additional middle management posts, with the relevant premiums attached to represent middle management responsibilities being taken.  That work has to continue.  In particular, the Deputy raised concerns about principals being stretched.  One thing we are doing with the DEIS programme is looking specifically at the transitions to which the Deputy referred.  We will be trying to take initiatives to support the transitions that can be problematic in DEIS schools.</p> <p>  Another issue raised relates to whether a teacher could join a union.  The general provision is that a person does not leave one union that is in dispute in order to join another.  That is an accepted principle within collective bargaining, industrial negotiation, balloting, disputes and so on.  The other established principle, as I understand it, is that if a teacher is in an ASTI school, the collective agreement has been negotiated by that union.  Therefore, teachers do not get the benefits if the ASTI has not entered into an agreement.  Those who are in a school governed by an ASTI agreement do not get the benefit of changes for which they do not have a collective negotiation.  It is different for dual-union schools.  Those are the constraints relating to membership of unions and people switching and joining other unions.  Obviously, a person can apply to join a union at any stage but the convention within the union movement is that if someone is a member of one union that is in dispute, then that person will not be accepted as a member of another union at the time.  Obviously, that is a matter for the unions.  It is not a matter for the Department, as I understand it.</p></speech>

We do not insist that it is by a guidance counsellor.  The guidance plan is a plan drawn up predominately with the leadership of the guidance counsellor.  We are supporting the guidance plan.  Deputy Thomas Byrne raised this point.  I do not detect that principals are trying to undermine counselling in any way.  In fact, the opposite is the case.  When I meet principals throughout the country, it seems that they recognise the importance of well-being support and that they are supportive of the investment in guidance and well-being supports generally.</p><p>I do not see, as some would project it, principals trying to undermine some objective in the restoration of guidance.  This is why, in light of concerns expressed, we are doing a survey; to establish what are the facts on the ground.  It is not my understanding that there is a substantial amount of maths teachers or others who are providing guidance.  It is a small element of a plan that we do no debar the use of those teachers and the guidance plan does not.  The models on which our guidance model is based perceive guidance as a whole school responsibility and not just the responsibility of one individual teacher within the school.  It is within that model that the circular was drawn up.</p></speech>

The Minister has said that he would expect them to be professionally equipped but earlier he spoke about best practice and said in the same breath that there is nothing wrong with a science teacher giving guidance to a student.  One could, however, have an excellent science teacher who has no idea what courses are available out there because the truth is that the guidance counsellors in the schools are in regional groups that meet regularly and unlike a science teacher, they constantly update and share their skills and information with one other.  We would not expect the guidance teacher to teach some science on the side so why would we expect the science teacher to teach some guidance on the side? This all goes back to the original decision in 2012, before the Minister's time but he was in government.  I believe the role of the guidance counsellor is completely undervalued by the Government and its predecessor.  It is an absolutely crucial role and yet we wonder why one in six students in college are dropping out in first year.  They are not getting the proper guidance counselling because since 2012, they have not been receiving it.</p></speech>

I have made a large commitment in this area to both restore guidance counselling, which will involve 600 posts, and expand the National Educational Psychological Service by 25%, which will mean 65 additional educational psychologists, as well as to roll out a well-being programme that will have 400 hours.</p></speech>

The idea of the guidance plan is that it is a whole of school responsibility.  The plan provides that if a school had within its staff number a science teacher who was very well equipped, who had access to information and who was well placed, the guidance plan would have the flexibility to deploy that teacher with those specific skills to provide guidance on choice of career or education path to pupils.  The concept of a guidance plan is not to find some way of outfoxing guidance counsellors to try to provide this resource from some other element of the school.  The purpose of having that flexibility is to offer the student the best possible support available within the school so that if there is such a gifted individual, the guidance plan would make provision.  That is all it is doing but to meet the concerns expressed by Deputies, I am conducting a survey to establish the practice within schools.  If there is a concern in this regard, we will be able to address it.  I envisage the guidance plan as being predominantly delivered by guidance counsellors but I recognise that if it is a whole school responsibility, there would be some element of the plan that may be delivered by other staff members who have a particular aptitude for doing it.</p></speech>

I have correspondence from the Secretary General on this issue and replies to a number of parliamentary questions but as I understand it, the Department at present is not in a position to afford the same benefits unless one is a member of a union.  My question is not about interchanging unions, I have a lot of correspondence and detail on that; my issue is how the Department views a member of the teaching staff.  My layperson's reading of this is it is compulsory to be a member of the union to accrue the full benefits.  Our colleagues were speaking earlier of equal pay for equal work.  I am interested to hear the Minister's views because I am concerned that the Department is not in a position to recognise people who, for whatever reason, are not members of a union.  People do not have to be in a union and I do not believe we should be forcing anybody to be a member of a union if they choose not to.  Not being a member of a union is an irrelevance but they should be entitled to the same benefits as those who are members of a union.</p></speech>

It is normal industrial relations practice in the public service that the decision of the trade union - recognised as holding representative rights for a particular grade or sector - will determine the position for all relevant staff in that grade or sector.  That is the practice.  Where the ASTI holds the representative rights for a particular school, it is the ASTI's agreement or non-agreement to a collective agreement that determines whether the provisions of that collective agreement apply to the individuals within the school.  That is the position.  Where a school has mixed or dual union representative rights that are recognised then the policy is different.  There is also the other element, as I understand it, which is the fairly established convention where in the course of a dispute people do not switch unions.  The ASTI currently holds the representative rights for a particular grade or sector within the teaching area and that approach is the approach right across the public service.  It is not just an education approach.  It applies to members of affiliate unions and so on with collective agreements.  I can send on the note to the Deputy to elaborate.  It goes through some additional information.</p></speech>

If it is going on in other Departments I would say that two wrongs will not make a right.  I do not think this is a justification for it.  Personally, I believe a wrong is being done because we are, <i>de facto</i>, saying-----</p></speech>

Lansdowne Road is a collective agreement between Government and the public service committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is voted for collectively, and applies to members of affiliate unions.  Allowing acceptance or rejection of collective agreements by staff on an individual basis would undermine the collective approach taken to public service pay agreements to date and the system of free collective bargaining generally.  It is an issue of fairly strong principle to defend the possibility of collective agreements being conducted.</p></speech>

When I worked, procedural agreements were made between workers and management through a particular union and nothing was done outside of that.  I am not saying that is right or wrong.  People have the right not to be part of a union if they do not wish to be - it is preferable that they are - but sometimes it comes down to a procedural agreement.  The Minister may be right in the sense that the objective would be to have an agreement with a union rather than individuals doing so with management.  That leads to all sorts of chaos.  This is why there are procedural agreements.</p></speech>

However, we have a situation where teachers who felt that the union of which they were members had not dealt appropriately with the situation and, on principle, they felt they should leave it.  They want to join another union and are precluded from so doing.  That is absolutely wrong.  We are not going to resolve it now, but I suggest that we return to it at another point.</p></speech>

It would also be useful to know the number of appeals and the population of students to which the SNAs relate, and would demonstrate the level of support.  I wonder where within this the autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units come into play?  Some areas have a very low number of ASD units.  For example, County Kildare only has 11 units.  This morning, I spent an hour and a half with the mother of a young boy who is in fifth class in primary school and who has no prospect of getting a place in a secondary school when he completes primary less than 18 months from now.  That is a matter of great concern and I see that mirrored across my constituency.  I am sure it is the case in every other constituency.  I know this matter is somewhat separate from the salaries of special needs assistants but it is related to that.  So many schools need to have special units and they need to have those six students.  In my experience, schools are saying that they can access the six students but are having their applications for special units turned down.</p></speech>

It is a little out of date but I am sure they are available more generally.  In the 2014-2015 year, there were 5,287 applications for SNAs at primary level and 59% were granted.  There is data going back further - a time series is available.  It seems that an average of approximately 60% of the applications are granted.  They are done by the NCSE against a matrix for allocation that was, I believe, worked out in the 1990s.  That allocation matrix and process is under review as part of the general review of the SNAs being conducted by the NCSE.  I do not have information on the number of appeals with me but I am sure I can get it for the Chairman.</p> <p>  The approach of using ASD units has expanded very rapidly in recent years.  In 2011, there were just over 500 ASD units, whereas today there are nearly 1,200, so it has grown very rapidly.  I recall, from a reply to parliamentary question, that there are a number of ASD units planned for in County Kildare, either in new builds or-----</p></speech>

The special education needs organiser, or SENO, along with the parents and children will try to decide on the best allocation.  I have the SNA numbers here.  They do not reflect pupil numbers but they provide an idea.  Of the 32,000 students accessing SNAs, 18,500 are in mainstream classes, 6,300 are in special units and 7,800 are in special schools.  There is a distribution across different environments for delivery of special needs assistants depending on the most appropriate accommodation of the child.  On the allocation of the SNA, it is always done on the same basis, that they look at the needs of the child from a caring perspective.  The allocation is 32,000 and I suspect that sort of pattern would be reflected across most counties.  The number of students accessing SNAs in special units has more than doubled in the past five years.  There is definitely a change in pattern there.</p></speech>

When children with special educational needs transfer to secondary school, they get little or no SNA support.  I have had parents come to me who have children with heightened anxiety, where the SNA was just walking the child to his or her classroom.  We need to change that and ensure that a child with special educational needs in secondary school gets full support from an SNA.  That support should not stop when they leave primary school.  It is a problem that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

This is despite an increase in the overall student population.  The figures also show a target for a reduction of 250 routes compared with 2015 figures with the relevant funding remaining the same.  Can the Minister of State elaborate on the policy decisions behind this and on how he intends to implement it?  Significant numbers of children are on concessionary transport each year and this number is growing.  It appears that the only means by which these targets can be met is if the students currently availing of school transport are refused.  I am aware of situations where this has happened.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State could outline his rationale for the figures and his plan for dealing with this issue in the future.</p></speech>

Approximately 114,000 children use school transport.  This number has been increasing significantly.  About 12,000 special needs students use school transport.  The cost of school transport works out at about &euro;182 million per year.  Out of that, 30% is spent on special needs.  Members should remember this is a very comprehensive and detailed service.  We are talking about over 4,000 vehicles on a daily basis serving primary and post-primary schools, covering almost 100 million km and moving 114,000 children twice a day.  In respect of the plans for school transport, it is very simple.  An analysis will be done every year on the number of children who indicate, particularly those who are eligible.  Members should remember the school transport scheme is basically for those who are eligible for school transport although we carry thousands of concessionary children.  The number of concessionary children has increased dramatically over the past four or five years.  The Department tries to get an indication to the best of its ability as to how many children are taking up the transport scheme, particularly eligible children, from one year to another.  We specifically put emphasis on special needs, which is of significant importance to us, to make sure every special needs child who needs school transport will get it.  The total number of children using school transport has actually increased this year from approximately 113,000 to 114,716.  Interestingly, 410 new services were introduced in 2016, which is 30% more than in 2015.  A total of 365 of those services were for children with special educational needs.  Every six months or as often as we can, we assess the number of eligible children and special needs children who need school transport.  We do our best within the budget we are obliged to work within.  Of course, criteria are set down covering things like routes and definition of routes.</p></speech>

We expect to receive some information on the appeals process over the next five or six weeks.  We carried out a complete review of concessionary transport.  We will write to everyone over the next couple of weeks regarding changes we are proposing.  The objective will then be to bring together again the group of Deputies from all parties regarding what we have done with concessionary transport and appeals.  This is very difficult.  Essentially, almost 99.9% of people are happy with the system.  There are some flaws and difficulties, particularly on concessionary transport, buses and minimum numbers required for a bus.  I must make it clear that a Deputy will often state the minimum requirement for a bus is ten but as members know, someone will come along with seven.  Where do we stop?  Do we bring it down to five, four, three or two?  Some criteria must be laid down.  Overall, the statistics prove that an overwhelming majority of people whose children use the transport system are happy with it.  There are some glitches and difficulties in the system that we are still trying to iron out with the review regarding concessionary transport and appeals.  I have put some relevant questions to the Department that the Deputy requested me to ask.  The Department will come back to me in a number of weeks.  We will have a meeting with the group of Deputies to go through it again.</p></speech>

It is about capitation.  The circular on school costs issued by the Minister last week is all bark and no bite.  The Minister set down a list of rules for schools to comply with but in respect of the capitation grant, he said that when resources allow, he would put in some penalty or give some incentive for schools to comply with the circular.  Are schools obliged to comply with the circular?  Are manufactured-in crests illegal or can schools continue to do what they have always done?  The circular says that all elements of a school uniform shall be purchasable from various stores but it then goes on to talk about how exclusive supply arrangements must go out to tender.  I do not know the exact text because my iPad has died.  Those two statements seem to conflict.  The circular says that elements of a uniform shall be purchasable from various stores but then envisages exclusive supply.  When will these penalties or incentives be brought in?  What happens if schools do not comply with the circular in the mean time?</p></speech>

Can the Minister advise if this has been achieved and what allocation has been set aside to improve high-speed broadband access in primary schools?  Is there high-speed broadband in all post-primary schools?</p></speech>

The capitation grant must be increased because schools find it difficult to raise the funds they need as they rely on local communities, which can be extremely difficult depending on location.</p><p> I was surprised by the correlation of certain metrics in different expenditure areas.  The highest number of metrics - five - was for this subhead.  Provided the metrics are appropriate, the more of them that are available, the better because they allow us to examine how money is spent and what types of outputs are delivered.  While broadband in schools is extremely important, it is also important that schoolchildren have access to broadband at home.  I was surprised that the only metrics provided are on high-speed broadband.  It is important that children are computer literate and can use information technology for research purposes and so on.  I wonder if DEIS grants are included here.  Surely there should be other ways of measuring other grants and services.  I ask the Minister to comment.</p></speech>

We have made it a requirement that schools consult parents.  We have also set out principles such as the need to use generic and low-cost items rather than branded and higher specification items using an approach where they are available in different locations.  These are the principles of keen cost.  We recognise that some schools have arrangements in place and we make the point that these arrangements can deliver keen costs.  For example, schools can tender collectively and achieve a keen cost outcome.  We are providing that these agreements should be tendered at least once every three years and that keen cost principles should be applied in new tenders.  This means schools should not opt for high-cost branded items.</p> <p>  This reflects the view expressed by the Chairman that parents are under pressure.  In an ideal world, we would be able to ease this pressure by increasing capitation.  However, there are many other pressures in the education system and we are seeking to ensure schools co-operate by taking a keen cost approach.  It is appropriate that the Department supports schools which take this approach.  When capitation is increased, I will give recognition to schools that seek to keep down costs.  These are the guidelines that apply in schools.</p></speech>

This will not happen overnight but a process is in place that will keep down costs.</p> <p>  As the Chairman noted, reports from the Irish League of Credit Unions have shown the pressure parents are experiencing.  Everyone in the education system must make a contribution to keeping down costs.  Schools must not specify expensive branded pads when other cheaper items could be used. </p></speech>
