He is accompanied by Mr. John Riordan, deputy director of audit.  Are the minutes of 16 and 17 November agreed?  Agreed.  There are no matters arising.</p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is correspondence received, in category A is the opening statement from Mr. Brendan McDonagh, chief executive and Mr. Frank Daly, chairman of NAMA.</p> <p>  We were scheduled to start at 9 a.m.  The two opening statements from NAMA arrived at approximately 8.20 a.m this morning.  Members have not had time to consider them. </p></speech>

It is inappropriate.  We have to spend a great deal of time preparing for these meeting.  There is a significant level of correspondence.  These statements are central to the proceedings but they arrived three quarters of a hour before the start of the meeting.  We have to digest them.  We have to shape our day in the D&aacute;il around these meetings.  In normal circumstances I would ask that the meeting be postponed because of the late arrival of the statements.  This is totally unacceptable.</p> <p>  We must plan our days around committee meetings.  To get crucial evidence, answers and statements 45 minutes before a meeting is frankly insulting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#B00500"><p>We will put that point to them when they come before us.  This is a big issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#B00600"><p>It should be on the public record.  I made the point when we met in private that it is totally unacceptable.  They are treating the Committee of Public Accounts with contempt.  It is our duty.  We are not in the D&aacute;il and we miss things because we have given a commitment to serve on this committee.  The Chairman, the officials from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and members have given their full commitment to the work of the committee.  Providing documents so late is treating the committee with utter contempt.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#B01200"><p>Chairman, it is contemptuous to treat the committee in this way.  Sadly, it seems to be part of NAMA's pattern.  We can put that to them.  We certainly need time to study the statements, but I think the representatives from NAMA need to understand that as a consequence of their approach this will not be their final appearance before the committee.  There is no doubt in my mind that we will need them to come before us again.  Deputy Cullinane and I had many questions that we wished to put them. The statements have come late in the day.</p><p>I believe Mr. Daly, Mr. McDonagh and others will be required to return next week, so in addition to marking their cards for disrespecting the committee I think they need to be put on notice of that, just in case this is a ruse for them to bounce in statements late in day or early in the morning in the hope that they will just manage their way through the meeting today and then they are out through the gap, home and hosed.  They need to understand that that is absolutely not the case.  This examination will be finished when it is complete and when we have answers to all of the pertinent questions.  Chairman, you might familiarise Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh with those facts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#C00200"><p>I know this is not a court but it would be usual in a case that an applicant or defendant would put in a replying affidavit on the morning of the trial so that he or she would have to get an adjournment because one does not have enough time to go through it.  That would be the common course of events.  I do not say we should adjourn today but we are on the back foot because we have not had time to assimilate the information, go through it, make notes and make bullet points.  I feel compromised today, but if we park that to one side, I am still well capable of doing it.  However, it is not the way we should conduct these proceedings in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#C00300"><p>I fully agree with that.  The problem for this committee is that it is not the first time that we have received opening statements very late, so if we cancel meetings every time that happens we will very rarely get business done because, as has been said, from their perspective, they took a decision not to furnish us with the information.  Perhaps they thought it would be leaked to the media, but that is no justification for it.  It is reasonable for us to have a recess, perhaps until after 10 a.m., but we need to meet them today.  As Deputy McDonald said, we will probably need them to come back again.  It may be that following questions today there are some board members who were central to some of the board meetings where minutes were recorded and they will also have to come back before the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#C00500"><p>I think we should adjourn for half an hour to let us read the statements.  I agree with Deputy McDonald that it could be that so many issues will arise that we will just do our best today and reserve other questions for another day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#C00600"><p>It may not be possible to fully complete the proceedings today.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#C01300"><p>We will make the point at the beginning.  We will put them on notice that due to the short notice if we do not get finished today it is not our responsibility.  We will move on then.  We will commence the main business shortly.</p> <p>  The first item of correspondence is 189B (i) to (iv), from Niamh O'Donoghue, Secretary General of the Department of Social Protection, providing follow-up information to the committee from our meeting in October.  Is that noted, agreed and published?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next item is 190B, correspondence from Mr. Mark Curran, in the Garda Commissioner's office responding to a query from the committee in relation to our hearings on NAMA's sale of Project Eagle.  I just wanted to have the letter.  Essentially, we wrote to the Garda Commissioner to find out if there was any issue in relation to inviting any particular witnesses.  He concluded by saying it was appreciated that the committee had very real concerns that an appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts may prejudice ongoing criminal investigations in other jurisdictions.  In that regard, any public questioning of an individual about matters which may form part of a criminal investigation in any jurisdiction has the potential to interfere with that investigation and subsequent due process.  I am just putting that on record.  We are noting the letter.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is 192B.  It is correspondence from Mr. Ronnie Hanna declining an invitation to attend, principally because of concerns regarding the ongoing investigation.  Essentially, he made two remarks - one is he has a duty of confidentiality still to NAMA which he has not been released from and, second, because of the investigation by the NCA-PSNI he believes, respectfully - he means no discourtesy to this committee, he is refusing to attend.  We will note that.</p> <p>  The next item is a letter from Mr. David Meissels, managing director at Fortress Investment group, declining an invitation to appear before the committee  Essentially, he said his company was the unsuccessful bidder and investigations are ongoing on Project Eagle.  He previously submitted written responses in detail and he, respectfully, declines the invitation to send a representative to the public meeting.  We will note that as well and publish it.</p> <p>  Then we have correspondence from Peter Robinson.  He said that he understands the constitutional reasons he is not answerable to the Committee of Public Accounts and it is complicated by the fact that the NCA inquiry in Northern Ireland is ongoing.  He gave evidence to the Northern Ireland committee.  He recognises there are some similarities between our remit and that of the committee in Northern Ireland and he attaches a copy of the statement he made to that committee.  He said that if we want his views on any specific issue we can write to the e-mail address given and he will be happy to provide a response.  I take that to mean in writing.</p> <p>  We will publish his statement, even though it is already published in Northern Ireland.  Much of the statement he made to the Northern Ireland committee flatly contradicts the evidence of Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, who said he was not in the loop.  We will adjudicate on that but we are not adjudicating on it now.  Martin McGuinness got the opportunity to give his point of view in public and the letter from Mr. Robinson flatly contradicts a number of the statements made by him.  We will have to consider those issues in drafting our report.  Neither individual is present now so we will not discuss it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.31" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#C01400"><p>We will need to do that but could I just note at this point that Mr. Robinson has the opportunity to come before the committee to have his evidence tested.  That is the distinction, if you do not mind me saying, Chairman, just as the Deputy First Minister availed of.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#C01500"><p>I thank Deputy McDonald.  I appreciate that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.33" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#C01600"><p>I am disappointed that Mr. Robinson is not taking the opportunity to come down.  They gave out about NAMA not attending before the committee in Northern Ireland.  They said it would have been very helpful if NAMA had attended.  I believe it would have been very helpful if NAMA had attended.  Equally, I believe it would be very helpful if Mr. Robinson attended here.  We are now placed in a very difficult position.  I agree with you, Chairman, that Mr. Robinson has flatly contradicted what the Deputy First Minister said here.  Now we have the benefit of the Deputy First Minister giving us that evidence and then a letter which absolutely contradicts him, practically on every point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.34" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#C01700"><p>Deputy Connolly's point is noted.  That is a complication for our committee and another exact example of that situation is the PIMCO letter.  PIMCO did not attend before the committee in public.  NAMA contradicted it in person but all we have from PIMCO is its written statement on the matter.  As has been said, we do not have the opportunity to test its evidence in public.  We did invite PIMCO and it declined to come.  That will always be an issue for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#C01800"><p>It is very disappointing that Mr. Robinson has chosen not to come.</p></speech>

That is the issue that has given rise to the recent discussion.  This is a 54 page document that has arrived within a half an hour of the commencement of the meeting.  We will not discuss it now.  On an ongoing basis we have been sending letters to NAMA with a series of questions.  We have got back a series of letters every week and one happened to arrive this morning.  There are lots of letters in the system.  They are not specific to today's meeting.  The reply is in response to questions we have submitted previously.  People might want an opportunity to raise some of these issues and follow them up.  NAMA has been sending us other correspondence on a weekly basis that is in our file.  It is up to the committee to deal with the responses received as part of our previous specific queries.  This process is not completed in terms of questions we might ask of NAMA in writing.</p></speech>

NAMA has offered a justification as to why it cannot provide it but we need to be robust in asking again for information.  Are you agreeable to taking such an approach, Chairman?</p></speech>

We will do that today.  We will also check whether there is provision in our Standing Orders to facilitate the receipt of confidential information by the committee.  That is a point we will come back to.</p> <p>  The next item of correspondence is in category C, item 181C.  It is correspondence from the North Meath Communities Development Association in relation to an ongoing issue with the HSE.  Could we defer it in order that we can check for a previous response to the issue, which is an ongoing one?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next we have correspondence item 182C(i) to (iv) and 191C(i) and (ii).  We have two items of correspondence with attachments from a translation company in relation to the transparency of an Office of Public Procurement tendering process.  The operations manager of the translation company draws attention to delays in the tendering process.</p><p>I propose we write to the Office of Government Procurement for a response, notwithstanding the legal considerations, and deal with it when we receive it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> Correspondence items Nos. 184C(i) to 184C(iii), inclusive, comprise a letter from an auctioneer-estate agent enclosing copies of correspondence with the Residential Tenancies Board on an ongoing issue.  These will be noted.</p><p> Correspondence items Nos. 188C(i) and 188C(ii) comprise a letter from an individual attaching a newspaper article referring to the man and an assault case.  The matter is not within the remit of the committee.  I suggest referring it to the justice committee.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> The following reports, statements and accounts of bodies audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General were laid since last week.  First, the Defence Forces canteen board.  Second, the Limerick Institute of Technology, for which there is an audit report but there is a reference to a payment of &euro;550,000 made to seven suppliers without going through the competitive procurement process.  The Institute of Technology Tralee has a clear report but it has incurred a deficit in the past three years, which has been highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As for Waterford Institute of Technology, a qualified report.  The institute has consolidated results of its campus companies for the first time in 2013 and 2014.  Attention is drawn to the fact that the group had an accumulated deficit of &euro;15.1 million on 31 August 2014.  The audit committee did not issue an annual report for 2013-14 to the institute's governing body until June 2015.  There was a situation where some companies in the institute were not consolidated into the overall accounts.  That has been done now but there was a previous issue.</p></speech>

I think there are six or seven institutes of technology with deficits.  Waterford is one with a particular problem.  We were told there was a plan in place, a contingency plan.  From what I am reading here, it does not seem to be dealing with the problem, however.</p></speech>

The point of the restructuring was to identify the level of deficit which had accumulated in Waterford.  As the 2013-14 accounts are the first where they were consolidated, we now begin to see what the problem is in Waterford.  I think there is a separate plan to deal with the situation there.  There is a more general plan to deal with the deficit situation in other institutes.  One will see from the other accounts that there are six or seven which have recurrent deficit situations.</p></speech>

Again, it states the foundation has net assets of &euro;15.1 million, the financial statements have not been consolidated with those of the university group.

We will write directly to the NTA and ask for a detailed explanation of how it got itself into that position.</p></speech>

My recollection here is that this arose when the Taxi Regulator was absorbed into the National Transport Authority.  It had a separate premises but then its activities were transferred to the authority's premises.  The authority inherited the lease on that premises, effectively and was not able to get out of it.  When the authority sublet the premises it did so at a level lower than the obligations in the lease.  The authority has provisioned to the tune of &euro;750,000 because the lease does not expire until 2024.  The authority is taking the full hit.</p></speech>

I assure the committee that many people in NAMA were working very late on these statements.

We are coming towards the end of our hearings on special report No. 94 of the Comptroller and Auditor General on NAMA and its sale of Project Eagle, which was the code name given to the sale of NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  Today, we will meet representatives of NAMA again.  We have also met members of the NAMA board at the time; the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and his officials; Mr. Brian Rowntree, who is a former member of NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC; the deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland; the chief operating officer of Cerberus Capital Management, which is the investment firm that bought Project Eagle; and Mr. Patrick Long, who is the managing director of Lazard, which is the company that acted as adviser to NAMA in the loan sale.  We have received detailed correspondence from other individuals and that has been put on the record as well.</p><p>I welcome to today's meeting Mr. Frank Daly, who is the chairman of NAMA; Mr. Brendan McDonagh, who is its chief executive; Mr. John Coleman, who is its chief financial officer; Ms Aideen O&rsquo;Reilly, who is its head of legal affairs; Mr. Alan Stewart, who is its senior divisional solicitor; and Mr. John Collison, who is its head of asset recovery.  We are also joined by Mr. David Linehan, who is the NAMA liaison officer in the shareholding unit of the Department of Finance.  As I have mentioned, the Comptroller and Auditor General is also in attendance.  I thank Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh for their co-operation, despite this morning's suspension.  We have written to NAMA on behalf of the committee every week, sometimes with six questions and sometimes with 36 questions.  Extensive correspondence has come back to us on a staged basis.  I hope we will reach the end of that process in the next week or two.  I acknowledge that we have received a great deal of documentation.  A little part of it can be seen in the files beside me.  A great deal of work has been put into this process by NAMA.</p><p>I remind members and those in the public Gallery to turn off their mobile phones.  I have to advise the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of that evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members of the committee are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 to the effect that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such a policy.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh to make their opening statements.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#L00600"><p>I will begin by addressing an issue which, in my view, is at the core of the debate about whether the best price reasonably achievable for Project Eagle in the first quarter of 2014 was in fact achieved.  There no longer appears to be any dispute about the appropriate discount rate that should have been used for deriving the market value for a loan portfolio such as Project Eagle in late 2013 and early 2014.  There now appears to be general acceptance that the market would have discounted the cash flows in this portfolio at a rate in the range of 10% to 15%.  This has been our position all along and it has been supported by a number of market experts.  By that criterion, it is reasonable to contend that &pound;1.3 billion was in the ballpark of what a buyer would expect to pay for this portfolio.  The position of the Comptroller and Auditor General, as recently articulated to this committee, appears to be that he accepts that a discount rate of 10% to 15% was indeed appropriate for determining the market value of the Project Eagle portfolio in the context of a loan sale.  If I understand his position correctly, he is saying that this higher discount rate would have been appropriate for potential buyers of the portfolio but not for NAMA as the seller.  A 5.5% discount rate may indeed have been appropriate for estimating the accounting value of the portfolio, but it was not appropriate for estimating its fair value, which is the best proxy for market value, and it certainly was not appropriate for assessing the market value of Project Eagle.</p> <p>  The board made a strategic decision in 2014 to sell the Project Eagle portfolio once that option became available.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has said he has no view on this strategic decision.  Up to late 2013, in the absence of any alternative strategic option, the default option had been to dispose of the underlying collateral of the Northern Ireland debtors on a piecemeal basis up to 2020.  From NAMA's perspective, and indeed from the perspective of any commercial entity, the report's position on the discount rate does not make commercial sense for reasons I will set out.  First, there was a major restriction on commercial flexibility.  The report's position on the discount rate would rule out the sale of any loan portfolio comprised of granular, multi-debtor and lower value assets.  Quite frankly, the market would never buy these portfolios at a 5.5% discount rate.  There would always be an unbridgeable gap between the market&rsquo;s valuation of a granular loan portfolio and NAMA's valuation of it.  In effect, this would mean that NAMA could never sell these portfolios and therefore, the strategic option of locking in their market value upfront when the opportunity arose could never be utilised.  At the meeting of this committee on 29 September last, we drew attention to the fact that we were advised by UBS that a 10% discount rate was appropriate for Project Tower, a better portfolio than Project Eagle which was launched to the market at the same time in the first quarter of 2014.</p><p>In Project Arrow, a portfolio with similar characteristics to Project Eagle, Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield advised in mid-2015 that a 15% discount rate was appropriate.  If one accepts the report's position, the market's view of a portfolio's valuation is irrelevant if it does not match a valuation based on a 5.5% discount rate.  That, in effect, would rule out all but a handful of loan sales.</p><p> Reason No. 2 is based on our statutory commercial mandate.  Given that NAMA has been tasked by the Oireachtas to operate on a commercial and expeditious basis, the report's view that NAMA cannot apply a market discount rate to its loan portfolios is simply not commercially feasible for NAMA if it is to fulfil its statutory mandate under section 10 of the NAMA Act.  Had we adopted such an interpretation, it is difficult to see how we could have deleveraged our overall portfolio to the extent that we have done over the past three years.  Thus, instead of dealing with a residual senior debt burden of &euro;3.6 billion, or 12% of the original &euro;30.2 billion as of today, we would be dealing with a multiple of that residual amount and facing into the major uncertainties that have emerged, both for property markets and for the global economy over recent months.</p><p> NAMA's strategy was set out in 2010.  It was to be an orderly and phased disposal but we stated that we would be alert and ready to avail of market opportunities as they arose.  If we had not lived up to our promise I am satisfied that, instead of discussing the Project Eagle sale, we would now be appearing before this committee and having to explain why we had failed to take advantage of the favourable and unprecedented market opportunities and the influx of capital that became available over the past three years.  Irish taxpayers would rightly be concerned as to why they were still left with a major contingent liability exposure backed by property in Ireland and elsewhere.  This report takes no account whatsoever of these major and very real strategic considerations.</p><p> Matter No. 3 is the prospect of a long-term piecemeal workout.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has stated that he considers it beyond his remit to comment on the strategic and commercial rationale underpinning the decision to sell the loan portfolio.  It may not have been his intention to comment on strategic or commercial issues but the position he has adopted is, in effect, a position that favours one commercial strategy, namely, long-term hold to 2020, over another, namely, the portfolio sale in 2014.  If one accepts the position that he has adopted in relation to the discount rate, namely, that NAMA is not entitled to use the appropriate market discount rate to estimate the market value of granular portfolios of this type, then he is clearly proposing a position which favours a long-term piecemeal workout in preference to an upfront loan sale.  In that sense, without the support of any knowledge or experience of dealing with distressed assets, the report is implying that a long-term workout will always be superior to a loan sale regardless of the risks involved, given that a portfolio discounted at 5.5% will invariably have a higher valuation than a portfolio discounted at a market discount rate of between 10% and 15%.</p><p> If NAMA accepted this perspective, which given its statutory commercial remit it cannot do, it would never adopt a loan sale strategy in preference to a piecemeal workout.  In fact, we would be around much later than 2020.  It is worth bearing in mind, however, that NAMA was not established with a restricted mandate to work out assets on a piecemeal basis over the long term; it was set up with a mandate to act commercially and expeditiously and that meant taking advantage of any opportunities to sell loans and property, either in bulk or individually, subject to the requirement that the best achievable price is obtained.  This view of NAMA's mandate was also articulated by the Minister for Finance in his section 227 review of NAMA in 2014.</p><p> No. 4 is the reliance on the 5.5% rate.  I believe that the rationale for the report's position is not sustainable, particularly in its assumption that it would have been appropriate to use a 5.5% discount rate to estimate the long-term workout value of the Project Eagle loans. We have repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that a 5.5% discount rate was not a standard NAMA discount rate and it is inaccurate and unreasonable to characterise it in those terms.  It was a rate which the board, in its decision of June 2013, stated was appropriate for use for some, but not all, commercial evaluations.  The board decision of June 2013 could hardly have been clearer.  A 5.5% rate should not be used as an overarching discount rate to evaluate all potential transactions.  It was important that flexibility should be maintained.  In particular, care should be taken to ensure that both (a) alternative NPV scenarios are generated using alternative discount rates and (b) that qualitative information would be considered as part of the decision-making process.  The key qualitative information in the evaluation of this transaction was the relatively low quality and granular character of many of the assets in the Northern Ireland debtor portfolio, which was not typical of the NAMA portfolio as a whole.  A discount rate higher than 5.5% was commercially appropriate, given the risks associated with its asset quality and with underlying weak economic conditions in Northern Ireland and in parts of northern England and Scotland.</p><p> This Project Eagle portfolio was very granular.  The fact that the top 55 assets accounted for two thirds of its value left the remaining one third of the portfolio with about 870 assets with an average asset value of about &pound;600,000 each.  The cash flows attaching to these smaller-valued assets were much less certain, both in terms of projected disposal proceeds and projected income, than was the case with larger assets.  It is accepted market practice that the less attractive the assets and the income stream securing a loan portfolio and the less certain that the associated cash flows will actually be received, the higher the risk premium and therefore the discount rate that will be applied by buyers.  For that reason, it made perfect sense, through a loan sale, to bundle the large number of poorer quality assets with the better assets.</p><p> The discount rate would also have incorporated a risk premium arising from the high concentration of assets located in the small Northern Ireland economy.  As we have pointed out, the Northern Ireland property market did not have the capacity to absorb a large volume of asset sales over a short time period, as is evidenced by the fact that, in the four years from 2010 to the end of 2013, sales of NAMA-secured assets in Northern Ireland realised a total of only &pound;113 million.  The report's conclusion that there was "a probable loss of &pound;190 million" rests entirely on the view that NAMA applied, or should have applied, a standard discount of 5.5% to all evaluations.  This can only be deduced by comparing an estimate of workout value, &pound;1.49 billion, to 2020 with the minimum reserve price of &pound;1.3 billion from a 2014 sale.  As the report puts forward no external evidence in support of 5.5% being an appropriate market discount rate or indeed being an appropriate workout rate, everything rests then on the report's interpretation of the board decision of June 2013.  The key question then becomes whether one takes the board's June 2013 caveat about other factors, including risk assessment, into account or whether one arbitrarily decides to ignore it.  If you accept the objective evidence offered by the actual decision that the board took in June 2013, including the major caveat to which I have drawn your attention, you cannot reasonably contend that the board intended that 5.5% would become a standard, one-size-fits-all discount rate for all strategic commercial evaluations.  Therefore, by extension, the whole basis for the conclusion of a probable loss of &pound;190 million does not hold.</p><p> Section 3.81 of the report outlines the Comptroller and Auditor General's case for relying on a 5.5% discount rate, based on three statements which are all factually incorrect.  One, the report states that "no reference was made in the papers presented to the Board in June 2013 or in December 2013 that a rate higher than NAMA's standard 5.5% rate would be appropriate".  For reasons outlined above, NAMA does not accept the contention that 5.5% was a standard discount rate to be used for all evaluations as the June 2013 board paper clearly provided for exceptions if and when appropriate.</p><p> Two, the report states that NAMA's cost of funding was 1.2% in 2013, much lower than the funding costs that would arise for the purchasers of loan portfolios.  This statement, designed to illustrate that NAMA could have continued to carry the portfolio at a low cost for all future years, is misleading.  NAMA's average actual and projected cost of operations from 2014 to 2020, the period of time during which NAMA would have had to work out this difficult portfolio, was 4.95%, not 1.2%.  This is significantly higher than funding costs for banks and some other comparable institutions.  It also implies a risk premium of 0.55% if you regard a 5.5% discount rate as appropriate.  I cannot imagine that any informed analysis would regard such a low risk premium as appropriate for the Project Eagle portfolio.</p><p> Three, the report states that NAMA already took account of the poor quality of the underlying Project Eagle assets in its impairment review.  This is not the case.  As discussed further below, international accounting standards allow impairment reviews only to consider circumstances and known incurred losses at the time of the review, which would have been end-2013.  Losses due to future events or conditions from 2014 onwards, no matter how likely, were not permitted.  The fact that the accounting impairment review does not capture future losses means that a higher risk premium must be built into the discount rate.  Hence, the report's assertion that overlaying a high risk premium on the technical impairment calculation would represent double counting is factually incorrect.  In any event, the market ignores accounting carrying values and tends to value portfolios by reference to the price of risk.</p><p> We note that the Comptroller and Auditor General, in his evidence to the committee on 29 September 2016, stated that it was not possible to be absolute or definite regarding the alleged probable loss of &pound;190 million.  He indicated to Deputy Kelly that there was a margin around it but stated that it was impossible to estimate what that margin might be.  Based on the magnitude of possible margins put to him on that date, he did not rule out the possibility that the margin may have been plus or minus &pound;200 million or more.  Therefore, depending on the parameters of the margin, the probable loss could have been much higher than &pound;190 million or indeed, at the other extreme, that there may have been no probable loss at all.  Such a wide-ranging margin leaves us in the realm of speculation.  In our view, compelling and objective market evidence is required to support a finding that there was a probable loss that would not have been incurred if NAMA had held on to the portfolio to 2020 rather than selling it in 2014.  While the Comptroller and Auditor General's qualification at this committee of his original report conclusion is to be welcomed, it only goes to highlight the difficulty of positing and estimating a probable loss in the absence of any objective market evidence of a loss.  Objective market evidence would be evidence that a credible buyer was willing to offer &pound;1.49 billion, or some other sum greater than the &pound;1.322 billion achieved by NAMA, for this portfolio.</p><p>No such evidence has been produced because there can never be any such evidence.  It is pure speculation.  I cannot imagine that a court of law or any other judicial forum would regard the interpretation of the NAMA&rsquo;s board decision which ignores a crucial element of that decision as a fair or reasonable basis for concluding that there was a "probable loss" of any magnitude.</p><p> NAMA had taken a cumulative impairment &pound;478 million on the Project Eagle loans up to the end of 2013.  We were well aware that it was highly likely that additional impairment charges would have to be taken in the 2014 and in future years&rsquo; financial statements.  This emerged in the form of an accounting loss of &pound;162 million on the sale of the Project Eagle portfolio.  International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS, accounting rules, specifically IAS 39, require NAMA to recognise an impairment provision against the book value of its loans where there is a reduction in the amount likely to be received or a change in the timing of future loan cashflows, commonly referred to as "objective evidence of impairment".</p><p> IAS 39 operates on an incurred loss basis as opposed to an expected loss basis.  Under IAS 39, NAMA could not have provided for expected future losses.  At the end of 2013, the board expected future losses but could not provide for them under IAS 39.  In setting the &pound;1.3 billion minimum price, the board was, in effect, recognising and bringing up front, losses of at least &pound;175 million.  The board was aware that the end of 2013 &pound;1.49 billion carrying value needed to be adjusted to take account of losses that it expected to take in future years but could not yet recognise in its end of 2013 accounts under IFRS.  The fact that there was an actual loss of &pound;162 million on the sale which was recognised in 2014 accounts is not in dispute.  The IAS board has redrafted IAS 39 and the new standard, IFRS 9, will, when implemented, change the impairment methodology to allow for future expected credit losses to be reported on a timely basis.</p><p> In 2014, however, we were operating by reference to the existing accounting IFRS rules.  If the timing of the Project Eagle sale had been six or 12 months later, additional impairment would have been recognised and I have little doubt that the cumulative impairment at that point would have been close to the &pound;640 million total impairment that we ultimately took on this portfolio.</p><p> I wish to reiterate NAMA&rsquo;s position.  The gross undiscounted cashflows arising from the Project Eagle loan portfolios amounted to &pound;1.68 billion.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's report has discounted these cashflows at a discount rate of 5.5% and has produced a NPV of &pound;1.49 billion.  The minimum sales price set by the NAMA board was &pound;1.3 billion.  This falls within the mid-point range of sale values generated by the 10% to 15% range of discount rates.  This is the range that would have been applied to a portfolio such as Project Eagle during the first half of 2014.  A 10% discount rate produces a value of &pound;1.36 billion while a 15% discount rate produces a value of &pound;1.25 billion.  The &pound;1.322 billion achieved on the sale, which was above the minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion, was, therefore, well within the range of expected values.</p><p> It has been suggested that there is no support in NAMA&rsquo;s contemporaneous records for its use of a 10% discount rate.  This is not the case.  A 10% rate was used in preparing information required as part of the fair value note in the end of 2012 NAMA financial statements which was certified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The fair value methodology for the 2012 accounts was based on a discount rate of 10% and, had this fair value discount rate been applied to the Project Eagle portfolio, the NPV would have been &pound;1.36 billion.  This was the prevailing fair value discount rate that applied at the time that the sale of the Project Eagle portfolio was being considered by the NAMA board in the fourth quarter of 2013 and, as such, it is a discount rate with which the board would have been familiar during its deliberations about a possible loan sale.</p><p> In any commercial transaction, there can only be one definitive market value, namely, the price on which a buyer and a seller agree after a competitive sales process.  In advance of a sale, a buyer and a seller will, in most instances, have different views on what a portfolio may be worth, but these views are notional unless, and until, a transaction price can be agreed.  NAMA does not accept the inference in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that the sales process restricted the field of credible potential bidders and thereby compromised the objective of obtaining best market price.  The nine potential bidders approached by Lazard were all credible entities which had the capacity to fund and execute a purchase on this scale.  Collectively, they purchased 88% of all large loan sales across Europe between 2013 and 2015.  There is no evidence that there were other potential bidders who could have participated in the process and who would have been likely to submit a competitive bid for the portfolio.</p><p> It is not plausible to suggest, as is done in the report, that NAMA set a reserve price for the Project Eagle portfolio which was too low.  By definition, any suggestion of a NAMA giveaway of &pound;190 million must have involved a gain of &pound;190 million for the successful bidder, and this is not plausible.  Are we being asked to believe that of the nine major international investors approached and the five major international investors which took a detailed look at the portfolio, only one identified the &pound;190 million that NAMA was allegedly giving away when it set the minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion?  Major astute international investors do not operate in that way.  We are being asked to believe that, uniquely on this occasion, they decided to leave easy money on the table.</p><p> The report suggests that the concerns that some potential investors may have had about the duration of the sales process or the level of detail available on the portfolio were so serious that they decided to forego the &pound;190 million of easy profit allegedly on offer.  Again, this is not a realistic view of the capacity of major international investors to surmount any obstacle in pursuit of substantial and easy profits.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General has acknowledged to the committee, the cost of capital of these purchasers would have been of the order of 10% or more.  There was no substantial profit available through alleged NAMA mispricing.  It would be more realistic and more credible to suggest that the &pound;1.3 billion minimum price set by NAMA was a commercially reasonable target in early 2014 and that only one of the five investors who looked at the portfolio in detail considered that it represented a potentially profitable opportunity for them.  The NAMA board made a decision to sell in excess of the &pound;1.3 billion minimum price and we stand over that.</p></speech>

In his opening comments, the chief executive, Mr Brendan McDonagh, has addressed the major issue of the price achieved for the transaction.  In my comments, I will focus on a number of other key issues.</p> <p>  Let me put the whole transaction and the activities of NAMA in context.  There has been a lot of discussion of the detail of the sales process over the last few months but it is important not to lose sight of the overall context in which the Project Eagle sale took place.  In January 2014, when the board decided in principle to sell the Northern Ireland debtor portfolio, NAMA had almost &euro;23 billion in Government-guaranteed senior debt outstanding.  Ireland had just emerged from the troika programme and there was significant uncertainty about the sustainability of the emerging economic, financial and fiscal recovery as the National Treasury Management Agency sought to raise funding in the bond markets to finance the Exchequer.  As has been discussed here on a number of occasions, there was pressure to ensure that NAMA&rsquo;s senior debt was repaid as quickly as possible, not least to enhance the financial position of the major Irish banks and to reduce the contingent liability or position of the State. </p> <p>  Up to that point, NAMA had redeemed &euro;7.5 billion of its senior debt.  An opportunity emerged in autumn 2013 - in the form of an offer from PIMCO to buy the Northern Ireland debtor portfolio - which would have enabled NAMA not only to lock down the value of one of the less attractive elements of its overall loan portfolio but also to generate cash proceeds equivalent to one fifth of the total senior debt that had been redeemed over the previous four years.  It would have been extraordinary, in the circumstances, if NAMA had not given the offer the most serious consideration as it was obliged to do under sections 10 and 18 of the NAMA Act. </p> <p>  Three years later, that &euro;22.6 billion contingent liability has been reduced to &euro;3.6 billion and we hope to reduce this further before the end of the year.  It is important that the committee &ndash; and indeed the wider taxpaying community - should appreciate that the &euro;19 billion reduction in the State&rsquo;s contingent liability could not have been achieved if NAMA had been unwilling or incapable of operating on a commercial basis.  Operating on a commercial basis means that one takes advantage of a good opportunity now to sell assets unless one has reason to expect that a better opportunity will come along in two, three or five years&rsquo; time. </p> <p>  NAMA proceeds cautiously but a commercial mandate means that one can never allow caution to lapse into decision paralysis.  To achieve that scale of deleveraging has required thousands of commercial decisions, none of which could have been made with any degree of certainty as to how prices would evolve in the future.  Decisions can only be based on information available at a particular point in time.</p> <p>  Would NAMA have realised more if it had delayed all its sales by one year?  Perhaps.  Would it have realised more if it had delayed all its sales by two years?  Perhaps.  Would it have realised more if it had delayed all its sales by five years?  Perhaps.  One will never know and neither will anyone else. </p> <p>  What NAMA knows is that a combination of developments, including a recovering Irish property market and an influx of international investors into Ireland, provided it with an opportunity to deleverage its risk by selling loans and property collateral and to thereby accelerate the redemption of its senior debt.  As of now, 88% of the senior debt has been repaid and NAMA expects that all of the &euro;30.2 billion of guaranteed debt will be repaid by 2018. </p> <p>  If NAMA were operating to its original 2020 horizon to repay all the senior debt rather than to a 2018 horizon, would it have realised more cash from its loans?  One will never know and I am not sure that there is much point in speculating.  What NAMA sought to do, given the huge debt that it had to deal with, was to reduce that debt on an accelerated but phased basis as market opportunities allowed.</p><p>NAMA is now in the fortunate position of dealing with outstanding senior debt of just &euro;3.6 billion, rather than &euro;22.6 billion at the end of 2013.  Bearing in mind the significant uncertainties ahead, that is a good position for the State to be in.  </p><p> There is market speculation that the likely impact of the policies signalled by Mr. Trump is that interest rates will rise faster than expected up to now.  That is likely to reduce the attractiveness of property assets to international investors.  The flow of international investor funds into property in recent years has been partly due to the relatively high yields available compared to cash and bond yields.  A narrowing of the yield differential is likely to reduce investor interest in property.  In that context, the big question a commercially informed market analysis would ask is: &ldquo;Did NAMA get its timing broadly right in reducing the huge contingent exposure of Irish taxpayers to property and has Ireland&rsquo;s cost of funding benefited correspondingly in the bond markets?&rdquo;  I believe we did and that this has been reflected in the sovereign&rsquo;s funding costs.</p><p> I will now talk a little about Britain.  Contrary to suggestions made at earlier hearings, we did not claim that we had foreseen the outcome of the Brexit referendum.  What we did was take advantage of favourable market conditions in Britain to reduce our risk exposure to that market on a prudent and commercially sensible basis.  According to official statements, the UK economy, after the Brexit vote, appears to be heading for a period of lower growth and reduced investment.  News reports last week indicated that land values in central London had fallen by over 10% in the last year and that house prices were 11% below their 2014 peak.  Our own analysis suggests the fall in UK prices may be much higher than official estimates.  Analysts are forecasting that prices will fall further in the coming years, partly in response to a weakening economy and the likelihood that companies will move staff overseas in response to Brexit.  Nobody is suggesting we saw all of this coming; what we are entitled to claim is that our strategy since 2010 has been consistent in acting prudently and commercially and taking advantage of good market conditions when they have prevailed.  For that reason, we do not now have to deal with the consequences of a weakening market.  Our debtors have only about &pound;800 million in assets located in Britain.  At one stage in 2011 we had an exposure in excess of &pound;12 billion to the British and Northern Ireland markets.</p><p> I will turn to the issue of PIMCO&rsquo;s withdrawal from the sale process.  Before doing so I wish to address its recent letter to the committee which was read at one of the meetings.  It is dated 8 November 2016 and sets out a number of important facts, none of which was disclosed by PIMCO to NAMA in March 2014.  The first fact which was not disclosed is that PIMCO was approached by Brown Rudnick and introduced to Mr. Cushnahan in April 2013.   The second fact which was not disclosed is that Mr. Cushnahan was one of the organisers of a meeting in May 2013 at which PIMCO met the Northern Ireland First Minister and the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and Personnel.  The third fact which was not disclosed is that PIMCO was approached by Brown Rudnick in June 2013 about a success fee, one third of which was to be paid to Mr. Cushnahan.  The fourth fact which was not disclosed is that PIMCO sought confirmations from Brown Rudnick in 2013 as to whether NAMA had been informed of, and had approved, the involvement of Mr. Cushnahan in PIMCO&rsquo;s proposed transaction.   PIMCO&rsquo;s letter to the committee is materially inaccurate because it states it provided details of these matters for NAMA in a series of calls in March 2014.  It did not provide these details for NAMA in March 2014 or at the time of its indicative offers in September or December 2013.   At no stage during NAMA&rsquo;s extensive engagement with it from September 2013 until 10 March 2014 did PIMCO inform it that Mr. Cushnahan was a potential beneficiary of the success fee arrangement proposed to PIMCO by Brown Rudnick.  Only PIMCO can explain why it did not tell us about these details and we have written to it to ask why none of these details was disclosed to NAMA at the time.</p><p> I wish to outline again NAMA's state of knowledge at the time of the various calls to PIMCO in March 2014.  PIMCO first informed NAMA during the conference call on 10 March 2014 of a proposed fee arrangement involving Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Mr. Cushnahan.  It asked if NAMA was aware that Mr. Cushnahan was potentially a beneficiary of this arrangement.  NAMA confirmed that it was not so aware.  For the avoidance of doubt, NAMA only became aware on 14 October 2015, through evidence given by the Northern Ireland First Minister, that Mr. Cushnahan had been involved with PIMCO in the potential purchase of Northern Ireland debtor loans as early as May 2013.  The NAMA board, at a meeting on 11 March 2014, considered that the proposed fee arrangement, in so far as it included Mr. Cushnahan, represented a significant issue for it.  It requested that this message be conveyed to PIMCO and this was done in a conference call at 11 a.m. on that day.  PIMCO was asked to reflect on the matter in view of the board&rsquo;s view of the significance of the issue.  Later on 11 March 2014, during a conference call at 5 p.m., PIMCO indicated that, having reflected on the matter, it was willing to withdraw and, in a call on 12 March 2014, confirmed its withdrawal, stating it believed it did not have any choice other than to withdraw gracefully.  In my view, the board, once it was informed of the Cushnahan matter, knew that it was inevitable that PIMCO would have to leave the process and the board provided it with the space to reflect and withdraw.  I am in no doubt that had it had made an effort to remain in the process, we would have had to formally remove it, but that did not arise, as by the time of the board meeting on 13 March 2014, it had signalled its withdrawal from the process.  In the circumstances, we were pleased that it had.</p><p> I do not believe we have rnischaracterised PIMCO&rsquo;s exit from the process, but even if we have, in our view, nothing turns on it.  At its meetings on 11 and 13 March 2014 the board discussed PIMCO's disclosure of 10 March 2014 and whether it did, in fact, wish to remain in the process.  On 10 March 2014 PIMCO asked if NAMA was aware of the Mr. Cushnahan fee and indicated that, if it was an issue for NAMA, it would have concerns about continuing to deal with Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Mr. Cushnahan.  The only plausible reason for bringing this matter to NAMA&rsquo;s attention was that PIMCO wanted to receive confirmation from NAMA either that it knew about it or that it was not an issue for it.  Presumably, if NAMA had indicated that it had no difficulty with the proposed arrangement, it is likely that PIMCO would, at the very least, have pursued the matter further with the three potential beneficiaries.  The board&rsquo;s reaction to the proposed arrangement - the committee has heard it from various individual board members in recent weeks - was unequivocal.  It decided on 11 March 2014 that PIMCO would have to go.  I reiterate what I stated to the committee on 9 July 2015 that the board was of the view that if PIMCO did not withdraw, NAMA could not permit it to remain in the process.  In other words, if PIMCO had not withdrawn, the board was minded to remove it and would have made a formal decision to that effect.</p><p> When it was made clear to PIMCO that the proposed arrangement involving Mr. Cushnahan was a significant issue for NAMA, the only residual question for it was the choreography of its withdrawal from the process.  From the board&rsquo;s perspective, it was preferable that PIMCO leave the process voluntarily rather than we having to make a decision to remove it.  The manner of its exit suited both sides.  Subsequently, we informed Lazard of PIMCO&rsquo;s withdrawal, but we did not inform it of the reasons for it.  Our key concern at that point was whether PIMCO&rsquo;s withdrawal was likely to have a serious impact on the level of competitive tension in the process.  Lazard advised us that there was sufficient competitive tension in the process with the remaining two bidders.  In retrospect, I accept that it would have been better if Lazard had been aware of the real reason for PIMCO&rsquo;s exit, but we did not regard it as a major commercial issue at the time, given that Lazard considered the post-PIMCO level of competitive tension sufficient.  I do not believe the information would have materially changed its advice on the residual level of competitive tension in the process.</p><p>As we have repeatedly stated, our primary concern was to ensure that Mr. Cushnahan was not involved in a bid and PIMCO's withdrawal had the effect of achieving that outcome.</p><p> I now wish to refer to other options.  One issue which has received some attention is the reference in the note of the second call of 11 March at 5 p.m. to a query from the head of asset recovery about other options and his query in respect of whether the deal could be "shaped differently for the arrangement fee to come out".  Taking these references in isolation, there has been an attempt to suggest that the head of asset recovery was seeking to persuade PIMCO to remain in the process.  That was not at all the case.  In raising these queries, the head of asset recovery was following up on the question that PIMCO had raised during the call on 10 March 2014.  During that call, Tom Rice said that if it was an issue for NAMA, then PIMCO would have concerns with continuing to deal with the three counterparties and would have to consider whether the business could proceed without the counterparties involved.  In order to establish the outcome of PIMCO's consideration of whether the business could proceed without the involvement of the counterparties, the head of asset recovery asked about it in the second call on 11 March 2014.  In their letter to the committee of 8 November 2016, PIMCO representatives make reference to NAMA's question on 11 March 2014 but, for some reason, fail to mention that the other options were originally canvassed by them on 10 March 2014.  The question from the head of asset recovery was only to clarify, as a matter of fact, what PIMCO's decision was in respect of its consideration of whether the business could proceed as outlined by PIMCO on 10 March 2014.</p><p> I will now outline the position on NAMA's response to the report conclusions.  There have been comments by a number of committee members to the effect that NAMA has been overly robust in its response to the Comptroller and Auditor General report.  I admit that we have been robust and I think we have been subject to very robust questioning at this committee.  The reason for our robustness is that we believe there is unfair commentary in the Comptroller and Auditor General report, that the report has questioned our competence and has implied that we failed in our obligations to taxpayers under section 10 of the NAMA Act.  Its key finding implies that members of the board and the executive who have extensive commercial experience and expertise set a minimum price for this portfolio which had the effect of locking in a probable loss of &pound;190 million on its sale.  According to the Comptroller and Auditor General report, this loss could have been avoided if NAMA had held on to the loans and worked them out over the period to 2020.  The NAMA chief executive has pointed out the numerous flaws in the hypothesis grounding the report's conclusion of probable loss.  He draws attention again to the fact that the report's reliance on a 5.5% discount rate appears to be based on an incorrect interpretation of a NAMA board decision of June 2013.</p><p> The report also concluded that we authorised a sales process which may have failed to identify a market investor with the willingness and capacity to pay more than &pound;1.322 billion for this portfolio.  In reaching this conclusion, the report disregards the compelling evidence that the nine firms which were admitted to the sales process accounted for 88% by par value of all European commercial real estate loan sales of large portfolios in excess of &euro;1 billion transacted over the period from 2013 to 2015.  The report took no account of Lazard's opinion that there was no evidence that any other investors existed at that time, in quarter 1, 2014, who were as credible and as well qualified such that it appeared that they were in a position to pay a higher price to NAMA than that secured from Cerberus.  The report took no account of Lazard's opinion that the process was open to the most qualified and credible potential counterparties.  Lazard's view was that there were fewer participants in this process than in some other transactions because there were fewer investors that were sufficiently qualified and credible.  I would suggest that the views of NAMA, Lazard and the Department of Finance, all of which have loan sales experience and expertise, should be treated as having strong evidential value in any review of a major loan transaction, especially if no market-based counter-evidence is offered.</p><p> We had serious concerns with the key contentions of the report and indeed our response has been robust, but appropriately so in my view.  In the circumstances, how else could we have been expected to respond?  We are entitled to defend our position.  I hope it is not being suggested that NAMA is obliged to accept the conclusions of the report regardless of the agency's views, not to mention the evidence submitted by us and Lazard, which, we believe, casts serious doubt over those conclusions.</p><p> We have always tried to run our business to the highest professional and commercial standards over the past seven years and I do not accept the implication of this report that, on this one occasion, the board and executive suffered a major collective lapse in managing our responsibilities which resulted in a probable loss of &pound;190 million of taxpayers' money.  My view then and now is that the Project Eagle deal was the best available at the time and no one has come forward with any credible evidence to suggest that a better deal might have been available then or since.  I note that Mr. Patrick Long of Lazard stated unequivocally to this committee on Tuesday that Cerberus paid the best price that was available in the market.  Our view in 2014 was that the sale of Project Eagle was a good deal for Irish taxpayers and events since then have only reinforced that view.</p></speech>

There is a v&oacute;t&aacute;il in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  Several of us arranged during the last vote to put in place a pairing arrangement.  The meeting is continuing.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#R00300"><p>I am keen now to discuss documentation.  We have listened carefully to all the evidence presented to this committee over the past two months.  If there is one message above all others that has come home to me based on that evidence, it is the fact that we did not document in greater detail and with greater clarity the rationale for key board decisions, especially those taken in December 2013 and January 2014.  Those decisions were taken after prolonged debate and discussion by the board.</p> <p>  Given that board members were experienced in financial, property, banking and accounting matters, much of the discussion revolved around the very topics that are now the focus of the committee's attention.  These included the issue of the appropriate discount rate that the market would apply to a portfolio such as this, our acceptance of the fact that our carrying value was in excess of the market's valuation of the portfolio and the probability that we would have to take substantial additional impairment on the portfolio in 2014, and possibly later, regardless of whichever strategy was adopted.</p> <p>  As with all board minutes, the minutes of those particular board meetings record the decisions ultimately taken by the board and do not provide a detailed account of the various considerations that were reviewed and discussed as part of the decision-making process.  If, at that stage in December 2013 and January 2014, we had any reason to expect that the board papers and the board minutes relating to Project Eagle were going to be subjected to the intensive review that is taking place, I have no doubt that the board would have been more than willing to set out a comprehensive and detailed rationale for its decisions.  If we had done so, I have little doubt that many of the issues which have attracted scrutiny from committee members since September would have been much clearer to them and that, as a result, we would all have spent less time now discussing them.  That is a lesson that we have learned from this experience.  Nowadays, board decisions and the rationale for them are recorded in much greater detail than was the case three years ago.</p> <p>  I will now discuss the position on management of conflicts of interest.  The report concludes that Mr. Cushnahan's potential conflicts of interest could not be managed by withholding of debtor-specific information and that NAMA should formally have considered whether his engagement in discussion of its Northern Ireland strategy was consistent with his involvement as a financial adviser to various Northern Ireland debtors.  Mr. Cushnahan was a political appointee intended to represent the views of Northern Ireland.  I believe that we managed the potential conflicts of interest appropriately within the statutory framework.</p> <p>  The key question to ask in a conflict of interest situation relates to the function of the designated director.  It is only if the interest is material to the performance of a function that an actual conflict will arise.  In the case of Mr. Cushnahan, his function was to sit on a committee which offered advice to NAMA about Northern Ireland.  He had no function in the formulation of NAMA strategy on the sale of Project Eagle or any other loan portfolio and he had no function relating to the management of any debtors or loans or assets.</p><p>Should he have disclosed his involvement to PIMCO in 2013?  Yes, I think he should have.  That alone does not justify the conclusion in the report that the potential conflicts were not appropriately managed by NAMA.</p><p> In conclusion, this is the fourth occasion that the CEO, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, and I have appeared before this committee to answer questions on Project Eagle and the second occasion since the Comptroller and Auditor General published his report.  In addition, current board members, former board members, members of the executive and the former CFO have also appeared before this committee since the Comptroller and Auditor General published his report.  At every one of these appearances, my colleagues and I have answered the committee's questions truthfully and honestly.  We have no difficulty with the committee scrutinising our work and questioning our commercial decisions.  It is right and proper that the committee does so.  We are accountable to this committee and we deliver our testimony to it in good faith.  I again wish to thank the committee for agreeing to hear at first hand the perspective of individual board members, current and former, an opportunity which was not afforded to them during the section 9 review.  I trust that the committee&rsquo;s review will take into account the totality of the evidence that has been placed before it.</p><p> My colleagues and I have devoted a huge amount of time and resources to appearing before the committee, to answering its questions honestly and to responding to its written requests for information.  Since the Comptroller and Auditor General published his report, NAMA has supplied 1,500 pages of responses and records to the committee in addition to the opening statements which have been made by board members and NAMA executives.  We take the work of this committee very seriously and we hope that the committee&rsquo;s further deliberations and final report will be fair, impartial and evidence based.</p></speech>

I already indicated this to the Comptroller and Auditor General before the meeting.  The principal witnesses here today are the NAMA people.  We are here to direct questions to NAMA.  Inevitably some people might want to raise a point of clarification with the Comptroller and Auditor General during the course of the meeting.  As Chairman, I will not allow a debate between the Comptroller and Auditor General and NAMA at any stage.  If people have questions that require clarification by the Comptroller and Auditor General, they can state them and I will bring him in to answer them at the beginning of the next session but this session is devoted to the NAMA people.  Immediately after the break, if any clarification is required, we will open the meeting to the Comptroller and Auditor General and then he will not speak for the rest of the meeting.  I will bring him in on a structured basis for clarification, not on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis.  The Deputy can put the question and she will get her answer before the next session.</p></speech>

I would like clarification from the Comptroller and Auditor General on that.  I do not think it is the position.  On page 8 of his opening statement, Mr. McDonagh said that the Comptroller and Auditor General has now added a qualification.  He says "While the C&amp;AG&rsquo;s qualification at this Committee ... is to be welcomed".  That is at the top of page 8.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly disputes that it was disclosed to NAMA.  The third fact that was not disclosed was that PIMCO was approached by Brown Rudnick in June 2013.  The fourth one is that PIMCO had sought confirmation from Brown Rudnick in 2013 as to whether NAMA had been informed of and had approved the involvement of Mr. Cushnahan in PIMCO's proposed transaction.  Mr. Daly is not disputing that any of these things happened.  He is saying clearly they are facts as they are put by PIMCO but NAMA was not made aware of them.</p></speech>

I just want to finish on Mr. Daly's opening statement in terms of what he said and what he has put on to the record of the committee.  He said that "PIMCO&rsquo;s letter to the committee is materially inaccurate".  That is a very strong statement to make because Mr. Daly is aware that this sale is the subject of two criminal investigations.  PIMCO made him aware of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and that it had to be in compliance with that Act.  There is also the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK.  There are two criminal investigations in two jurisdictions.  PIMCO is trying to helpfully present this committee with information.  It would seem from what Mr. Daly is saying that PIMCO is misleading the committee, which is a very serious charge for Mr. Daly and his organisation to make against PIMCO.  We will need to hear from PIMCO because it would be very interested in what Mr. Daly has to say.  Mr. Daly says the letter is materially inaccurate.  Given that there are criminal investigations and PIMCO is subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to say that the information it gave was materially inaccurate is a very strong statement.</p><p>Would Mr. Daly accept that?</p></speech>

I do not make a statement like that lightly.  All the Acts, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, etc., those are all obligations of PIMCO.  My main concern throughout this is that if we had been told in early 2013 by PIMCO of Mr. Cushnahan's involvement, and it acknowledges it knew of it, then I do not want to give a definitive answer but in my view that would probably have been a reportable issue in terms of SIPO.</p></speech>

There is a discussion around the potential payment which was going to be split three ways between Brown Rudnick, solicitors, Tughans, solicitors, and Frank Cushnahan.  The discussion was in that context.  The minutes go on to state: "The Board noted that PIMCO had advised that the negotiations had commenced in April 2013 and noted further that Frank Cushnahan had not resigned as a member of the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee until 7th November 2013".  Minutes of any meeting are a factual record of decisions that were made and issues that were noted.  The board notes that the negotiations commenced in April 2013.  I put it to Mr. Daly that he did know and the board did know about the April 2013 date.</p></speech>

What Mr. Daly is really saying, then, is that the question was asked but PIMCO did not give NAMA the information, which is very serious, given that a criminal investigation is ongoing.  I think PIMCO would be very interested in Mr. Daly's comments.  I think they are very explosive in the context of the criminal investigation.</p> <p>  Moving on from that, Cerberus also appeared before the committee.  The witnesses would have seen when representatives of Cerberus were before the committee that they said that when Cerberus was approached by Brown Rudnick - Cerberus got a cold call approach by Brown Rudnick - Brown Rudnick informed Cerberus that it had been working on this project for a year.  Brown Rudnick approached Cerberus in March 2014.  If one works backwards one year, that is March 2013.  Again, Brown Rudnick had no problem volunteering that information.  PIMCO had no problem volunteering to us information on the background of April 2013.  However, Mr. Daly wants us to believe that PIMCO did not give NAMA or its board that information at a critical time when it was giving NAMA the information about the success fee.  From all of the documentary evidence that the Comptroller and Auditor General presented to us in terms of the contemporaneous notes, it is very clear to me that PIMCO was very aware of its legal requirements.  It was very conscious of them, so for PIMCO not to give NAMA the information that Mr. Daly says it did not give NAMA is very serious for PIMCO, and that is very troubling.</p></speech>

That is exactly the point I am making: PIMCO had this information.  It is now obvious from PIMCO's letter that this process dated back to April 2013 and that it never told us.</p></speech>

With respect, Mr. Daly is counting on the clock now and what I will leave there is the letter we got from PIMCO and the evidence from Cerberus.  Obviously, we will have to make up our own minds on all of that.  </p><p>I want to draw Mr. Daly's attention to another paragraph of the same minutes.  These are signed minutes, so there was never adaption of them.  These are signed minutes in a record of what I would see as fact.  Mr. Daly will see the very last paragraph which states:</p><blockquote>The Board noted further that the situation was evolving and would need to be carefully managed.  Following further discussion the Board noted that, subject to Lazard's advice, it was minded to be as upfront as was possible with other bidders in relation to PIMCO's withdrawal.</blockquote> <p>Mr. Daly's opening statement reads: &quot;I accept that it would have been better if Lazard had been aware of the real reason for PIMCO's exit&quot;.  NAMA did not make Lazard aware of it.  I find that absolutely extraordinary.  I asked Mr. Daly earlier whether Lazard had a responsibility or a role in relation to integrity in the process.  He said &quot;yes&quot;.  He was made aware of a success fee that involved one of his NIAC members, he was made aware that he was associated with Brown Rudnick and Tughans and he did not feel that it was relevant to give that information to Lazard, despite the fact that NAMA's own board minutes note that is what he said he would do.</p></speech>

I will read from them again: "Following further discussion the Board noted that, subject to Lazard's advice", etc.  For Lazard to give the advice, it would have to be in possession of the information.

"As was possible" relates to giving the information to the bidders, not Lazard having the advice, which is different.  Representatives Lazard appeared before the committee, and I want to make Mr. Daly aware of what they said.  Mr. Daly put on the record some of what they said but he was quite selective in that regard.  When Mr. Long of Lazard was here, he said he was very concerned about the fact that he was not given information, and I will quote some of what he said.  He said that the process was not as level as he thought it was at the time.  He was asked about a level playing field.  He said that he was not aware at the time quite how much time PIMCO spent on the transaction.   He acknowledged that that did confer on PIMCO a competitive advantage.  He stated that he was surprised and concerned as to the letter's content.  He was talking about PIMCO's letter.</p></speech>

We wanted to make sure that they would be told that PIMCO had pulled out and that it was gone.  In fact, as I think some of my colleagues have told the committee, whenever the former board members were in - or maybe it was the executives - we felt that we would never want to lose a bidder in a race.</p><p>While we obviously never wanted to lose a bidder from the race, the fact that PIMCO was gone might well have enthused the others to keep going and bid at a more competitive price.  That phraseology was all around-----</p></speech>

There was talk of Lazard being in the position to give advice on how NAMA could relay information to other bidders.  The fact is that Lazard was not given that information.  The final point I will make is that Lazard went on to say that it had complete information and accepted that the process had become compromised.  That comes from Lazard.</p></speech>

I remember that we had a discussion on that.  We considered whether there were any legal risks attached to that.  We asked ourselves questions.  How much do we tell Lazard?  How much do we tell the other bidders in the race about all of this?  Can we couch it in such a way so as not to leave ourselves exposed to some issue with Mr. Cushnahan, Tughans or Brown Rudnick?</p> <p>  I have already acknowledged today in my opening statement that, looking back, we probably had told Lazard broadly of the reasons for PIMCO's departure.  I do not think we would have ever given Lazard the full details of it because that would have led to all sorts of-----</p></speech>

I am not sitting here in judgement of Mr. Daly or NAMA, for that matter.  We have a report to produce and we are trying to establish the truth more than anything else.  The witness can understand, from our perspective, when we are hearing different narratives and polar opposite statements about different things, that it is quite difficult to find the commonalities and to ascertain the truth.  That is what we are paid to do and why we are here.  I hope he can appreciate why people get a bit excited at times about it.</p> <p>  I will start with a positive.  Mr. Daly's opening statement discusses documentation on page 9.  When he was previously before the committee, he did say that the process could have been tweaked better, if my memory serves me correctly.  Mr. John Collison of NAMA also said that there could have been improvements.  At the time, Mr. Daly said that the minutes should record decisions, not discussions.  However, in his opening statement on the issue of documentation, Mr. Daly said, "If there is one message above all others that has come home to me based on that evidence, it is the fact that we did not document in greater detail and with greater clarity the rationale for key board decisions".  That is something I asked him about on the last occasion and I think it is very important.  I am glad that he accepts that because it is a departure from what he originally said to us.  I believe that it will be helpful going forward in order that we alleviate something like this happening again.  That is what we are all about at the end of the day.  I welcome that in Mr. Daly's opening statement.</p> <p>  The other thing I will put to Mr. Daly is something I asked Ms Ann Nolan in the Department of Finance.  It is only fair of me to ask Mr. Daly today.  It is about the NAMA Act itself.  My view is that it was quite restrictive in terms of expediting the sales above everything else.  I said that to Mr. Daly on the previous occasion he was before the committee with regard to haste.  I know I outlined a lack of certain things and I will go through that in a minute.  What is Mr. Daly's view of the NAMA Act itself?  Does he think it was restrictive on NAMA?  Did it put haste above everything else?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.362" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#V05500"><p>That is probably getting into an area of policy, which is difficult for me to comment on.  There are many restrictions in the NAMA Act, including not selling back to defaulting debtors and all of that.  I would say that, in the aggregate, those measures were probably quite positive from the point of view of NAMA's business.  The expeditious point is in the Act a few times.  That is our mandate and we cannot really depart from it.  The point Ms Nolan made, or perhaps it was Deputy Madigan, was that there is a tension between that and getting the best value.  There might be some validity in that but, at the end of the day, an asset management agency has a number of objectives.  It must manage the assets, not necessarily retain them.  It also has the objective of getting the market going.  Part of that is in actually putting assets on the market.</p><p>We were criticised several times in the early years for stymying the market by putting nothing there at all.  I am reluctant-----</p></speech>

It comes back to my opening statement.  In the overall context, debt of &euro;30.6 billion has been reduced to &euro;3.6 billion.  This has happened because we acted expeditiously in many cases.

Under the category of valuation of portfolios, there was a lack of records, a lack of discussions about the sale of Project Eagle, a lack of formal evaluations of property collateral and a lack of formal expert advice received.  Under the category of conflict of interest issues, there was a lack of actions taken to deal with conflicts of interest in the success fee arrangements, there was no considered approach to the method of sale and haste appears to have been put before prudence.  I have said all of this before.  There was also a lack of competition in the sales process.</p> <p>  Deputy Cullinane has gone through one aspect of the issues with regard to Lazard.  I understand that a mini-tender is normally put forward prior to the appointment of loan sale advisers.  I know that is permissible under EU procurement rules.  Can Mr. Daly explain why that was not done in this instance when Lazard was being engaged?</p></speech>

We had an EU tender in late 2011 and we appointed a loan sales panel in 2012.  We appointed a US panel and a European panel.  Lazard was on the European panel.  Its fees and the fees of all the tenderers were set at that stage.  The fees on the panel are broadly the same.  One usually calls a number of people off that panel as a subpanel if one has time to do so.  It does not-----</p></speech>

I understand that in other NAMA loan sales, the loan sale advisers valued both the loan collateral and the loan portfolio for disposal in a single lot.  I understand that in the case of another NAMA multi-debtor, where there was a multi-property sale, the loan sale advisers advised on alternative loan sale strategies and provided a commentary on market conditions.  It would appear that Lazard was not asked to carry out any of these tasks.  Can I ask Mr. McDonagh about that?</p></speech>

As one of my colleagues explained previously, the loan sales market changed from late 2014 onwards when bidders demanded up-to-date valuations of all the underlying collateral.  As I said in my opening statement, until late 2013 we envisaged that the sale of the Project Eagle portfolio would be a hard slog all the way to 2020.  An opportunity came along involving one of the most credible counterparties in the world, PIMCO, which had approximately &euro;200 billion of assets under management.  We said we would provide an opportunity to prove the concept of whether a firm like PIMCO would be interested in the portfolio.</p></speech>

That was its key responsibility.  We have given the committee the details and the contract note with Lazard.  That note sets out in detail what NAMA wanted Lazard to do, which included maintaining confidentiality, price maximisation, a fair and transparent process, suitability of bidders and no ongoing participation by NAMA etc.  There is a whole lot of detail and the contract order for services contains the detail and sets out the scope of the work.  It would be quite clear that the main deliverable from Lazard at the end of the process would be a recommendation in respect of a preferred bidder, which is what it did in terms of Cerberus.  Again, I am at a disadvantage in that I do not have the transcript of everything that was said on Tuesday.</p></speech>

This seems to me to have been a major factor in applying a high discount rate to the portfolio's valuation.  The Comptroller and Auditor General told us that he sought evidence of these deteriorating relationships but did not get any.  Does such evidence exist?</p></speech>

At the end of 2013, 76% of our Northern Ireland debtors were not co-operating and we expected to make a loss.  The rest of our portfolio had 38% in the same category.  That speaks for itself in terms of the type of portfolio we were dealing with.  We cannot provide individual debtor details because of obligations under the NAMA Act but that is available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Debtors were continually missing milestones.  If debtors are continually missing milestones in terms of mandating rent, not achieving sales and rectifying security, then effectively they slip down the credit rate, which is why the Northern Ireland debtors had 76% in that category compared with the rest of the portfolio, which had only 38%.  That evidence is available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  There are individual instances of what we call strategic credit reviews.  We do formal reviews of each of the debtors twice a year.  We sit down and assess each debtor in terms of whether the debtors are meeting their milestones.  Again, that information is available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

The point would be that we would have needed something very solid to remove Mr. Cushnahan from the NIAC.  There is no doubt at all that it would have caused tensions up North.  I know that the deputy First Minister, when he was before the committee recently, indicated that it would not really have been a problem for him, but he was clear in his evidence that he felt that it might have been a problem for others.  I think that bears it out.  That is not to say that that would have overridden our considerations.  I made it clear on the last occasion that if we had known at any stage of Mr. Cushnahan's early involvement in Project Eagle, political sensitivities or not, we would have removed him.  Up to the time he resigned in November 2013, we knew absolutely nothing about his alleged activities.</p></speech>

Is the document available?  It mentioned under a subheading the rationale for making a bid below the reserve price.  It highlighted that an unconditional bid process was required.  Fortress also spoke of the quality and completeness of the diligence information available to it.  This implies to me it influenced its reasons for going in below the reserve price and seems to suggest the quality and completeness of the diligence was not to a standard it felt would allow it to go with the reserve.  Is it reasonable to state that the conditionality of the bid process led to companies such as Fortress bidding less than they would if there was no conditionality in terms of allowing them to syndicate or use external finance sources?</p></speech>

We try to avoid this as much as possible because putting the portfolio back on the market is very expensive.</p> <p>  With regard to the diligence, we are satisfied we put as much due diligence into the data room as was necessary to allow people make a bid.  The important thing with Fortress, which comes back to the earlier question, is Fortress took on Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield as its property valuers after PIMCO withdrew.  If PIMCO allegedly had the benefit of a long period of working on the portfolio, then Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield may have been working the portfolio for a long time and Fortress would have got the benefit of it.</p> <p>  The major issue is bidders will always like more time and more information, but they must make a call on the price they will pay for the portfolio.  We think, and Lazard has also said, there was sufficient information in the data room for people to make a bid.  The question is whether they want to step up to the &euro;1.3 billion minimum reserve, and, if so, they then step up to the plate.  This is their own call.  They have their own views on valuations.  This is also in an e-mail I provided to the committee previously.  When Michael George wrote to me about getting into the process he said he had $4 billion in cash.  The question of him needing to get cash from third parties does not seem to have arisen if he had $4 billion in cash.  Someone can always refinance after buying the portfolio from NAMA, which is what has happened with Cerberus.</p></speech>

We were given that undertaking.  Cerberus told us that it had given us this undertaking only after it had received confirmation from Brown Rudnick and Tughans that they had complied with the foreign corrupt practice Act and the UK Bribery Act.  I think we have given these emails to the committee also.  Cerberus gave us that undertaking after it had received confirmation from Brown Rudnick and Tughans.

I have actually wracked my brains and consulted some of my colleagues about who said what in terms of the external members.  Certainly my recollection is that Mr. Cushnahan said little enough and that most of the contribution was made by Mr. Brian Rowntree, but I cannot recall who said what.  I do recollect that Mr. Cushnahan would have said the question of value would be key for NAMA or something like that, but most of the contribution would have been made by Mr. Rowntree.  Deputy Marc MacSharry used the word "discount".  I want to make it clear that it was just a general remark that a discount would be sought.  There was no discussion of what it might be, the range or anything like it.</p> <p>  Deputy Marc MacSharry's other question was related to what I think I termed a "debtor's charter".  This was a document that had been mentioned during the telephone conversation with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, who suggested it be sent to NAMA.  It was sent to NAMA by somebody in the First Minister's office, but we ignored it.  From our point of view, we thought it was laughable really because it amounted to a debtor's charter.  I was never quite sure what the intention was and whether it was intended that NAMA would consider making it a condition prior to the sale of Project Eagle.  I do not know.  If there was anybody with that spurious hope, they would have been given short shrift.  We effectively ignored it.</p></speech>

Mr. Patrick Long was before the committee the other day.  Prompted by some of the questions asked, I want to clarify a few things.  At the time the portfolio was being sold, there were four firms that had acted on nearly 90% of the assets that had a par value of over &pound;1 billion.  None of these firms was on the first list of firms approached.  In fact, Cerberus was on the second list.  Mr. Long told us that Lazard had decided to go about it in a sequential way.  There seems to have been a lot of engagement with NAMA on how it should approach it.  Will Mr. McDonagh comment on this?</p></speech>

I was not at the meetings but he was.</p></speech>

We relied heavily on it to pick what we called the right bidders - credible bidders.  It initially selected the first three, two of which opted not to participate.  That in sequence led to the engagement with Cerberus.  I think Apollo might have been after that also, but we relied heavily on Lazard's advice at that stage.  Having been briefed on the composition of the portfolio and where the assets were located, one of its key tasks was to select the actual bidders which could transact during the timeframe about which we were talking and which also had the financial wherewithal to transact.</p></speech>

Obviously, we took its advice on who would be the right counter-parties for the transaction.  I would go a step further and say that, by the time the process broke in the media, the board gave Lazard the flexibility to go wider and ensure no counter-party - no credible potential bidder - would be excluded from the process.  This was detailed in one set of board minutes on 13 or 14 February.  Lazard was given that flexibility.</p></speech>

Does that not suggest that this was a flawed approach?</p></speech>

All of the bidders were given the exact same information.  Granted, PIMCO had access to some of what we would describe as limited information in advance of the others.  One could say, certainly, that the bid level that PIMCO submitted was, no doubt, of interest to NAMA but that is not to say that we were not interested in actually exceeding that bid.  If there were bidders who were prepared to bid higher than PIMCO we would have been satisfied to accept their bid.  Lazard was given that flexibility.  Meetings took place with all of those bidders and they were told at the very outset what conditionality would apply, what information would be available and how the transaction would take place.  They were given the option at the time to opt in or out.  That appealed to a number of them and they felt they could transact in that sort of timeframe.</p></speech>

These were the ones who - and again it is in our statements - were responsible for 88% of all European commercial real estate sales of over &euro;1 billion.  For me, the question in all of this is who was in and why did they leave etc., but there is some question mark out there that there was somebody else.  I do not know who it is, and nobody has identified for me who it is.</p></speech>

Deputy MacSharry has just referred to what Fortress told the committee about not being allowed to syndicate pre-bid finance.  I appreciate that Mr. Daly has answered this but it appears there were a lot of constraints put on people or entities.  It is certainly the impression, cropping up over and over again, that there was an attempt to limit the number who would fall in at the end in this process.  Obstacles were put in the way with regard to local valuations and in other ways.</p></speech>

The main concern for NAMA was that anybody out there who had the capability of taking on this portfolio, and who might be interested, was given an opportunity - and they were.  That condition about upfront financing is not at all unusual in NAMA's <i>modus operandi </i>because what we do not want is somebody coming in with a high bid but then telling us they do not really have the finance for it and need three weeks or three months to actually do it while in the meantime, everybody else has gone away.</p></speech>

Mr. John Mulcahy described the PIMCO bid to the committee as a "superb offer".  He was basing that on only a portion of the assets being valued and the loans being valued in-house.  Is there any question in the witnesses' minds about there being some groupthink as to what these assets were valued at, by virtue of the fact the price is what someone is prepared to pay, as Mr. Daly said in his statement?  Is there any question in Mr. Daly's mind that there is a bit of groupthink and that this got almost fixed in terms of what these assets or loans were worth?</p></speech>

I go back to all the discussions we had around that issue.  The &pound;1.3 billion figure we put on this was a result of our own internal review, workings and considerations.  That is how we got at that minimum price.  It is probably not hugely surprising that it would not be totally different from somebody else because - and this goes back to the argument about purchaser and seller - one needs both of them to eventually come to some sort of agreement around the figure.  Groupthink was certainly not a factor in our decision to come up with the figure of &pound;1.3 billion.  It was, however, a useful target to us.  Here was somebody who we knew - as the CEO has said - was in very high standing internationally.  They were coming up.  There was an element of proof of concept in it for NAMA's board.  There was the opportunity, an indicative price that was attractive and then we did our own thinking and we came up with a minimum price.</p></speech>

It became a single process as opposed to the customary best-practice two-phased approach where one opens it up to a wide group and then one narrows it down.  More information is probably offered to those in the second round.  The process appears to have been influenced by the fact that the bid was on the table.

We have told Cerberus that there was &euro;2.8 million relating to sales of assets that, once the transaction closed and the bank accounts became Cerberus's rather than ours, went to Cerberus but that we should have had.  There is provision for this in the loan sale agreement called a "wrong pockets" clause.  Cerberus had indicated to us throughout that it would pursue a counterclaim against us for up to &euro;20 million in respect of assets that we told it were there but that, when Cerberus looked for them, the security was not right.  We resisted that.  We are still in discussions with Cerberus.  The latest position is that Cerberus has reduced its counterclaim from &euro;20 million to &euro;2.5 million and stated that it would give us &euro;300,000.  We have not acceded to that yet because we have been tied up in dealing with all of this.  We will engage with Cerberus on the matter, but it is just a part of normal ongoing negotiations with counterparties.</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Mr. Daly referred to an issue that involved some public debate.  I will quote him, and I want him to think about this.  He stated: "According to the Comptroller and Auditor General report, this loss could have been avoided if NAMA had held on to the loans and worked them out over the period to 2020."  The report does not say that this definitely would have happened.  It is conditional.  Were this committee drafting a report and we wrote that the loss could, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, probably have been avoided, would NAMA have an issue with that?</p></speech>

It reads: "NAMA's argument that a discount rate ... is not persuasive."  The Comptroller and Auditor General is not arguing about figures.  Rather, he writes that NAMA's argument of 10% is not persuasive.  Let us be clear if we are to quote bit by bit.</p></speech>

I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General after the break whether he could use another, but similar, formula of words in order to take the heat out of the debate and help us to draft a report.  I am not asking him to change his report or Mr. Daly to change his opening statement, but both know that we have to write a report and it would be helpful if we achieved a consensus before then.

My position is that different discount rates would be appropriate for estimating what a purchaser of a portfolio of non-performing loans might be willing or able to pay for them and what the loans might yield to NAMA if it worked them out, as planned, over the medium to long term.  I have not changed my position in that regard.  That is my response to that point.</p> <p>  An issue was also raised with regard to a reference on page 8 of the same statement.  The reference is to the Comptroller and Auditor General's qualification of the report around probable loss and so on.  The report refers to NAMA's projected cash flows yielding net receipts of &pound;1.675 billion through working out the loans over the medium to long term.  Obviously, any future cash flow is subject to a certain amount of uncertainty and the eventual net receipts might have been above or below that.  That is really why I put the qualification of "probable" on the reference to the loss of value.  We will never know what the outcome would have been.  I do not think I mentioned figures of plus or minus &pound;200 million and I certainly do not recall the detail of that.  It is worthwhile for the committee to bear in mind that the cash flows that were prepared by NAMA for use in the financial statements would have been conservative.  There was a possibility, certainly, that the values achieved could have been higher.  The other element in that uncertainty was that PIMCO's indicative bid offered more for the top 55 assets than the cash flows were actually indicating they might yield two to three years into the future.  That is an indication of the variance there.</p> <p>  I was also reflecting on the suggestion around the term "probable" and so on.  I think I have explained previously that I changed from the use of the phrase "potential loss of value" on reflection in the last round up of the report.  The key reason for that change was that if one was talking about an investment possibility where one was comparing two potential lines of activity or two potential investment options, comparing one with the other and projecting forward that one would yield a value of "X" and one would yield a value of "Y", then one is talking hypothetically in that situation but here we were actually talking about assets that were owned.</p><p>If one were not disposing of them in a way that yielded what they were worth at the time or they might yield in the future and disposed of them at a lower price, it would result in a probable loss of value.</p></speech>

We are talking about whether the rate should be 5% or some other percentage.  On the top of page 5, it states in bold: "In particular, 'care should be taken to ensure that both (a) alternative NPV scenarios are generated using alternative discount rates and (b) that qualitative information would be considered as part of the decision-making process'&rdquo;.

To be fair to Mr. McDonagh, he should be afforded an opportunity to retract his view on the view of the Comptroller and Auditor General if it is incorrect.  Mr. McDonagh said in his opening statement that the view of the Comptroller and Auditor General is that a discount rate of 5.5% would have been appropriate to derive the market value of the portfolio.  I have read the report.  Nowhere in the report does it say that.  Could the Comptroller and Auditor General acknowledge that it does not say it?  Could an opportunity to withdraw the remark be given?  It is not in the report.  In layman's terms, is it the case that the probable loss, as referred to by Mr. McCarthy, arose when the decision was taken to sell the portfolio as a lot?</p></speech>

If the Comptroller and Auditor General is saying he has got his interpretation, that is fine and I accept it.  The important point is that we and the Comptroller and Auditor General are at one in terms of the undiscounted cashflow of &pound;1.67 billion.  The question is what discount rate one uses.  The second point, which I have made in my statement, is that when the board decided to set a minimum price of &pound;1.3 billion, it was effectively locking in a loss.  That loss, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said, is &pound;190 million, bearing in mind the &pound;1.49 billion.  It turned out to be &pound;162 million but the point is that the board was fully aware that a loss would effectively be incurred and that it would arise anyway in future years in terms of impairment.  We could not take account of that loss in our 2013 financial statements under the accounting rules.  It is a very technical point.</p></speech>

The issue of the higher discount rate being an appropriate market discount rate and the &euro;1.3 billion value was discussed in the December 2013 and January 2014 board meetings.

With respect, it is important that when a view is attributed to the Comptroller and Auditor General and he has clarified that it is not his view nor is it anywhere in the report, which states a discount rate of 5.5% would have been appropriate to derive the market value of the portfolio, it is fair to ask Mr McDonagh to withdraw that.</p></speech>

That is the implication.  I fully accept the word of the Comptroller and Auditor General and I withdraw my remark if he said that is not what he meant.  I fully accept that.  I will hold my hands up.  I can only give the Deputy my interpretation of paragraph 3.81.</p></speech>

He said there was a discussion of the 10% discount rate in the board meeting, and in hindsight he thinks it would have been better had it been recorded.  That is part of the story.  The issue is the documentation presented to the board meeting.  I refer, in particular, to page 144, appendix C, of the report which refers to documentation presented to the board.  The right hand side of the column on page 144 shows that the documentation presented to the board was a 5.5% NPV and 2.5% NPV.  It is not just a question from our perspective that a 10% discussion may have taken place at a board meeting and was not documented.  The issue is very clear, namely, that there was no document presented to the board about a 10% rate.</p> <p>  In terms of generating a scenario, a reference to a buyer's discount will not do.  In terms of the scenarios generated, which is in bold in Mr. McDonagh's statement today, the only two scenarios that were generated for the board were 5.5% and 2.5%.</p></speech>

The executive puts a lot of papers forward to each board meeting.  They are put forward for discussion and are discussed and challenged by the board.  Not everything the executive puts forward is accepted by the board, and that is the value and role of a good board.  All I am saying is that those scenarios were put forward by the executive.  Page 146 refers a 10% discount on the collateral.  That led to a discussion about why figures of 5.5% or 2.5% were put forward by the executive as appropriate.  There was a discussion about the 10% rate.  That should have been documented, and then we would not be having this discussion.</p></speech>

Just to be clear, one would have thought that the board would have said that it had seen the scenario of 5.5% and 2.5% NPV work-outs.  Mr. McDonagh said the board members said a 10% rate, or higher, was closer to the mark of where things were.  The logical thing was to ask someone to work out the figures.  The board appears to have made some decisions.  We have been told it made a decision based on a rate of 10%.  What was the figure based on?  Why did Mr. McDonagh tell us it was &euro;1.3 billion?</p></speech>

That was the thought process.  That is part of the discussion when a board is clued into the financial world and things like that.  All I say is that the &euro;1.3 billion figure is not something that was easily bought or accepted by the board; rather the board came to a decision that it thought a minimum price of &euro;1.3 billion for the portfolio was the appropriate price but that there should be a competitive process in order to try to get more than &euro;1.3 billion.</p></speech>

This has been an important issue, even though some people might be quite bored by it.  The documentation Mr. McDonagh provided to the committee uses the phrase "the discussion on the 10%" because it was implicit in the discussion that the people on board all had financial expertise and knew about the higher rate.  The committee is saying that he is not able to demonstrate to us that happened or the scenario was worked out.  That is our difficulty.</p></speech>

At the end of the day, I presume the committee is considering all the evidence.  There have been two, three, eight, nine or ten people from the board or executive of NAMA before the committee who have given evidence in regard to that.</p> <p>  I have one brief comment.  I go back to the Chairman's reference to the ordinary person on the street.  He or she will say the Comptroller and Auditor General found NAMA should have held onto the assets and have gotten &euro;190 million more.  That is what is being said to me.  I accept that the Comptroller and Auditor General did not make a recommendation to that effect.  I point in particular to paragraphs 3.86 and 4.83.  When one looks at those together, the clear inference is that if we had held on we would have gotten the &euro;190 million.  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General has not directly said that.  If he said what he said two or three minutes ago, going back to our previous conversation, namely, that NAMA had the option to sell or hold and that was a commercial decision for NAMA because it is our responsibility and it had been left at that, I doubt we would be here arguing about all this.</p> <p>  The headline that came out of this was that NAMA generated a probable loss of &euro;190 million for the taxpayer.  That is what is being said to me on the street.  From our point of view as a board, as individuals on the board and executives, the committee will understand that is what we find difficult.  The Comptroller and Auditor General said some time ago that it was NAMA's decision to hold or sell, and it was.</p></speech>

I am 100% happy with the Chairman.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General has been excellent in its clarity.  From day one I have asked every single witness who appeared before the committee whether they read the report.  Every time we were told they did, but it is as if he is saying what he said for the first time.  He has repeatedly made points in his report and kept a dignified silence, in contrast to a number of witnesses who went straight to the newspapers with a particular narrative.  I address my comments to the Chairman; I will come back with my questions.</p> <p>  The comments have to be balanced.  The narrative was written by certain witnesses from NAMA in regard to the percentage.  It persisted with that narrative until today, and now we see some type of apology.  There is no confusion in the minds of the people on the ground, except-----</p></speech>

He said after careful consideration and all of the evidence he did not.  If I am correct I understand that NAMA is accepting that today, but perhaps I am wrong.

The narrative thus far for NAMA has been that an approach was made by PIMCO.  A reverse approach was made through Brown Rudnick in respect of the Project Eagle portfolio.  When we had a conversation about that at one stage I said it was interesting.  I wondered how it had occurred to PIMCO that it was a good idea to focus on debtors not on assets.  The impression had been created for the person in the street that PIMCO as an entity thought it would be an idea to make a play for this portfolio and mediated it through Brown Rudnick.  Mr. Daly should bear with me.  We now know in fact that was not how it happened.  How it happened is that Brown Rudnick suggested the deal to PIMCO.  Is that how it happened?</p></speech>

I would speculate rather differently than that.  Let us move forward to a subsequent conversation on 11 March, the following day, at 5 p.m.  It involved largely the same cast, Mr. Tom Rice, Mr. Hugh Mildred from PIMCO, Mr. Stewart and Mr. Hanna.  They picked up the theme again regarding Mr. Cushnahan and the success fees or fixer's fees, whatever term was used.  Mr. Rice said the Project Eagle process:</p><blockquote>had been with NAMA for several months referenced April/May 2013.  This development went back to the origination of the deal with PIMCO and the proposal for an acquisition fee.  The proposed split was mentioned some time ago and enquiries were made and it was looked at in more detail in the second half of 2013.</blockquote> <p>I am reading it correctly, am I not?</p></speech>

Once the amount was queried, it became evident the payment was to be split three ways, and clarification was sought from the firms afterwards.  There is set out the fact that PIMCO, on examining the letter of engagement became aware and concerned about the fees and the manner in which they were to be split.  It also demonstrates that PIMCO referenced the April or May 2013 date and made it explicitly clear that the fee arrangement went back to the point at which Brown Rudnick and PIMCO first discussed the transaction.</p></speech>

The Deputy and I had an exchange about it.  The Project Eagle process had been with NAMA for several months, referenced April-May 2013.  We were able to establish that it was not with NAMA from April or May 2013, and a moment ago the Chairman mentioned the first notice was the July letter, which I learned subsequently.  When they referenced it and said it had been with NAMA, it was clear that it had not been with NAMA from April or May 2013, so that cannot have been right.  Admittedly, my knowledge about timeframes regarding when NAMA would have first become aware was limited at the time.  That was what I took from it.</p></speech>

I have mentioned what was said on the call, and what I took, quite reasonably, from what was said on the call, was that the process was not with NAMA from April-May and that PIMCO must have been mistaken.  This has come to light in PIMCO's letter of 8 November 2016.  On the call, we asked when the issue arose.  On the previous call, we had been told PIMCO wanted to contact us, out of a desire for transparency and to be as upfront and open as possible.  It was entirely reasonable for us, in asking when the issue arose, to expect that PIMCO would have outlined, in detail, when the issue arose, how it became aware of it, who was involved and all those things.  What we got, to my mind, was a vague answer that did not address those points.  Only in the letter of 8 November 2016 do we have far greater detail on it.  Maybe the people on the PIMCO end of the call were unaware of it at the time.  I do not know.</p></speech>

Minutes are much more than that; they are afforded a position in the Companies Acts because they are important.  They are a legal requirement to be met by companies and entities.  Minutes are not mentioned, albeit only a handful of times, in the NAMA Act.  They are not just somebody's impression; they are evidence of what occurred.  I ask Mr. Stewart to look at the minutes and therein the point of contention, the mention of the April 2013 date.  According to the minutes, the board noted that PIMCO had advised that the negotiations had commenced.  It is clear from the previous paragraph that the negotiations referenced were in relation to the fee.  It is noted that the negotiations commenced in 2013.  It is further noted that Mr. Frank Cushnahan had not resigned as a member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee until 7 November.  Given what transpired in the passage we have gone through, the correspondence we have from PIMCO and, above all, what was signed off on by, if I am not mistaken, Mr. Daly, this confirms to me that NAMA was aware of this.  It was brought to the board's attention that the arrangement between PIMCO and Tughans and Mr. Frank Cushnahan had dated back to April 2013.</p></speech>

The reason this is absolutely critical is the version of events from NAMA - this is in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General - when it was asked what it had done when this conflict of interest came to light is that when it had come to light Mr. Cushnahan had stepped down.  NAMA's response was that it had discovered there was a success fee, but Mr. Cushnahan was not getting it because the transaction had been terminated and that he had gone off on his merry way.  I believe what we are looking at is something entirely different.  It is not simply that NAMA discovered that Mr. Frank Cushnahan was in line for a success fee or a fixer's fee but that it had been brought to its attention - I believe this is reflected in the minutes - that Mr. Cushnahan, with Tughans and Brown Rudnick, had been involved in hammering out this deal from the get-go and that the success fee had been envisaged from the get-go.</p></speech>

I refer the Deputy to my opening statement of this morning and the four points on which we are in disagreement with PIMCO.  They all relate to the fact that the involvement of Mr. Frank Cushnahan and the possibility of a success fee being paid him was not brought to our attention, in so far as it related back to April or later in 2013 while he was a member of the NIAC.

I am saying that in March 2014 NAMA was made aware retrospectively of what Mr. Cushnahan had been involved in.  One might ask why does that matter.  It matters a great deal because it means that Mr. Daly's initial defence of why NAMA was inert and did not act in respect of Mr. Cushnahan saying, "Sure, he was gone anyhow" actually does not hold any water.  I am suggesting to the witnesses that in March 2014 it was brought to NAMA's attention that a year previously, when Frank Cushnahan was on the Northern committee, that he had an involvement with Brown Rudnick and Tughans in terms of this transaction, and had lined himself up for a very hefty payment.</p></speech>

To follow through on the Deputy's question, I am saying quite clearly that when we did become aware of this - and it was through the PIMCO letter even though it is not, to our minds, exhausted - when we became aware whenever that letter was produced to the committee, or read at the committee, that Mr. Cushnahan appeared to have a relationship back to April 2013, we reported that to the appropriate authorities because that was the first we became aware of his involvement with this while he was a member of the NIAC.</p></speech>

If one recalls, I think it was 14 October 2015, at the equivalent committee in the North of Ireland, the then First Minister Peter Robinson gave evidence.  His evidence was that he had attended a meeting with PIMCO, attended by Frank Cushnahan.  I think that had occurred in May 2013.  That was the first objective evidence we ever had of Mr. Cushnahan's involvement with PIMCO, at any stage during 2013.  Immediately after that evidence we reviewed the transcript.  We actually entered into quite lengthy correspondence with Mr. Cushnahan which ran from, I think, November until February of this year.  We had extensive correspondence with him.  There is a provision in the Standards in Public Office Act whereby the chairman can seek further information from a designated director.  When that correspondence was exhausted we still did not think we had a satisfactory explanation from Mr. Cushnahan and we made a formal complaint to the Standards in Public Office Commission.</p></speech>

That is what is here.  It does not make for trust.  Second, I have Mr. Stewart's accurate record - what seems to be accurate.  I take that back.  It seems to be in line with what PIMCO tells us.  Mr .Stewart's note specifically is in line with what PIMCO tells us in relation to its concerns and how the matter arose.  This record is a slightly different narrative so I am going to park that until Mr. Stewart clarifies that for me and gives me his handwritten notes for each one.</p></speech>

PIMCO signed a non-disclosure agreement in October 2013.  That non-disclosure agreement required it to ensure all of its professional advisers who included legal advisers observed the exact same confidentiality obligations.  Therefore, the onus was on PIMCO to ensure Brown Rudnick, as its adviser, preserved and kept the confidentiality of information or materials, as defined in the non-disclosure agreement, in line with the obligations on PIMCO to do so.  It is a mirroring obligation.  To answer the Deputy's question, Brown Rudnick did not specifically sign a non-disclosure agreement, but PIMCO's non-disclosure agreement was the one on which we would have relied to ensure its advisers kept the information confidential.</p></speech>

That was in late 2013, at which point PIMCO had signed a non-disclosure agreement which included, as I explained, the obligations on their professional advisers which included Brown Rudnick.  When it came to the point where PIMCO had withdrawn from the process - we are talking about the period around 14 March - the point in time when it notified Lazard of its withdrawal, Lazard was asked to ensure all of the documentation, including the informational materials, was destroyed or otherwise dealt with in accordance with the terms of the non-disclosure agreement.  That, equally, extended to all of its professional advisers under the terms of the non-disclosure agreement.  There was an obligation on PIMCO at that point to ensure both it and its professional advisers destroyed or returned the information or materials, primarily the content in the data room.  That is the sequence of events involved.</p> <p>  When Cerberus retained Brown Rudnick, the point to which the Deputy has come, and we were notified on 3 April of its intention to retain it as a strategic adviser, the requirement on it was that it notify us of who its adviser was.  Because it had largely closed at that stage because the bids were in from 1 April Brown Rudnick would not have had a necessity to access the data room and, therefore, the informational materials in its capacity as an adviser to Cerberus.</p></speech>

In that response it identified the three technical breaches, into which I can go if the Deputy wishes.  It explained who its adviser was and apologised for the breaches and expressed its view that they were not material.  I have since written to it to say it did not answer the question I had asked about all breaches, actual and potential, of the non-disclosure agreement and that it dentified the technical breaches only.  I asked the additional question as to what information Brown Rudnick had produced to it because I wanted to gain an understanding of what it was in order to understand if there had been a breach of the PIMCO non-disclosure agreement.  That was the reason I was asking the question.  It is important for me to understand the answer to the question also.</p></speech>

I think this has been outlined by the Chairman.  Mr. Long can say what he wants to say.  Both he and Lazard were aware that PIMCO was involved in in discussions with us in the autumn of 2013.  There is no dispute about this.  The issue that has arisen, as I understand it, is with PIMCO's letter.  I do not have the transcript in front of me, but I am trying to surmise the issue was PIMCO stating in the letter that it had been engaged a year earlier.  That is something of which we and Lazard were not aware.</p></speech>

The session began with statements focusing on the processes, the commercial decisions and probable losses.  Deputy Mary Lou McDonald referred to the differences between the versions of events offered by Martin McGuinness and Peter Robinson.  She credited Martin McGuinness for coming here, unlike Mr. Robinson.  There are differences between the version of PIMCO and what we have heard from NAMA today but I acknowledge that NAMA representatives have come here twice, whereas PIMCO has refused to do so.</p> <p>  On the PIMCO withdrawal, I note the difference between the words used by both sides.  In its letter of 8 November PIMCO stated that it was never asked to withdraw but NAMA said it had asked PIMCO to "reflect".  This is a bit like a Minister who finds himself in a bit of bother and takes time to reflect, which means he is being asked to fall on his sword before the Taoiseach wields it.  Was that what was being implied when NAMA asked PIMCO to reflect?</p></speech>

Once the red flag was raised about Mr. Cushnahan and the alleged fee, that was it.  It was not unreasonable to give PIMCO a chance to reflect, as the Deputy puts it.  We gave our executive a message to go back to PIMCO and say this was a very serious issue for us and this is what happened.  It is covered in the transcripts of the records, in particular record No. 2.  PIMCO did fall on its sword and it is my absolute belief that it did this because it had no alternative.  PIMCO knew that we would not allow it to stay in the process.</p></speech>

At this point, Ronnie Hanna asked whether PIMCO had considered other options and when Tom Rice asked to which options he was referring, Ronnie Hanna asked if it could be shaped differently for the arrangement fee to come out.  Why was that asked, given that NAMA had been categorical on the subject earlier?</p></speech>

The reference to the query from Ronnie Hanna about other options has to be read in conjunction with the question PIMCO raised in the call on 10 March, during which Tom Rice said if it was an issue for NAMA, PIMCO would have concerns with continuing to deal with the three counterparties and that he would have to consider whether the business could proceed without the counterparties involved.  To me and the board, it seemed that PIMCO was anxious to stay in the process and as it had done a lot of preparation and due diligence, who could blame it?</p></speech>

I presume they meant throwing out the three advisers, Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Cushnahan.  On 11 March, Ronnie Hanna sought to close that off in a phone call.  There was never any doubt in the board's mind that PIMCO could not continue in this.  It probably suited both us and PIMCO, in the end, that there was a graceful withdrawal.</p></speech>

Does that statement in itself not call into question this whole process?  Does it mean there are no other questions to be asked at all on the process?  Does it not oversimplify what is at play?  Ten minutes ago, you stated that you acknowledged there were technical breaches which you were examining with Cerberus.  The Comptroller and Auditor General raised the processes, not just the discount rate, but NAMA is stating with one line that the position of the report is not sustainable.</p></speech>

The carrying value of the portfolio was &pound;1.49 billion.  The board of NAMA believed that we could get &pound;1.49 billion but, if we offered it to the market, the minimum we would accept was &pound;1.3 billion.  One can get to this by a number of different mechanisms but the board did not believe a 5.5% discount rate was the appropriate mechanism.  Instead, it believed a 10% discount rate was appropriate.  This is a technical approach.  There are going to be losses - it is just a question of when.</p></speech>

Accounting rules and international financial reporting standards mean we could not have impaired at a higher discount rate.  Did we believe that, by discounting cash flows by 5.5% into the future, we would get &pound;1.49 billion eventually?  The board did not believe that.  Under the accounting rules, we could not have written down the portfolio at the end of 2013 more than we did.</p><p>Did we believe we would take losses in the future?  Yes, we did.  If we had not, we would never have set the minimum price of &euro;1.3 billion.</p></speech>

We thought they were worth approximately &pound;900 but PIMCO came back with an indicative value of some &pound;950 million.  That is like a person saying they will buy a car from someone at &euro;5,000 but not committing to do so.  Once they get an NCT or a check-up from a mechanic, they might offer &euro;4,500.  The first offer is an indicative offer and it is only once a person makes a binding bid, as Cerberus did in April 2014, that one gets a commitment that they will pay what one wants for a portfolio.</p></speech>

It regards Project Eagle NDA and is for the attention of Mr. Alan Stewart.  It reads as follows:</p><blockquote>Dear Mr. Stewart:<br /><br />I am writing to follow up on my telephone conversation with Mr. McDonagh and Mr. Whelan on November 18, 2016 concerning the agreement entered into with NAMA on February 11, 2014 (the &quot;<b>NDA</b>&quot;) in response to your letter of the same date.<br /><br />Please allow me to repeat my apology for not bringing this matter to NAMA's attention sooner.  While I do not offer it as an excuse, I was focused on preparation for the meeting with the Public Accounts Committee (the &quot;<b>Committee</b>&quot;).  I intended no discourtesy to you and your colleagues.<br /><br />As you are aware, I attended a meeting of the Committee on November 17, 2016 as a representative of Cerberus Capital Management L.P. and certain of its affiliates (&quot;<b>Cerberus</b>&quot;).  Cerberus was invited to assist the Committee in its examination of the Special Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General with respect to a number of matters.  Some of those matters related to events in relation to which I had direct contemporaneous knowledge, whereas for others, I did not.<br /><br />In advance of attending a meeting of the Committee I reviewed some contemporaneous documents dating from 2014, including emails that were not copied to me in 2014.  As part of that process I became aware that some information had been disclosed by Cerberus to Brown Rudnick LLP (&quot;<b>Brown Rudnick</b>&quot;) in March 2014.<br /><br />Cerberus engaged Brown Rudnick to provide legal and strategic services in connection with Cerberus' proposed acquisition of the Project Eagle portfolio.  Cerberus was first approached by Brown Rudnick on March 14, 2014 and professional interactions began from that date.  The engagement was formally documented on March 24, 2014.  As solicitors permitted to practice in England and Wales Brown Rudnick are obliged by the Solicitors Regulation Authority's code of conduct to treat information received from clients or prospective clients as confidential.  This professional and legal obligation was acknowledged and other related representations and warranties were made both in our discussions with Brown Rudnick and in Cerberus' formal engagement letter with Brown Rudnick.</blockquote></speech>

I will continue:</p><blockquote>Specifically, I became aware, during my recent preparation of the following information having been disclosed to Brown Rudnick [these are the technical breaches]:<br /><br />-  On March 21, 2014 Cerberus told Brown Rudnick the adjusted reserve price that had been communicated to Cerberus by Lazard.<br /><br />-  On March 25 2014 Cerberus shared with Brown Rudnick a letter received from Lazard earlier that day (which I note was substantially similar to an earlier letter received on February 14, the equivalent version of which I assume Brown Rudnick would have seen during their time working for PIMCO).  I believe this correspondence, and that of March 21, was shared by Brown Rudnick with Tughans.  Tughans owed confidentiality obligations to Brown Rudnick. <br /><br />-  On March 27 2014 Cerberus told Brown Rudnick that Cerberus' request for an extension of the bid deadline (to 1 pm on April 1, 2014) had been granted.<br /><br />My responses to your queries are based upon the information of which I am aware concerning the NDA as of the date of this letter.  The preparation of our bid involved over 100 Cerberus personnel and advisory personnel.  Consequently, I have not conducted a full review of Cerberus' records nor have I interviewed all of our personnel, or those of our advisors.  I have included information concerning Cerberus' affiliates and advisers in the Appendix to this letter.<br /><br />Although regrettable, the disclosure of this procedural information was not material in the context in which it occurred.  I accept that the three instances listed above may contain some information that may not have been previously known to Brown Rudnick and which may therefore be deemed to be &quot;Informational Materials&quot; as defined in the NDA.  I do not believe that the information sharing had any impact on the integrity of the Project Eagle sale process.  Brown Rudnick (and Tughans) had no role in determining the purchase price Cerberus offered for the Project Eagle portfolio.  I can confirm that Cerberus' sharing of these three pieces of information did not impact on the amount of Cerberus' bid.  I also want to acknowledge that the inadvertent disclosure summarized in this letter was Cerberus' responsibility and was not the result of any failures by NAMA or inefficiencies in the Project Eagle process.<br /><br />Finally, I confirm that Cerberus does not object to NAMA providing a copy of this letter or the NDA to the Committee.<br /><br />Very truly yours<br /><br />Cerberus Capital Management, L.P.<br /><br />Mark A. Neporent<br /><br />Chief Operating Officer <br /><br />General Counsel</blockquote></speech>

Once the portfolio transferred to it, the money went into its bank account rather than ours.  There is a provision to deal with it in the loan sale agreement.  It is called a wrong pocket clause.  If money goes into a wrong pocket, it is supposed to come back.  Cerberus indicated to us that it had a counterclaim against us for &euro;20 million because it claimed we had sold it things which did not exist.  That was part of its post-acquisitions due diligence process.  It now claims that it is counterclaiming &euro;2.5 million against us and that it will give us the difference of &euro;300,000.  We have not accepted this.  In fact, we have not spent a long time looking at it other than the fact that it has made this offer because we have been dealing with questions from the committee and preparing for them.  Once we get a chance, we will sit down and figure out what is involved.  It will always be a process of negotiation between the two sides, between claims and counterclaims, but that is not unusual in a transaction of this size.  While it is important, it is not the biggest issue.</p></speech>

When one is selling a portfolio of 900 assets, there will always be something.  For example, when one changes a bank account from AIB to Bank of Ireland, a direct debit will fail because it was not set up on time or the proceeds were paid into a different bank account.  We will resolve the issue and I am satisfied that we will.  It is just a question of fine-tuning the negotiations on it.</p></speech>

The document, from around the time of completion of the sale, states: &ldquo;Based on preliminary calculations, it is anticipated that the loss generated on the loan sale may be up to &pound;160 million&rdquo;.  That is a figure NAMA recorded at its audit committee and would have been relevant because it was when there was a big discussion of how much one should provide in the 2013 accounts versus the 2014 accounts.</p><p>In his opening statement on Thursday, 9 July 2015 Mr. McDonagh stated:</p><blockquote>In overall cash terms, taking into account disposal proceeds, non-disposal income, advances and the proceeds of the loan sale, the net cash loss to NAMA, in layman's terms, on the Northern Ireland [debtor] portfolio was about &euro;280 million.</blockquote> <p>Around the time of the sale the figure was &pound;160 million.  With the passage of time and after looking at the figures, a year after the event, Mr. McDonagh presented a figure of &euro;280 million to the committee.  In September 2016 the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, in paragraph 3.86, referred to the famous issue of &pound;190 million being a &ldquo;significant probable loss of value to the State&rdquo;.  On 29 September 2016, in his opening statement to the committee, the Comptroller and Auditor General stated:</p><blockquote>NAMA recorded a loss of &pound;162 million in 2014 as a result of sales relating to its Northern Ireland debtors.  Most of this related to Project Eagle.  Losses of &pound;478 million on the Northern Ireland loans had already been recognised in earlier years, reflecting deterioration in market conditions since November 2009.  That was the market value reference point used by NAMA when it bought all its loans.</blockquote> <p>The Comptroller and Auditor General referred to the loss of &pound;162 million in 2014 when the sale was completed.  Previous losses had been recorded by way of an impairment figure of &pound;478 million.  This adds up to &pound;640 million.  In his opening statement today Mr. McDonagh said:</p><blockquote>We note that if the timing of the Eagle sale had been six or 12 months later, additional impairment would have been recognised and I have little doubt that the cumulative impairment at that point would have been close to the &pound;640 million total impairment that we ultimately took on this portfolio.</blockquote> <p>That is exactly the figure the Comptroller and Auditor General had quoted here a month earlier.  That is the cumulative loss from the time NAMA bought it to the time it disposed of it.  Is Mr. McDonagh happy with all of these figures?</p></speech>

That is all I want to say about it.  There is so much confusion about figures, but there is agreement on that figure anyway.  That is a statement of fact that the committee can put to bed at this stage.</p> <p>  The next issue I want to mention is the issue of the discount.  I will not dwell on this too much because I mentioned it a little earlier in the meeting.  On page 5 of his written statement today, Mr. McDonagh mentions the "alternative [net present values] scenarios ... generated [by] using alternative discount rates".  Mr. McDonagh has not been able to demonstrate that, although he said he did discuss it.  I also want to refer to the opening statement of Mr. John Collison, head of residential delivery in NAMA, who appeared before the committee on 25 October.  On page 9 of his written statement, he stated: "The fair value methodology for the 2012 accounts agreed [by] the C&amp;AG was based on a discount rate of 10% and, had this fair value discount rate been applied to the Eagle portfolio, the NPV [net present value] would have been &pound;1,365m."</p> <p>  Here we have Mr. Collison telling us just a month ago or so that, had the 10% discount been applied, it would have given that figure.  That implies to me that it was not applied.  If it had been applied, I would have expected his opening statement to have read that the 10% discount was applied, resulting in a particular figure.  However, his opening statement is qualified in that regard and I imagine these statements were carefully written.  Rather than specifically stating that the 10% discount was applied, he uses the phrase "had [it] been applied".  Does Mr. McDonagh get the point?</p></speech>

Part of our coming to the end of the process of these public hearings is perhaps to draw some of those issues together.</p> <p>  I now want to refer to page 111 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  I will lay out the scenario as I see it and will ask Mr. McDonagh to convince me otherwise.  I have not made up my mind yet, but this jumps out at me.  We are dealing with page 111, which contains the NAMA board minutes of 8 January 2014.  Towards the end of the third paragraph, they state: "As agreed at [the] 12th December 2013 meeting the Board noted it would not consider the sale of Project Eagle portfolio of loans for a consideration [of] less than STG&pound;1.3 billion."  Mr. McDonagh accepts that.  Those are the minutes.  We will not argue.  That is a definite recording.</p> <p>  However, I have to ask myself where this figure of &pound;1.3 billion came from.  Mr. McDonagh has said that he has not been able to demonstrate it based on his figures.  The only thing that has been demonstrated to me is that PIMCO came to NAMA with a bid of up to &pound;1.3 billion in December or thereabouts.  It was towards the end of the year.  The only people to put a figure of &pound;1.3 billion on the table were PIMCO.  It offered up the &pound;1.3 billion and that became NAMA's price.  It is hard to believe there is a coincidence there.</p> <p>  I want to move on to the PIMCO offer.  The PIMCO offer had a number of what I would call restrictions.  I am pulling them from the notes prepared for the board.  The board stipulated that it would be cash only.  That is significant.  According to page 82 of the report, Lazard also referred to these restrictions when it was making its recommendations to NAMA.  At paragraph 4.61 of the report, it is stated that Lazard, in a letter dated 2 April, after the conclusion of the bids, noted that "[t]he process involved a limited number of highly qualified bidders".  That is a restriction.  There was a limited number of bidders.  It went on to note that there was "limited due diligence information".  That is a second restriction.  There was "a single round of bidding".  That was a further restriction.  "[T]he requirement for bidders to acquire the portfolio 'entirely [for] cash'" was another significant restriction.  There was a tight timeline as well, although it is not mentioned in that particular paragraph.  I also think that in one of the recommendations - in the information of the board meeting - NAMA said that there should be restrictions on the number of advisers appointed by the purchaser.  That was probably for confidentiality reasons.</p> <p>  When NAMA came to put out its proposal to tender, lo and behold, everything it had laid out - confidentiality, cash upfront, limited due diligence, time restrictions and the price of &pound;1.3 billion - appears to have been mirrored exactly in what went out.  I have to say that it looks to me - Mr. McDonagh might convince me otherwise - that NAMA's tender document was, possibly, based on what PIMCO gave it.  This whole thing about 10%, 5% and 11.7% is all well and good, but the figure of &pound;1.3 billion came from the PIMCO document.  That is the only place I have seen that figure.  Will Mr. McDonagh address that point?</p> <p>  My next question leads on and I will deal with all of this particular issue on PIMCO.  In respect of the last sentence on page 132 of the report, one has to ask how PIMCO came up with the figure of &pound;1.3 billion.  I would be surprised if the board did not ask it when out of the blue it gets an inquiry and an indicative offer from PIMCO and it comes in with the figure of &pound;1.3 billion.  It is a mystery.  I do not think it is based on NAMA's internal discount rates of 10%.  PIMCO has come up with the figure of &pound;1.3 billion, which NAMA ran with from there on in and which was the ultimate final figure.  I will require explanation of the last sentence on page 132, because whoever was preparing the information for the board obviously had to understand where PIMCO was coming from.  The sentence reads: "PIMCO's analysis was conducted by way of reverse engineering NAMA's Balance Sheet and cross-referencing the publicly available information on NAMA's portfolio."  Therefore, there are two bases by which it came by the figure of &pound;1.3 billion.  Is "the publicly available information" newspaper articles about who the big debtors were, etc., or how was that established?  If it was publicly available information, did anyone ask at that stage if anyone on the Northern Ireland committee might have been aware and dealing with it and have already declared he or she was working with debtors to help put some of this information together?  I would have asked how it, out of the blue, came up with the figure.  I am asking Mr. McDonagh to explain it.</p> <p>  I have asked a couple of people how it was able to work out the bid based on reverse engineering NAMA's balance sheet.  It is a lovely, beautiful technical term to confuse us all, but I do not think NAMA issued a separate balance sheet for Northern Ireland.  The figures that are available or that NAMA normally gives us include Northern Ireland and the UK.  I do not know how someone could have used "reverse engineering" of NAMA's balance sheet to work out what was left in NAMA.</p> <p>  I will stop at this point now.  I want to take this further.  Can Mr. McDonagh understand our concerns as to where the whole bid structure came from?  It is very similar to what PIMCO approached NAMA with.  Did NAMA not ask how it come up with the figure, which NAMA ultimately went with?</p></speech>

Then we allowed PIMCO into the data room in the context of proof of concept from NAMA's point of view.  It had access to information on the top 55 assets which accounted for two thirds of the value of the portfolio.  It came back and said: "We will make a offer in the range of &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.3 billion."  It knew the names of the debtors having been in the limited information data room in November 2013.</p></speech>

The information was limited.  In the next data room we added a significant amount of extra information, including on the legal aspect.  People are more interested in the tightened security of a real data room, the subsequent data room from February 2014 onwards.  I hope that deals with the questions asked.  PIMCO made a offer in the range of &euro;1.1 billion to &euro;1.3 billion sterling.  We then move forward to the board meeting.  The Chairman states the only place he has seen the figure of &euro;1.3 billion sterling is in PIMCO's offer.  I said to him earlier that effectively the board paper presented by the executive had set out discount rates of 2.5% and 5.5% and the board's response was that these discount figures were not credible.  Effectively, if a buyer had assets, the discount rate should have been much higher, perhaps 10%.  The board challenged the executive by stating the value was probably closer to &euro;1.3 billion sterling; therefore, PIMCO was not 1 million miles from what the board thought the portfolio was worth.  That was the genesis.  I cannot tell the Chairman any more that.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly is chairman of the Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC, which has made it clear that the people who signed their declarations handed them to Mr. Daly in person.  We have not had sight of these declarations.  Today we received a letter from the NIAC quoting data protection legislation in proposing it not give them to us.  We have also received unredacted versions of the minutes which refer to the same debtors as a result of the same declaration made by Mr. Cushnahan at four or five meetings.  I put it to Mr. Daly that he knew precisely that Mr. Cushnahan was dealing with debtors.  We accept that no debtor specific information was discussed at the NIAC meetings, but Mr. Daly knew as a result of Mr. Cushnahan handing these documents to him over an extended period that he had debtor specific information.  Mr. Cushnahan must have been the only person in the entire NAMA organisation who had debtor specific information, not from his involvement in the board but from his involvement with the debtors.  That is why he signed the declarations.</p></speech>

A number of the board members, including Mr. Daly, would have been aware that an individual connected with NAMA, not by virtue of being connected with the NIAC, had debtor specific information.</p></speech>

There are two sets of declarations.  One needs to be clear that there are the annual declarations required under the Standards in Public Office Act, as well as the declarations made every year by each committee or board member.  They are produced to me.  The process is managed by the NTMA compliance unit and I review the declarations every year.  In that period of two or three years I would have been aware that Mr. Cushnahan had made declarations in respect of a number of debtors in Northern Ireland.  I did not do what the Comptroller and Auditor General did - add up the four or five or five or six debtors.</p></speech>

I was aware of this and, as far as I was concerned, the really important thing was that I was aware of it and should ensure, as chairman of the NIAC, that there would never be a discussion even remotely related to any of these debtors.  As well as or supplementary to this, at the beginning of every meeting each member of a board or a committee is required to make an oral declaration of any conflict of interest in relation to anything that might be on the agenda.  He made several such declarations and we have indicated them for the committee.</p><p>They were never relevant, actually, to anything discussed at any of those meetings.

He did.  I think there are a lot of people in Northern Ireland who had general knowledge of people who were in NAMA.  It was known pretty well around Northern Ireland.  We referred before here, I think, to the fact that it was a village and a lot of people knew other people's business.  He was not dealing, by the way, with the debtors as I understood it in relation to NAMA debt.  Most of these had other debt as well with other banks, with other institutions.</p></speech>

So if I take all of that from PIMCO at face value.  The issue I have with PIMCO is that it did not tell us.  Yes, it is an allegation that he was involved in this, which was wrong and which I believe was absolutely in breach of his responsibilities towards the Northern Ireland committee and NAMA.

Even Brown Rudnick was quite obviously, again from PIMCO's letter, kind of instrumental in putting this together.  That is not news.  We know that, it is referred to in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  I am not going to give Mr. Cushnahan credit for it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.1385" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#YY02900"><p>I would not expect Mr. Daly to give him credit for it, but he can see there is an actual connection, strange as it is, between Mr. Cushnahan's initial involvement and the think being offered ultimately for sale.  I will move on from that.</p> <p>  Page 158 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report refers to the famous phone calls.  I will not get into these phone calls.  I want to pick out one aspect.  In the last sentence of the second paragraph referring to a call on 11 March it states, "At this point, it was also noted that one third of the fee was in fact payable to a named individual at Tughans".  Page 118 contains an extract from NAMA's board minutes of 13 March, two days later.  We have looked at this before, but I am picking out a particular aspect.  It refers to "a potential payment of &pound;16 million split equally three ways between Brown Rudnick Solicitors (London), Managing Partner, Tughans Solicitors (Belfast) and Frank Cushnahan".  Here are two references to NAMA knowing the money was not due for Tughans, it was due, according to the phone call, to a named individual and the NAMA minutes recorded that it was specifically to the managing partner.  Is that correct?  Therefore, NAMA was aware that two thirds of the payments were to actual individuals.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.1387" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016112400002#YY03100"><p>Therefore, NAMA was aware that it was an individual.</p><p>While it might not be easy to bring this up on the screen, among the documents NAMA sent to us was a letter dated 23 July 2015 from Mr. Daly to Martin McGuinness in his constituency office in Cookstown, County Tyrone.  It is part of a bundle of documents NAMA submitted to us.  I will read the paragraph which I find a bit unusual.  Obviously, Mr. McGuinness wrote to Mr. Daly concerned about all the things that emerged in 2015 and the revelations.  Mr. Daly wrote back to Mr. McGuinness as follows:</p><blockquote>It subsequently emerged only very recently, [this was July 2015] that a former partner of a Belfast law firm, Tughans, had, according to that firm, &quot;diverted to an account of which he was the sole beneficiary, professional fees due to the firm without the knowledge of the partners&quot;.  According to Tughans, the diverted fees relate to its professional work on the buyer side, not the seller side, of the NAMA loan sale.  NAMA could not have been aware of this matter and the disclosure has no relevance to the competitive sales process run on behalf of NAMA.  As you point out in your correspondence, the Tughans matter is subject to investigation by the police in Northern Ireland.  It would be entirely wrong, as some parties have sought to do, to conflate NAMA's process with the unrelated Tughans issue.</blockquote> <p>So NAMA was very much on notice that the first fixer's fee, as it is being called, was to the managing partner, the named person.  Then when NAMA got the letter from Cerberus it was informed that there was a payment again, to two parties on this occasion, Brown Rudnick and Tughans.</p></speech>

I recall it as three.  No matter.  When we spoke previously, Mr. Daly was aware that Mr. Cushnahan had had an office in Tughans.  Indeed, the correspondence from NAMA to Mr. Cushnahan went to an e-mail address in Tughans.  Does Mr. Daly remember how we went through all of this?  There is evidence that Mr. Cushnahan held what we termed as clinics for NAMA-related matters in that office in Tughans.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly has consistently said that.  Nonetheless, NAMA was well aware of the particular dynamic.  When all of these issues are bundled together, the implausibility is astonishing.  The PIMCO scenario arose, NAMA knew that Brown Rudnick was the mover and shaker in shaping the deal, and NAMA also knew that Mr. Cushnahan had a relationship with Tughans.  I do not know whether NAMA is spectacularly bad at joining dots.  I would find that difficult to believe, particularly in Mr. Daly's case.  In fairness, he would hear the grass growing.</p> <p>  It is astonishing that NAMA could have been so blind.  Mr. Daly is sticking to the line that NAMA was not told of Mr. Cushnahan's involvement as far back as April 2013.  It is a matter of record that NAMA's minutes refute that.  Never mind me refuting it - the minutes of the NAMA board refute it.  Even if NAMA had not been told directly, the fact that it would not probe the information, put two and two together and ask the relevant questions is mind boggling.</p> <p>  According to Mr. Daly, the ordinary person on the street believes that NAMA messed up and should have held on to the properties, worked them out, etc.  That is not what people on the streets are saying, though.

Where I have a difference with the witness, and where the minutes differ with him, is that he says on 10 March he discovered this guy, Mr. Cushnahan, is being lined up for a big payment.  That is true, and we agree on that.  However, I put it to the witness that the minutes reflect that he was told something else as well.  According to the minutes, not alone was Mr. Cushnahan lined up for this fee at some point in the future, but at a time when he was a member of NAMA's Northern committee, he was involved with Brown Rudnick and Tughans in conceiving of and negotiating a fee for himself at that point.  I accept Mr. Daly discovered that in March, but he discovered information on malpractice or whatever one might call it in respect of him that had occurred a year before.</p></speech>

They give a sequence of events, the context to the issue and a record of decisions taken and issues noted.

The minutes read: "As discussed via the conference call between NAMA's Head of Legal and PIMCO's Legal Counsel on 13th March 2014."  Again, this is all still in the context of the success fee.  Moving on, the minutes read: "In the interest of full transparency, PIMCO disclosed that the success fee arrangement had involved a potential payment of &pound;16 million split equally three ways between Brown Rudnick Solicitors, Tughans Solicitors and Frank Cushnahan."</p> <p>This again is about the success fee and it being split three ways.

The minutes do not say a new set of negotiations or a different set of negotiations.  The earlier point states: "in relation to Project Eagle negotiated by PIMCO's commercial team."  It is still all in the context of the success fee.  Is it fair to state that the board noted that PIMCO had advised that the negotiations in relation to success fee had commenced in April 2013?</p></speech>

We have followed the logic through, where that is correct.  We then moved into the part where the minutes talk about the need for full transparency. That is what PIMCO said.  It disclosed the success fee arrangement and it was very clear it was a three way split between Brown Rudnick solicitors, Tughans and Frank Cushnahan.  Then the minutes talk about the negotiations, which was referenced earlier, and the board noted that PIMCO had advised that the negotiations had commenced in April 2013.  The minutes did not stop there and went on to read: "and noted further that Frank Cushnahan had not resigned as a member of the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee until 7th November 2013 nor had he made any disclosure of his involvement."  Again, it is very logical that this was in reference to the breakdown of the success fee between Brown Rudnick, Frank Cushnahan and Tughans, otherwise NAMA would not have mentioned Frank Cushnahan.</p></speech>

The point is that Frank Cushnahan did not resign until 7 November 2013.  We had no idea that Frank Cushnahan was in any way involved other than what PIMCO had told us on 10 March.</p></speech>

That is all I am doing.  The logic of the minutes is that PIMCO legal informed NAMA of the existence of a success fee, that it was negotiated by PIMCO's commercial team and that PIMCO disclosed that it was a three way breakdown between Frank Cushnahan, Tughans and Brown Rudnick.  The minutes talked earlier about the negotiation and mentioned it again, that it commenced in April 2013 and added a further note that Frank Cushnahan's involvement was problematic because he was a member of the NIAC.  If NAMA had not known that he was involved prior to his departure from the board of the NIAC, why would that have had any relevance?</p></speech>

What it says, in fact, is that in June 2013, PIMCO was approached by Brown Rudnick with a request for a proposed success fee.</p></speech>

The board's view, which was my view, was that Mr. Cushnahan resigned from the Northern Ireland committee in November 2013 and then immediately proceeded to get involved in this deal with Brown Rudnick.</p></speech>

If that was the view of the board, it would not have put that in there.</p></speech>

He was also aware of the previous association of Mr. Cushnahan with six debtors.  He then said he formed an opinion that his relationship started with Tughans and Brown Rudnick after he was a member of the NIAC.  The very first thing I would have said if I was on the board is that Mr. Cushnahan was a member of the NIAC so we need to check with PIMCO, Brown Rudnick and Tughans to see if there was any involvement when he was a member of the board.  Was that ever done?</p></speech>

It is important from my point of view to be able to say this to the Deputy.  The reality was PIMCO's legal team was saying back in March 2014 that it had only come across this.  Its commercial team had negotiated it and its legal team was still finding out facts about this whole situation.  The understanding we had was that Mr. Cushnahan was not involved while he was a member of NIAC.  It was subsequent to him being a member of NIAC that he got involved.</p></speech>

He had an association with debtors.  Mr. McDonagh then says he formed a view that any association with Brown Rudnick and Tughans was when he left.  The concern would have been that surely there was a possibility that he had an association prior to that.  That would have been the most obvious question to ask and yet the board of NAMA did not even ask PIMCO.  The reason why I believe it did not ask PIMCO is because it already knew.</p> <p>  Can I go to page 116-----</p></speech>

Much of the criticism of the process by the Comptroller and Auditor was that there was a sharp deviation from standard sales practice.  There was a shift from a work out of the assets to a loan sales strategy and all of that happened because Mr. Cushnahan, Tuvi Keinan and Mr. Coulter conceived a business opportunity that they would financially benefit from and they brought that to three bidders, according to PIMCO, and it was one of them.</p></speech>

The decision on the sales process was taken by us following the approach by PIMCO and on due consideration of all sorts of other facts.  If I believe PIMCO or if the Deputy believes PIMCO then going back to this point about the minutes, the Deputy should also believe it when it says that success fees were not mentioned until June 2013 and not in April.</p></speech>

That is what I was trying to get at earlier.  In terms of the process, if that was the case and Mr. Daly accepts that, we have a situation where there was no Project Eagle.  There was a sales strategy, which was to work out the assets and we have Frank Cushnahan who is a member of the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee, NIAC.  We have an internal law firm, Brown Rudnick, and Tughans, a Belfast law firm,  and they were working together.  We know it started in April 2013, according to PIMCO, and they together were the genesis of the possibility of Project Eagle.  PIMCO then contacted politicians and then it approached NAMA, and then Project Eagle was born.</p></speech>

I cannot remember whether it was in a response to the Deputy or another member.  Compromising of the process would have been an issue if, at the end of the day, either in terms of setting the minimum price or in the process of the competitive bidding that we had, or in terms of the decision ultimately to accept the Cerberus bid, Mr. Cushnahan was in any way remotely involved in any of that process.  It is my absolute contention, and that of the board, that he was not.</p></speech>

We went through this earlier where the same board minute suggested that, subject to Lazard's advice because it would have been given the information about the success fees, it was minded to be as upfront as was possible with bidders.  We went through that earlier.  When Mr. Long was responding to this, he said the process was inappropriate because could he, Mr. Cushnahan, ever be totally separated from Tughans and Brown Rudnick?  We now know that Tughans and Brown Rudnick transferred over seamlessly to Cerberus.  Even Lazard is saying that it was inappropriate that he, Mr. Cushnahan, could ever be totally separated from Tughans and Brown Rudnick, which is also what the Comptroller and Auditor General says in his report.</p></speech>

What Mr. Long said was that the process was inappropriate as how could he, Mr. Cushnahan be disentangled from Tughans and Brown Rudnick.  That is the point, that he could not be disentangled from them.</p></speech>

At the end of the day, at that same session last Tuesday, he stood over the process and he stood over the outcome.  This is going back to an issue that was raised here in September where there was a question mark put over the comprehensiveness of Lazard's endorsement of the process.  I think he fully endorsed the process and he fully endorsed that it was the best outcome.</p></speech>

We know that PIMCO gave an account of a number of different events which Mr. Daly also disputes.  He also disputes the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  It seems there is some sort of conspiracy according to NAMA against it by the Comptroller and Auditor General, by PIMCO and by others who give a contrary view.</p></speech>

We have a difficulty with what PIMCO did not tell us rather than what they told us in their letter.  It is why they did not tell us at a particular time, which, to my mind, was a material issue that should have been disclosed to us if they were in the process of negotiation or a discussion with NAMA.</p></speech>

Cerberus has given evidence, as I understand it, that they never met Mr. Cushnahan, never saw him, never dealt with him.</p></speech>

PIMCO did not disclose this information to NAMA.  Had they disclosed this information to NAMA, this happened in April 2013.  Mr. Cushnahan was still a member of NIAC and he had an association with debtors.  Mr. Daly mentioned earlier that it is unbelievable to suggest that NAMA would not have acted.

Obviously, it would depend on the outcome of that conversation but, to my mind, if the Deputy wants my thinking on it right now as chairman and this would mirror my board colleagues, he would have been exited very quickly and any sensitivities about North-South relations would have been set aside.</p></speech>

We believe they should have told us during the 2013, as far back as April when they were first introduced to Mr. Cushnahan.

They are saying that despite the fact that there is a reference in the contemporaneous notes of the telephone call and the board minutes, which explicitly cites April and May 2013, this was somehow not an indication of PIMCO giving that information to NAMA.  In fact, they have gone as far as to say &ndash; this is significant &ndash; that PIMCO deliberately mislead and failed to provide information that it properly should have provided.</p></speech>

That is a very serious assertion to make in respect of PIMCO.  We need a response from PIMCO on that matter.  Similarly, we had to get a response from PIMCO on the question of whether PIMCO went or was pushed in respect of its exit.  There was a time when Mr. Daly was absolutely resolute, to the point of almost being obnoxious, in his assertion that NAMA kicked PIMCO out.  PIMCO contested that strongly.  I notice that Mr. Daly has modified that language.  It now appears to have been a gracious mutually beneficial exit.</p> <p>  I think we need to ask PIMCO to give us its perspective.  Certainly, I am clear, as a member of the committee and as a person who is reasonably good at reading the English language, about what the NAMA board minutes say.</p></speech>

I want to know why PIMCO did not disclose those facts because they were material to conflict of interest issues regarding somebody who was, at that time, a member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee.  If we had known, we would definitely have taken very strong action.  PIMCO's letter to the committee is also inaccurate, and I said it is materially inaccurate, because it states PIMCO provided details of these matters to NAMA in a series of calls in March 2014.

I have no doubt dozens and dozens of people worked to the best of their capacity and in absolute good faith and then bang, they were in the middle of this.  What did Ms O'Reilly ask, or what did she seek to know, from Mr. Rice in respect of all of this?  He told her he would have expected that Frank Cushnahan told NAMA what was going on.  I am assuming Ms O'Reilly agreed with this.  What queries did she make of Mr. Rice in terms of establishing information for herself?  I ask Ms O'Reilly to remind the committee of her position.

The question I asked in that context was whether the specific question was asked at that point because Ms O'Reilly says a question was asked.  We do not know whether he was asked if he had an association with Brown Rudnick, Tughans and PIMCO when he was a member of the board.  We also do not know the answer because there is no reference to any date in the same minutes, apart from April 2013, which is in the board minutes.

Anyway, the reference Ms O'Reilly refers to is record 3, where Ronnie Hanna asks when PIMCO became aware of the issue to which Mr. Rice replies that the Project Eagle process had been with NAMA for several months and he references April-May 2013.  It is not very elegantly recorded but that is the date, the reference point, and we have had a long discussion on that.</p> <p>  I want to move on to the conversation Ms O'Reilly was involved in.  If she goes down to the point where Mr. Rice states: "... they had not notified the decision to their advisors that brought the deal and were still working that through."  This is the part I want to examine with Ms O'Reilly, in her capacity as the senior legal officer in NAMA.  She states: "... for our part, there were no reporting obligations for NAMA in regard to its advisors and no need to take positive action."  I want Ms O'Reilly to explain what she was saying in that conversation.</p></speech>

In terms of the context of that discussion, Tom Rice was talking about how PIMCO would essentially notify its advisers, and its advisers were Brown Rudnick.  Tom Rice, and I suspect with others in PIMCO, was figuring out what, how and when they would inform Brown Rudnick of this.  I think he was quite keen that whatever message PIMCO would give to its advisers, there would be a co-ordinated message from ourselves.</p></speech>

I can only take from this that Ms O'Reilly, as the person in charge and to keep everything on the straight and narrow, did not ask direct questions in respect of Mr. Cushnahan and the point at which he first gets involved or has an association or an arrangement with PIMCO.  Ms O'Reilly has given reasons for that.  Be that as it may, she did not ask the question.  She is aware, in this context, of the quantum of the fees in question, which were big bucks.  That raises many other questions.  I am struck by the fact that her sentiment, as recorded here, is that there is no reporting obligations to her advisers and no reference or consideration here around anything else.  It seems to be a view of home and hosed, PIMCO is out, problem solved and there is nothing to worry about here.  That may have been Ms O'Reilly's genuine view and position at the time.</p></speech>

For anybody who is looking at this and asking why we are obsessing over who knew what and what was known about this April 2013 issue, that cuts to the quick of it because if the board did know, there were clear-cut obligations that had to be met.  The concern I have, and that I believe others have, is that the transcript of the telephone calls, the testimony from PIMCO, indicates that in fact there was knowledge.  The dates are specific.  We are not going to agree on that but I want to explain that in case Mr. Daly is feeling a little hard done by in terms of the reason we have focused on that.</p> <p>  I want to ask Ms O'Reilly another question.</p></speech>

It was not just Ronnie Hanna who was there; Alan Stewart was there.  Aideen O'Reilly was in on some of them.  The more relevant ones are the earlier ones with Alan Stewart because it is a logic.  It is Tom Rice on 10 March.  PIMCO said, "if it was an issue for NAMA, Pimco would have concerns continuing to deal with the 3 counterparties and would have to consider whether 'the business' could proceed without the counterparties involved".  That was PIMCO on 10 March wondering, "Is there another way we can stay in this?  Can we deal with the issue around Cushnahan, Brown Rudnick and Tughans and still stay in this process?".  The head of asset recovery on 11 March was just closing off that question.  It was an open question and he was closing it off.  Mr. Stewart was in on those calls.  If he wants to add anything, I would be quite happy-----</p></speech>

My reading of it is PIMCO saying, "We have a big problem here and we are letting you know we have a big problem.  We are not sure that this can proceed.  Can 'the business' go ahead with the three parties out of the loop?"  Mr. Daly used the term "thinking out loud" earlier.

Ronnie Hanna was closing an open question that was left there and put on the table in the first place by PIMCO.  Remember, in the first phone call PIMCO came to us asking whether we knew about it.  That was their opening question and then, if we did not, they asked whether we had a problem with it, which was a surprising question from people who, as the Deputy says, were the experts.</p></speech>

I have never suggested that PIMCO suggested to us, or would suggest to us, that we should look the other way and we certainly would never have considered looking the other way.  If the Deputy goes back to the first phone call on 10 March, Tom Rice asked if NAMA was aware of Mr. Cushnahan potentially being a beneficiary.  Ronnie Hanna confirmed that NAMA was not aware of this, that it would have to be considered and that NAMA would take it away and consider it.  Tom Rice said he was bringing it to our attention in the interests of transparency.  Then we go on to ask how PIMCO became aware of this etc.  Ronnie Hanna asked if what had been outlined was an issue for NAMA and whether NAMA would proceed with its work on the proposed transaction.  Tom Rice said they would certainly not proceed with their legal due diligence until the position had been clarified.</p></speech>

In the letter they wrote to us, they believe that Mr. Daly's colleague, Mr. Stewart, during his last appearance before the committee, more accurately reflected what happened.

As such, I am now reading to the committee the letter dated 18 November 2016 from Mr. Ronnie Hanna to Mr. Lenihan, the clerk of the Committee of Public Accounts, Leinster House, Dublin 2:</p><blockquote><b>Re C&amp;amp;AG's Special Report No. 94 - National Asset Management Agency Sale of Project Eagle</b><br /><br />I acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 14<sup>th</sup>November which arrived at my home on 17<sup>th</sup>inst.<br /><br />I regret that I have to decline the invitation to attend for two reasons:<br /><br />1. I remain under a statutory duty of confidentiality arising from my former employment with NAMA.  I have not received any communication from that organisation that I am at liberty to divulge details of any activities in which I was engaged while in their employ.<br /><br />2. A more fundamental reason for declining the invitation is that I was arrested on allegations of bribery, misconduct in public office and conspiracy to defraud.  I vehemently denied all of those allegations.  I was subjected to an interview under caution under the Police and Criminal Evidence Order.<br /><br />While I was initially released on police bail, that has now been removed although I have not yet received any indication from the NCA/PSNI or the Public Prosecution Service that I am no longer a suspect.<br /><br />Until such time as I have been informed that I am no longer a suspect and therefore, remain under caution, I cannot make any statement about the activities under consideration without the protections afforded by the above legislation.<br /><br />I regret that I am obliged to refuse and wish to assert that I mean no discourtesy to your Committee and the Oireachtas.<br /><br />Yours sincerely, <br /><br />RONNIE HANNA.</blockquote><p>It is fair that the whole transcript be read in and not partial quotes of the letter.</p></speech>

Lazard noted that in its professional advisory judgment, given NAMA's objectives, the process had been appropriate for the transactional nature of Project Eagle.  It said that, for Lazard, it involved a limited number of highly qualified bidders, limited due diligence information, a single round of bidding and the requirement for bidders to acquire the portfolio entirely in cash.  While four bidders had withdrawn from the process, in Lazard's view, which is the important thing, competitive tension remained in the process following those withdrawals.  I think there was debate about whether, in the overall sense, Lazard's letter was as comprehensive as it could have been.  I think that when Mr. Long was here on Tuesday, he put any doubts around that to bed.  I was not here on Tuesday.</p></speech>

Mr. Daly has chosen to say that today and he is entitled to, but Mr. Long also said that PIMCO had an advantage and NAMA chose not to take that on board.  He also said he should have been told.  That is what he said.  When he gave NAMA an assurance, it was a qualified assurance on the information given.  Does Mr. Daly accept that?  It is what the Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out in his report.  Does Mr. Daly accept that?  It is just "Yes" or "No".</p></speech>

He said it and NAMA does not accept it.  Earlier, I asked Mr. Collison about the interaction with Lazard and the bidders.  Perhaps he could clarify that for me.  I asked if he accepted that the understanding set out was understanding set out.  We will not quote it at this time of the evening, but Lazard came back to NAMA.  NAMA gave a verbal briefing and Lazard said "This is our understanding of it".  Mr. Collison is saying that is correct.</p></speech>

That contract order for services set out the scope of those services, which included identification of prospective bidders, which is what it did.  I mean, that was one of the main objectives and tasks we set them.  The actual letter to us at the end of the process is this letter of 25 June 2014.  I think the committee has it albeit there may be a restriction on its publication.  Lazard confirms that the process was structured in order to seek to achieve NAMA's objective and, specifically, Lazard, in consultation with NAMA, identified a select group of investors who were qualified in terms of financial resources, expertise, track record and so on to undertake a transaction of this nature.  Lazard did that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked me earlier about Lazard's pitch book.  The only change I can recall relates to that sort of consultation around the selection of bidders.  I recall specifically that there was one particular firm in - let us call it - the second tier, which I think was Oaktree, and it was elevated after that discussion between Lazard and NAMA to tier 1.  It was in the first group of bidders that was approached.  Cerberus I think was switched to tier 2.  As it turned out, obviously, both of those bidders were approached, but the main rationale for that at the time was that we had had a lot more visibility and interaction with Oaktree in terms of it bidding on other NAMA portfolios than we would have had with Cerberus.  In fact, at that point, we really did not have much engagement at all with Cerberus.  That was really the rationale behind that.</p></speech>

We are finished with the 5.5% versus 10% debate, in my opinion.  However, I stand open to correction.  We are also finished with the Comptroller and Auditor General's lack of experience or anything of that nature or the picking of figures out of the sky.  We are looking at his concerns in respect of the process.  There was a major shift in strategy to sell the portfolio in one go.  We have all accepted that, have we not?  That is a fact.

I think this was explained to the committee when the other directors were before it.  The full board was considering it and a risk committee is a committee of the board, that is, of all board members.  The risk assessment around this is taking the offer and the process and looking at the outcome, setting a minimum price and deciding that this is the best outcome for NAMA.</p></speech>

Honestly, I will not interrupt you.</p> <p>  All of that is in Mr. Daly's statement.  In Mr. McDonagh's statement, he argues about the 5.5% and the 10% all over again.  This is about the third time.  Really, the issues are as set out here.  They are basic issues, namely, interest and how NAMA handled it, the sales process, whether the process gave reassurance to the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and so on.  That is what is set out.  I asked Mr. Daly if NAMA risk assessed a major change of strategy and he said it was not formally done, that there was an opportunity and that NAMA took the opportunity.  Is that right?</p></speech>

I will not go into the detail of all the risks but they related to the granularity, the debtors, the Northern Ireland market, etc.  That is the key risk assessment: Were we getting a better result?  Should we take the &pound;1.3 billion in the hand in 2014 as opposed to the possibility of more or, more likely, less if we held onto it?</p></speech>

That is a fact.  That is set out.  That is a fact that has been set out by PIMCO.</p> <p>  Let me ask a few more specific questions.  I have a question about Cerberus for the legal team.  When it was communicated to NAMA that there was &euro;15 million - all of this has been set out and dealt with already - what did the legal team advise in respect of follow-up?  Perhaps Ms Aideen O'Reilly can answer.</p></speech>

That has been outlined previously.  It is outlined fairly in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  He takes NAMA's view and he outlines it.  My question to Ms O'Reilly and Mr. Stewart, as legal people, concerns the phone calls they had.  Mr. Stewart was present for all the phone calls, I think; Ms O'Reilly was present for some.  The phone call concerned a former committee member, not a director.  Ms O'Reilly has now referred to him as a director.  We are all getting confused.  He was a committee member in Northern Ireland who represented six debtors, which has already been pointed out, the debts of which represented 50% of the Project Eagle portfolio.  When Ms O'Reilly and Mr. Stewart heard that Mr. Cushnahan was to receive &pound;5 million or &pound;6 million, did alarm bells not go off in their heads?

My understanding is that, under the non-disclosure agreement, Cerberus would have been obliged to notify NAMA via Lazard, which managed that process, if Brown Rudnick wanted access to the data room.  The whole purpose of non-disclosure agreements is to protect the information of the vendor.  The confidential information of the vendor goes into the data room.  Because Brown Rudnick did not access the data room on behalf of Cerberus, there was no obligation under the NDA for Cerberus to notify us of its engagement of Brown Rudnick.</p></speech>

I will not repeat it.  On 3 April, did it not occur to her, as head of legal, to say to herself that NAMA discovered this within less than a month of the whole shock over PIMCO and the fees and that it was now 3 April?  One would be forgiven for thinking it was 1 April.  NAMA had just learned that Brown Rudnick went to Cerberus.  Again, did alarm bells not go off in the heads of Ms O'Reilly and Mr. Stewart?  Did they not say to themselves that there was something wrong?</p></speech>

The crux of this matter for NAMA was always Frank Cushnahan; it was never Brown Rudnick.</p></speech>

NAMA knew they have been with PIMCO prior to this and that the money was allegedly to go to a former member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee.  I asked Ms O'Reilly whether alarm bells went off in her head about the process or anything else.</p></speech>

What occurred was as follows.  A discussion, or probably several discussions, took place about this new development.  As I said, the crux of the matter for NAMA was the issue of Frank Cushnahan, the former committee member.  That is why I was instructed by the board to draft and seek a declaration from Cerberus that no current or former NAMA board member, committee member or executive was in receipt of any fee or remuneration of any description from Cerberus.</p></speech>

It seems to me that at the very least questions should have been asked of Cerberus, such as when it took these people on, what it was getting out of it, what was happening here, and what fee was being paid.  That is what I think.  The witnesses can comment on that and I will listen.</p></speech>

Was he getting a fee or anything from this now that Brown Rudnick was with Cerberus?  The decision to seek a declaration from Cerberus endorsed by a declaration from Tughans and Brown Rudnick was the focus of that morning.  That was something we decided we needed before the board made a formal decision to adopt Cerberus as the preferred bidder.  That was the big issue for us.</p></speech>

He sets out five specific points on page 95 about what NAMA should have done.  I imagine if the witnesses re-read them, they could not but agree with him.  They are the concerns about following up and potential conflict of interest.  I do not think the Chairman will let me go through all those but they are set out.  I have not heard the witnesses deal with all of those points.  They have continually and consistently said their concern was Cushnahan.  He was gone, that was the end of it.

Mr. McDonagh in particular goes through the financial stuff.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has clarified the issues he addressed.

It is a question of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  This is not an inquiry.  It is a report.

There is not that I am aware of, in law or anything else.  My understanding is it happens quite regularly in these situations.  In fact, Tughans was not the only one to move in this process.</p></speech>

That is correct.  In this situation PIMCO withdrew under a cloud.  There is a disagreement between NAMA and PIMCO as to the nature of that, although the record is quite clear, I think, that PIMCO sets out that it brought it to NAMA's attention.  There is a different context here of a solicitor moving on, from the bidder that withdraws under a cloud to the bidder who is successful.  It does not disclose it to NAMA.  The witnesses are not clear today that there was an onus the solicitor to disclose it to them.  Perhaps that can be checked out with the non-disclosure agreement which appears to be broader than the data room but we do not know because we have not seen it.  There is a difference.  I apologise to Mr. Stewart, I interrupted him.</p></speech>

There was an obligation on Cerberus to notify us and get our consent and to put in place an NDA and to provide us with a copy of it, with Brown Rudnick as strategic advisers, before there would be a release of informational materials to them.  It has said to us, for example, in the letter today, that by its analysis, and Mark Neporent was clear on this, it has identified three technical breaches, in other words three items that it considers fall within the definition of informational materials, that went to Brown Rudnick without its first having got our consent and an NDA put in place with Brown Rudnick.</p><p>That is really what he is saying in the letter today.

Prior to that call, we knew nothing about anything to do with Frank Cushnahan.  On 10 March and during two calls on 11 March, PIMCO made disclosures to us.  That was all we had to go on.  We were entirely reliant on what PIMCO told us.</p></speech>

There had to be a reason for that and the reason was either that NAMA asked for the information and was not given it or it did not ask for it.  I am trying to establish which one it was.</p></speech>

Ms O'Reilly has not given us a date.  We have asked a very specific question.  We want to know the date because Mr. Cushnahan was a member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee and we want to be very clear that there was no association when he was a member.  NAMA asked for the date and did not get it.  Surely it would go back again and say that it needed the date.  Was that done?</p></speech>

Deputy Cullinane can see that in the notes.  When we asked a question and they professed they wanted to be transparent about things, only tell us a certain amount and also tell us separately that they were still getting to grips with the facts, it was reasonable to conclude that they might not have established all the facts and that the people in PIMCO to whom we were speaking might not have known.</p></speech>

I am a NAMA board member.  I am made aware of a success fee arrangement that involves a member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee.  I do not know when that relationship started.  I would try to get that information.  Mr. Stewart says NAMA tried to get the information and did not get it.  At no point was that ever established, which I find incredible.  NAMA then went through a very painful and exhaustive process of working out with PIMCO how to deal with this success fee arrangement.  PIMCO then left.  It was a shocking revelation that this success fee arrangement was in place.  Deputy McDonald described it as a bombshell.  Lo and behold, Brown Rudnick and Tughans transferred to Cerberus.  This question is also for NAMA's legal department, so it is for Ms O'Reilly.  How in God's name did NAMA not tell Cerberus that there had been a success fee arrangement between PIMCO, Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Mr. Frank Cushnahan because it was looking for a letter of assurance that there was no association with anybody in NAMA?  How was that information not shared with Cerberus because it would have given it a context?  Frank Cushnahan's name was never mentioned to Cerberus.  It could not have categorically given NAMA that assurance because it was never asked.</p></speech>

It also goes back to what the Comptroller and Auditor General said in his final finding.  He said that NAMA was concerned about being legally OK but was not concerned with actually drilling down into it and making sure that Cerberus had access to the full information so that when it gave NAMA a letter of assurance, it was not doing it blind or with half the information or no information but full information.  NAMA did not do that.</p></speech>

In other words, when Cerberus says it notifies us of the three technical breaches, and a breach is a breach whether it is technical or non-technical, the biggest breach was it never told NAMA about the appointment of these people in the first place.  NAMA only heard that on 3 April.</p> <p>  In fact, there was one major breach.  They never told NAMA about them.  Now they are giving three additional breaches.</p></speech>

In case the message went out today there were only three technical breaches, the biggest breach was not telling NAMA about them in the first place.</p> <p>  I want to move on to the next paragraph.  I am sorry about this.  This will take a few minutes and it is in everybody's interest that we close off these points.</p><p>Paragraph 4.12 reads:</p><blockquote>NAMA would tell PIMCO about the process being undertaken by the loan sale advisor, and explain to them that [there could possibly be two other people brought into the process] <i>&ldquo;the intended approach regarding the other shortlisted investors noting that this would be as much to protect their interests with regard to integrity and credibility of the disposal process&rdquo;.</i></blockquote><p>NAMA is saying that it has a deal, there is &pound;1.3 billion on the table from PIMCO and there are many restrictions about cash up front, but the board decides to open up the process to provide a veneer of transparency.  NAMA tells PIMCO that two other people must be brought into the process and that it would be in PIMCO's interests to have someone else in the field.  That is how I read this.</p></speech>

PIMCO wanted a closed process.  It wanted to be the only bidder and for us to sell directly to it.  The board would not agree to that.  NAMA had a policy of opening a market wherever practicable.  The board said that we knew PIMCO only wanted a closed process, but that it was in everyone's interests that this be subject to a wider range of bidders.  PIMCO was not happy about that.</p></speech>

This refers to forgoing personal guarantees.  Obviously, being informed of this in advance would have had an impact on the price that the Irish public could achieve in the deal.

Had NAMA sold the loan book without these restrictions, it could have achieved more.  They must have had an impact on the price.  NAMA must demonstrate to us that it got value for money for the Irish taxpayer.  The restrictions impacted on the possible value that NAMA would have got.  Can NAMA demonstrate to us that it got value for the Irish taxpayer in this transaction?  How can it do that?</p></speech>

When Lazard appeared before the committee, it stated that it had identified a universe of bidders from its market knowledge, which is why we employed Lazard in the first place, that it believed would be qualified and be interested in the portfolio.  All of the bidders who could meet those criteria were invited into the process.  Lazard discounted others who tried to enter the process because it did not believe they were up to it.  Lazard dealt with this matter previously.</p> <p>  The point on limited due diligence information is not true because the data room expanded during the bid process.</p></speech>

If people knew the yield and income, they could have reversed it out.  They just had to employ a chartered surveyor.  They could have worked it out.  Chartered surveyors who work for Sherry FitzGerald, Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield, the bidders in-house, JLL or anyone else could have done that.  I do not accept that there was anything unusual in people being able to work out a close valuation.  When Mr. Mulcahy appeared before the committee as a former board member of NAMA with 40 years of experience in this business, he said that this could be done if someone wanted to.</p></speech>

People who signed up to the process knew that they were signing up to a single round of bidding.  A condensed process appealed to some of them.</p> <p>  A further point was made on acquiring the portfolio for cash.  That is what we told people.  Those who were approached had the money to do it.  If they got in poll position and NAMA told them that they were the preferred bidder, they could close the transaction.  That is not a real restriction.  We are referring to funds that have in the range of $10 billion to $200 billion under management.  They are not funds that have $500 million under management trying to buy a &pound;1.3 billion portfolio.  They have multiples of the portfolio's value.</p></speech>

We wrote to Fortress and asked for its rationale for making a bid below the reserve price.  It stated that the bid process required an unconditional bid that "could not be syndicated or financed pre-bid".</p> <p>  I will cut to the chase.  Only one bidder met the conditions of minimum price, cash up front and the breakdown.  We must decide a question.  NAMA provided us with several documents in the report on market value and various definitions, but they are all based on a well-designed sales process.  It is not about a willing buyer, a willing seller and what the market offered on the day.  It is about a well-designed sales process.  That is fundamental.  We must decide whether we believe it was a well-designed sales process.</p></speech>

First, Fortress signed up to the bid process letter with Lazard under those conditions.  It knew what it was signing up to in February 2014.  Second, and I believe that we have provided the e-mail to the committee, but when Mr. George wrote to me in February 2014, he said that he had $4 billion.  That was in excess of the &pound;1.3 billion.  When one signs up to a process, one is saying that one has the money.  If Mr. George is now saying that he did not have the money to do it, he signed up to a process for which he did not have the money in the first place.</p></speech>

The success fee was a major issue but it is quite obvious that he was involved with PIMCO.  We did not know how far back.  Even if it was a day or two, it was an issue for us.  I think that at the end of the day, PIMCO withdrew because we made it very clear to it that we would not allow it to continue.  That has been my view from the start.</p></speech>

Will NAMA pass on the correspondence when it receives a response?</p> <p>  There is a chart, on page 77, that I want to ask the witnesses about.  For the benefit of people, most of us took it on face value until Mr. Neporent highlighted the matter the day he was here.  The chart refers to European sales from 2013 to 2015.  Project Eagle was completed at the beginning of 2014.  That is using sales that happened substantially after the conclusion of Project Eagle to explain who are the main players, or for NAMA to state it dealt with the main players.  It would have been more helpful if we had the European sales from 2012 to 2014.  Do the witnesses get the point?  Those figures represent activity in the market after the conclusion of Project Eagle.  NAMA has used the chart to justify the fact that it brought it in the big players.  For all we know, some of those may not have been players prior to the Project Eagle event.  Can that chart be reworked?  NAMA said it got somebody to produce it for it, Cushman &amp;amp; Wakefield.  Does it have a similar chart for the three years 2012 to 2014 that would give us an indication of who the big players in the field were at the time of going to market?</p></speech>

Confidentiality was a fundamental issue as far as NAMA was concerned.  Shortly afterwards, in mid-March, we had the PIMCO issue coming to light.  Then, on 2 April and 3 April, we had the issue with Brown Rudnick and Tughans coming to light.  I refer to the success fee.  At any of those three stages, did NAMA consider halting the process?  Mr. Daly should consider them one by one.  There were three occasions on which significant problems arose.  I believe Mr. Daly said before this committee on an another occasion that, as a result of the leak, he considered whether he would pull the process.  Owning to the difficulties in the process, it was not a clean, neat process.  Those are the three issues that arose.</p></speech>

The final decision there was to give asset recovery and Lazard flexibility to increase the number of bidders involved in the process if genuine, credible interest arose.  Regarding the three incidents the Chairman mentioned, certainly my recollection is that, at each time, we asked what the implications were for the sale.  In relation to the media leak, obviously there was a concern but I believe it was more a concern around the quasi-political stuff and Northern Ireland.  At that stage, it was out.</p></speech>

I am not saying he should get any credit for it and Mr. Daly will not give it but, perhaps without a Mr. Cushnahan doing a bit of wheeling and dealing, NAMA might never have got that first offer.

Mr. McDowell put Mr. George in touch with Ronnie Hanna, head of Credit at NAMA, and John Collison, Head of Residential Delivery at NAMA, who informed Mr. George that Fortress would be invited to bid, and that NAMA had engaged Lazard to oversee the bidding process.  On February 14, 2014, a Fortress representative spoke with Lazard regarding the bidding process.</blockquote><p>I am just saying that according to the letter, the leak resulted in Fortress asking to be let in, on the basis that it was a big outfit with an interest in Belfast and Northern Ireland, and getting in contact with to the Taoiseach's office.

I suggest that NAMA was very fortunate that there was a media leak.  If NAMA had not had Fortress in there, it would have had just one bidder and it would not have been able to convince anybody here that there was a competitive process.  NAMA was very lucky that the media leak allowed this bidder in.  The only reason Lazard could say to NAMA at the end of the process that it had been a competitive process was that there had been two bidders.  One of them came in by fluke.  It was not asked in by NAMA, according to the letter from which I have read.  NAMA might have intended to ask Fortress to come in if other people fell out, but the reality is that it came in as a result of the media leak.  I ask myself what kind of way that is to run a show.</p></speech>

I think the issue is that we employed Lazard to contact the parties that they considered to be credible bidders for the portfolio.  They contacted the credible bidders that they thought could bid for the portfolio.  I do not have my e-mail from Mr. George here with me today.  I do not know whether the Chairman has it.

Oaktree was intensively involved in this process.  It withdrew later on, at some point in March.  If Fortress was not in the process, it might have distilled down to one bidder, as the Chairman has suggested.  However, there is a possibility that if Oaktree was still there, it would actually have reached the finishing line.  There would have been just one other potential competitor for Oaktree at that point.  My point is that we cannot say for certain.</p></speech>

Before we conclude, I will let them all make a final comment on any new information they feel they should have mentioned during the meeting.  According to the factual situation that the Committee of Public Accounts is in, Fortress forced its way in following the media leak.  It was never invited.  The witnesses might say to us they believe they might have invited Fortress.  We might want to record that.  All we can deal with is what actually happened, which is that NAMA did not invite Fortress.  Do the witnesses understand where we are?</p></speech>

I know it is late.  A lot hinges on the competitive bid.  As I have said to the witnesses, it was very fortuitous for NAMA that it had a competitive bid as a result of the media leak.  That is all I can say on the matter.  I am just making that observation.  The last thing I want to mention is that Cerberus felt it could pay &pound;1.3 billion and make a significant profit.  My question relates to whether there was a big profit to be made out there.  The only other company in the market at the end of this process felt there was big money to be made by paying &pound;1.3 billion upfront.  Why could NAMA not have made the profit that Cerberus is presumably making?</p></speech>

I am just asking the question.  It was a NAMA decision.  It was nothing to do with the Comptroller and Auditor General.  NAMA was satisfied that it had a bidder that was going to pay &pound;1.3 billion.  The only reason it was going to do so was that it knew it would make several hundred million out of it.  Why did NAMA not try to emulate what Cerberus is now doing?</p></speech>

I am not saying that NAMA cannot do this, but we certainly cannot do it in the long term.  I do not want to make a distinction between where we invest money, but it is the case that as a State body, when we are investing money we have to consider where we invest it.  I think the opportunities for NAMA in terms of this portfolio were less than the opportunities for Cerberus or anybody else.</p></speech>

I understand that.  In fairness to NAMA, this point is not well appreciated.  I am going to ask NAMA to send us a note on the restrictions that prevent it from cutting deals with its own debtors.  It sold these loans to other companies that had the significant advantage of being able to do that.  The Oireachtas legislated in this manner for good reasons.</p></speech>

Following an extensive debate, NAMA was subject to a legal requirement with regard to investing funds that nobody else was subject to.

We will have to go back to the Department of Finance.  To put it in a nutshell, if a Government agency, for example, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, was in the marketplace procuring a contract for several hundred million euro and the Minister was to meet the successful bidder the night before the bid was put in, there would be a national outcry.  I am just saying it is remarkable.  I know the reference to the meeting is buried somewhere in the 1,500 pages but of all the people who have come to us nobody has ever said anything to us about a meeting with a Minister the night before the bids closed.  Perhaps nothing turned on it but it looks extraordinary and if it was in relation to procurement one could probably render the process so fatally flawed, to use one of Mr. Daly&rsquo;s own words, that it would have to be cancelled.</p></speech>

My job is to make sure I keep people interested in buying assets off NAMA.  If people who have lots of money are interested in buying assets and want to meet someone in NAMA our policy is to meet them, but we were very clear with Fortress and Cerberus that they could come to meet us and talk to us about the weather or anything else but we would not discuss the bids.</p></speech>

The process is crucial and NAMA has come back repeatedly to say that there were nine or ten bidders.  I have repeatedly gone through the Comptroller and Auditor General's report and said there was not.  There was eventually, but there were three bidders initially.  Sorry, Mr. McDonagh, if you could resist distracting Mr. Daly, I wish to put the question to him.  I know we are all very tired, not to mention the staff for whom I feel very sorry.  There were three bidders.  One came forward from those three.  The process then went on to the next stage.  Today, Mr. Daly said that PIMCO wanted to stay in the process at all costs.

The witness has said that and there is a conflict there.  Let us look at page 112, paragraph 4 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  PIMCO were in the process from a very early stage, not with NAMA, according to the witnesses, but with Brown Rudnick and Tughans from April 2013.  They went forward to September and through the various board meetings.  On 8 January 2014, a decision was made by NAMA.  Paragraph 4, page 112 reads as follows:</p><blockquote>In parallel, PIMCO were permitted to complete their due diligence on the &quot;tail&quot; of the Eagle Portfolio and formalise their bid.  AR would, at this juncture, meet with PIMCO to advise them of the intended approach regarding the other short-listed investors noting that this would be as much to protect PIMCO's interests with regard to the integrity and the credibility of the disposal process;</blockquote> <p>One could be forgiven for assuming from this that it was more or less a cover of an open process.  The witness can come back and correct me.  Reading this, PIMCO had been involved for a long time and had invested an awful lot of money and time.  NAMA was happy with PIMCO.  NAMA then had an open process with very limited time and directions for Lazard, as well as other matters that restricted the process.  I put it to Mr. Daly that NAMA did that to cover PIMCO and to keep it in the race at all costs, but to give the illusion that it was a competitive process.</p></speech>

It had been very clear from the start, even though PIMCO wanted a closed process, that the board was never minded to do that.  There is plenty of other documentation that says as much.

I cannot remember the exact wording of my statement in September.  I was talking about what NAMA can and cannot be responsible for.  What we cannot be responsible for is what Mr. Cushnahan may have been saying or doing in Northern Ireland and how he was promoting or projecting himself.  I do not know.  If the committee wants me to make any speculation at all about this, it would be that Mr. Cushnahan was convincing people that he would bring added value to this process.  I am not really going to go any further than that.</p></speech>

Mr. Neporent was quite explicit, as I noted earlier.  In his view, &pound;15 million was the price tag on debtor information and access to movers and shakers.  These are decision-makers in the North and also in the South.  That was his position.  We know, along with the witnesses, that Mr. Cushnahan had a specific relationship with debtors.  We also know, as it is in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, that there was a specific provision in this transaction that there was not to be contact between bidders and debtors.  Is that not correct?  Would it be fair to say that in having the kind of access relationship information that Mr. Cushnahan had, he could have proven a convenient bridge or access point in respect of debtors?  All the witnesses have said repeatedly is how difficult the Northerners were.</p></speech>

To make it clear, if Mr. Cushnahan had information relating to debtors either with a connection with NAMA or with no connection with NAMA but rather with other banks, maybe Cerberus would have taken the view that it was of value to it.  I must stress that none of that debtor information would have come from NAMA or Mr. Cushnahan's involvement with NAMA.  If he had information relating to Northern Ireland, the business or developer community, there are all sorts of other ways in which he could have had information.  My point is he did not get it from NAMA.</p></speech>

I do not dispute that.  Cerberus was absolutely clear - Mr. Neporent did not put a tooth in it - in saying that &pound;15 million was the price tag for debtor information.  He was quite specific in detailing abstracts on debtors and loans, guarantees and potential business plans.  It seemed to be quite a body of work.  It was very clear that Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Mr. Cushnahan had this asset in the form of access to this information.</p><p>They went so far as to say to Cerberus that if it was not interested, they would take it elsewhere.</p></speech>

Given that part of its conditions as agreed with Lazard, and we have heard from Mr. Long, was the prohibition of such contact between bidder and debtor and given that Cerberus got access to that type of information, and let us accept that NAMA was not the source of it, did that not really compromise matters and confer an advantage on Cerberus over the last party standing, which at that point was Fortress Investment Group?</p></speech>

NAMA can only control somebody involved with NAMA at a certain stage, like Mr. Cushnahan was, in respect of our control over him or his responsibilities to us.  I again reiterate that wherever any information was coming from, or where Brown Rudnick or Cerberus believed it was coming from, it was not coming from Mr. Cushnahan's association or former association with NAMA.

By the way, I am not sure he said it was coming from Mr. Cushnahan.  He talked about Brown Rudnick, Tughans and the whole lot of them, but that was the value.  It certainly was not Mr. Cushnahan.  Remember, Cerberus has confirmed to us that there is absolutely no fee or engagement and that it has never met Mr. Cushnahan.  I think he did not confirm it to us - he confirmed it to the committee.  Cerberus had never met Mr. Cushnahan, never had an engagement with him and there is no fee proposed for him, so it is talking about information that may have come from Brown Rudnick or Tughans.

She said Mr. Neporent referred to information about guarantees.  All information relating to guarantees was already in the NAMA data room so, effectively, Cerberus's legal advisers would have been able to tell it what the guarantees were anyway, because they were part of that.

I do not know what it paid &pound;15 million for.  I saw the committee ask Mr. Neporent that question.  He explained what it paid the money for.  It wanted to make sure Cerberus had it and stop somebody else getting it.  That is Mr. Neporent's view.  Does that seem to be an extraordinary amount of money to pay?  It does.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses wish to say something where they were cut short or something else?  I do not want a summary of anything.  If there is a significant point that has been bugging them and they need to say it, please say so.  Perhaps there is none.  Unfortunately or fortunately, there will be further correspondence to you and we ask you to bear with us and turn the correspondence around as quickly as possible.  You are doing your best at present and we ask that it continue.</p> <p>  The main point I wish to make is that we are seeking some information that has not been made available to us, perhaps for confidentiality or commercial reasons.  We need to find some mechanism for access to key documents for this committee.  We cannot issue a report on the blind or without seeing some documents that are in the system, only to find ourselves potentially contradicted the following day based on a redacted document we have not seen.  You will understand that we wish to have comprehensive information and we will respect any issue regarding publication.  Are you happy that you have covered everything?</p></speech>

I am sure you do not want me to do that, so I will not.  There has been a very good engagement today.

As members are aware, a technical or token Supplementary Estimate does not involve additional Exchequer funding for the Vote, other than a very small technical increase of &euro;1,000.  This is because corresponding savings, or as in our case, corresponding additional fee income, fully covers the additional expenditure required.</p> <p>  Earlier this week, on 22 November, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform moved a motion in the D&aacute;il seeking a technical Supplementary Estimate of &euro;1,000 for the Department and the approval to move excess income from appropriations-in-aid to fund increased expenditure on international contributions and on the Passport Service.  The Department is seeking an increase of &euro;5.001 million, which is offset by additional passport fee income of &euro;5 million resulting, as already stated, in a net technical or token increase of &euro;1,000.</p> <p>  The increased expenditure is being sought for Ireland's increased mandatory contributions to several international organisations - mainly the United Nations, UN, but also to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE, and to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD - and for increased operational costs relating to the Passport Service due to an exceptional increase in demand of 10% in 2016 compared to 2015.  These increases are fully offset by additional passport fee income of &euro;5 million.  The international contributions in question are Ireland's contributions to the organisations outlined, not just those of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade but across all Departments which interact daily with, and benefit from, Ireland's membership of these valuable organisations.  The mandatory contributions of Ireland and all other member states of international organisations are based on scales of assessments and these can vary.</p> <p>  The first purpose for which additional expenditure will be incurred this year relates to the Passport Service, which has experienced an exceptional increase in demand of an extra 10% applications this year compared with 2015.  Last year, just over 680,000 passport applications were received and this is expected to grow to over 740,000 this year.  There was a strong underlying increase in demand for passports in the first half of the year.  Indications are that this will be further affected by the UK referendum on EU membership.  From July to October this year, applications from Northern Ireland increased by approximately 70% compared to the same period last year, while applications from Great Britain have almost doubled.</p> <p>  A significant proportion of the operational costs of the Passport Service are demand-driven and directly correlate to the level of applications.  Consequently, the significant increase in demand has led to a proportionate increase in operational costs, particularly for passport books, postage, the printing of application forms as well as for additional temporary clerical officers and overtime.  The relocation to Mount Street in the early part of the year resulted in increased challenges to maintain passport delivery within expected timeframes.  I am proud that the Passport Service was recently, in the customer experience, CXi, survey, ranked number one in the Irish public sector.  This survey confirms that the Passport Service delivers very strongly in facilitating travel for citizens, sometimes in urgent circumstances, and in ensuring that applicants are properly advised about their passport entitlements.  I congratulate and thank the staff of the Passport Service for their commitment to delivering a friendly and efficient service.  Gabhaim comhghairdeas agus bu&iacute;ochas le foireann Sheirbh&iacute;s na bPasanna.</p> <p>  The largest source of increased expenditure relates to Ireland's international contributions, accounting for some &euro;4.2 million of the additional &euro;5 million on which the Supplementary Estimate is based.  The largest element of this, Ireland's payments to the UN, consists of mandatory contributions to the UN regular budget, UN peacekeeping budget and UN tribunals which accounts for some &euro;3.3 million of the additional funding included in the Supplementary Estimate.  UN member states' contributions are based on a formula, called the scale of assessment, which is reviewed at three-year intervals.  In December 2015, a new scale of assessment was approved for the 2016-2018 period, with Ireland's rate set at 0.335%.  The challenge in forecasting the UN peacekeeping budget, which is the largest part of our payments to the UN, is not easy.  The budget depends on the level of UN peacekeeping activity around the world.  This is influenced both by the number of conflicts, as well as the size and complexity of the UN operations which the Security Council decides to put on the ground.</p> <p>  It is difficult to estimate this in advance, as an existing peacekeeping operation might be increased or decreased, depending on the circumstances, or a new one might be established.  Also, and this was the case for 2016, the timing of the bills for peacekeeping can cause problems in estimating costs.  Normally, the majority of peacekeeping payments fall due in July at the beginning of the peacekeeping budget cycle.  However, for technical reasons, every three years these bills are split between July and January.  As a result, this year several payments that would ordinarily have been paid in full in July 2015 were split between July 2015 and January 2016.  As a result assessments payable by all member states, including Ireland, in January 2016 were higher than usual.</p> <p>  As regards the OSCE, we require an additional &euro;450,000.  The amount provided for in the Revised 2016 Estimates was &euro;1.168 million.  The amount spent in 2016 will be &euro;1.619 million.  The shortfall is due to the fact that the provision in the revised Estimates was insufficient.  The amount spent in 2016 covers both Ireland's contribution to the OSCE unified budget, &euro;1.070 million, and its contribution to the special monitoring mission in Ukraine, &euro;550,000.  Both these contributions are mandatory and arise from Ireland's participation in the OSCE, which is integral to long-standing Irish foreign policy goals of supporting human rights and the rule of law.  The special monitoring mission in Ukraine plays a vital role in monitoring the implementation of the Minsk peace agreements.</p> <p>  The final international contribution which was under-provided for in the 2016 Revised Estimates was a shortfall of &euro;440,000 in Ireland's contribution to the OECD.  The amount allocated in the Revised Estimates for 2016 was &euro;2.26 million but the total amount to be paid to the OECD in 2016 will be &euro;2.70 million.  Member countries' contributions to the OECD are determined in part on the basis of the relative size of their economies and are thus affected by economic growth.  The shortfall arises due to a combination of growth in the Irish economy and an underestimation of the likely final allocation.</p> <p>  I trust that my remarks have clarified the purpose for which the Department is seeking a technical Supplementary Estimate but, of course, I will seek to answer any questions committee members may have.

I compliment the staff on the excellent work that is done in the Passport Office.  Every Oireachtas Member has a number of dealings with the Passport Office each month.  I hope, with the agreement of the committee, that word will go back to the Passport Office.  I have not known anybody who had to cancel a holiday because he or she could not get a passport.  Sometimes one can nearly get a passport on the same day in cases of unforeseen circumstances.  The staff of the Passport Office are understanding, they listen and will revert to members and discuss matters.  In the context of the service that is provided by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade's office, Members of the Houses can e-mail the Department directly and they usually receive calls back fairly fast.  I want to acknowledge that service.</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the increase in demand for Irish passports from 680.000 to 740,000.  There is a rising demand from Northern Ireland, where there has been a 70% increase.  The demand from Great Britain has more than doubled.  The Minister of State may not have the information to hand, in which case I can table a parliamentary question, but will he indicate whether the additional applications have been approved or have there been instances of people chancing their arm and seeking an Irish passport due having, for example, a great, great, great grandfather who was Irish.  Since the election Mr. Donald Trump, has there been an increase in demand for Irish passports from the US, particularly in view of the fact that there are more then 40 million people of Irish descent in that country?</p> <p>  Ireland is very well respected at the United Nations.  Irish soldiers who serve with the UN peacekeeping forces abroad are also very well respected.  I was travelling around Lebanon and met with various groups and officials and they had nothing but the height of respect for the members of the Irish Army that are on UN peacekeeping duties abroad.  I visited the refugee camps within the Syrian border in a private capacity.  I and a few Irish people were travelling with a few delegation of individuals from around the world.  We had a security detail travelling with us and its members came over to the Irish party to acknowledge that they respect the Irish and that the Irish are very well respected in Lebanon.  It nice to hear about the Irish Army serving with the UN in Lebanon.  I support the Supplementary Estimate.</p></speech>

I agree with the Deputy not just on the level of efficiency of the staff but also in the context of the empathy they show.</p> <p>  The Deputy will be aware that a major part of the passport process happens in his county at HID Global.  I had the opportunity to visit that company's plant in the Gaeltacht community and it has been providing the physical product.  Deputy Grealish was being very modest by not mentioning the company in question.  I appreciate that.</p></speech>

However, I assure Deputy Grealish that all passport applications are carefully vetted.</p> <p>  Deputy Grealish also mentioned the recent election in the United States.  We do not have statistics which might indicate whether there is a trend in applications.  However, there has been an increase in inquiries since the American election.  I have some figures for New York.  The figure for 2015 was 5,984 and that for 2016 was 6,209.  On the west coast, the figure for San Francisco for 2015 was 3,660 and this role to 3,849 to date in 2016.  There is an increase but it does not coincide.</p></speech>

The staff there do great work.  They have to give advice in respect of that to which people are entitled.  It is a very good service.</p> <p>  I agree that the Irish Army members serving in Lebanon are doing great work.  One in three, more than 30% of the population in Lebanon are people with refugee status.  That says a great deal for Lebanon as a country</p></speech>

I do not want to be parochial either but I had the opportunity to meet young lads from Ramelton in my county at a ceremony.  They are doing great work</p> <p>  In response to Deputy McLoughlin's question on Brexit, from my time spent in Edinburgh and Glasgow a few weeks ago, I am aware that business carries on and there is a great positivity regarding Irish and Scottish business working together at that event.  We are looking at increases in respect of inquires about passports and also passport applications.  We have a very dedicated sub-committee at Cabinet level, headed by the Taoiseach which held its fourth meeting this morning.  There are significant proactive actions we can take in light of the Brexit result.  There are lots of positives such as, for example, the business-to-business engagement between the UK and Ireland.  I know that at a symbolic political level, whether it was the Queen's visit or the President's visit to the United Kingdom, the language around relationships has never been stronger.  On the ground, one can see the incredible synergies between businesses on an UK-Ireland basis and companies feeding into the supply chain in Scotland.  There is an infrastructure of which we must be conscious.  I acknowledge the work of Enterprise Ireland, which held a very successful trade mission in Edinburgh recently.  At a political and a State agency level, we must be as proactive as possible, whether it is in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales or England.</p></speech>

Is it possible to indicate to us in writing, rather than verbally, who is entitled to a passport?  There is confusion about whether a person who is a first or a second cousin may be entitled to a passport.  The service provided by the Passport Office is second to none and a credit to everybody, including the departmental officials.  It is seldom that I hear a complaint about the passport service and as a public service it is first class.  Above all, its personnel always give the impression that they are trying to help people and it is not just a case of going through the motions.  There is an ethos that should be recognised by us all.  The personnel in question are behind desks and providing a service and never really receive recognition for the work they do.  Many times they have to deal with somebody in the airport who is panicking as he or she has just realised he or she does not have a passport.  There is always an attitude that personnel should try to help people rather than tell them to come back tomorrow.  The service is excellent.</p><p> The fact that we are renowned for our part in peacekeeping missions is a great advertisement for Ireland.  I have witnessed it at first-hand and we cannot underestimate the value to Ireland of our troops operating on peacekeeping missions.  Very often we speak about the situation in Lebanon where we have 500 or so troops, but there are other areas where 20 or 30 members of the Defence Forces are serving on very small missions but who are playing a vital role.  They do not receive the recognition they deserve.  Again, I highlight the work done on all missions, including the small ones, as well as the big ones.  The troops involved play such an important role in enhancing the image of the country.  We cannot overestimate the value of their role as peacekeepers, nor can we overvalue Ireland's role as a neutral country and in not being tied to European armies or anything else.  Our neutrality is very precious and allows us tremendous scope in participating in peacekeeping missions.  We are not seen as serving some agenda or other but as being there purely to help.  Expertise has been built during the years, dating back to the mission in the Congo, and it is second to none, as the Minister of State has seen at first hand.  Small missions are just as important as bigger ones in various parts of the world.</p><p> I am glad that we are contributing to a special monitoring mission in Ukraine.  Do we have many troops or officials there in that capacity or are we only subscribing to the overall cost for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe?  I have a particular interest in the situation in Ukraine as it has been messed about and become a political football.  It says a lot for the way the world works today when Russian troops can march into Crimea and just take over, without a finger being lifted to say boo to Russia as such.  There are sanctions, but the situation is horrific.  I have had the pleasure of being in Ukraine on a couple of occasions and although they are making tremendous strides, they need ongoing support.  I am delighted that we are contributing in some way to stabilising the country and allowing its people to pursue their independence.</p><p> It is always great to have an opportunity to say thanks to those who serve on UN missions.  We cannot overestimate the value to the country of those ambassadors who serve throughout the world.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.2559" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016112400002#C00200"><p>The Minister of State and his team are most welcome and I thank them for their presentation.  I know that all of my colleagues have touched on the work of the Passport Office.  It is interesting that the Department is seeking an increase of &euro;5.001 million, with &euro;5 million being offset by the increase in revenue from the Passport Office.  That is direct evidence of the work it is doing.  The 10% increase in demand has resulted in an extra &euro;5 million for the Exchequer, which has allowed us to cover the additional cost of our contributions this year without having to look for much more from the country's funds.  It is incredible and significant evidence of the fantastic work the Passport Office is doing.  I join my colleagues in commending it.</p> <p>  I am heartened in going through the table of specific programmes with which we are involved by the number of people serving at home and abroad who are working for a fairer, more just, secure and sustainable world.  We are advancing prosperity and promoting our economic interests internationally, while protecting and advancing Ireland's values and interests in Europe and strengthening and influencing our capacity to deliver on our goals.  Although austerity has permeated nearly every aspect of our life in the past few years, we have continued to maintain our interactions and work internationally and remained committed to advancing our core values in foreign affairs.  It is a credit to the country that we have managed to do this during the years, particularly given the increased pressure to cut and cut some more.  I commend the Department for its work in that regard.</p> <p>  I will go through some more specific contributions to international organisations within which we operate.  Our most significant contribution is, as we know, made to the United Nations.  UN operations are a major source of pride to the country and its citizens, as well as for those who serve or have served in the Defence Forces.  There is no doubt that they are very well trained and equipped.  They do fantastic work abroad and Ireland is very well regarded by international colleagues when it comes to defence matters.  Our contributions to the United Nations are based on a formula, with the scale of assessment reviewed at three-year intervals.  There was a new scale introduced in 2015.  How does it compare with the previous one?  Have our contributions increased or decreased since the previous assessment?  The Minister of State has indicated that the budget depends on the level of UN peacekeeping activity.  I appreciate that demand can very often change, in reacting quickly to what happens globally, but how do we even attempt to estimate what our contributions will be, given the volatile nature of both UN peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions?</p> <p>  I have a question about the OSCE.  The Minister of State has indicated that there was a shortfall owing to the fact that the Revised Estimates were insufficient.  Why was that the case and where was the mistake made?  Was it due to a lack of information?  I have had some contact with the OSCE.  It is a very valuable organisation, of which Ireland is a member.  As international as well as Irish citizens, it is vital that we participate in organisations such as the OSCE to contribute to international peace and support human rights and the protection of the rule of law.  These are objectives which Irish people value.  I am very happy to see that Ireland is participating fully in the organisation.  I am interested in hearing a little more about the monitoring mission in Ukraine.  Where exactly is the money going?  Do we have any direct control over where it goes or is it included in a general budget for the entire project?</p> <p>  I have a question on the OECD.</p><p>Again, there was a shortfall in the Estimates.  Why was that?  It was estimated to be &euro;2.26 million for 2016 but the actual amount paid will be &euro;2.7 million.  Again, it is a considerable sum of money and I wonder why that shortfall is there.</p><p> How are our contributions calculated?  We know they are calculated on the basis of our economic growth but is that done every three years or every year and what figures are used?  How have we fared over the past number of years?  Have our contributions to that organisation increased?  That concludes my questions.</p></speech>

The entitlement to a passport is based on citizenship in the first instance and determined by law.  There are two automatic categories.  If one is born in Ireland or one's parents were born here, that is automatic.  Then, one has the grandparent facility, but that is after registration.  As such, there is a registration process.  Then, there is naturalisation and we have many new citizens in the State as a result of that process.  The Deputy is right about having that information available on the Passport Office website.  I am sure it is readily available.  If there is anything specific that would be of benefit to the Deputy, we will organise its provision.</p> <p>  One of the officials showed me a passport card today.  It is useful and it prompted me to apply for one.  I admit I do not have one.  It will get one around Europe and is handy because it can be kept in one's wallet.  Obviously, one needs a passport to get the passport card.  If Deputy Barrett does not have one either, we could jointly apply.</p> <p>  He talked about the role of our missions.  He is absolutely right that, big or small, they are doing a phenomenal job internationally.  I can see that the roles are changing and that they are adapting to new challenges and ways of communicating.  The best example of a person using social media is Mr. Dan Mulhall in London who one sees tweeting most days.  In the smaller embassies such as the one in Edinburgh, there is a greater capacity to engage with community.  It is very bottom up and when one speaks to members of the Irish community or those who have an affinity for Ireland within the Scottish community itself, they talk about the great work that goes on at grassroots level.</p> <p>  I mentioned empathy earlier.  The high profile example was Mr. Philip Grant in San Francisco and the work he did during the Berkeley tragedy.  At the time, it was a very personal thing for him in his role.  I received feedback on that from meeting different people out there and he has had an ongoing engagement.  It is the follow-through that is very significant.  He is still doing work and different aspects of legislation in California are being looked at.  He is still in touch with all the families.  That empathy and investment in humanity that all our ambassadors and consuls general demonstrate all over the world is something into which I have been given a bit of an insight.  I note the work of Mr. D&oacute;nal Cronin in Uganda and I will be meeting with Dr. Vincent O'Neill in Kenya next week where Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan will be joining me.  The work Mr. O'Neill's team has done in advance of our visit next week has been going on for months and then there will be the work of following that visit up.</p> <p>  Where Government needs to raise the bar is in terms of our strategic approach internationally, whether sourcing investment or otherwise.  That is a message for myself and our political colleagues.  It is in the follow-through.  Embassies and missions can only do so much as their resources are limited. A whole-of-Government approach to using our State agencies better, including Enterprise Ireland and the IDA, is needed.  We have to look at a more strategic approach.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is already initiating that.  At the moment, it is working on an Asia strategy and last week it was working on an American strategy.  It is not just about the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; there has to be a whole-of-Government buy-in across Departments.  That will bode well for the future.</p> <p>  Deputy Barrett also mentioned Ukraine and our work there.  Ireland makes an assessed contribution to the monitoring mission in Ukraine, which is tasked with monitoring the implementation of the Minsk agreement.  This is also a mandatory contribution arising from our participation in the OSCE.  We are providing a monitoring role.  I acknowledge Deputy Barrett's comments on the challenges out there.</p> <p>  Deputy Lisa Chambers asked a series of questions.  If I leave anything specific out or I fail to get back to her, the officials will follow up on some of her observations.  She mentioned the reduction and asked what was missing in relation to the assessment and the scale of assessment, which is reviewed at three-year intervals.  In December 2015, a new scale of assessment was approved for 2016 to 2018 with Ireland's rate being set at 0.335%, which was down from 0.418%.  The reduced rate is the result of Ireland's depressed economic performance over the preceding years.  Deputy Chambers was correct to say it was measured against our economic performance.  I acknowledge her point that, even during the years which were difficult economically and otherwise, we continued to face our international challenges in a proactive way in relation to our work with different organisations as well as financially.  The taxpayer should be constantly reminded of the figure.  When I set it out, people are often startled.  From 2011 to this year's budget, the Irish taxpayer contributed &euro;4.5 billion in contributions to overseas aid.  Notwithstanding the fact that since 2008, some &euro;28 billion came out of the economy and that a great many hard and difficult measures were taken, as the Deputy said herself, the Irish taxpayer still contributed &euro;4.5 billion.  It is a phenomenal contribution.</p> <p>  While there are still challenges about getting to the 0.7% target, we can work better in terms of that strategic approach.  We should not simply be waiting for the next budget to come along to see if there will be an increase or decrease and, if so, how much it will be.  Rather, we should be a bit more ruthless in relation to the 0.7% target and set out a five-year plan.  The committee has been working on and made proposals around this and it is important that we are clear about trying to provide a continuum towards the objective of reaching the 0.7% target.  On the other hand, as the economy improves the percentage decreases, but that does not make up for the fact that we need to get up to a different place.</p> <p>  I was asked about UN missions.  We are in Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Western Sahara, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Ivory Coast and Cyprus.  Deputy Barrett asked if we were in Ukraine, but these are the ones we are in at the minute.</p> <p>  A few issues were raised about scale and Deputy Chambers asked how we estimate our contributions.  It is difficult.  It is a best-guess scenario because everything changes so quickly.  I mentioned in the D&aacute;il yesterday some of the figures we got from the International Committee of the Red Cross this week.  To take the example of Chad, 9 million people are displaced from that country at the moment, the majority of whom have refugee status in Somalia and Ethiopia.  In the context of a total global displacement figure of 65 million, 9 million are from one country alone.  In Italy, 25% of refugees are from Eritrea, from which country 5,000 people leave per month.  One is looking at the scale of movement and displacement of people and everything is changing.  The challenge is absolutely enormous.</p> <p>  I would like to acknowledge all of those involved in peacekeeping meetings as well as Irish Aid, whose personnel I have got to know very well and with which some of the Deputies here have worked very closely over the years.</p><p>It is doing great work in terms of rising to the challenge.  The responsibility on the EU and UN is massive.  The world is changing by the day.  We need to also focus on the positives, including the hosting by Uganda, despite its own challenges, of 500,000 people in temporary refugee status.  We can draw inspiration from what is being done in places like Jordan, Lebanon and Uganda.  While there are positives, the reality is that the challenges are enormous.  </p><p> In regard to how we estimate our contributions, that is done on a best guess analysis.    </p><p> My officials will communicate with Deputy Lisa Chambers on any of the questions to which I have not responded.  On the OECD, the budget submission was based on the estimated balance of the 2016 contribution and advances on assessed contribution for 2017.</p></speech>

I also visited the US recently to attend a wedding.  During my visit I had a meeting with Mayor Marty Walsh regarding the undocumented Irish and he assured me that Boston will retain its sanctuary status in that regard.  As the Minister of State will be aware Boston, New York, Chicago and San Francisco are cities of immigrants.  During my visit, I also met a number of Irish people working in the trade area whose driving licences are nearing expiration.  These people need to be able to drive to get to their places of work.  When a person is stopped by the police in the United States, the first thing he or she will be asked for is a driving licence.  If that person does not have a driving licence, he or she is arrested.  The point was made to me by these people that when their passports expire, they can apply by post to the consulate office for a new one - everybody knows that a passport is a more valuable document than a driver's licence - but when their driver's licence expires, they cannot renew it because they are required to return home and present themselves at a driving centre to get it.  In reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister on this issue, I was told that a person living abroad in a particular country for a specific period should be able to obtain a driver's licence in that country.  Unfortunately, undocumented people, particularly in the United States, do not have a social security number and so they cannot produce the documentation required to get a driver's licence.</p> <p>  Many people are living in fear because their driver's licences are due to expire.  I have asked the Minister to look into undocumented Irish people in the US being permitted to apply to the consulate office for a driver's licence, as they do in respect of passport renewals.  I do not know why a person has to present in person to pick up a driver's licence.  That appears to me to be a little crazy given one can get a passport through the post from anywhere in the world.  It should be possible for people to renew their driver's licence at any of the Irish consulate offices throughout the United States.  I accept that this is not a matter relevant to today's discussion but it is an issue I would like the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to examine.  This is a serious issue for the undocumented in the United States which needs to be addressed jointly by the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Transport, Tourism and Sport.  I ask the Minister of State to ask his officials to contact the officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to see if some resolution can be found to this issue.</p></speech>

There are constant attempts to drag us, one way or the other, into a European army and so on.  That is not what I signed up to Europe for; we must protect our neutrality and create an awareness in the public mind of the value of our neutrality and the role of our peacekeepers and so on.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.2580" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Byrne" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016112400002#D00300"><p>We are very pleased to have the opportunity to give the Oireachtas and the public as comprehensive a picture as possible of AIB's progress - from recovery to its current position of sustainable profitability - to what I believe can be a period of continuing growth for it and the country.  The crucial task for all of us is to ensure Ireland is clearly seen as an attractive location for business in which to invest capital and resources.  This challenge has grown considerably in recent times.  This is my first opportunity since I became the bank's chief executive in May 2015 to meet the joint committee and I look forward to hearing members' views on how we can move forward together in the economy in facing up to these challenges and availing of many opportunities.</p> <p>  The committee will have received our written responses to the questions in its questionnaire, to which we will return.  I would also like to give it an overview of how I see AIB contributing positively to the growth of the economy and to assure members that the bank now has a sustainable business model and is in a position to continue to facilitate the return of capital to the State when the Government decides.  </p> <p>  First, I will introduce the members of my management team who are with me.  They are Mr. Mark Bourke, chief financial officer; Mr. Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe, head of financial solutions group; and Mr. Robert Mulhall, managing director of retail, corporate and business banking.  </p> <p>  AIB is a critical part of Ireland's economic infrastructure.  The banking system and the supporting infrastructure were rescued from collapse at great expense to the taxpayer because of the crucial economic role of the banks.  The financial crisis and the role the banks played in its creation led, understandably, to a reputational battering of the banking sector which will take a lot of time to heal and will never be forgotten.  Fortunately, the reality is that the banking sector in Ireland is now in far better shape and delivering on a daily basis the economic support it has been designed to deliver.</p> <p>  Overall, while the GDP growth rate is expected to lessen slightly next year, the economy is forecast to continue to perform well in the next three years, prompting demand for new loans and banking products and reducing pressure on problem loans.  AIB's role is to be a strong net contributor to Ireland's prosperity to demonstrate why it was an organisation that was well worth saving.  We can do this by providing reliable financial support for every aspect of the economy, including business, farming, families, individuals and communities.  As evidence of its progress, the bank is recording a strong underlying profit, has made substantial repayments to the State and is ready for sale at a time of the Government's choosing.  </p> <p>  In summary, after a period of enormous transformation, AIB's financial performance has improved, with a sustainable underlying profit of approximately &euro;1 billion, excluding write-backs and one-off benefits which are incremental to it; a reduction in our cost base of &euro;450 million over three years to 2015; an &euro;18 billion reduction in impaired loan balances to &euro;11 billion in June 2016 from &euro;29 billion in 2013; new lending approvals of &euro;14 billion in 2015 and &euro;6.1 billion in the first half of 2016, an increase on the figure for the previous year; a total of 37,000 forbearance solutions provided for mortgage customers in difficulty; owner-occupier arrears greater than 90 days past due at a figure of 5.8%, significantly below the industry average of 8%; significant capital generation and strong capital ratios; and repayments of capital in the past 12 months of &euro;3.5 billion to the State, bringing total payments to &euro;6.5 billion, including fees, coupons, dividends and levies.</p> <p>  AIB received a &euro;20.8 billion investment from the State and our objective is to facilitate the repayment of this amount in full.  The timing, nature and structure of a return to the public markets are matters for the Minister.  From my perspective, the aspect within my control is the management and performance of the bank and ensuring international investors have a clear understanding of our strategy, progress and future trajectory.  Members will have recently seen that the  Department of Finance has begun the process of appointing investment banks as "global co-ordinators" as part of a banking syndicate to assist in a potential future initial public offering, IPO, of AIB.  The selected investment banks will assist the State in the initial stages of preparation for an IPO and the Department has confirmed that the global co-ordinators selected will be appointed for an 18-month period with an option to extend.  </p> <p>  If proof were needed of the importance of a strong banking sector, it has rarely been more starkly illustrated than in very recent times.  Economic uncertainty has been introduced in unprecedented measure by the Brexit vote and possible policy changes under a new US Presidency.  I strongly preface my remarks by stressing how premature it is at this stage to accurately foretell what lies ahead in either the EU, US or UK scenarios.  However, as a small open economy which is particularly influenced by developments such as those we have just seen in two of our most significant trading partners, we must give serious thought to the risks and benefits that might yet result for the country.  In the short term a weakening sterling is affecting some of our indigenous exporters and we are working hard with our customers who are impacted on to address these effects and plan with them for alternative and diversified markets.  I believe that in the longer term Ireland can present itself as a bridge between two major economic regions on either side of the Atlantic.  This must be the most attractive location in which to invest capital and resources.  This must be true for local entrepreneurs, domestically headquartered businesses and the multinational sector.  This goes well beyond headline tax rates.  If we have a truly supportive and agile approach to attracting all investment, we can maintain the healthy job creation that has been a feature of the past few years.  There is no reason we cannot benefit from additional foreign direct investment inflows and possibly the relocation of financial firms from the United Kingdom, but in order to attract business we must have the required supporting infrastructure such as commercial office space, housing, transport and efficient access to finance.  As a well capitalised bank with excess liquidity, AIB is strongly placed to help to drive and support that strategy.  </p> <p>  During the summer the publication of the ECB stress test results attracted negative media attention.  The market reaction was more muted.  The methodology used is particularly penal to banks such as the Irish banks, with their relatively high levels of non-performing loans, NPLs, and a recent history of losses on distressed loans.  The tests were a snapshot in time and do not fully reflect the current state of the bank and the pace of our recovery.</p><p>Crucially there are no required capital actions.  Earlier this month, Moody&rsquo;s outlook on Ireland&rsquo;s banking sector was positive in spite of the Brexit vote, saying the uncertainty introduced by the result was manageable and that Irish banks had materially strengthened their solvency ratios owing to a mix of factors including strong internal capital generation and simplification of their capital structures.</p><p> After the initial phases of the financial crisis, the level of non-performing loans, NPLs, still on AIB's balance sheet was almost &euro;30 billion at the end of 2013.  AIB has in the intervening years engaged with customers in difficulty to implement a range of forbearance and restructuring solutions.  This work meant that by the end of June 2016 these NPLs were 61% lower at &euro;11 billion.  Despite this progress and the fact that we hold almost half of this in bad debt provisions, we recognise it is still a high number when compared to other peer European banks.  Elevated NPLs attract both regulatory and market attention and the ECB in particular is very keen to oversee the lowering of NPLs across the entire European financial system.  Their stress tests will continue to focus very heavily on this aspect, as will other regulatory actions.  Therefore, we must continue to address the challenge of non-performing loans as a matter of the utmost strategic importance.  We will continue to seek and implement sustainable solutions for those customers who engage with us whilst also recognising that after years of consistently working to restructure the number of loans in long-term arrears, we must keep all options open that reduce the overall level of NPLs.</p><p> We are essentially a core Irish bank.  With 2.2 million AIB customers and 360,000 EBS customers, the AIB Group is rooted in the country&rsquo;s economic life and communities.  A total of 60,000 customers use our 205 AIB branches every day, with a further 7,000 customers visiting our 71 EBS locations daily.</p><p> Our partnership with An Post, with its 1,100 offices, provides banking services to 15,000 customers every day, with approximately 4 million transactions expected to be recorded by the end of this year alone.  These combined banking services amount to a deeply embedded and widespread network across the country.  Our network bank staff are drawn from within the community, bringing with them local knowledge and an understanding of our customers and their needs.</p><p> Close engagement between AIB and our customer base is important to the success of our business and underpins our performance.  We have recently reorganised our banking model in order to work more closely and connect better with our customers across our retail business and corporate activities.  We created 19 new local markets which are now in place and headed by an individual senior manager responsible for AIB&rsquo;s overall engagement with customers in that region.</p><p> The bank is organising around customers at a local level, eliminating duplication and unnecessary complexities in the system.  The new structure aims to provide customers with a convenient one-stop-shop flexible form of service, allowing more local management autonomy when it comes to decision-making, including lending.  It is designed to be more tailored to individual customer needs, allowing far greater agility of service and enabling us to move working capital faster and more efficiently.</p><p> When I joined AIB in 2010, I could not have predicted the amount of change in customer behaviour that would occur in a relatively short period of time.  The systematic move by customers to digital and technological banking means that AIB is more than half way through an &euro;870 million investment programme focused on improving the customer experience, digital innovation and information technology resilience.</p><p> AIB is leading the expansion of digitalisation of services.  For example, 76% of all AIB&rsquo;s personal loan applications are now done through digital channels and 95% of all customer transactions are automated.  This activity is by no means conducted just by a younger generation of customers.  The use of digital channels by older age groups is growing consistently, regardless of geographical location.  In line with European norms, banking online and through remote channels has been embraced across the country.  Almost 50% of customers in rural counties now use digital banking of one kind or another.  More than 40% of our 500,000 daily transactions are conducted outside of normal banking hours, and are transacted online or on mobile.</p><p> There is a balance to be maintained between providing our customers with personal, one-to-one services and an accessible and robust digital or mobile service.  AIB opened three new branches last year, in Little Island, Cork, Carrickmines and Grand Canal Dock in Dublin.  Earlier in 2016, we opened the only in-store banking outlet in the Republic of Ireland through SuperValu in Lucan.  It is an illustration of the increasing number of flexible banking options available to our customers, to be used when and where they choose.</p><p> AIB is also increasing its mobile salesforce where trained staff travel to meet customers where and when it suits their needs.  In addition to the core retail opening hours, by the end of this year the bank will be operating 20 bank lobbies across the country providing a wide range of services, seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.  In addition, students now have access to exclusive on-campus banking services at 13 universities and colleges from Waterford to Sligo, and from Dublin to Galway.  Where there is a lack of physical branch infrastructure, AIB operates community banks in rural areas of Cork, Kerry, Clare, Limerick, Tipperary, Mayo, Galway and Donegal via mobile branches.  We have recorded over 40,000 transactions at these branches this year.</p><p> Supporting our customers with speedy and efficient credit decisions remains central to our aims.  Overall, the bank is approving approximately &euro;14 billion a year in new lending to SME, corporate, mortgage and personal customers.  The bank is now clearly performing its fundamental role of facilitating our retail and business customers in protecting as well as creating jobs.  On the SME and corporate side, the bank sanctioned &euro;4.8 billion in lending last year to existing and new businesses and the current momentum is positive.</p><p> The bank has 250,000 SME customers and can now provide a decision within 48 hours on a credit application of up to &euro;30,000.  Since this initiative&rsquo;s launch in September 2014, some 28,000 applications have been approved through this process.  The performance of loans in what was a very challenged SME sector has improved significantly, a welcome metric as it directly involves saving jobs and creating employment.  Meanwhile, we have been building out bank sectoral teams, developing specialists to work specifically with key areas of the economy.  These teams have gained an insight into the needs of farmers, retailers, the hospitality sector, transport, technology, exporting, energy and health sectors.  This approach of building sectoral capability has been very effective.  It has given the bank a high level of understanding of the specific requirements of businesses and allowed us to shape products and funds suitable to their needs.  For example, our agri-team now includes eleven specialist advisors with front-line experience of farmers&rsquo; needs and opportunities and who can respond rapidly and pragmatically to issues such as flooding, price volatility and poor crop yields.  Farming is a major aspect of our business and, following the full drawdown of the first &euro;500 million agri-loan fund, at the end of last year we launched a second &euro;500-million agri-loan fund to support the sector.</p><p> Recently, AIB has been engaging with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland or SBCI in regard to the Low-Cost AgriCash Flow Support Loan Fund announced in the budget.  AIB&rsquo;s successful partnership with the SBCI in helping the expansion of small businesses and farming is reflected in the aforementioned figures.  Since the launch of AIB&rsquo;s &euro;400 million SBCI fund in 2015, which is available at a 4.5% rate, AIB has approved more than &euro;5 million of credit each week to businesses and farmers under the fund.  Last year, the average loan drawdown under this fund was &euro;28,500 but loans ranged in size from &euro;1,000 to &euro;1 million.</p><p> AIB is the largest provider of mortgages in the Irish market.  We have a 34% share of market by drawdowns and we approved &euro;2 billion of loans to customers last year alone.  Conscious of the need to treat customers fairly, as soon as the bank&rsquo;s underlying performance allowed, and in particular as our cost of funding improved, AIB moved to cut its standard variable rate.  The joint committee is aware that we have implemented four mortgage rate cuts totalling 1% to new and existing customers in the past 24 months.  Our SVR rate is now a market-leading 3.4% and LTV variable rates start as low as 3.1%.  It means savings of approximately &euro;1,300 a year on the average mortgage.  We also introduced a &euro;2,000 contribution to switching costs to facilitate that process.</p><p> Case by case restructuring of problem mortgages continues to absorb a high degree of bank resources but, as the figures show, we are making good headway.  We have produced a comprehensive range of sustainable solutions including split mortgages, low fixed-rate options, term extensions, arrears capitalisation, reduced repayment and voluntary sale for loss.  All of these measures are underpinned by the bank&rsquo;s determination to keep people in their homes where possible, when customers engage with us and prioritise mortgage debt.  Repossession is always a last resort and, in spite of popular misapprehensions, less than 200 repossessions of owner-occupier homes took place last year as a result of enforced security.  Our engagement with third-party channels such as the Irish Mortgage Holders' Organisation and Stepchange has also led to the resolution of thousands of what appeared to be intractable cases.</p><p> As everyone is acutely aware, we are operating at present in a very constrained housing market.  The societal and economic impact of the lack of housing supply makes an early solution to this crisis imperative.  AIB recognises the critical role it plays in the housing supply chain and is actively engaged with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, as well as other relevant agencies, to ensure we play our role in establishing a normalised housing market.  The bank is also providing a pipeline of hundreds of empty houses to the Housing Agency to provide homes for families.</p><p> In summary, on behalf of AIB, I want to again express thanks to the committee for inviting us here today.  From our perspective, these engagements with the Oireachtas are a valuable means of explaining our position to the committee and to the broader public.  They allow space for debate and also provide us with a clear view of the opinions and expectations of the committee.</p><p>Once again, with the bank now profitable, our priorities are to maintain the focus on delivering a strong and sustainable financial performance, to be ready for an IPO when our shareholder decides, to continue to reduce impaired loans, to strongly support Ireland&rsquo;s economic growth and jobs and to keep our customers' needs at the heart of all our policies. </p><p> The Irish banking sector is an integral part of the Irish economic infrastructure.  In addition to supporting our indigenous industries, we play our role in establishing Ireland as the European location of choice for international investment.  I assure the committee my team and I will continue to build on the advances already secured by AIB and support our customers in the challenges ahead.  It is through the delivery of professional, efficient, reliable and experienced service that we intend to match our strong financial performance with a full redemption of customer trust in the bank.  We welcome the committee's questions.</p></speech>

I also welcome the information he has provided to the committee to help us in our endeavours this morning.  Will Mr. Byrne explain to us the information on page 6 of the document we have received?  We asked for data in tabular form on the total remuneration package for employees.  Mr. Byrne provided us with a table suggesting nobody had a total remuneration package in excess of &euro;500,000.  Mr. Byrne is well aware this is not totally true, given his package is &euro;587,000, as reported in the annual accounts, and Mr. Burke's is &euro;570,000.  Could it be suggested that the bank has tried to mislead the committee in the presentation of the facts, in answer to a very clear question on total remuneration?</p></speech>

The only pension contributions we have are defined contribution benefits.  In my case, my salary and package on an annualised basis, because last year contained a half-year number, is &euro;500,000, and I have a defined benefit contribution of 20% on top of this.  On a normalised basis this is &euro;500,000 plus &euro;100,000 which equals &euro;600,000.  For all other members of the bank their defined contribution rates vary from 12% to 20%, depending on individual circumstances.  The remuneration here is all cash, and all forms of annual pay have been included.</p></speech>

We ask very clearly for the total remuneration package.  The annual accounts have the total remuneration package.  We are aware of it, and we just wanted it for ease of access and reference.  The bank decided to exclude the pension part and did not state it is excluding it.  I will not dwell on it.</p></speech>

Is Mr. Byrne surprised or can he comment on the fact that Governor of the Central Bank went way beyond what the federation was looking for and got rid of the cap altogether?

Part of that referred to a limit or number.  We are part of that group but in overall terms I believe that number came from looking at the average first-time buyer property in terms of the pricing that was set and to move the limit from &euro;220,000, which seemed low relative to the experience in the market, to a level which reflected the experience in the market.  The guiding thought on that number was based on market practice more than anything else.  Based on quick observation of what the Central Bank has done, it has simplified the system even more than that.  Effectively, it has stuck with a 90% position and moved away from a property boundary on the loan-to-value, LTV, side, so it is creating an environment where a 90% mortgage for a first-time buyer on a LTV basis is okay.  It is important to remember that the loan-to-income, LTI, restriction will still be in place, so that will place a boundary on part of the criteria.  Affordability is central to everything and what has happened on the LTV side will certainly help in freeing up what was probably the major stalling point, as we would have seen it, in terms of the ability of people to gather deposits.  It has helped that piece.  However, the affordability piece in terms of incomes will still be in place.  It will take time to see how that plays out.  As a quick perspective on it, we believe it is helpful.  We believe it will help bridge the apparent real problem which was people's inability to gather deposits.  However, affordability is still central to this.  People will get closer access to a deposit but affordability will be key.</p></speech>

I will give him an example.  Let us say I am a first-time buyer who is borrowing from a body in the AIB group, such as EBS, and I wish to purchase a house for &euro;300,000.  The deposit I must put together now is &euro;9,000, which is 3%.  Obviously the loan-to-value ratio is 90%, the Government will give me 5%, which takes me up to 95%, and EBS will give me 2% back.  In effect, from a borrower's point of view, it is like a loan-to-value ratio of 97%.  We know that is not the reality but the reality for the borrower is that he or she is only required to have 3%.  Does Mr. Byrne think that is prudent?  That is close to a return to the 100% rates, which could allow for much more credit to flow and could have the impact of pushing house prices up again.  We have seen the house price increases in the last number of months.  Does Mr. Byrne believe we are likely to see a steady rise in house prices as a result of these moves?</p></speech>

There is an element of the pricing for first-time buyers, other things being equal, having to rise to attract supply into the market.  There will be two factors playing out and it will be difficult in the first six to 12 months to figure out which of them is happening.  One will be a move to a clearing price in terms of first-time properties and the second might well be price inflation as a result of a supply-demand imbalance still in the system.  In the short term one is likely to see prices rising.  Some of that is necessary to encourage supply to come forward and some of it will be simply a consequence of that shortage of supply for demand.  As a measure, it will encourage the development of first-time properties in a significant way.  That is something we will see playing out.  Property developers, and banks, will now be able to look at the market and see how properties can be moved into a consumer marketplace as consumers can get the deposit together, so they can construct.  The measure is likely to have a positive impact from that point of view.</p> <p>  The other positive measure in the Central Bank announcement yesterday is that it is clear from the Governor, Mr. Lane's speech and the actions of the Central Bank that the Central Bank will keep this under very close review.  There will be short-term and medium-term effects and then long-term effects.</p></speech>

We are approaching the end of this year and at the mid-point of the year there were 13,325 principal dwelling homes in mortgage arrears of 90 days or more.  Can Mr. Byrne give a best estimate of the breakdown of those figures?  How many of them are the hard core cases?  How many are there where there might be no option but to repossess the home or seek voluntary surrender?  How does he believe these will be resolved?  As I said to Mr. Byrne and his predecessors previously, it is deeply frustrating to see that there are still thousands of cases so long in arrears.  It is not just me pointing this out; other external agencies are doing so.  It is causing a drag on the bank and on the wider economy.  We must clear it up.  Can Mr. Byrne give an indication of what the position will be over the next 12 months with the huge level of arrears in his institution?</p></speech>

I will ask Jim O'Keeffe to give the Deputy a more detailed breakdown, but as we have progressed over the last number of years we have engaged in a significant process of trying to deal with issues as we have seen them.  On the mortgage side, as we have engaged with customers we have put 38,000 solutions in place.  We have written off &euro;1.3 billion of debt in an attempt to right size particular positions for home owners and property owners on mortgages who have engaged with us.  Our stance has always been that if somebody engages with us, gives us the disclosure and allows us to understand their affordability, we will right size the debt and come up with an answer.  That answer in many circumstances involves the right sizing of debt, and &euro;1.3 billion is the total write-off.  We think that will continue but we think there are a couple of categories that are starting to become very obvious.  Some of them are about people's inability to engage because they just have no affordability and, on the other hand, people's desire to stay out of the process because they see that as a better outcome than getting involved in the process.  Jim O'Keeffe will give some statistics.</p></speech>

As Bernard Byrne said, we have 38,000 mortgage restructures in place.  We have 13,000 customers who are post 90 days past due in our private dwelling or owner-occupier mortgages which, as the Deputy pointed out, is still a significant number of customers in difficulty.  The challenge for us is that it is about engagement.  We have been working very hard on engagement because we recognise that borrowers, for various reasons, find it difficult to engage with the bank.  We have worked with the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation, IMHO, StepChange and various organisations.  That engagement is critical to us working through this portfolio.  In the engagement we have had with the IMHO, where people feel that they can have independent engagement with ourselves, funded by ourselves, we have had almost 3,000 customers come through that and we have put solutions in place for over 2,500.  They would have been customers that we would have seen within the cadre of customers who were not willing to engage and work with us.</p><p>As the committee will see from the documentation, we have almost 7,000 customers out of the broad group of 13,000 that are at various stages of the legal process.  The legal process and repossession are a tiny part of the solution.  When we look at the scale of repossessions that have taken place, from our perspective, and on an industry level, compared to the amount of restructures that have happened, it is about 1%.  When one looks at the volume of restructures that have happened in the bank through 2015, for example, nearly 48,000 restructures occurred and close to 700 repossessions took place and some of those would have been voluntary.</p><p> Engagement is critical.  One can see from the list that we have a wide range of solutions.  Even in the legal process when we look back to 2015 we see that between 20% and 25% of that grouping re-engaged with us and in the vast majority of cases we were able to find solutions for them.  As we move forward what will be critical for everybody is that either directly with ourselves or through engagement with third parties, people are encouraged to come forward to the banks to find solutions.</p></speech>

Permanent TSB is also owned by the State and when one takes the properties owned by the two institutions, more than 1,000 houses are lying vacant at this point.  That is criminal in the extreme when we see figures released yesterday by the Dublin Region Homeless Executive and when we hear about rough sleepers.  There are multiple families in the hotel I stayed in last night.  A hotel room is now their home and has been for some months, and in some cases for years.  We must move in an aggressive way to ensure those houses are used to deal with people who are homeless.</p> <p>  This morning the Minister spoke about 200 houses in total being bought by the Housing Agency before the end of the year.  Can the bank do anything with the 569 houses to make sure they are used to deal with the housing crisis?</p></speech>

Absolutely.  We have had very significant engagement with the Housing Agency as a result of the broader initiatives.  The Deputy referred to this morning's announcement about 200 houses.  We are clearly a significant part of that.  We have made available the full listing of the 500 properties to the Housing Agency and we are working actively to make sure we see the process come through with the agency.  We share the Deputy&rsquo;s concerns in that regard.  We have had much engagement with the Department.  In the short and medium term we will make up a considerable percentage of the flow of houses into social housing.</p></speech>

Given that we pumped &euro;21 billion into the bank, I believe AIB should announce today to the committee that the 569 houses will be made available immediately to deal with the pressures experienced by people who are in emergency accommodation.  The houses are lying vacant.  It is not enough to make them available for the Housing Agency to buy, but that the bank would do the right thing, even if we did not pump &euro;21 billion into the bank.</p> <p>  In terms of the 3,000 customers who are expected to receive redress from being moved off tracker mortgages, is that number still accurate and is the provision which has been spoken about of &euro;105 million still relevant?  Could the witnesses inform the committee from their trawl of tracker mortgages how many have been moved off them or have not been allowed to go back on them?  Has AIB assessed how many people have lost their home as a result of them not having a tracker mortgage?</p></speech>

We have never come out with a number so any numbers that are in the system are media numbers.  The number mentioned by Deputy Doherty is not one we have ever used.</p> <p>  Last August we started a programme to look at whether there was an issue in the bank associated with tracker mortgages.  As we developed through the programme we determined that there was an issue and there are two parts to it.  One is that in certain situations customers had, or should have reasonably been entitled to think, that they had a contractual right to a tracker.  The second part is that there is probably a larger group of those we confused, or where the documentation was confusing or our communication with them was misleading.  There are those two cohorts.  As the work progressed, the Central Bank came out with a framework in December and we brought the two programmes together.  In July we announced that we were starting to communicate with the first group of customers that we had brought through the whole programme at that stage and we put them on to the correct rate.  The number of customers we are talking about in that circumstance is approximately 2,600.</p> <p>  As we have progressed, this month we are engaging with customers in terms of actually fixing those balances.  We changed the rate and now we are fixing the balances and before the year end, in respect of those customers we expect to have resolved all items and issues, subject to the fact that they have appeals rights and that there may be other issues that need to be investigated.  In respect of that group, which is the majority of the customers, we expect to be through that, so it is a slightly different number but I am just giving the context of where we are at.  We have not completed all of the work in respect of that at this stage and it will run into the early part of next year in terms of conclusion of that programme.</p> <p>  The provision that we have we announced last year and we still remain confident it is the correct provision so we have no change in respect to it.  Based on the work we have done at this point in time our assessment, knowing what we know - we have not fully engaged with all of the customers so we do not know everything - in respect of people's homes, where the rate was an issue, we might have 14 customers where the home was lost as a result of the rate.</p> <p>  If I could add the context to that, because I think it is relevant, one of the reasons that we have written off &euro;1.3 billion of debt and mortgage loans is that as we have engaged with customers, we have tried to right size their loan based on affordability.  In situations where they could not afford the whole debt we therefore did a write off.  So the historic rate that existed on the product was not hugely relevant all the time in terms of the position that they were in.  If they were in a modest amount of arrears or they could not afford the repayment we looked at a different solution, so a split mortgage, for example, would not have looked at the existing product offering, it looked at affordability and we tried to see whether we could do something.</p> <p>  In order to make sure that we were clear on the boundaries of what we were trying to do and not to make another mistake, problem and loss to the customer, we effectively expanded our definition of the criteria to apply for those products.  Our solution for the 14 customers, which is the position as we know it at the moment, is based on an assessment that asks whether they would have been entitled to a forbearance solution.  All of them would have a problem under any solution, and if we were applying a more expanded definition, a bigger boundary to that forbearance solution, would we have been able to come up with an answer which may have allowed us to progress?  That is the full context to the number we have at the moment but until we conclude I will not be able to say definitively where we are at, but for the sake of the committee, that is where we are at today.</p></speech>

AIB has a very competitive SVR, and that must be acknowledged.</p> <p>  I do wish to ask about EBS and the reason the previous time AIB announced a rate cut, which took effect on 1 July, a corresponding cut was not applied to existing EBS customers.  If one looks at the table AIB has provided on page 4 of the questionnaire there is a difference of between 0.2% and 0.3% in the rate.  Existing EBS customers feel very aggrieved.  Could Mr. Byrne please address that issue?</p></speech>

If one looks at the overall book of Irish rates versus European rates, in all banks not just AIB, we are right on the average in terms of the European zone in total book when one takes the pricing.  Some markets are higher, for example, France, Germany and the UK, and some markets are lower.</p><p>On a front book pricing basis, Irish pricing is higher than the European average, but the features of the market are very different.  For example, in many European countries, the imposition of fees upfront has a significant impact.  The European average is about 43 basis points.  In France, it is 87 basis points if the effect of upfront fees is annualised across.  Different markets operate in different ways.  In the Irish market, this manifested itself in banks offering a significant upfront benefit in the form of a cashback offer.  For our core AIB franchise, we felt it right to continue to offer the front and back book benefit in terms of the customers' positions.  Any time we make a change to the SVR, we spread it across the customer base.  This costs us about &euro;140 million in benefit to the customers.  However, the feature of the market attracting particular interest was the cashback offer, which does not come without a cost.  The 2% cashback offer comes at a cost to one's position.  Effectively, we differentiated the two offerings we had on the market and positioned EBS as a cashback offer for customers for whom cashback is very important and who wanted a cashback position.  Interestingly, the changes about which we talked earlier may have an impact on the relative attractiveness of this product in the future.  Pretty much all the competitors were offering cashback at the time.  We then tried to facilitate switching, if this was important to the customer and was what he or she wished to do, from an EBS brand to AIB.  It was not a perfect measure but it was our attempt to match customer choice in the two relevant offerings in the market and to facilitate switching via a benefit of &euro;2,000.  If one wanted to move from one to the other, one could.</p></speech>

We cannot implement a back book price change and not implement a front book price change in EBS.  Neither can we do the reverse.  We have an EBS brand offer which is based on a cashback and a better SVR.  We have implemented three price cuts in respect of this in the marketplace which is appealing to certain customers.</p></speech>

Our understanding is that other institutions do not disclose the information in this way.  I could be wrong, but we have examined and tracked this.  The one other issue which could have had an impact on this in the period is the subordinated liabilities, that is, the contingent convertible bond, CoCo, which is included in that for the period and which is the higher cost.  I would have to examine the detail of the reconciliation.  That may have had an impact.</p></speech>

This is the bank's pricing strategy, presumably, which is quite different to Bank of Ireland's, which has kept its variable rate high and opted for lower fixed rates.  AIB has reduced its variable rates.  Its fixed rates are slightly higher than its variable rates.  This is a very deliberate policy.</p></speech>

The initiatives we have taken so far have been focused on standard variable rates.  We have reduced fixed rate pricing and we will keep all those rates under review, but our focus at this stage is definitely on variable rates.  I do not know if Mr. Mulhall wants to say anything about that.</p></speech>

As he said earlier, our commitment here is to pass on the benefit of the reduced cost of funding to our customers.  We have credentials in this regard, given the four basis cuts we have implemented over the past two years.  I think this is also reflected in the buying behaviour of the customers.  Over 60% of our new mortgage business comes in on our variable rate.  It is attractive to the customer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.2622" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1223" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016112400002#K02000"><p>I make the general point that it is instructive that, though AIB has a higher cost of funds and blended cost of funds, it has managed to reduce its variable rate to effectively the lowest in the market, whereas other banks that have a much lower cost of funds stand over much higher variable rates.  This proves the point that there is scope in the case of a number of other banks to reduce their rates.</p> <p>  I want to raise the issue of the tracker redress programme.  I have a copy before me of the clause in the mortgage contract in which it is clearly stated that at the end of the fixed interest rate period, the customer may choose from a further fixed interest rate period, conversion to a variable interest rate or conversion to a tracker interest rate mortgage loan.  It is the customer's choice.  However, those who choose the tracker option are being offered a rate of 3.67% plus ECB.  Many customers feel that this is an arbitrary rate which is broadly in line with AIB's variable rate offering, even slightly more expensive.  Can the witnesses explain the rationale behind this and why AIB is not offering such customers what would be regarded as a prevailing tracker rate in the market today of roughly 1%?</p></speech>

The rates for this are between 0.49% and 1.5% - they vary depending on their original position - plus ECB.  All customers about whom we have spoken to date have been in that position.</p></speech>

They are spread across both brands.  Furthermore, as Mr. Byrne alluded to, we are considering many different cohorts in the redress programme for these 2,600 customers.  In many cases we have examined marketing materials, anything that could have been misinterpreted by the customers or communications in which we were not totally transparent about customers' rights should they ever come off a fixed rate and want to go back onto a tracker rate, etc.  It is not that everybody is in that category that he describes-----</p></speech>

The case to which I refer is quite specific.  The customer could choose a tracker rate at the end of the fixed rate period.  There are no new tracker products to choose from, so this is down to interpretation, but one can certainly argue that the customer is entitled to the current tracker rate.</p></speech>

Its root cause dates back to 2008 when trackers were withdrawn.  At that time, the bank did not do a good enough job of understanding the confusion, whether customers' rights were being infringed or we were not communicating with customers in this regard.  As Deputy McGrath quite correctly pointed out, among our contract holders were customers who could go onto a variable rate, fixed rate or prevailing tracker rate.  When we withdrew the tracker product, there was no prevailing tracker rate.  That was an error.  We should have reinstigated what a prevailing tracker rate at that time should have been.  This is what has created this moment of confusion.</p></speech>

However, AIB is not offering that to the customers who now choose a tracker.  It is down to interpretation.</p></speech>

We mentioned in our opening statement the position we adopted as we tried to address the very high level of non-performing loans we had.  Over the past five or six years, we have engaged significantly with customers.  As I have indicated, there has been &euro;1.3 billion of write-offs on the mortgage side.  A similar volume of write-offs has taken place across SME and other portfolios as we have tried to address this issue.  We have successfully reduced the balance to &euro;11 billion and we have indicated that this figure will be closer to &euro;10 billion by the end of the year, which is great.  However, non-performing loans will still comprise 17% of the bank's balance sheet.  The European norm is approximately 5.5%.  The primary issue of focus for the ECB and the regulatory authorities is the level of non-performing loans on a bank's balance sheet.  The stress tests we mentioned earlier make that very obvious when they focus on the capital position of the banks.  For that reason, we emphasised in our opening statement that it is of the utmost strategic importance that we continue to address this topic.  I suppose that is consistent with Deputy Pearse Doherty's comments.  The level of arrears remains very high.  It must be addressed and dealt with.  It was in that context that I said we are keeping all options under active review at this time.  I include the options that have been mentioned, such as portfolio sales and disposals, if appropriate, in that context.  Any attempt in that direction will focus on commercial portfolios in the first instance.  We are continuing to work as hard as we can on the private dwelling house portfolio and other portfolios.  This issue will have to be addressed.  A famous investor, Warren Buffett, once said that if something cannot last forever, it will end.  The ECB's view is that the number of non-performing loans in Irish banks must be reduced.  If this issue is not resolved, the consequences in terms of capital, etc., will be very significant and that will feed through to pricing.</p></speech>

By my calculation, some 5,729 mortgages fall under the categories covered in the first four lines of the box at the top of page 3.  The four categories are issuing of a civil bill at the court; civil bill served on the borrower; court hearing in progress; and, order granted for repossession.  It seems to me that the number of mortgages at such advanced legal stages on the path to repossession is quite high.  I assume that the 1,788 mortgages referred to in the following box are separate and are not included in the 5,729 mortgages referred to in the box at the top of the page.</p></speech>

If these 7,500 mortgages are added to the 569 mortgages and the 722 mortgages in the previous box, it is clear almost 9,000 properties have been repossessed or, in the majority of cases, are well down the road to being repossessed.  Is AIB pursuing this approach as a means of triggering engagement?  The number of properties that are well on the road to being repossessed seems very high.  I suggest it is much higher than would have been expected.</p></speech>

The overall number is a consequence of where we are in the process at this time and the volume of cases we have been dealing with through the process.   The number mentioned by the Deputy must be seen in the context of the number of solutions that have been put in place and have been successful.  Many of the issues that are seen on the voluntary side refer to specific cases that have been worked through with the customer, and in respect of which deals have been done and agreements have been reached about debt write-offs and relieving people of future obligations.  That has been helpful in this context.  There is a legal element to this because as part of the process, we must make constant progress through the process.  We end up in that circumstance when people do not engage.  As Mr. O'Keeffe mentioned earlier, the legal approach sometimes has a positive effect in terms of re-engagement.  It is also a necessary phase in terms of how we make progress.  The time periods, in terms of bringing these cases to a conclusion, tend to be very significant.</p></speech>

At the start of this, we had almost 40,000 private dwelling house customers in arrears.  This has taken a considerable amount of time.  It has not been a one-year event.  The legal cohort has probably built up over six, seven or eight years.  That is an important point.  The most significant category mentioned by the Deputy is "court hearing in progress".  It is important to point out that it takes a considerable amount of time to work through that progress.  I advise the Deputy not to take these figures as an indication that a large number of repossessions is coming through the pipeline.  Based on the way the system is operating currently, that is not how it will work out.  Approximately 1,600 customers within the grouping mentioned by the Deputy are re-engaging with us.  We are working with them at the moment.  If they continue to engage with us, we will work through their cases and find solutions for them so that they can exit the legal process.  As I said earlier, we have positive outcomes in that regard.</p></speech>

When the bank reaches the point at which it is looking at court proceedings in respect of homes owned by families, obviously all other options have been worked through by the bank with those customers.  Has it seen any schemes in any other jurisdiction or country that the Government could adopt here?  Could the Government intervene through a voluntary housing agency to take up these homes and prevent families from becoming homeless if court proceedings are successful?  When the banks have exhausted their efforts, some sort of Government scheme could assist families that are otherwise going to become homeless.  The mortgage-to-rent scheme is not working.

I confirm that from our perspective we see the mortgage-to-rent scheme as a very good solution and work-through and we are very much engaged in trying to make it work.  There was an additional item at that point which was referred to as the mortgage-to-lease scheme.  That is more in keeping with a wider scheme of being able to attract a portfolio of customers rather than just taking it individually, case by case.  We remain positive that this is an option.  As we mentioned earlier, there are various discussions on initiatives around housing with Government and we are actively working on the basis that if we can contribute to something like that, we would be very willing to do so.</p></speech>

Is it through the federation, directly with the Minister for Finance or by some other method?</p></speech>

On a particular set of initiatives around housing, that is falling into an engagement with the Department, at its behest, in terms of seeking arranged solutions, one of which we spoke about earlier, namely, vacant properties and movement in that regard.  It is very much a request coming to engage with the Department and we are very comfortable about doing so and about talking through what might be the practical implications of implementing such a scheme.</p></speech>

In terms of treatment of customers in that regard, once a customer gets into difficulty, we have a standard treatment policy across the bank regardless of the brand or the way one was originated into one's mortgage.  There is no bias in respect of why we would be moving customers from EBS or AIB into a legal process.  We deal with them consistently across the two.  If there was a bias in terms of the numbers, it would only be on the basis of how many customers got into difficulty.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.2666" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016112400002#M00800"><p>My point on that process is that I have come across cases of customers - not just in my constituency but also in the context of approaches at national level - who are certainly unable to repay their debts.  They then find themselves in court.  It seems that not every avenue has been examined in respect of some of those cases.  I can give Mr. O'Keeffe examples but I do not want to go into the details.  I am surprised that the cases in question are before the courts.  Despite intervention to try to explain the situation through intermediaries, they remain before the courts.  In other words, when the bank passes them to its legal representatives, they just take a course and end up either with a registrar or in the Circuit Court and it is impossible for some of them to be represented properly in those courts.  They have to apply for free legal aid, which further adds to their distress and upset because they are dragged through all of this process without the appropriate supports in terms of solicitors and everything else.  There must be something wrong with the process if cases like that end up with the registrar or the Circuit Court.</p> <p>  There is something wrong with the fact that when the bank passes its cases to its legal representatives, it becomes an inflexible process that just closes down in the interest of pushing the proceedings through the courts.  Has the bank examined that matter?  A number of Deputies and Senators attend these courts and what goes on is shocking.  I have also said it to the Bank of Ireland that it is difficult to believe that such cases would be taking place in light of all the discussion we have had about saving family homes and working through all the options.  One particular case comes to mind and I must set it out.  The case in question involves two brothers living together, one of whom is now attending the department of psychiatry and has been for years.  He is still getting letters from the bank's legal representatives despite the fact that it has torn his life asunder.  His brother is now on the verge of the same thing.  I am just asking the bank to review the process.</p></speech>

If there are any issues that anyone has at any point in time, we always have review and appeals processes to do that.  Please feel free to do that.  It is important to point out the number of mechanisms that are in place to help people, whether it is a MABS solution, the IHMO or some other solution.  They are available and we engage as actively as we possibly can with them.  We do not benefit and it is not helpful to us in terms to have a legal process given how long it takes where repossessions go through.</p> <p>  The Chairman made an opening comment, which I understand, around whether there is something else that can happen when people have gone through everything they can.  The reality is that in the majority of cases that end up in legal, people have gone through nothing because they have not engaged with us.  As Mr. O'Keeffe mentioned, the 2,800 cases sitting in court are there because there has been zero engagement.  Yet, when we finally get up into a legal process, 1,600, or the majority of those cases, actually begin to engage.  We are dealing with a complex situation.  There are always going to be cases where situations are misunderstood by us.  We have made mistakes and if there are any of those, please tell us.  We will see whether we are doing the right thing or the wrong thing.  However, if people do not engage with us and are not fully involved or participating or using one of the agencies that exist to engage with us if they find engagement with the bank too difficult, it is going to be tricky for us to progress.</p></speech>

In fact, all one gets is "It is now with our legal representatives".  In his opening statement, Mr. Byrne said he was conscious of the need to treat customers fairly.  It may be that the bank has treated them fairly but now they are dumped onto the legal system and their cases are not being understood.</p></speech>

As I mentioned at the beginning, 20% to 24% of customers re-engaged with us last year out of the legal process.  We have an absolute ability to work with people who are in the legal process and who want to re-engage.  They can do that directly with ourselves.</p></speech>

It is only in the past 20 minutes or so that we have got to the crux of some of the problems coming down the line in terms of the number of people who can expect to lose their homes in the next year, albeit I recognise the efforts the bank says it is making to engage.  The pressure to bring non-performing loans from 17% to the European average of 5% paints a stark reality for those who are struggling to pay their mortgages.  There is a conflict there in terms of saying that the bank is engaging with customers and is going to help everybody when the further it gets down the line, the more difficult it is going to get.  I appreciate that the bank has worked with people to restructure loans.  It is not only AIB.  The situation is presented by the banks across the board, which makes me very fearful in terms of what is going to happen in 2017 and 2018.</p><p>Should we be in a position in which quantitative easing finishes and interest rates begin to rise, there will be further pressure on families.</p><p> Deputy Doherty referred to the 596 houses in AIB's possession.  The delegates are saying the bank is making them available.  In the past 12 months, how many properties have been made available by AIB to the Government or local authorities?</p></speech>

Previously we worked with a grouping of 24 to 30 houses.  I would have to confirm that and revert to the Senator.  The number was not of the current scale.  It is partly attributable to the fact that we did not have vacant property available at the current scale bearing in mind what we were doing at the time in question.  I reinforce the point that we very much welcome the opportunity to work this through now because we see the opportunity to address the social housing need.</p></speech>

The sale of properties would be done on a market basis or through the housing authority.  It would obviously be done on a valuation basis.  That will continue to be a process.  We are not seeing any move into private equity.</p></speech>

We often end up talking a lot about one particular type of asset class at these meetings, namely, personal homes.  It is very important to note that these comprise just one type of asset we have worked through.  We have lowered the figure from &euro;30 billion to &euro;11 billion, which is a &euro;19 billion reduction.  We are talking about a reduction of probably &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion more.  It is approximately one third of what we have done already.  It is a much smaller number.  In many scenarios, we end up having conversations on the impending doom associated with repossessions.  In reality, that does not transpire because there are developments, people engage and they move to a different position.  It is always important to bear in mind where we are.  We do need to solve the problem; that is the important point.  We accept that there is a set of solutions.</p> <p>  Mr. Burke will contextualise the mix of assets we are talking about.  Those are the assets we think about in broad terms.  As I have mentioned, if we were to engage in any portfolio sale - no decision has been made - it would be across commercial portfolios in the first instance.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Keeffe spoke about his reality.  Mine is that I attend the court sittings around the country and see the human casualties and the children being put out of their homes.  We are already in the middle of a massive housing crisis.  What is occurring with the banks and repossessions could further the crisis next year.  AIB's having 569 houses in its possession creates difficulties, therefore.   I have several other questions and do not want to dwell too much on that.</p></speech>

We made the full list available.  We have concluded the sale or transfer of 114 of those properties.  Probably another 80 will be transferred before the year end.  If our expectations are correct, there may be 600 or 700 in the following year.  That is a big part of our plan in trying to address the various aspects as far as we can as a bank.</p> <p>  On Mr. Byrne's point on dealing with our entire impaired loan portfolio, we have reduced the figure from approximately &euro;29 billion to approximately &euro;10 billion at year end.  At year end, &euro;3.7 billion of that &euro;10 billion would pertain to private dwellings while the remainder would be split between commercial property and personal SME non-property business.  We have to get down to the &euro;3 billion level.  We can get a huge amount of that distance simply by dealing with the non-private dwelling home asset portfolios that are non-performing.</p></speech>

The current process is not working for either, in reality, although there are many customers in the process.  As I said, when one looks back at 2015, one notes that 1.5% of restructurings were repossessions.  Any of us would welcome a system that would operate differently in terms of how we go about this.  We do not have any details on that but, as it emerges, we will certainly be very willing to engage.</p> <p>  On the court system deciding what the solution would be, I do not have the specifics on how it would operate.  Mortgages are secured lending so the point we would need to understand is how that could have an impact.  Clearly, mortgage pricing is done on the basis that it is secured lending.  The unintended consequence of giving a court a power, if it were to weaken the construct of secured lending, is that there could be a feed-through in regard to pricing.  I do not have the details on it.  It is just an observation we have made based on what we have seen to date.  Certainly, anything that would help to move the system on for all parties would be beneficial.  The Chairman mentioned the distress people rightly feel as they are going through the legal process owing to the toughness of the system.  We would be very willing to engage with it.</p></speech>

It is a solution we put in place to try to help that situation.  Clearly, from the Senator's description, there are days or scenarios where it is difficult for people because of the weather.  In overall terms, as part of an overall solution, it is an effective way for us to get to parts of the country that in no other circumstance we would be able to maintain banking in.</p></speech>

I cannot imagine that those branches, with two or three staff, were producing huge overheads to service communities.  AIB closed them down.  It was not offering a solution to people.  AIB closed them down without consultation with the very people who propped up the banks.  There are people in rural areas who are elderly and do not have broadband.  Mr. Byrne referred earlier to 50% of people engaging digitally because they are forced to but it also means there is 50% who are not engaging digitally and who have to queue up at these mobile units without any protection from the weather.  How much has AIB saved by closing these branches and putting these units in place?</p></speech>

We had an obligation under the EU programme to take &euro;450 million of operating costs out of the business.  As part of that programme, we closed approximately 30% of the branch network in terms of number of units.  The solution we implemented was around those closures.  I will ask Mr. Mulhall to talk about the impact in terms of the local market and what we are trying to do around that.  The &euro;450 million programme was part of our EU restructuring plan.</p></speech>

In many cases, the private banking debt being nationalised led to these and other people losing their jobs.</p></speech>

It was regrettable that we had to embark on that branch closure programme after the financial crisis but a very important dimension to this story is that we entered into an agreement with An Post at the time to offer full banking services in 1,100 post offices across the country.  We are the only bank doing that.  It was a key part of our continued commitment to rural Ireland and ensuring we were continuing to provide services in that regard.  It should be recognised that as we look at the migration of transactions to digital, there is an unstoppable force there in terms of the level of transactions that are now being executed over online, mobile, etc.  It is not just a young person's fascination; it is across the full demographic of the population of customers we serve.  We do regular customer experience surveys with our customers to determine the level of service we are offering.  Our customer service continues to improve in that regard.</p></speech>

We do not see that as the main solution.  We see the solution as the investment in the digital offering and the An Post franchise so we continue to offer services in many communities all across the country.  Mr. Bernard Byrne referenced in his opening statement that we have recently done a reorganisation within our distribution franchise around local markets.  This is all part of our commitment to ensuring we are absolutely part of the community and that we continue to provide that service to the community.  We have reorganised our distribution around the county construct.  We have created accountability around senior people within each county to ensure they carry the flag of AIB across all the services we offer in that county.  It is not just about branch banking.  It is as much about putting in place mobile sales forces and mobile relationship managers that can go to the place of business of customers who want us to visit them such as the agri-sector population.  That has been hugely successful for us as we look at how we shape our distribution going forward.</p></speech>

AIB used to be a community bank.  I have experience of AIB in Britain and it was a community bank that engaged with its customers.  It is removing itself further and further from that customer base.  It is ignoring people in rural areas.  I ask the witnesses to look at that again.  We are trying to get the Government to use the CSO survey to ask people their opinions on banking and the banking services they need.  I welcome that AIB is looking at giving more autonomy to branch managers.  I can see AIB is doing something but I ask that it looks again at some of the branches that have been closed down.</p> <p>  In terms of the bank overall, is it ready for selling off now?</p></speech>

One of the key features that matter from an IPO point of view is the investor appetite for the marketplace.  Ireland is an attractive market relative to other jurisdictions.  It still has a higher growth rate, a younger demographic and is seen as an attractive location from a European point of view.  That is positive.  Another feature is the strength of our banking franchise.  Approximately 40% of the marketplace is seen as attractive as a growth opportunity and that is given we have a disproportionate share of younger customers.  The fact we have restructured the bank and are delivering profitability is seen as attractive and is still giving an opportunity for growth going forward.  The next phase of any development is to make sure people are comfortable with the capital.  At this stage people are comfortable with the capital and can see how the bank is generating a return on that capital.  The final element, which is a very important one, is the market dynamic, which is influenced by a whole series of things.  It is influenced by an interest rate environment which is low at the moment.  It is influenced by a view on Europe, Brexit, the US elections and the sort of things which introduce volatility.  It is also influenced by a view on the regulatory regime and its likely impacts.  They are all decisions that investors make independent of us.  We have nothing to do with that.  Our job is to position the franchise so it is attractive and growing.  Across pretty much all of those segments we are growing our market share and delivering a higher level of performance than peers, which means the answer to the Senator's question is "Yes".</p></speech>

I could give the Senator arguments either way.  It will be a Government decision but given the position of the bank and the fact that markets are volatile and will remain volatile for a period of time, the sense, as we understand it, of selling a piece of the bank at this stage and then maintaining a sell-out over time gives optionality.  That means the bank can avail of market opportunity when it arises.  I can certainly see the merits and wisdom of the strategy as described.  Does Mr. Bourke want to add anything?</p></speech>

The big issue at the moment is in the area of mortgages and first-time buyers.  I want to go through the practicalities.  Am I correct in saying that in answer to questions Nos. 9 and 10 in the questionnaire the witnesses provided us with, they say that the loan-to-value ratio for first-time buyers is 80% and the average mortgage for a first-time buyer is about &euro;175,000?  If that represents 80%, then the value is about &euro;219,000, which is below the &euro;220,000 limit.  Is that circumstantial?</p></speech>

In other words, the number of people who make it through will be based on the rules that exist at this point in time.  It should not be circumstantial, it should be evidential of the rules being applied.</p><p>Therefore, it is not a sign of pent-up demand or issues that did not make it through.  It should not be seen as pointing to there being no bigger market because the statistics do not support that.  We think there is more demand but the rules led to this conclusion.</p></speech>

I do not know how much higher it is in Dublin but it gets us past the &euro;220,000 threshold, which has probably been a constraint for first-time buyers in Dublin.  There are a number of factors in regard to the macroprudential rules.  We welcome the new rules as a welcome relief for first-time buyers who are trying to accumulate deposits while also paying rent and we think this will accelerate the journey for them, making it a welcome initiative for everyone.  However, our first decision criterion is affordability.  After we assess that, we apply the criteria of loan-to-income and loan-to-value.</p></speech>

One will be on the confidence of the entire chain.  The developer side, the builder side and those who finance the builder can now see how consumers can afford to get the deposit together to buy.  That is a very significant issue and should mean the supply side has the confidence to start.  The second impact is that the very long period for which people had to save, as well as renting when rents were rising very rapidly, will reduce very significantly and this will broaden the range of people who have access to deposits.  People will not have to rely on others to gift them a deposit but will have the income to get one and that will have a societal benefit.  It will also have a benefit from our point of view because it opens the field up to a wider group of people, namely, those who have good sustainable income but were struggling to find the deposit.  That is my interpretation of how events will play out but they will unfold in the way they unfold.</p></speech>

If it was in a marketplace where we did not have a strong position, such as the UK, we would not be particularly interested at this point in time.  Our key focus points are in delivering better propositions in the Irish market and reducing the cost to serve in the Irish market.  The key issue for investment and, ultimately, the attraction of capital - not just equity capital but debt capital, which is going to be increasingly important - depends on getting the cost-income ratio below 50%.  It was said earlier that to pass benefits on to the customer one must operate efficiently.  There is no point in having a higher or lower interest margin if one has a very significant cost base and one has to take the cost base down to pass on benefits to customers and to be competitive.  The board has just had a strategy meeting and we are focusing on our core markets and trying to get more efficient.</p></speech>

That was the last dividend in the form of recurring income.  Obviously, that capital is now restructured.  At this point in time, we are engaged in a discussion with the regulator and our shareholder, namely, the Department of Finance, on how, having restructured the capital of the bank and established sustainable profitability, do we get to a position where we can re-establish returns on equity capital, namely, dividends.  We are in that process but there are a number of pieces to that which play out and need to be progressed.</p></speech>

It will have progressed from the last disclosed numbers we have.  While provision for principal dwelling houses is slightly lower and for others is slightly higher, one can assume that on average, it is about a 50% provision level.  Gross loans provided a provision level of 50% on impaired loans.  We would expect that to maintain itself as we continue down the gross side of this equation.  Those provisions are required at this point in time and are necessary for us to implement solutions to right-size debt and get people back into a sustainable debt position.  There is a significant amount of scrutiny that takes place in those.  A key area of concern of the European Central Bank is the level of provision we hold in respect of those.</p> <p>  We understand it is a large number.  Unfortunately, with a big balance sheet one ends up with every number being big.  Our objective is to get that number down appreciably.  It will be coming down because the gross number comes down and then the net number.</p></speech>

Given the change that has taken place on the loan-to-value piece, I can see the logic of leaving the 3.5 times rule in place to see what emerges, given that it has a natural dampening effect on affordability, which is probably a good thing.  I can see exactly why the Government and the Central Bank have made that call.  As I said earlier, it is clear that they will keep it under active review.  If it turns out to be an issue, we should all assume all these mechanisms will be capable of being amended if there is too much exuberance in the market or if the Government thinks it is acting as too much of a dampener.</p></speech>

We will consider exceptions only in the eventuality where somebody qualifies from an affordability perspective.  Then, we consider an exception.  One enhancement down the road could be having exceptions on a rolling 12-month basis rather than on a calendar year basis.  This could be easier to manage.  As Mr. Byrne said, if one finds oneself at a point on a cycle in which exceptions are high in a particular calendar year, it may curtail one's ability to lend in the second half of the year, which is unhealthy.

Are we to read from this that nobody who applied to the bank was deemed affordable but could not get the lending because of the rules?

As I said, we first examine our own affordability rules and then determine whether exceptions are required.  The statistics the Deputy quoted are overall industry statistics.

One in five of the value of all loans the bank will issue can be above the loan-to-value ratio of 80%.  How does the bank inform customers that they may be entitled to it?  Say, a person who wants to trade up is examining these calculations and wants to buy a house which costs &euro;300,000.  The person calculates that he or she needs a deposit of &euro;60,000 and, therefore, decides to forget about it, not knowing that for every five loans the bank issues, one of them can be above the ratio and this person could be that one person.  How does the bank communicate, advertise and select the individual who will be able to go above the loan-to-value thresholds set by the Central Bank?</p></speech>

This is done through a very intensive engagement with our customers in terms of ensuring they understand the process.  As part of it, we will discuss exceptions if they are appropriate at this point.  I would not offer it as the perfect solution, given that the awareness of exceptions probably has dampened people's desire to even come and ask the question.  As the debate has emerged more and more in the public domain, there has been increase in the number of people who will come and engage, whereas otherwise they would probably never have thought to come in the first place.  The Deputy's point is well made and is a very fair question.  The awareness is probably growing as opposed to being perfect.</p></speech>

The number of sanctions has been increasing regularly since 2014.  Can the witnesses explain why the level of drawdowns is so weak in comparison to the level of sanctions?  In the context of the idea that we need to create more demand, one third of the loans the bank has authorised have not been drawn down in the first quarter.  I know there is a timing issue, but across a three-year period, approximately one third of loans are not being drawn down.</p></speech>

Our final division was at 2.45 a.m.  For my sins, I read the Central Bank's document afterwards.  It is very sad.  I was waiting for my "Morning Ireland" interview and I thought if I fell asleep I might pull a Conor Lenihan, so I decided I was better to try to stay awake.</p><p>There was an issue with the risks of the bank.  It is stated in the Central Bank document that the concentration of lending to residential and commercial real estate represents a vulnerability.  It states:</p><blockquote>Approximately 65% of Irish Banks loan portfolios are accounted for by residential mortgages while a further 11% are for commercial real estate.  Coupled with the outstanding vulnerabilities in the household sector and still high proportion of households in negative equity it is clear that Irish banks remain vulnerable to any reversal in trends in real estate prices.</blockquote><p>I always knew about that vulnerability in terms of prices, and I am particularly concerned about a reversal of prices in commercial property.  In regard to the concentration of lending for AIB, where does the bank sit?  The Central Bank is stating that across the banking sector, 65% of the loan portfolios are for residential mortgages while 11% are commercial.  I have been thinking about this.  I sat on the banking inquiry, and I now wonder how this was seen in the context of Anglo Irish Bank, which was a monoline bank?  If we have banks that are so heavily concentrated on property loans, we have numerous banks, which have similar practices to the former Anglo Irish Bank. </p></speech>

That will be a feature of the market place.  If one has very large investment banks that take different positions in different exposures, one might end up as an industry with a different type of position but when one gets down to simplified banking structures a large part of the portfolio will be property related because that is where people make investment decisions.</p> <p>  Our model, however, has a certain benefit.  There is one other player in the market who would have a similar characteristic, that we have a range of different offerings from a business-corporate perspective as well as different types of personal lending.  While we will have a more balanced position than the one Deputy Doherty described, we will still have a heavy concentration associated with residential and property related loans taken out during the boom and thus the bust.  We ended up with too much exposure to other types of property related exposure even outside residential mortgages.  Our own risk limits prevent us from getting back into those sorts of positions.  One of our objectives is to ensure we grow a more diversified portfolio in terms of that position.  However, residential mortgages will be a large feature of the Irish markets as they will be a large feature of any market that has a simplified non-investment bank type structure.  One does not get the other portfolios of investments through that model.</p></speech>

We are at the sub 50% level on Irish mortgages, but mortgages as a total when we take in everything is well over the 50% mark.

At this point in time that is much lower down the list and the surveys that exist will support this.  From our point of view, what we have done and what we continue to try to do is deal with the speed at which credit decisions get made.  One of the key issues that has affected people is decisions taking a very long time, which they interpreted as a slow "No", but not giving a person a decision at all.  Hence our commitment, and we mentioned it in the opening address, to the turnaround times for small loans, that is a loan for under &euro;30,000, which is 90% of all SMEs loans, is 48 hours.  Our approval rate for SME loans is 94%.  </p> <p>  Basically, we are saying that SMEs should apply, it is a very short process, the document that an AIB customer has to fill out is very small, about three or four pages.  We are encouraging AIB customers to fill out the application and we can track what happens.  If the SME customer does not like the bank's decision, there are many mechanisms available, both internal to the bank and also the Credit Review Office.  There is professional machinery that works and will deal with the customer when a loan decision or an investment is declined.  We will always work, and have always worked with the decision of the Credit Review Office and implemented the solution that has come out of that process.  </p> <p>  The numbers that take those routes are very low, but it is very difficult to deal with the anecdote.  It is very difficult to deal with people who say they did not apply because they knew the bank would say "No".  In terms of encouragement to people, the first priority should be for them to apply for a loan.  I would not be too concerned if our approval rates dropped because more people applied.  At least that would be evidence and information with which we could do something.  The first issue is to try to ensure that everyone applies.  If we the bank end up saying "No", there is an appeals process and a Credit Review Office.  That is important. </p> <p>  In the second point about the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, we engage very actively with it and in terms of its loans, we put in place a &euro;200 million facility.  We utilised it very quickly and then we actually drew down another &euro;200 million, that is &euro;400 million in total.  The last time I saw a statistic on it, some 90% of all the loans that were being sanctioned through SBCI were through AIB.  We have the highest level of penetration by far of any bank.  We have embraced it.  As I also mentioned in my statement, we are working on the agri-fund at this stage which will have subsidised funding and we hope to be the first to market with that fund.</p></speech>

Ireland was not the only country to have a banking crisis.  It was global.  Most of the rules and regulations that started to change from an Irish point of view have effectively become European regulations at this point.  As an institution, we are regulated out of Frankfurt and all the rules and regulations concerning how we conduct our business prudentially are set by Frankfurt.  The rule book has changed completely.  Every practice that we engage in now is likely to be different from it was ten years ago when the loans originated.  This is 2016, so the last of those loans originated in 2006.</p> <p>  The level of verification and validation in terms of customers and SMEs is an issue that we need to address.  The level of support given to provide assurance around larger credit and loans is significant.  The level of property valuation that is required to support those positions is different.  From a credit point of view, the marketplace bears little resemblance to that which existed in the early 2000s, which was quick and easy.  It is not quick and easy now.  In particular, a significant process is associated with collateralised lending.</p> <p>  Something that has not changed and is still a work in progress is the establishment of security.  Where collateral is used, the process remains dated.  How security for properties is registered is a national issue rather than a banking sector one.  It probably has not changed much, but nearly all the other processes and procedures are different.</p></speech>

I would like to update the committee today on the work I have been doing in the Department of Finance with the cost of insurance working group, which brings together all the relevant Departments and offices involved with the process.  In September when I last appeared at this committee, I welcomed the initiative of the Oireachtas committee to hold public meetings in order to produce its own report on this urgent matter.  I am, therefore, pleased to see that the committee has published its report with its own set of recommendations, many of which complement the emerging recommendations published by the Department of Finance.</p><p>Both strands of this work are hugely important.  The Irish insurance sector has been subject to a lot of volatility in recent years, as the committee will know.</p><p> When one looks at the inflation data from October 2016, one will see that insurance prices have increased by 47% since January 2011, motor insurance prices have increased by 51% during the same period and by 8.5% in the 12 months to October 2016.  These kinds of increases &ndash; these so-called &ldquo;super-cycle&rdquo; trends &ndash;  while down from September, are very damaging to the economy.  They hit consumers hard and they undermine competitiveness.  The future for insurance in Ireland must have certainty, clarity and transparency at its core.</p><p> In that regard, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, set up a task force to look at the insurance sector earlier this year.  I was asked to chair a working group under this task force to examine the various factors contributing to the increasing cost of insurance.  The cost of insurance working group was established in July.  It brings together the relevant stakeholders on the Government side, namely, the Departments of Finance, Transport, Tourism and Sport, Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Justice and Equality, as well as the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, the State Claims Agency and the Central Bank.  The objective of the working group, as set out in its agreed terms of reference, is to identify and examine the drivers of the cost of non-life insurance, with particular focus on motor insurance, and to recommend short, medium and longer-term measures to address the issue of increasing insurance costs, taking account of the requirement for an economically vibrant and financially stable insurance sector.</p><p> The core areas being examined by the working group in this first phase are the motor insurance sector generally, at present and in recent years; the effects of legal costs and litigation processes on insurance costs, the current claims compensation arrangements and the cost of claims, insurance data and information, the impact of accident rates, the impact of unlawful activity on the insurance sector and other market issues.</p><p> As the issue of the cost of insurance is complex and multilayered, I decided as a starting point to establish four subgroups to examine particular issues in detail.  These issues were understanding the motor insurance market, improved data availability, the cost of claims and other public policy issues.  Chairs were appointed to these subgroups, which have been meeting on a weekly basis since September.  The outputs of these subgroups are currently feeding into the regular meetings of the working group.  The working group has held ten meetings to date and will continue to meet every two weeks to the end of 2016. </p><p> The consultation process is ongoing and to date, the working group and the four subgroups have met with representatives from AA Ireland, Auto Records Limited, the Consumers Association of Ireland, the Freight Transport Association of Ireland, the Irish Brokers Association, the Car Rental Council of Ireland, the Irish Road Haulage Association, Insurance Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland, the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, Tiom&aacute;na&iacute; Tacsa&iacute; na h&Eacute;ireann, and the chief executive officers from AIG, AXA, Aviva, FBD, Liberty Insurance and RSA Insurance.  In addition, submissions received from all interested parties are being considered as part of the process.  I have also personally met a number of stakeholders to help me develop a greater understanding of their perspective on this complex issue.  In that regard, I have had informal meetings with representatives from a number of key stakeholders including: Insurance Ireland, AA Ireland, the Injuries Board, the Irish Brokers Association, IBEC, FBD, the Bar Council of Ireland, and the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p> Undoubtedly there are a number of specific issues contributing to the increasing cost of car insurance in Ireland and because of this, I believe it is generally recognised that there is no quick-fix solution to this problem.  In addition, in considering solutions the group has been very conscious of the need to ensure the maintenance of a stable financially solvent insurance sector to ensure that risks to policyholders and the wider financial system are minimised.  Consequently, the importance of insurance companies meeting regulatory requirements and maintaining adequate reserves cannot be understated in examining the pricing of insurance products.  Moreover the constraints imposed by Solvency II on the State&rsquo;s ability to influence insurance pricing must be factored into the overall approach to satisfactorily resolve this issue. </p><p> A key part of the work of the group has been to try to build consensus on appropriate actions, which then need to be implemented as soon as possible to restore some stability to pricing in the motor insurance market.  Another important aspect of our work is to make Ireland more attractive for new entrants.  It is likely that some of our actions may take time to implement, particularly if legislation is required.</p><p> In order to progress this agenda, however, political consensus among the different parties and Members in the Oireachtas is essential.  Consequently, for this reason I welcome and am appreciative of the work of this committee in conducting public hearings on this matter and in producing a report.</p><p> At the end of October, I provided the Minister for Finance with emerging recommendations.  The emerging recommendations touch broadly upon nine areas and between high level and lower level contain about 40 actions.  One area relates to consumer protection.  It seems clear to me that we need better and more proactive information on the part of insurance companies when quoting for insurance or renewing insurance, including providing more information on how a person&rsquo;s premium has been calculated and the reasons behind changes year on year and so forth.  Other issues, such as providing greater recognition of previous driving experience outside the State for returning emigrants, are also the subject of a recommendation.  In summary there is a host of well-documented consumer issues to which the emerging recommendations speak.  I believe this committee's report has identified similar issues, as well as solutions.</p><p> A key area where change is required is in the claims environment.  We need to enhance transparency and facilitate the use of data sharing and collection that we see in other jurisdictions.  A resource, either in the form of a claims database or a claims register, is needed for the sector so that among other things, we can see what claims are being made against property or for personal injuries, the legal and other costs that are being incurred and the channel of resolution and what impact that has on the final settlement.  This happens elsewhere and it should happen here.  It is my view that greater transparency in the claims environment should lead to greater stability in the pricing of motor insurance and should help prevent these &ldquo;super cycles&rdquo; both up and down that have occurred regularly in the Irish market in the past.  I note the emphasis the Chairman also place on transparency in his preface where he states &ldquo;This Committee, above all, requests the publication of 'raw' insurance data and that transparency becomes the norm within the insurance sector ... from this day forward.&rdquo;</p><p> Significant concerns have been raised around the uncertainty of the claims process, its cost and the method for making awards for personal injuries.  I am fully respectful of the right of Judiciary to set awards but I have heard concerns expressed on the need for more consistency in the setting of those awards.  Again, I note this is an issue on which this committee's report has a particular focus.</p><p> The working group is therefore going to make a recommendation to establish a personal injuries commission to look at those areas that speak directly to the cost of personal injuries.  Subject to Government approval, I hope this commission can be up and running as soon as possible and will work alongside the ongoing reform of the book of quantum and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  Its terms of reference have yet to be finalised but we have already scoped out the priority areas for it to look at.  These include conducting an exercise to look at the average awards in other jurisdictions, as well as the grading of personal injuries.  I hope this committee can be broadly supportive of this proposal, as I believe it covers some of the areas highlighted in its report.  If, from their engagement with the industry and others, members of the committee or the Chairman believe they can identify a person or persons to nominate to this commission, such a proposal would be very welcome.</p><p> Two other important areas that need to be tackled are uninsured driving and fraud.  In regard to uninsured driving, the working group is likely to recommend that a fully functioning insurance database to allow An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to check insurance compliance through the use of technology such as automatic number plate recognition be finalised.  Much work has already been done in this area, however, I would like to see the roll-out of such a database to be expedited.</p><p> On the fraud issue, we are exploring what can be done to improve data sharing around suspected fraud, through the possible establishment of a fraud database.  The legal requirements of such a database such as, for instance, data protection issues are being examined by the working group and any recommendations must be conscious of them.  I note this committee's recommendation in this area that fraudulent and exaggerated claims should be pursued and tackled more aggressively by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and insurance companies and I have no issue with it.  Other recommendations that are emerging include giving consideration to reviewing relevant legislative provisions in the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, as well as Road Traffic Act 2004.  The group is also looking at some sector-specific issues in light of concerns raised by hauliers and taxi drivers.</p><p> Since providing these emerging recommendations to the Minster for Finance, the working group is working to finalise the report and developing an action plan to enable the relevant Departments and offices to commence the implementation of agreed priority actions.  The report and action plan will detail any legislative or regulatory changes that may be required and will include a detailed timeline for implementation.  I am determined to ensure that this important work progresses at a pace and that it meets its implementation deadlines.  I am taking a hands-on approach as chairman, working closely with Department of Finance officials and liaising closely with the four subgroups that are now established.  Our plan is to publish a report in December of this year.</p><p> In conclusion, our work is about taking action on credible solutions to address the problem of the increasing costs of motor insurance with a view to implementing them as soon as possible.  While we cannot direct insurance companies on pricing of insurance products, I hope these recommendations will settle the current uncertainty we are seeing around premium prices.  As these recommendations work their way through, I believe we will then see a sustainable reduction to more appropriate insurance premium prices.  We can achieve that for the customer, while also protecting the stability of the insurance market and ensuring it is a market worth being in.  I have asked my officials to review the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach with a view to incorporating aspects that complement the analysis of the cost of insurance working group.</p></speech>

The joint committee has made 71 recommendations and it took time, deliberation and conversations with the various stakeholders to arrive at the recommendations.  We believe a number of the recommendations can be dealt with immediately.  For example, section 4 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 provides for the Minister to confer additional powers on the Personal Injuries Assessment Board.  It is necessary also to reform solicitor's fees.  Could the Injuries Board be reformed so that it takes a greater role in settlement?</p><p>More cases might be settled at that level rather than being pursued through the courts with the greater degree of costs and so on.  There is also the other legislation, namely, the Civil Liabilities and Courts Act 2004 and the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003.  These are steps that can be taken alongside the work of the Minister of State's working group.  This committee wants to work closely with the Minister of State and that group to achieve the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations we have made.  One of the issues that arose today, and from our recommendations, was to do with the Irish Road Haulage Association and a submission made by its president, Verona Murphy, which indicated that hauliers are obtaining insurance elsewhere in the market in the European Union.  It is a point that we did not develop fully in the context of our recommendations.  We expressed an interest in the area and support the case being made but there is a need for the Minister of State's group to look at this in more detail.  This might be something that he may comment on and maybe resolutions to address the issue could be brought about pretty quickly.  I would like to see that happen.  </p><p> Recommendation 59 in our report into the rising costs of motor insurance recommends that Government examines the reasons Irish businesses, in particular the transport sector, are procuring motor insurance abroad with a view to reversing this trend.  The committee also recommends that government engage directly with businesses in this regard.  I know the Minister of State has done that and maybe he has not examined all these recommendations in detail but I would like his opinion on the possibility of implementing some of those recommendations in the short term or having the legislation examined in the short term to see what parts of the legislation were not enacted, what could be enacted, what would impact on the premiums immediately and so on.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on that and I will leave it with him.  He also mentioned who we might recommend and there are people in the Gallery who might-----</p></speech>

It is a group I chair and I would need to consult with it.  I will, however, speak directly on the issues raised by the Chairman.  An initial point is that I very much appreciate the public consultations that took place because the meetings of the working group did not happen in public and people were not able to hear the concerns we heard in the working group.  The work done by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach gave a real opportunity to different stakeholders to put their part of the case across publicly and to have their position challenged, which is important too.  It has played a very important part in terms of the understanding we are coming to.  From the chance I have had to look at the committee's report, which is very detailed and has a number of recommendations, I see a lot of alignment with the work done by the working group, and there is no surprise there.  The Government and the Oireachtas share concerns around doing something to protect the consumer while also ensuring a stable and attractive market for these companies to operate in and to provide the necessary insurance.  This process has evolved in a good way and I hope the way we have worked together to date can continue because it is in everyone's interests.  If legislation is to come from government, I hope it would be agreed by the House so it could be implemented swiftly.</p> <p>  It is important to note that we are not coming at this from a standing start.  Work is already under way, not just in our working group, but also in reviewing certain legislation, which the Chairman mentioned, and in technological developments that are already at an advanced stage but perhaps have not been implemented as quickly as we would have liked.  When we publish the working group report in December, the timelines, actions and priorities we have will speak to the fact that work is already under way in certain areas and those areas will have shorter timelines.  Where we see that priority action can be taken, because it can be an early win, we will certainly prioritise that action, always bearing in mind the fact that we will not be able to solve it overnight but should try to move quickly when we can.  Pace is absolutely essential because it will send the correct signal to all the market players about how serious the politicians are to do something to protect consumers from the unfair spikes they have seen in recent years.</p> <p>  When one talks about section 4 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003, for example, the review is already ongoing, so we are not coming at it from a standing start.  Reform of the Personal Injuries Board is essential and we have spoken to it in terms of our emerging recommendations.  I note also that the Personal Injuries Board is part of our working group.  We are aligned with it in what we hope to do, which is another important factor.  There is no point in the committee or me coming out with recommendations for the Personal Injuries Board which it does not agree with or which it might not think were a priority.  We have been able to make sure that our thinking is aligned with those people who want a similar outcome from this process.</p> <p>  Data is the key to understanding everything here and we just do not have the data we need.  There is not the requisite transparency there is in other jurisdictions.  Let us be clear, there are companies operating in Ireland which operate in other jurisdictions where they share data and are transparent with the data on a level that Ireland is nowhere near close to being.  That really concerns me and it very much concerns the working group.  We have strong recommendations which speak to that and to getting that data.  Of course, it would be very helpful if the insurance industry was willing to come forward with the data in a way that the Chairman speaks of it.  We would like to propose an independent body - this has to be finalised in the report - to decide on the defined standard sets to feed into the data, to then control it and share it in a transparent way with everybody.  Data should not be held by certain parts of the industry and data should not be presented in such a way that it is not meaningful to the work we want to do.  Data is key to understanding what we need to address around the claims channels and settlement channels in terms of understanding exactly what is happening and for those 70% of cases where there is no transparency.  Some 10% of cases go to court and 20% go through the Personal Injuries Board but there is a mystery over what happens to the 70% of other cases.  We need to lift the veil on that mystery, which is a crucial act which the Government and the Oireachtas need to take.  We have recommendations that speak to certain sections of the Civil Liabilities and Courts Act on the review of the sections and the commencement of other sections.  Since we published the emerging recommendations further sections have been brought to our attention.</p> <p>  The Chairman spoke about the hauliers.  We looked at that initially but we need to look at it a bit more.  We met the Irish Road Haulage Association.  It is important to understand that hauliers who are getting insurance abroad have had to relocate in order to do that.  There are a number of factors that might compel or attract a haulier to operate outside Ireland and insurance is one of those factors but, as the Chairman knows, there are other factors at play.  These factors have been raised with the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport and with Government and there are a number of issues at work there.  We think there is a potential difficulty at EU level with what the hauliers are looking to achieve, namely, to remain registered in Ireland and to purchase insurance from companies in another jurisdiction which do not operate here, do not have freedom of services here and are not registered with the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland.  There is not going to be a quick win there.  If it requires a change at EU level, it will take time.  We need to be clear about that with the hauliers.  I believe I have addressed the issues raised by the Chairman in the first round.</p></speech>

I have said it umpteen times today that the Minister of State is the Minister with responsibility in this area.  We know what is happening as do the participants in the business.  We just need to engage and make these recommendations work.  Is it fair to ask that at the end of February or March 2017 we carry out a review of how far we have come since the publication of this report or the Minister of State's working group report, which was in December?  Can we set milestones, achievement dates and so on? Does the Minister of State think this would be fair?</p></speech>

I have met the insurance companies and Insurance Ireland on this and have said to them that we are going to come with an ambitious and a detailed timeline for the implementation of every single recommendation we put forward.  We want to show a determination that we are serious about this to all the players in the market.  That is why when I talk about it, and I hope the committee sees this, and when we come to publish the working group's report with the detailed timeline reflecting all the good work done by the Oireachtas committee and in showing the determination to get things done and to take action, it will have a calming influence on the recent spikes we have seen in the cost of motor insurance premiums.</p><p>That is my hope.  In that regard, the feedback I have received from the industry has been positive.</p><p> The report of the working group will be published in December.  Since giving our recommendation to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in October we have been trying to draw out those timelines and put in key performance indicators for the different milestones we have to hit and when we must hit them.  Once that is in place and published, I will be happy to come in at any point and speak to this committee about the progress that has been made under each of those action points.</p></speech>

It is hugely important to have an ongoing evaluation of this matter, even if we were to have short spaces allocated each month to review so that we can tick off the ones that have been completed.</p> <p>  Has the Minister of State sought, or does he intend to seek, formally the legal position on the Single Market?  I am afraid that the whole idea of being able to access the EU Single Market will get lost in EU legislation.  Therefore, has the Minister of State formally sought the legal position on it for hauliers or taxi drivers so that they can get insurance abroad?  I am referring to formally seeking the position from our own legal advice here and from Europe.  Has he done it?</p></speech>

From January, we will have two tasks - ensuring that the implementation of the recommendations is taking place, but we will be moving to other areas of the non-life insurance market as well.  No doubt members of this committee have been receiving submissions from business people about their insurance costs.  I do not mean their motor costs, but in terms of insuring their premises and what they do.  I want to get to that quickly and January will be the starting point for that once we have published our report.  I am happy to come in on a monthly basis and we will be doing other work as well.  Some of the recommendations will have a longer tail, so there may not be immediate progress from month to month on a particular recommendation.  I ask the committee to bear that in mind.</p> <p>  In so far as the Single Market and hauliers are concerned, it comes back to a point the Chairman made which I want to address.  As it is not possible now or because it might seem like a tough ask to change European law, it does not mean we will not seek it.  We have sought the legal position and have had an initial legal consultation on this.  There is an ongoing court case, so it is something we will have to revert to, but it is part of what the working group is doing between now and December to understand how best we can progress this particular issue of concern.  I know that it is an issue concern and I have met with hauliers who put their case forward.  In talking about the future of the Single Market, there is a good argument to be made there as well.</p></speech>

As regards sharing legal advice, I will have to check on that because we have had difficulties previously concerning what legal advice can be shared, and what happens to it upon sharing it.  I cannot therefore give a commitment on it now, as I will have to check what the legal status of the advice is.</p></speech>

I am glad we all agree that the State can no longer be a neutral actor in all of this, given the dysfunction we have seen in the insurance market.  While much of our rhetoric is aimed at the industry, most of our recommendations are about what others can do.  The Minister of State's working group has the potential to put more radical suggestions on the table.  Can he reassure us that he will talk to the industry and not just work around the issues thus dealing with everything except the elephant in the room.  The industry has profited wildly but is now facing less profits, and now simply wants to ramp up prices.  In that context, how confident is the Minister of State that premiums will start to reduce?  I know they have fallen slightly for motor car insurance in the last month, but maybe the Minister of State can give us an opinion on it.</p></speech>

The State must intervene to protect consumers as well as protecting the insurance market.  We need reform across a lot of areas.  As the Chair also said, there is no silver bullet policy issue here.  There is a range of complex policy responses that need to be taken.  That is what our emerging recommendations, and the committee's report, speak to.  Reforms have taken place arising from the financial crisis, including the introduction of solvency measures, that prevent some super-cycle trends from happening in future.  One of the first things we must do, however, is stabilise the current spike in premiums that people have witnessed particularly over the last 12 months.  I hope we will be able to give a strong message to all aspects of the market in our recommendations and timelines.  That is the feedback I have received in some of those areas.</p> <p>  Once the recommendations begin to work their way through I would expect to see premiums come down.  Insurance companies may tell me they are adding &euro;50 to the cost of every premium due to fraud, but we will publish ambitious and radical ideas on fraud.  These include a fraud database to be shared not just between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and insurance industry, but also potentially with the courts.  Technology to automatically detect number plates will also be used to detect uninsured drivers and other behaviour.  As those type of actions are implemented they will no longer justify an additional &euro;50 increase on a premium.  Whiplash claims add &euro;130 to premium costs while uninsured drivers add &euro;35.  As our recommendations work their way through, the industry will no longer be able to make a defence for loading premiums in such areas.  I hope our recommendations will bring about changes in behaviour in each aspect of the market.  That is what we are all working towards.</p></speech>

I suppose it is about having information on insurance companies making wild claims, yet not being able to substantiate them.  They certainly do not produce raw data in a way that others do, so that the claims can be contested.  When representatives of the Central Bank appeared before this committee, I asked them if they were satisfied they were getting data that had been requested.  When I asked them if they had ever requested data from insurance companies and been refused, they said "No".  That leads me to believe that the Central Bank has not been asking the right questions that would help it to fulfil its consumer protection role.</p></speech>

Data are also crucial to understanding how insurance companies are operating themselves, as well as being essential to consumers understanding exactly how their insurance premiums are priced.  Data are also necessary to check fraud and cut out uninsured driving by introducing transparency around that.  We must bring our insurance sector out of the stone age, which I feel it is in given some of the engagements I have had, and make the market grow up.  That is the key to attracting other entrants in to ensure we have a healthy and competitive market.</p> <p>  I cannot and will not speak for the Central Bank.  I saw a transcript of what its representatives said when they appeared before this committee.  The Central Bank sits on my working group and we have spoken on data issues in the sub-group with the different actors that have come in.  As regards its prudential function, the Central Bank would have flagged that matter with the working group if it had an issue with it.  We are looking at various data concerning fraud which affects extra premium costs.  Up to this point, the insurance industry has been trying to manage those data itself and build a database to be shared between the industry.  That is not happening quickly enough, however.  In addition, I do not like the idea of them managing the data.  That is because from a public interest viewpoint the data should be managed independently by a State agency.  There is a recommendation in the committee's report on who should collect, handle and manage that information.</p><p>We will need the committee's support in determining that body.  Not everyone is seeking to do this work.  In our various engagements to date, we have seen some reluctance.  We all need to work together to settle on what the right agency or body is to manage these data and get the right data sets.  Doing this quickly will be important.</p></speech>

In terms of the commitments that have been given to me by the insurance industry at our meetings, the industry has agreed that we need this database and it is willing to perform the necessary functions.  We are using legislation to do this so as to ensure that there can be no uncertainty about what information is being sought and how it is to be presented.  Following engagements of the working group with the industry, I have sought particular information that was committed to in the room, but the companies or their representative bodies then explained that they had experienced difficulty in providing it over concerns about where it would be shared, could it be subject to freedom of information requests, what would that mean for commercial sensitivity, etc.  I take it in good faith that these are their legitimate concerns, but it speaks to the need to clarify legislatively for industry and ourselves the data protection and commercial laws in this regard so that, instead of going on a commitment that is given in a room or in writing, there will be no confusion at a later stage.  It is important that we proceed legislatively, which I intend to do.  Once the legislation is ready, I hope that it can be moved quickly through the Houses at the appropriate time.</p></speech>

The separation of powers is important.  Everything that has been happening in the UK post Brexit only underscores the importance of that separation to the people's faith in their judicial system and in their ability to have their natural and civil rights protected by an impartial system.  Nonetheless, the Injuries Board liaises with the Judiciary and is on the working group.  The recently published review of the book of quantum was managed in a helpful way in terms of some of the signals from the Judiciary and there have been a number of interesting judgments since the publication.  The costing of an award by the Judiciary is a matter for it, but we can give it much more information to help it set those awards better, for example, through the granularity of information contained in the book of quantum.</p> <p>  Through the personal injuries commission that I want us to establish, we will be able to conduct international benchmarking of the level of personal injury awards in a detailed way and determine how whiplash, for example, is graded abroad.  We can consider the use of an independent panel of medical experts to help in assessing injuries that are brought before the courts.  We can also consider relativity between awards for injury types.  One of our recommendations speaks to that.  In this way, we could move away from being outliers.  This work needs to be done in tandem with the review of the book of quantum and of the legislation underpinning the Injuries Board.  That is how I want to proceed.</p></speech>

In our work, however, we have come up against certain constitutional road blocks that affect what we can do regarding personal injuries, including soft tissue ones.  What is clear from the relevant data that I have seen is that we are outliers when it comes to award levels and the number of claim applications.  A personal injuries commission could, if set up in the right way, do much to tackle this issue.  The current system is an incentive for fraud and exaggerated claims.  It also incurs a higher and uncertain cost for industry in terms of its work, its provisioning, etc.  That issue is a large part of the picture.</p> <p>  We have had conversations on whether there is a claims culture or environment in Ireland, but we need to examine the situation because it is adding a cost for everyone who drives responsibly.  Accidents happen, as do penalty points and whatnot, but we all suffer because some people may be taking advantage of how personal injury claims are settled.  I hope that the fraud database will address this issue.  It is another key part of the architecture that we need to put in place as part of the reforms that we are trying to introduce.</p></speech>

The idea that we would blame people who have made a legitimate claim is unfair.  The purpose of an insurance company is to pay out on claims when an accident happens.  That is insurance.  We must maintain that at the core of a properly functioning insurance market, but we must also recognise in the information that we have seen that fraudulent or exaggerated claims are being made.  We have recommendations that speak to this matter.</p> <p>  We are examining the recommendations of the committee's report and determining what further research might be necessary in order to incorporate them.

I welcome the Minister of State to the committee and wish him well with his final report.  When he appeared before us previously, I asked that he would request of the industry a number of cases that were outliers in terms of insurance increases.  We are familiar with the CSO figures on annual increases in premiums, be they in the 25% or 33% range depending on which cycle one is considering.</p><p>Deputies and Senators are aware of many cases where individuals have seen their premiums increase by two, three and higher percentage ratios.  At that time I asked the Minister of State to request the industry to provide a sample of the outliers and to ask the industry to justify how that has happened on the basis of risk.  Has the Minister of State made that request to the industry to provide him with the figures?  If that has happened, what was the outcome of the examination?</p></speech>

We just touched on this with his colleagues on the committee around getting the right data.  In our emerging recommendations, which will be finalised in December, we will be doing this through legislation.  The working group has found it difficult to get the information we want from the industry, in so far as trying to drill down into some of the problem areas, including the one raised by the Deputy at the committee.  After our engagement we went to industry with a request for different types of information, not just the type of information Deputy Doherty was looking for, but also the information I was seeking.  Commitments were made, about which the industry was completely genuine, and there was desire by the industry to work with us.  When we actually tried, however, to get that information, it was not as forthcoming as I had hoped.  Different reasons were given around data protection, commercial sensitivity and whether or not information given to a working group in the Department of Finance can be subject to a freedom of information request and what that might mean.  On that point, I take the industry on good faith, but it indicates the very serious need for us to make sure that, through legislation, we are able to grab all the data we need and in the right manner for publication.  That is why we have a recommendation that speaks to the national claims database or register.  It is also why one of our recommendations for the future is that whenever there is an increase on premiums at renewal, the increase would have to be explained to the consumer.  There would have to be something behind that and it would not just be an automatic increase when driver behaviour had not changed.  That is what we are working to, and while I do not want to repeat myself, I have already said that data is the key to all this.  We need to make sure that the type of data we are looking for is clear in legislation and that the data can be given.  </p> <p>  As the committee is aware, there are insurance companies operating in Ireland that are also operating in other countries.  They are giving that type of data elsewhere for publication but they are not doing it here.  The industry says it is trying to, and that it going to, but it is not happening quickly enough.  I want the Government or an independent body to be in charge of it and to have ownership of the matter.  That is where we are heading and where our work should be going.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.2883" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016112400002#LL00300"><p>I appreciate that and we are at one on the importance of data and raw data.  Reference was made earlier to the statistics released by the industry rebutting claims by the Law Society of Ireland.  This information, which was provided by the industry to the Minister of State on request, was about the average increases in legal costs over a three-year period.  Everybody knows that when one controls the data, one can very much abuse the data also, and the way it is presented, to make a particular argument.  Even at a quick glance, it was very clear that the information was presented in a way that suited the narrative the industry was peddling.  The data shows the levels of compensation but there is no reference to the additional numbers of motorists on the roads between 2013 and 2015.  This increase in driver numbers is a factor.  As there are more cars, there will automatically be more claims, unfortunately.  On the increase in legal costs, the industry made the issue that the insured person's legal costs were running at around a 12% increase over three years.  When we actually look at the industry's own figures, the increase in claimant legal costs is shown at about 8% between 2014 and 2015.  This is exactly the same as the legal costs for the industry itself over the same period.  Again, it is about how the data is put forward.  When it controls the data, it allows it to provide it selectively.  That is an aside but it is important that we get the data availability right.</p> <p>  I welcome the fact the Minister of State has made the point a number of times now about reasons behind increases.  When the motion was going through the D&aacute;il, it was one of the areas I focused on, and that it was not a case that we were just looking at 33% increase on average.  Individuals must have a right to an explanation as to why insurance premiums are increasing above the average in the sector.  If he would not mind, will the Minister of State pursue that issue again?  The argument he has received from the industry do not hold water; it is bull.  That is the reality.  We are not looking for names and addresses of individuals.  We are looking for sample cases such as Mary Jo in Fanad was insured for &euro;350, had no claims, is driving the exact same vehicle and has no penalty points but her renewal premium is &euro;985 and this is the reason for it.  That can be a fictional person but based on a real case file.  There is no reason the industry should not provide the data to the Minister with responsibility for this issue.  If the industry does not provide it, let me be clear that it is basically shunning the work of this committee.  The request from this committee, through the Minister of State, for this type of data to be made available is so that we can be satisfied that the insurance industry gouging its own customers or that it is not doing so.  That is what we need to know and, if he would not mind, I ask the Minister of State to pursue that again, bearing in mind that he requested it earlier.</p></speech>

This has been part of the difficulty we have all had in trying to get to grips with what has been happening over the past number of years.  Companies have used their data in their own way as part of this blame game, and that needs to end.  We will need, through legislation, to very clearly define exactly what data we are looking for, how it is to be presented, what it means and how we intend to publish it.  The control part is key and that is why it needs to be by an independent or a State body, and not the insurance industry.  I want to let the Deputy know about an exchange I had with one of the industry companies that came in.  It may have been a little bit indicative of the exchanges we have been having.  I put the point across to the company that we need to know, and a person needs to know, why a premium has increased.  The company is providing the service, the person is paying for it and needs to understand why there is an increase.  I asked the company if it could commit to doing that and it said that it could.  I asked if a person would get a detailed understanding of why a particular premium had increased.  The company said it would not be the particular premium and that the reasons a premium had gone up would be in general terms.  That is not helpful to anyone.</p></speech>

I do not want to paint a particular picture of the industry but the control is an issue and the fact that a commitment given is interpreted one way, either intentionally or not, and then afterwards it does not stack up.  Legislation has to be brought in and this is going to be one of the priority areas for that legislation.  </p> <p>  I did not mean to interrupt the Deputy but I just wanted to come in there.</p></speech>

While I was driving back to my hotel in the early hours of this morning after dealing with the Finance Bill, I listened to the Minister of State and George Hook, although, obviously, the Minister of State was not on "The Right Hook" at 3 a.m., so it must have been a repeat.  Forgive me if I picked this up wrong, as we had quite a long session on the Finance Bill, but when George Hook focused on the issue of fraud, the Minister of State said that he had seen evidence or information provided by the industry that suggested a level of fraud takes place.  We know from the industry and from cases that there have been staged accidents and so on, but that does not amount to the level of fraud being suggested.  The industry tends to come up with the figure of &euro;50 per premium to cover fraud costs.  Has the Minister of State seen any data to quantify or stand over the figure of &euro;50 on each person's premium to cover fraudulent claims?</p></speech>

I mentioned the &euro;50 figure in an earlier exchange.  One of the things I was able to do during this work was to take an in-depth with an actuary into how premiums are calculated and all the different metrics that go into the calculation, including a person's credit rating potentially, which happens in other jurisdictions, the colour of the car, etc.  The type of information and the different variables that are put into computers now to spit out what a premium might cost is incredibly impressive in that regard.  We spoke about the issue of fraud.</p><p>It was put to me by one particular company that essentially it was a guesstimate.  If those who engage in fraud are successful, it is not detected; therefore, there is no decent set of data behind the &euro;50 figure.</p><p> The various concerns raised such as exaggerated whiplash claims, the fact there is no integrated fraud database to check or that certain sections of legislation have not been implemented by the courts are pointed to in suggesting solutions to the fraud problem.  Let us solve each of these problems.  As we implement the recommendations made, the figure of &euro;50 will not disappear because there will always be fraud.  We must try to figure out a way to calculate the level, but the number should come off the premium charged.  That is the intention.</p></speech>

If it is a guesstimate by the industry to justify the premiums charged without it being able to back it up in any way, it is wrong for us, as parliamentarians, to repeat it.  There must be something to underpin it.  It must be underpinned by some material figures, as opposed to someone thinking one sixth of every premium is made up of the cost of meeting fraudulent claims, even though he or she has no evidence or information which suggests that is the case.</p></speech>

I understand the industry is looking at what is happening internationally.  I disagree with the Deputy; we should absolutely use the industry's figures.  If it states the figure is &euro;50, we should say we will tackle the issues it has highlighted to us.  If its information is not substantiated through research or by the evidence, we can use it against it.  We should do our own work to tackle the cost of premiums.</p></speech>

We cannot tackle fraudulent whiplash claims by reducing payouts because we would affect genuine claimants.  We need to prosecute in order that it will be seen as a deterrent to engage in fraud.  Many of the measures mentioned by the Minister of State such as medical assessments by the PIAB might offer a way to deal with it, but we also need to challenge the figures produced.  I cannot state the insurance industry is making a profit of &euro;200 on everybody's premiums and absorbing it to pay salaries and fat pensions.  It would be wrong for me to answer, when the Minister of State asked me from where I had got the figure, that it was guess.  I would have to be able to show from where it had come.</p></speech>

It has mentioned a figure of 1%.  I am not saying I am satisfied with this answer from it, but there are a number of recommendations emerging that speak to how we can combat fraud such as looking at the sections of the Civil Liabilities and Courts Act which are not being used and have not been implemented, or creating a proper database that could be shared between the Garda, the insurance industry and, potentially, the courts.  These measures to tackle fraud are key.  We could use automatic number plate recognition technology to make it easier for the Garda to identify uninsured drivers.  Uuninsured driving is another source of fraud.  There are a host of measures we could use to take the issue of fraud off the table and we could be quite successful in doing so.</p></speech>

What the Minister of State has said is quite interesting.  If we look at the campaign conducted here on the &euro;50 added to every premium, it is identical to the one conducted in Britain.  It goes to the heart of the issue.  As the Minister of State mentioned, the figure is based on the level of fraud internationally.  Ireland is no different from anywhere else.  If it is happening all over the place, it is a wider issue.</p></speech>

We have spoken about information and data being central to everything.  Some companies claim &euro;130 is added to every premium because of the high prevalence of whiplash claims and the high awards made.  Various figures are added, including &euro;35 for uninsured driving and &euro;50 to &euro;55 in respect of Setanta Insurance, depending on how the issues involved might be resolved.  We have tried to obtain detailed granular information on how the figures are calculated in order that as our recommendations are worked through, we can consider how they can be lowered.  There is a huge onus on the industry to front-up in providing data and information.  It speaks constantly about the economic incentive to settle early, but this is causing a problem in providing an incentive for some people to chance their arm, the expression which might have been used by the Deputy, which impacts on everyone.  To go back to the point made by Senator Rose Conway Walsh, let us not come out of the committee trying to support the impression which some are trying to give that the reason is people suffer from whiplash as a result of an accident.  That is not the impression I would like to give.  There are a number of problems in the industry.  That is why a number of reforms are needed to tackle what has been happening in recent years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.2898" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016112400002#MM00800"><p>We will examine the report in detail and deal with the registration legislation at pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  It is important that we tackle all of these issues.  Some of them may be minor, but they should be tackled because it will help to reduce premiums a little.  The increases stem from the investment end of the companies' portfolios - that has been the main driver - and imprudent practices in recent years.  Having said that, I am concerned that the Government's approach will be to reduce the existing safeguards for motorists and those with a legitimate claim, for example, through providing care, not cash.</p> <p>  There is an idea that the prevalence of whiplash claims in Ireland is way beyond what it is anywhere else.  I made the point in private session that - no harm to them - certain comments made by individuals in the debate were over the top.  They received headlines for their comments on the weakest necks in Europe and such nonsense.  Yesterday I made the point in private session that in a fire the injuries suffered would be burns, while in a car accident typically they would be damage to soft tissue and whiplash.  The idea that this is the dominant claim in the sector should not, therefore, come as a surprise.</p> <p>  In tackling these issues to try to push down premiums I am concerned to ensure we will not reduce the safeguards for motorists and benefits.  It should be borne in mind that many people do not claim from motor or home insurance companies when they have legitimate reasons to do so.  I have been in that situation.  Somebody hit my car while it was parked outside Leinster house.  On another occasion I damaged my car and it cost money to fix it.  The reason people do not claim is their premiums will increase and they will lose their no claims bonus.  As a result, they put their hand in their pocket and pay themselves.  If paint falls on the carpet, homeowners do not claim because they know their insurance premium will increase.  Two years ago my oil tank leaked causing an oil spill in my garden.  Obviously, I had to have the soil removed.  When I telephoned the insurance company, I was told I should not claim because I would lose my no claims bonus and that there was an excess.</p><p>I said "Yes, but what about the cost?", which was ridiculous because the amount of damage was small but the cost was approximately &euro;27,000, a quarter of what it cost me to build my house ten years ago.  The point I am making is that many people who have legitimate claims do not claim from the insurance industry, which is profiting as a result of the fear it instils and the model it has in terms of people who take out insurance for damages that occur to themselves, physically, to their vehicles or to their homes.  People do not claim, even though they are insured, because of the structure of the industry's business model.  In a way, the insurance industry is committing the fraud.  My point is that in dealing with this issue and trying to drive down premiums, it is important that we do not reduce the type of support and protections that are there for legitimate claimants.</p></speech>

It was strongly made within the working group - by one of the subgroups that is examining the claims element of it - in the context of ensuring that we would not do anything that would undermine the protections that are currently in place.  The point of insurance companies is to pay out on claims.  That is why they exist and that is why we have insurance.  It is important, though, that we have a claims environment that can deliver some certainty for all involved in terms of the time and the cost to make the claim and to pay out on the claim.  That is something we want to protect.</p> <p>  In January, the working group will start to look at other areas of non-life insurance in which spikes have also been experienced.  I mentioned to some members earlier that businesses, particularly in terms of their premises, have been experiencing those spikes too.  From January, we will adopt a twin-track approach that will involve monitoring the implementation of our recommendations to our performance indicators and milestones and then moving on to those other areas in non-life insurance to which an importance also attaches.  Some of the practices are similar as well as to what it happening on the side of the insurance companies, so some of the work we have done already will feed into that area naturally.</p></speech>

When the data are not there to back up the circumstances whereby companies are taking money off people, one can also turn it the other way around.  I will conclude on that point.  I look forward to working with the Minister of State in the coming months on the implementation of the process.</p></speech>

I accept that it will be early days but we would still like to know what has happened, what is in train and what is going on.  As the Chairman said earlier, we do not want our report or the report of the Minister of State gathering dust on a shelf.  We want as much progress as we can get because it is clearly an enormous issue for so many people.  Almost every house in the country has a car, if not more than one car, and it is affecting how we all do business.</p></speech>

The Minister of State would like to make an opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.2909" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1339" speakername="Marcella Corcoran Kennedy" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2016112400002#D00300"><p>I am pleased to resume the legislative process of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which was published in January.  I thank the Chairman for allowing me to make some introductory remarks to outline the legislative proposal for the members of the committee.</p><p>The Bill is entitled an Act to amend the Irish Medicines Board Act 1995, the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 and the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015; and to provide for related matters.  It has four main purposes: to amend the 1995 Act to allow for the payment of fees to members of the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, formerly the Irish Medicines Board, as such fees are payable to the members of other boards; to amend the 2009 Act in order to exclude certain <i>ex gratia</i>payments that have been or will in future be made to individuals under specific schemes approved by Government for the purpose of assessment of means under that Act; and to amend the 2013 Act so that over-the-counter medicinal products, including emergency contraception and nicotine replacement products, can continue to be reimbursed to medical card holders after June 2018.  Otherwise, medical card patients will have no way to access such products without charge other than the prescription charge.</p><p>The Bill's purpose is also to amend sections 2, 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 of the 2015 Act to provide by way of regulation for a number of elements relating to the appearance of tobacco packaging.  The regulation of the appearance of the packaging is intended to contribute to improving public health by reducing the appeal of tobacco products to consumers; increasing the effectiveness of health warnings on the retail packaging of tobacco products; and reducing the ability of the packaging of tobacco products to mislead consumers about the harmful effects of smoking.  The Bill's amendments to the 2015 Act set out further provisions relating to retail packaging of tobacco products, some of which are of a technical and practical nature and some of which seek to provide basic information to the consumer.</p><p>The Bill has five Parts and 16 sections.  Part 1 sets out the Title of the Bill and all Parts will be commenced on enactment.  Part 2 amends the 1995 Act to allow for the payment of fees to members of the HPRA.  Under section 8(7) of the 1995 Act, as amended, only the chairman of the authority is entitled to a fee.  There is an onerous responsibility and a significant time commitment placed on members of the authority and we wish to attract the highest calibre of people to apply to be members of such boards.  Some people may be self-employed and, without the modest fee that will be paid under this amendment, it would be difficult for them to give the time commitment involved.  There is no additional cost to the Exchequer relating to paying board members of the authority, as it is mainly self-funding.  The fee approved for payment to each board member, in keeping with the guidelines issued by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, is &euro;7,695 per annum.  The additional cost to the authority will be up to approximately &euro;61,560 per annum.  However, some members may choose to waive their fees and the one person one salary policy will also apply to members who are in receipt of a salary from the public service.</p><p>Part 3 aims to amend the 2009 Act in order to exclude certain <i>ex gratia</i>payments that have been or will in future be made to individuals under specific schemes approved by Government for the purpose of assessment of means under the Act, also known as the fair deal scheme.  A number of groups within the State have been in receipt of, or will receive, <i>ex gratia</i>payments as a result of Government decisions that acknowledge the hardship, pain and suffering that these individuals underwent.  The schemes being covered in this legislation are the Lourdes Hospital Redress Board, involving 119 women; the Lourdes Hospital payment scheme, which compensated women who were excluded from the redress board on age grounds alone, which relates to 47 women; the surgical symphysiotomy payment scheme, which has made awards to approximately 400 women; and payments made either by the Government or the German Contergan Foundation to 32 Irish survivors of thalidomide.  The Bill will also amend section 36 of the 2009 Act, giving regulation-making power to the Minister to allow for an exemption for other similar groups that may receive <i>ex gratia</i>payments from being taken into consideration for support under the nursing homes support scheme, provided such schemes have been approved by the Government.  This is the way that such exemptions under various social welfare schemes are managed by the Department of Social Protection.</p><p>The key principle underlying this legislation is that a person should not be disadvantaged because of acceptance of a payment under an <i>ex gratia</i>scheme that has been approved by the Government.  Applications under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009 are means tested and the individuals or their partners could be over the income threshold for availing of Nursing Homes Support Scheme supports due to receipt of their <i>ex gratia</i>awards.  The proposal will not give access to free nursing home care to the various groups.  Rather, the awards or payments that they receive under Government-approved <i>ex gratia</i>schemes will be excluded from the financial assessment for supports under the fair deal.</p><p>Part 4 of the Bill amends the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, Part 1 of Schedule 3.  This amendment is required to ensure that over-the-counter products that do not require a prescription can continue to be available under the general medical services, GMS, and community drug schemes if so required.  This will ensure that over-the-counter medicinal products, including emergency contraception and nicotine replacement products, can continue to be reimbursed to medical card holders after June 2018.  The amendment will allow the HSE to disapply the criterion regarding prescription-only medicines when considered appropriate in the interests of patient safety or public health.</p><p>Another amendment proposed is to paragraph 1(<i>e</i>) of Part 1 of Schedule 3 of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which specifies that medicinal products must have a marketing authorisation referred to in paragraph (<i>a</i>) of the definition of &quot;authorisation holder&quot; in section 2(1) of the Act.  The reference to paragraph (<i>a</i>) is unintentionally restrictive, as it excludes products that are authorised by the European Medicines Agency and parallel imports.  Parallel importation is the importation from an EU member state or a country within the EEA of a medicinal product that is essentially similar to a product already authorised in Ireland by an importer who is someone other than the importer appointed by the marketing authorisation holder of the product on the Irish market.  The parallel trade of medicinal products is based on the principle of the free movement of goods within the internal market of the EU under Articles 28 to 30, inclusive, of the EC treaty.  It was never the intention to exclude such products and any such inference would be contrary to free trade principles.</p><p>The Bill's explanatory memorandum noted that allowing &quot;reimbursement of certain over-the-counter medicines under the GMS and community drug schemes will give rise to some additional cost from loss of prescription charges over time, but this is not expected to be significant.&quot;  However, this is not correct.  My officials have confirmed that there are in fact no additional costs arising from the amendments proposed in Part 4.  The explanatory memorandum also notes that over-the-counter medicines will not be available for reimbursement under the schemes after June 2016.  However, the Minister for Health granted an extension of this period under section 18 of the 2013 Act until June 2018.</p><p>Part 5 of the Bill seeks to amend sections 2, 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015.  Section 2 of that Act sets out the definitions used in it, section 7 deals with retail packaging of cigarettes, section 9 with roll-your-own tobacco products, other tobacco products, including cigars are dealt with in section 10, presentation of tobacco products in section 13 and features of retail packaging in section 14.</p><p>The Act provides for a number of elements to be prescribed by the Minister, including the colour of the outer and inner surfaces of tobacco packaging, the form and manner of bar codes and the manner in which a name may be printed on tobacco products.  The amendments to the 2015 Act proposed in this Bill are to provide by way of regulation for a number of other matters relating to the appearance of tobacco packaging.  Some of these matters are of a technical and practical nature and some seek to provide basic information to the consumer.</p><p>These amendments will permit the following elements to be included on tobacco retail packaging: text to indicate the type and weight or number of tobacco products contained in the packet; the inclusion of a tab to allow consumers to reseal the pack, excluding cigarette packs; the inclusion of a calibration mark, which may be necessary for the automated production of the packaging; contact details of the manufacturer; and additional information on cigar bands.</p><p>I intend to bring forward an amendment to the Bill on Report Stage.  It relates to Part 5 and the amendment of the Public Health (Standardised Packaging of Tobacco) Act 2015 in the context of the transitional times outlined in section 6.  The reason for it relates to the lapse of a substantial period of time since the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was first initiated in the Houses.  The Bill serves to make important changes to four Acts in the interests of equity or, in some cases, patient safety.  Of course, tobacco legislation is to help to protect public health.  I hope Deputies will give their full support to the Bill.</p></speech>

The section, as I have proposed it, corrects an anomaly in existing legislation in which current rules only allow medicines that are prescription-only to be supplied under the community drug schemes.  This affects a number of products that were prescription-only but are now over-the-counter, as well as some over-the-counter items that have long been available under the schemes.</p> <p>  The legislation gives a temporary reprieve in supplying over-the-counter medicines until 2018.  The amendment, as I have proposed it, will make this permanent.  The effect will be that some very useful medicines such as emergency contraception and nicotine replacements will continue to be available under the drug payment scheme, the medical card scheme and other schemes.  Patients will still need a doctor's prescription to obtain an approved over-the-counter product under the various schemes.  This applies to all schemes and both over-the-counter and prescription-only items.  This is a very important control, both clinically and for the financial operation and governance of the schemes.</p> <p>  Specifically regarding access to emergency hormonal contraception, there are a number of issues I have considered carefully.  Medical card holders already have access to emergency contraception which is currently available free under the general medical services, GMS, scheme to medical card patients provided they obtain a prescription first.  It is also available as an over-the-counter treatment.  Therefore, anybody can go into a pharmacy and buy it without a prescription.  The most up-to-date figures show that in the 12 months to August this year, just under 13,000 emergency hormonal contraceptive prescriptions were dispensed across all schemes, of which more than 12,000 were under the medical card scheme.  The barrier, therefore, for medical card patients in obtaining emergency hormonal contraceptives as soon as possible is not access.  More than 12,000 people a year go to their doctor and then the pharmacy.  The issue arises when people need emergency hormonal contraception but cannot obtain a prescription in time to receive treatment.  It might be the weekend and they cannot get an urgent appointment or they might not be able to afford to buy it.  I share Deputy Clare Daly's concern about timely access to treatment for medical card holders and fully accept that there should not be unnecessary barriers to receiving this treatment.  However, while I agree with the principle of the Deputy's amendment, I do not propose to accept it for the following reasons.  The Minister for Health has instructed officials to remove this requirement as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  Work on the development of services and clinical structures is under way.  A minor ailments pilot scheme was run over the summer, allowing pharmacies to treat medical card patients with over-the-counter medicines for minor conditions without a doctor's prescription.  Much of the IT infrastructure needed has been trialled under the minor ailments pilot scheme.  In line with the Minister's instructions, the HSE is developing the operational structures to implement this service safely and effectively, including the clinical standards required to ensure patient safety; procedures for identifying pharmacies in compliance with these standards as for the vaccination programmes; and the infrastructure required to provide a secure claiming and verification process.  Service development will be built on work already done, including the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland's professional practice guidelines for dispensing over-the-counter emergency hormonal contraception and existing structures for providing specific services in pharmacies such as the vaccination programme.</p> <p>  The amendment is not legally necessary.  There is no legal barrier to the proposal other than that being corrected in section 9.  The amendment which prescribes the supply of a single treatment in a specific manner through primary legislation raises a number of challenges, including that it could undermine the requirement placed on the HSE to provide treatment in line with patient safety and cost constraints, for example, to get the best price or refuse individual products.  Crucially, it might remove the ability of pharmacists to make clinical judgments and decisions, in particular, a decision not to supply where it may be unsafe for a patient for clinical reasons.  This is a professional clinical service set out by the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland which the amendment does not reflect and which would make it unsafe.</p> <p>  Discussions will be required with the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on implementation and officials will pursue this aspect.  The Irish Pharmaceutical Union has previously indicated a willingness to expand into this type of professional service and was involved in the minor ailments pilot scheme for over-the-counter products.  The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland has issued professional practice guidelines on dispensing emergency hormonal contraception and advising patients.  Deputy Clare Daly and other members of the committee will appreciate that significant steps have been taken to remove barriers to timely treatment for medical card holders in the case of both emergency contraception and over-the-counter products in general.  The principle behind the amendment is worthwhile.  I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and Deputy Billy Kelleher for raising it in her stead.  The amendment makes a valuable contribution but is actually not necessary in addressing this health need.  In fact, it could have unintended consequences.  In addition, given the operational challenges to be addressed, it would not speed up implementation which is already under way.</p> <p>  There are other issues that have been raised about cases in which pharmacists would not provide treatment.  They may not have been able to provide treatment or may have had personal reasons for not wishing to do so.  The statutory code of conduct for pharmacists requires that, where they are unable to provide a service, they take reasonable action to ensure the patient's care is not jeopardised.  In practice, the patient should be referred to another pharmacist, pharmacy or health service.  All pharmacists must prescribe to this code.  If a patient is unhappy with the conduct of a pharmacy or a pharmacist in this or any other matter, he or she should contact the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland which regulates the profession.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.2929" nospeaker="true" time="12:00:00" ><p>Chairman:This meeting has been convened to consider the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2016, the purpose of which is to amend the Health Insurance Act 1994 to specify the amount of premium to be paid from the risk equalisation fund in respect of certain classes of insured person from 1 April 2017; to amend the Act to further specify the circumstances in which a registered undertaking may terminate or refuse to renew a health insurance contract; to make certain other amendments to the Act; to make a consequential amendment to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999; and to provide for related matters.  I welcome the Minister and his colleagues.  As there is only one amendment, the issue of grouping does not arise.</p></speech>

The Bill makes two changes to the operation of the scheme.  It sets a new benchmark for reasonable profit based on return on sales and also provides for a limit on the total amount of credits that can be provided for insurers under the scheme.  This is to ensure it will only compensate for higher costs arising from the differences in risk between insurers.  It clarifies when a health insurer may withdraw a product from the market and ensures consumers will be offered a replacement product with at least the same level of benefits.</p></speech>

Has there been any further elucidation on the merits of the proposal?  The purpose is to try to ensure we can make health insurance affordable at the lower levels.  Obviously, people are taking out premiums at the lower level because they simply cannot afford to move up a little.  If there is a flat rate across all premiums, proportionately much more of the levy is being paid by those at the lower end.  Is there some way of having a <i>pro rata</i>arrangement for lower-cost plans?  In other words, the higher one's premium payment, the higher the contribution made in stamp duties.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-24a.2934" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2016112400002#S00600"><p>I thank the Deputy for the amendment which I did consider following our discussion on Second Stage.  Since there has been a lot of misinformation in the public commentary on the linkage between stamp duty and affordability, although not from the Deputy, there is a point worth making in this regard.</p><p>It must be recognised that any changes to the operation of the scheme which result in lower stamp duty on some policies do not necessarily increase affordability for individual consumers.  For example, last year, my predecessor reduced the stamp duty on non-advanced plans by &euro;38 from &euro;240 to &euro;202 and no insurer announced price reductions on such plans as a result of this measure.  While some of the insurance companies and their communications people are putting out information about this, it is important that they reflect on the reality that when my predecessor reduced the stamp duty on non-advanced plans, the benefit was not passed on to a single consumer.  That is an important point in terms of how this has been described.</p><p> I acknowledge what the Deputy is trying to do and he is making an important point.  I will elaborate on a few facts about how we arrive at this point annually.  Each year, the HIA holds discussions with insurers before it makes a recommendation to the Minister about the credits and stamp duty rates under the risk equalisation scheme.  In both 2016 and 2015, one of the insurers indicated a preference for switching to a percentage-based stamp duty.  This view has been taken into account by the authority but it still has not recommended changing from the current system of fixed amounts of stamp duty.  The stamp duty applied under the scheme is on a fixed amount basis for a number of reasons, which relate to both the practical administration of the scheme and the key objective of the scheme, which is to share costs in a fair way across the market to support community rating.  An important feature of our risk equalisation scheme is that the total amount collected in stamp duty from insurers equals the total amount of credits paid to them.  If the stamp duty collected was higher than the credits paid, the scheme would be inflationary for the market at least in the short term, and if the stamp duty collected was lower, temporary funding would be required from the Exchequer, which would impact on Government current expenditure.</p><p> The scheme is also based on fixed amounts of stamp duty with reduced rates for those with non-advanced products and for children.  Taking into account market trends each year, the HIA is able to accurately predict the total cost of credits and the stamp duty rates required to fund them.  Switching to stamp duties as a percentage of premium would pose a number of difficulties for the operation of the scheme.  Insurers regularly increase and decrease the prices of their products and, therefore, there is no price control in the market.  The health insurance Acts permit them to vary the premiums of health insurance plans once they provide at least 30 days notice to the HIA.  With a percentage-based stamp duty, it would be more difficult to ensure the total amount of credits paid matched the total amount of stamp duty collected.  The authority has calculated that the percentage-based stamp duty required to fund the credits proposed from 1 April 2017 would be 29% of the premium.  This would mean that the stamp duty would be higher than &euro;444, which is the proposed fixed amount for all advanced policies costing more than &euro;1,531 and the stamp duty would be lower for all policies costing less than that.  In the case of non-advanced policies, the percentage-based stamp duty would be higher for policies costing in excess of &euro;765 and lower for policies under that price.  However, changing from a fixed amount of stamp duty to a percentage-based stamp duty would affect the overall financial impact of the scheme.  The authority must take into account the net impact of both stamp duty and credits when considering the support required for groups of people under the scheme.  Older people, in general, require more support under the scheme because they have higher claims costs.  That is at the core of the scheme.  However, older people on average pay more for health insurance and, therefore, the authority's recommendation in respect of credits would have to take this into account.  There could be an unintended consequence for older people were we to move on that.</p><p> I accept the bona fides of what the Deputy is trying to do.  If it was useful for committee members to be briefed by the HIA and to further explore its views, I would be open to asking the authority to do any further body of work that the committee or individual members feel should be done.  It might be useful to further explore this but there is no benefit to legislating for this.  I have available to me the opportunity to ask the authority to conduct a review if members feel that is necessary.  It would be worth further engaging with the HIA in this respect.</p></speech>

The Schedule outlines the amounts applicable after 1 April 2017.  There is an issue if we consistently reward insurers to ensure they do not cherry-pick.  Has there been any policy discussion about the issue of rewarding insurers that take on high risk types?  The Minister referred to chronic illness.  There is little in the current set-up that incentivises or even encourages insurers to take on these cohorts.  If we continue to use age as the means of assessing how money is paid from the Central Fund, there might be a logic to examining this issue.  A broader policy decision would be required and it would not come under this legislation.  Has there been any discussion anywhere about looking beyond age cohorts to other categories to encourage insurers to take on people on the basis of illness?</p></speech>

It makes it easier for a private health insurance company to make the decision to take on a 70 year old rather than a 30 year old.  That is at the core of the scheme but we need to get to a better place in terms of refining where we want credits to go and make sure we are directing them to the appropriate places.  We are looking at refining parts of the scheme in respect of health status.  I will update the committee as that progresses.</p></speech>

When I was a young person - I know it was a while ago but I can still remember that far back - we were charged a fee because we were allegedly supplementing older people.  The age profile of the population has changed since then.  Many more young people have come into the country in the meantime, some of whom emigrated and returned.  They are being told they are paying a higher premium because insurers have to look after men and women in my age group.  I have tabled countless parliamentary questions but I have never been able to find out exactly where the money goes in terms of the comparison between the public and private sectors.  I have never been able to get that information to my satisfaction.  I have been suspicious over the years and I have never been able to find out to what extent the credit applied for the pain and suffering my peers and I experienced as a result of paying more to carry the older age groups in terms of risk equalisation when I was aged 25 or 30.  I do not know what the purpose of that was but the current younger generations are allegedly paying a similar surcharge for the same reason.  The briefing suggested by the Minister might be useful.  We might get some information that ordinarily would not be available.</p></speech>

As members know, we brought in lifetime community rating to ensure there would be an incentive and reason for people to sign up at a younger age and to have balance in the market.</p><p> The risk equalisation scheme is targeted at helping the older cohort but that requires making sure one continues to bring younger people into the market also.  The Deputy's suggestion is good in that it would be very useful to engage with the HIA.</p></speech>
