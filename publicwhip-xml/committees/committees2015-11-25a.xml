The joint committee has considered issues relating to special education on a number of occasions.  As recently as last week we examined the issue of second level education, and we have been assisted on many occasions by the officials from the NCSE in that regard.  We are pleased to have an opportunity to engage with Mr. Stack today.  I welcome Mr. Stack and invite him to make his presentation to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Stack" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#C00400"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation to speak here today.  As members are aware, I served as chairperson of the NCSE for the past three years, since January 2013.  As members are also aware, the council is the organisation's governing body and has an oversight role in leading and approving the NCSE's strategic policy and direction.  The executive of the NCSE has a separate and complementary role, which is to oversee the achievement of the organisation's strategic goals and the day to day management of its functions.  As the Chairman stated, last week, S&eacute; Goulding and Mary Byrne, principal officers, were before the committee dealing with organisational matters.</p> <p>  The NCSE wants all children and adults with special educational needs to achieve their potential.  An appropriate education is essential to achieving this goal.  I welcome the opportunity to play my part in making this vision a reality.  I wish to speak about three areas, namely, the past three years as chairperson of the NCSE, the next three years, and my personal commitment to the role of chairperson.</p> <p>  Three years ago I told this joint committee that my focus would be on ensuring delivery of the NCSE's five strategic objectives, which are set out in the Strategy Statement 2012-2016.  I will highlight briefly five aspects of that strategy, the first of which is policy advice.  The NCSE published a comprehensive strategic review of special education in 2013, which was the first major review of special education in Ireland in 20 years.  We also published a report of the NCSE working group in 2014, which proposed a new model for the allocating of additional teaching supports.  More recently, this September we provided the Minister with a pre-publication copy of policy advice on educational provision for students with autism spectrum disorders.  Members will appreciate that I am unable to discuss the detail of our policy advice on autism until such time as it has been published.</p><p>The NCSE policy advice is informed by widespread consultation with education partners and a comprehensive examination of relevant and international literature. Our consultation groups consistently acknowledge that the State's ongoing and significant investment in special education has brought about improvements in how students are supported in schools.  There is considerable consensus that the right supports are in place.</p><p> As the committee is aware, the previous Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, requested that the NCSE establish a working group to develop a proposal for a new allocation model, and I agreed to chair that group.  The working group reported in March 2014 and we presented the proposals to this joint committee in June 2014.  The main recommendations, in summary, are that available additional teaching resources should be allocated in line with the educational profile of a school and deployed in accordance with students' identified educational needs, and that one coherent support service is needed to improve the capacity of schools to meet the needs of students with additional learning needs.  I am pleased that last February the Minister, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, announced the establishment of the inclusion support service within the NCSE with immediate effect and that the Department of Education and Skills is now conducting a pilot exercise to test the new model in 47 primary and post-primary schools.</p><p> An extensive research programme underpins our policy advice and informs the good practice information that we disseminate to schools, parents and the education sector.  During the last term, the NCSE published eight research reports addressing important issues in special education.  I am very pleased to advise members that the NCSE is about to publish two new studies that have helped to inform our policy advice on autism spectrum disorders, ASD.  One considers the literature between 2008 and 2013 on national and international research on education for persons with ASD.  The second publication is an evaluation of State-funded educational provision for students with ASD in Ireland.  These reports will be published on the same day as the policy advice on ASD is launched by the Minister.</p><p> I am very proud of our new programme of locally delivered information sessions for parents of young children with special educational needs.  We initiated these seminars in 2014 because, as a council, we were very pleased to respond to parental requests for more comprehensive and objective information concerning their children with special educational needs.  More than 1,000 parents have now attended these seminars and have been very satisfied with their content and the literature provided.  We have published nine information pamphlets and two booklets for parents to explain how the education system supports students with different types of disability, and we have an information booklet on post-school education and training options for adults and school leavers with disabilities.</p><p> With regard to operational matters, I am satisfied that the NCSE has allocated available teaching and special needs assistant, SNA, supports in accordance with departmental policy.  I am very pleased to be able to report that the level of additional supports for students with special educational needs, including resource teachers, SNAs and special classes, is now higher than ever.  We now have almost 26,000 adults supporting special education and learning difficulties in our schools, comprising 14,151 teachers and 11,820 SNAs.  With regard to corporate governance, the NCSE has conducted its business in compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, as well as complying with the normal legislative requirements governing our work.  At a meeting two weeks ago with the Comptroller and Auditor General, I was pleased to be told that all issues raised at audit were dealt with to the satisfaction of the auditor and no letter needed to be issued to the NCSE on any audit manner.</p><p> What lies ahead if I am ratified as chairman for the next three years?  Over the next three years, the core activity of the NCSE &ndash; research, policy advice and operations &ndash; will continue and I will ensure that it continues to be effective.  In that context, I will support the NCSE executive in continuing to develop our services and deliver essential supports for schools and children.  Next year we will work on the development of the new NCSE statement of strategy that will guide our work between 2017 and 2021.  This work will include the roll-out of the new model for allocating special educational teachers to schools.  The NCSE will continue to support both the Department and the education partners to ensure its successful implementation.  The new inclusion support service needs to be developed and embedded within the NCSE in the near future.  Our research programme will be focusing on teacher education, as good teaching is crucial to successful educational outcomes.  So much research is under way about what comprises good and effective teaching for children with special educational needs, and our research will help inform future policy developments.  This morning in Croke Park I opened the seventh NCSE research conference for 2015, which deals with teacher education for inclusion.  On completion of the meeting, I will be returning to Croke Park.  That is not because I am a Kerryman and I like Croke Park, but rather because the research programme is there.</p><p> We will be publishing further information and guidance for parents and schools on the transition of students with special educational needs.  These guidelines will cover all stages of education, including preschool to primary school, primary to post-primary school, special to mainstream settings, and onwards from post-primary school to further and higher education or training programmes or the world of work.  These are all elements in the process of a learning curve for young people.  There are also new frontiers to be explored.  The NCSE now works closely with the Department of Health and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and their agencies at both national and local level.  I hope to see further co-operation in the coming years, particularly around the inclusion of young children with disabilities in preschool education and the further development and review of post-school options for young people with special educational needs.</p><p> With regard to my personal commitment, as the committee knows, while I was the chief inspector in the Department of Education and Skills - for 12 years - I initiated major structural change, reform and expansion of the inspectorate, including the introduction of whole-school evaluation for all schools.  Before that, I was the founding principal of a large co-educational post-primary school in Limerick for 14 years, and I was fortunate to be able to bring the school from 90 students in its first year to more than 1,000 students within ten years.  Prior to becoming principal, I was a post-primary teacher of business studies for six years.  I am also the author of many books and articles on business and economics.</p><p> If reappointed as chairperson of the NCSE, I will use my expertise to lead the NCSE so that it continues to function effectively and to provide appropriate strategic guidance in accordance with the highest ethical standards.  I will continue to work closely with council members, the chief executive officer and her senior management team to achieve this.  I would consider it a tremendous privilege to lead the NCSE through its next phase of development.  The workload is challenging but I am personally committed to this work and the role of chairperson.  I thank the committee for its patience in listening to me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#D00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Stack and his colleagues from the executive of the NCSE.  I thank him for his ongoing commitment to his role and his work, along with the executive, over the past three years.  I will support them, and I wish them well for the next three years.</p> <p>  There are some issues on which I would like Mr. Stack to comment and give his perspective.  He mentioned the NCSE's plans over the coming period to assess the current position with regard to preschool special education provision.  He also touched on further education and supports after secondary school.  Will Mr. Stack comment further on the gaps in both of those systems?  What challenges need to be addressed at preschool level?  Could he comment on the challenges of post-secondary school education?</p><p>I understand that the NCSE does not handle this role directly in the same manner it does at secondary school level.  This means it is a much more complicated, cumbersome and far less person-friendly experience for those with special needs once they leave secondary school.  There is a real gap in our system.  We have achieved much progress over recent years in mainstreaming students alongside their peers at primary level through to secondary school, but there is a gap once they leave secondary school in terms of the type of services and supports available to them in the form of a resource teaching facility and personal and special needs assistance.</p><p> Will Mr. Stack discuss the pilot exercise on the proposals of the working group as to how the allocation of resources to schools will be changed?  I know the pilot is taking place in 47 schools but there is a great deal of concern in the educational community regarding how the pilot model will work and how it will impact on various schools.  There is genuine concern among many schools that they may lose resources and concern about the level of commitment on the part of Government to increase resources.  I know they were decreased significantly by about 15% four years ago.  People genuinely believe that the model is a precursor to further reductions or certainly no increase to match increased demand in those services.  I know the pilot is being carried out without impacting on the allocations to the schools that are taking part in it.  Considering that one of the main concerns schools have is how it will impact on the level of allocation they will get, will Mr. Stack comment on how the pilot will be able to allay those concerns because it is not addressing them in its current format?</p><p> In respect of the role of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, and its educational psychologists working with the NCSE in making diagnoses, will Mr. Stack comment on the current situation regarding the limit on the number of NEPS assessments schools have and how this is impacting on the council's ability to give students the resources they require?  Is there a need for additional supports in NEPS to properly support schools in assessing students and their needs and supporting the work carried out by the NCSE?  I believe there is a need.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#E00200"><p>I also welcome Mr. Stack and the officials from the NCSE.  I have a couple of questions in addition to those asked by Deputy McConalogue.  I know Mr. Stack cannot comment on the policy advice - the pre-publication that has been given to the Department - but he may be able at least to indicate whether we have looked at the use of restraints and seclusion rooms as part of that policy advice.  I am not asking what advice has been given but perhaps Mr. Stack could tell me whether that has been incorporated into the pre-publication that has been given to the Minister.</p> <p>  In respect of the 28 recommendations, many of which are being implemented, will Mr. Stack give the committee an indication as to which ones are not being implemented, why they are not being implemented and if there are plans to commence their implementation?  Deputy McConalogue spoke about the new model which is being introduced and is operating on a pilot basis.  There is at least a degree of concern that the new model will be hampered by the 15% reduction in resource teaching hours.  Will Mr. Stack comment on that?  Is the new model fit for purpose given the resources that are available or do we need an increase in resources?</p> <p>  I agree that teacher education is a critical aspect that we need to look at, particularly in a mainstream setting when we are dealing with children with special educational needs.  From my experience, it is a very hit-and-miss process with some teachers.  Some teachers are excellent when it comes to students with dyslexia or dyspraxia and do a lot of continuing professional development, CPD.  The teacher who was teaching my stepson, who is dyslexic and dyspraxic and has Asperger's syndrome, was excellent.  The teacher introduced assistive technology into my stepson's education and because of her training and upskilling, she was able to relate to the student in particular.  When a change in teacher occurred as my stepson progressed, we found that the teacher, through no fault of his own because he was an excellent teacher, did not have the same level of interaction with assistive technology in respect of how to deal with children with specific needs.  Are we looking at CPD or actual degree courses in respect of teacher education or is it a combination of both?  I know the Teaching Council of Ireland is undertaking some research on the inputs and outputs of teachers, but it will also focus on the processes in between and how CPD fits into those processes of upskilling.  When one is dealing with children with special educational needs, it is critical that the teacher has more than the academic understanding because it is a completely different scenario when one goes into a classroom setting.  One can read and learn as much as one wants around special educational needs but there is a personal interaction between students with those needs and teachers, and this is very difficult to teach.  One only gets that in a classroom setting.  How can we overcome that particular issue?</p> <p>  In respect of the transition between primary and post-primary education and on to further or higher education, I am a firm believer that resources need to follow the child.  This is only my opinion.  It should follow that whatever resources are available in primary education should automatically follow the student into post-primary education.  Obviously, there would be a review of those resources in light of how the child is progressing.  There is no guarantee for students in primary education, especially those with severe dyslexia who may be using assistive technology as part of their educational process, that when they move into post-primary education, they will get the use of a scribe or a reader for State examinations.  We need to look at this area.  If a student has a recommendation to start using assistive technology at an early stage in primary school and goes into secondary school, one issue that arises is that their laptops do not transfer to the post-primary setting when they should transfer.  Aside from that, there is no guarantee that the student will be given access to a scribe or reader.  We need to look at the transition model going right through rather than resources stopping at primary level and the student having to apply for new resources at post-primary level.  I do not know if we are looking at research into whether it would be more beneficial for resources to follow the child through.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1193" speakername="Joan Collins" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#E00300"><p>Mr. Stack is very welcome.  Many areas have been covered by the other two Deputies.  A great deal of good work is being done in respect of looking at the impact of education on children with special needs, including those with various forms of autism.  It is a societal issue because as a society we said we would bring these children into mainstream education.  Therefore, we must ensure they get that support all along the way.</p><p>I was approached by the parents of a boy who was only diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome at 17, having gone through the entire primary and post-primary system.  The boy and his family are finding it very difficult to cope with the diagnosis and are finding access to services extremely problematic.  How do we ensure that such children get the support of the various disability services and mental health services?  I was stunned to hear that diagnosis at such a late stage could happen, even though I am aware that resources have been withdrawn from our schools.  I ask Mr. Stack to give his views on the point made by earlier contributors about resources following the child.  Is that being examined by the NCSE at present?  The same conversation is going on with regard the health service, with many arguing that the money should follow the patient.</p><p> Mr. Stack said that a pre-publication copy of policy advice for students with autism spectrum disorders will be available.  When will that be published?  I also ask Mr. Stack to elaborate on the pilot project for the proposed new model in 47 primary and post-primary schools.  Is that going to be continuously revised or will the NCSE reach a point where it determines that the model could work, with some tweaking further down the line?  </p><p> The Minister introduced legislation recently which provides that every school will have access to the NEPS but that does not mean every child will have such access.  What is Mr. Stack's view in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#F00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Stack and apologise for being late.  On the question of the role of the NCSE with respect to the Department, I presume everything done by the NCSE is done through departmental circulars.  I ask Mr. Stack to outline the type of engagement his organisation has with the Department before such circulars are issued and, if issues arise with circulars, the type of engagement that happens post their issuance.  This is very important in the context of a very fluid and fast changing environment in the context of resource allocation to schools for children with special needs.  Can circulars constrain the work that the NCSE does in terms of a lack of flexibility?  The issue of resource constraints is a whole different ball game.  I am interested to hear if the NCSE is constrained by departmental circulars.</p></speech>

When we had a meeting about that new scheme, I detected broad support for it from the witnesses who attended that day and from committee members.  Most were supportive, although some concerns were expressed that day.  Is there a broad geographical spread in terms of the 47 schools that are involved?  When does the NCSE expect that pilot to finish?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Stack" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#F00400"><p>In general, I welcome all of the questions posed which are valuable and are signposting issues for the NCSE.  They are not tricky but are legitimate questions about the challenges for special needs.  I will start with the new model and the pilot project, which several members raised.  The purpose of the pilot project was to test out all of the documentation prepared by the Department of Education and Skills to see what elements needed to be amended or changed.  As we all know, change can be difficult for people.  The idea of a pilot is to introduce change and to learn from that change before it is formally implemented.  There will be changes to the changes, so to speak, based on the experience of the pilot project.  The schools involved are located all over the country and are of different sizes.  The pilot includes a representative sample of schools and none of the education partners have any problem with the selection of the schools.  The selection process was fair and honourable.  Hopefully, we will know the outcome of the pilot by the end of the school cycle in 2016.  It will take a full school year cycle to get a good understanding of what is happening.</p> <p>  I will tie that into the questions posed on resources related to that.  We were very clear in the working group report that we were resource free in designing that plan.  There was no precondition about resources.  I had long discussions with the Minister at the time, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, to clarify that point.  I told him that if he tied my hands behind my back and asked me to produce a report with current resources, it would not work.  That said, it will present resource challenges.  The NCSE is happy that the report has been accepted by the Minister, the Department and all of the education partners and the next step is the implementation.  There is no resource condition attached to its implementation.  That is as much as I can say on the matter.  The Department will have to address that issue.  In terms of the issues that emerged, resources were never raised by the Department with me.  I was never told that will cost too much.  That kind of dialogue never took place, formally or informally.  The whole purpose of this, as we put on the front of the document, is "delivery for students".  Those three words remain in our head as our main purpose.  It falls where it falls and if the need is justified, it will be met.  </p> <p>  Deputy O'Brien asked about transferring resources from primary to post-primary and there was food for thought in his question.  I cannot give him a short answer but I accept his question as legitimate and one which is worth reflecting on.  He also made reference to examinations.  The challenge there is that the State Examinations Commission is in charge of that area but that does not prevent us from having a dialogue with the commission so that we understand the totality of the situation.  At the end of the day, whatever section or agency we are dealing with, we are dealing with people, with children who will become adults.  They have special needs and we must be aware of all aspects of those needs.  I would approach that issue from an open perspective.  I like to have open discussions, with no limitation to people's thoughts.  Then it is a question of working things out.  </p> <p>  Reference was made to gaps in the system and to the role of the NEPS.  I was responsible for the establishment of the NEPS.  In the early days, the NEPS was part of the inspectorate, before it was called the NEPS.  That was a working group with which I was involved way back in the last century.  I understand the role of the NEPS but we have more work to do with that service, in co-operation with it.  We can all be in separate boxes at one level but we must get out of those boxes because we are providing a service to children.  It does not matter if it is box A, the NCSE or box B, the NEPS, or whatever.  Part of the inclusion support service that has emerged and is being put together is about joining the boxes and providing supports for teachers as well as for children.  All of them will be under the NCSE in the future which will give us a better basis for working out, more logically and fairly, the provision of special needs support.  </p> <p>  A question was posed about teachers and their qualifications.  Continuous professional development is vital in this area.  We are working with the Teaching Council on the proposed new framework, Cos&aacute;n.  We are part of that and have included the Teaching Council in our group, so that we can inform each other and stay connected.  Reference was also made to assistive technology.  As we speak, session 2 of the conference in Croke Park is discussing "Assistive Technology for Students with Special Educational Needs".  Who is attending that session?  Parents and students are there, talking about their experience of using assistive technologies.  It is not about theory but about practice, how it works, what is positive or negative and so forth.  That is happening as we speak.</p><p>We have eight different speakers on the topic, led by Dr. Chris Abbott from King's College in London.  He is an expert on the role assistive technology can play.  If we have technology everywhere in our lives, it is only appropriate that we get the right fit for students with special educational needs.</p><p> No doubt I have left out answers to some questions.  I am not avoiding them on purpose.  It is simply that there were many questions.  We have a note of all of them.  There was a question on resources and the new model as well as a specific question on the 28 recommendations.  All those recommendations will be implemented.  I cannot give an indication of where we are on the list, but they are all on track under the Department of Education and Skills and they will be put into operation in the fullness of time.  If I am before the committee this time next year, I will come back with the list done and all 28 boxes ticked.  None of them is being dismissed or ruled out.  It is a question of getting to them.</p></speech>

There are some dangers with an over-reliance on assistive technology and sometimes people lose sight of that.  That is the last thing we want in dealing with a child who uses assistive technology.  We cannot be over-reliant on it.  We must to try to develop the child's potential in reading and writing as much as possible while understanding that there is a need to complement some educational aspects of a child's development with assistive technology.  I agree completely and I am pleased to see this question on the agenda for today.  I am pleased to see that we are going to look at real-life experiences.  In theory, assistive technology sounds great but there are also drawbacks and they need to be acknowledged.</p> <p>  I am encouraged because Mr. Stack has an open mind on the transition of resources.  One of my bugbears at the moment arises when a student transitions from primary to post-primary education.  If a student has the use of a laptop, the laptop does not transition with him or her.  The laptop itself becomes obsolete because it has been used for so long by the student in question.  We cannot simply recycle it or give it to another student.  I see no reason these laptops cannot transition.  If there is a cost involved, that is well and good.  I imagine parents would be more than willing to purchase them if they were in a position to do so.  It is like anything in the sense that the laptop becomes part of the learning and thinking of the student.  It is a tool for revising and looking back to see where they have progressed.</p> <p>  The use of online applications for assistive technology is something schools need to consider.  There are many online applications, for example, Reading Eggs, that can have a significant positive impact on children's education.  This does not apply only to children with special educational needs.  The way we teach is changing because technology is changing.  I am glad to hear that we are open to looking at the role of assistive technology and transitioning resources.  As Mr. Stack said that at the end of the day, we are dealing with children.  It is a question of what is best for them.  We should start from that point and consider how much it will cost and the resources that need to be put in place.  They represent a separate issue.  However, if we have what is best for children as the primary object, then we are doing well.</p> <p>  Continuing professional development is critical but not only for special educational needs.  I imagine teachers recognise as much themselves.  When it comes to children with special educational needs, we have to get to a point where continuing professional development incorporates well-being, relationships and how teachers interact with students.  It cannot simply be about upskilling academically.  It has to be about upskilling their social skills and social interactions with students.  This is a major challenge because every teacher is different and every child is different.  An element of this must be included and we must have an interrelationship between student and teacher, not only at an academic level but at the basic social interaction level as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1031" speakername="Michael Conaghan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#G00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Stack.  Historically, many children were lost, not only to the educational system but also during their entire adult lives to employment and being able to meet the ordinary needs of living because of lack of literacy.  I was involved in teaching for 35 years.  In that time there were no appropriate interventions designed or provided for.  Teachers would go to Eason &amp;amp; Son Limited and buy books or cardboard and make up what they wanted to teach because there were no other resources.  All that has changed.  I realise the NCSE has played a major part in the provision of adequate resources.  Its name is well established as an innovator in this area.  Things have changed so much.  I pay tribute to the foresight and years of hard work of the NCSE in this regard.</p> <p>  Certainly there is more to do.  However, a firm platform has been established.  Teachers can be ambitious about the levels of support.  There have been big changes.  The NCSE and many teachers have been very much to the fore.  If we lose a child at an early age, the child is lost for life, perhaps not literally but metaphorically.  We have to prevent human loss in all its forms and we must tackle what contributes to it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#G00400"><p>I thank Mr. Stack for his response on the pilot model.  He mentioned that the working group operated in the spirit of being resource free in terms of the implications.  Will Mr. Stack elaborate on what that meant?  My understanding is that Mr. Stack took a model that was in place but proposed another way to allocate whatever level of resources were available.  Were there any advice or implications from the working group on the new model proposed?  What was the expected impact on resources, either positive or negative, in terms of an increase or decrease?  Will Mr. Stack comment on that and explain what was meant by resource-free?</p> <p>  The inclusion support service was referred to.  Will Mr. Stack elaborate on what exactly is involved, how it is moving along and what exactly its role will be when it is fully up and running?</p> <p>  Mr. Stack did not go into the issue of how the current pilot model for the new allocation system will allay concerns over a change in resources for particular schools.  Some will gain and some will lose.  This is a key concern for certain schools and parents.  I do not see how the pilot model is going to address that.  I would appreciate if Mr. Stack could elaborate on any way of addressing it.</p></speech>

Some had the view that the old system was not working and that some people were able to use it to their advantage more than others.  In that sense, the people who had been advantaged by the old system might have concerns, although those concerns may not be legitimate.  That effectively is what I am saying.  At the same time, other people may have concerns but perhaps those fears can be allayed when they see the outcome.  That is my view on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.26" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Stack" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#G00600"><p>I can respond in respect of the NCSE working group.  One very useful document is the guide for parents and guardians on the new model.</p><p>It compares, in a few pages, the new model with the old model.  It explains the current system and why it is unfair.  In addition to having a comprehensive report, we wanted it to be understood by people as best as possible.  The book helps that but the next step in helping to understand it is the pilot scheme because we will have evidence from 47 schools that can speak publicly about it when it is done.</p><p> What will emerge from the pilot is more information relevant to the success of the new model when it is introduced.  When I made reference to the pilot being resource-free, I was thinking about all the meetings of the working group that I chaired.  I only needed to repeat it once or twice - at no stage did we make a decision based on resources and neither did our terms of reference, which was only one paragraph.  We know that in future there will be a resources issues but addressing it was not part of our terms of reference so we did not address it.  We might have left a challenge for the next Minister of Education and Skills and the Department in the implementation aspect.  Perhaps it will not be a challenge but no predetermined line has been drawn about resources.  The present system is not fair for a number of reasons and the only claim we made for this was that it was a better and more equitable way to proceed.  There is nothing equitable about cutting money and that is not what it was about.  That is why I spoke about it being resource-free.  The challenge we examined was whether it was more equitable to do it this way or the present way.  The dominant question, before one looks for the cheque book, is if it is more equitable.  More is not always better.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#H00200"><p>The only issue with there is that everyone agrees that the old model was inequitable and the new proposed model is more equitable.  One of the criticisms of the pilot project is that under the new model, some schools will lose resources and some will gain, yet during the pilot project no school lost resources.  I am sure Deputy McConalogue will agree with me.  The question that will be asked is whether the outcome of the pilot model is reflective of the reality for schools on the ground.  If 47 schools are involved in a project and none of them are losing resources while trying to implement the new model, does it give an accurate picture of how it will be rolled out and implemented?  That is the concern.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Eamon Stack" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#H00300"><p>I accept that.  I have not addressed it but I will now in so far as I can.  The pilot is being operated by the Department of Education and Skills, not by the NCSE so the NCSE has stayed away from it apart from giving the co-operation that has been requested of it.  We are not operating the pilot.  As with everyone else, I am waiting with interest for the result of the pilot and to find out where we go from there.  It is better to have information before one makes a decision than after making it.  The Deputy is right to say that resources were taken off the agenda for the pilot so that they would not upset the apple cart.  That is acceptable because the purpose of the pilot was to establish the operational aspect of it.  The focus of the new model is to ensure that students who need resources have them.  If a school has the students, it should have the resources; if it does not have the students, why would it keep the resources?  That is a question and not a point of view.</p> <p>  In the new model, the resources are designed to be where they are needed.  We have said very clearly that in the new model, assessment should not be required to receive resources.  Every school should have a baseline of resources and there is a baseline in place.  Whether that is too big or too small will become apparent with experience.  Hopefully, the resource problem will work itself out but there could be schools that will lose resources.  As chairperson, I am concerned that a school with students with special educational needs will lose resources.  That is the real question.  The question is as important as the answer.  That is why it is resource-free, it was not designed to take resources away from schools that genuinely need them.</p></speech>

Everybody should switch off their mobile telephones or put them in flight or safe mode.</p><p>We are looking at the issue of adult literacy and considerable progress has been made in Ireland on making our education system more accessible for our citizens over the years.  It is a major concern that up to one sixth of Irish adults has difficulty understanding basic written text because literacy is fundamental in enabling a person to participate fully in all aspects of our society.  To assist us in looking at this issue we have the National Adult Literacy Agency, represented today by Ms Inez Bailey and accompanied by Olive Phelan.  Some of her colleagues are in the Visitors Gallery.  I invite Ms Bailey to make her presentation to the committee.</p></speech>

NALA is committed to making sure people with literacy and numeracy difficulties can fully take part in society and have access to learning opportunities that meet their needs.  We do this through providing innovative solutions, in policy and practice, to improve outcomes for adults with literacy or numeracy needs, working in partnership with a range of public and private stakeholders in Irish society.<br/><br/>Unmet adult literacy and numeracy needs have devastating consequences for individuals, communities and the economy.  The recent OECD adult skills survey shows that one in six Irish adults, which is 521,550 people, find reading and understanding everyday texts - for example, a bus timetable or medicine instructions - difficult  According to the survey, one in four or 754,000 people have difficulties in real world maths from basic addition and subtraction to calculating averages.  The survey also showed that people who scored at the lowest literacy and numeracy levels often have no or low qualifications, earn less income, are unemployed and have poorer health.  According to the Central Statistics Office, there is no statistical difference between the scores of adults in the 1994 international adult literacy survey and the 2012 adult skills survey. <br/><br/>The European Commission response highlights that the least skilled are caught in a low-skills trap which contributes to high unemployment and threatens growth and competitiveness.  Irish evidence acknowledges that further education and training sector, FET, is not optimally aligned with labour market needs and significant development is required.  The recent publication of the further education and training strategy holds promise if the required increased investment is forthcoming.<br/><br/>The national skills strategy, which was published in 2006, set a target of improving the skills of 70,000 people to level 3 by 2020, leaving only 7% of the workforce with, at most, lower secondary qualifications.  The current figure is 15.6%, which means we are unlikely to meet the target of 7% by 2020.  By contrast, we are set to meet or surpass all of the targets aimed at upskilling those who already have higher education as their lowest level of qualification.<br/><br/>Currently, a review of the national skills strategy is under way within the Department of Education and Skills.  It presents an opportunity to reflect on why our performance has fallen so short of our ambitions in the particular area and what needs to done differently in the new national skills strategy to achieve such a target in the future.  Participation rates in lifelong learning in Ireland further illustrate the challenge, with Ireland at 7.3%, which is consistently well behind the EU average of 10.5% and dramatically behind the highest-performing countries in the EU.  Furthermore, those with the highest educational attainment are most in evidence in participating in lifelong learning.<br/><br/>Currently, the adult literacy services of the education and training boards provide more than 50,000 adults with between two and six hours of adult literacy tuition per week from its &euro;30 million budget.  Such a period is often insufficient to attain a level 3, or junior certificate equivalent, qualification.  In fact, the number of hours or places available to learners has decreased since the OECD survey was published.  There is also a particular gap in provision for the long-term unemployed and other cohorts with literacy, numeracy or ICT needs.  For example, the MOMENTUM programme is aimed specifically at unemployed people, but it no longer funds certification for people at levels 3 and 4.  Also, the educational supports within the community employment programmes, aimed at people with literacy and numeracy difficulties, were removed and have never been replaced.<br/><br/>Decision makers need to commit to addressing the unacceptable levels of literacy and numeracy difficulties among our adult population in a similar vein to the Youth Guarantee.  Our greatest resource is people, and we must enable more adults address their literacy and numeracy needs and improve their skills through the following measures: restoring the previous levels of provision for adult literacy and basic skills within the ETB system; providing access to more intensive learning options, particularly for the long-term unemployed; customising provision to engage the low-skilled, such as youths and those returning to the labour force, using blended learning and technology - for example, NALA's free interactive learning website at <i>www.writeon.ie</i>, which supports independent and distance learning, expands learning time and achievement within existing programmes and includes the only form of recognition of prior learning that currently exists at this level in Ireland; and engaging employers to support low-skilled workers in line with international policy and practice, of which there are numerous examples in the UK, New Zealand and the United States of America.<br/><br/>While unemployment rates are falling generally, people with low qualifications or skills remain particularly vulnerable.  Early school leavers are over three times more likely to be unemployed than their counterparts with higher qualifications.  We believe we can promote equality in our education and training system by ensuring that all adults can achieve a basic education.  By targeting people caught in the low-skills trap, we can tackle some of the inequality of the current system and wider society.  We believe that all unemployed people with no or low qualifications should have access, on a guaranteed basis, to an intensive basic education course that leads to a level 3 or junior certificate equivalent qualification.  We further believe that all adults with less than a level 4 or leaving certificate equivalent qualification should have access to an intensive basic education course that enables then to move up at least one level.<br/><br/>The Irish education system is seen as one of the finest in the world and as one that serves most people well.  If one has the basics, there are great opportunities and supports available.  However, if an adult needs the basics, he or she is consigned at best to part-time provision with no support.  We believe that access to education and training in Ireland should be fair and equitable.  We also believe it is important to target initiatives at groups who would most benefit and who are most at risk of being left behind.  This has been the successful intent behind ensuring that children's literacy and numeracy is a national priority.  At present, the literacy and numeracy strategy for children and young people is also under review within the Department of Education and Skills.  This intent must be extended to adults.  NALA believes that literacy is a human right and a tool for change that enables people to participate more fully in society.  NALA believes that the Government should commit to providing a guarantee of support to all adults with less than a level 4 qualification who wish go back to learning and an intensive basic education course at level 3 to unemployed people with low qualifications.  These programmes could be funded through the National Training Fund, as we need to boost the current adult literacy budget to at least &euro;50 million.  In conclusion, NALA believes that there are not enough programmes or programmes of sufficient quality across the system to raise adult literacy and numeracy levels by the level required.</p></speech>

I commend NALA on its great work and hope that it continues to make progress.  I know it strives for advances to be made in adult literacy and numeracy levels.</p> <p>  I would like the delegation to comment on a couple of issues.  As Ms Bailey mentioned at the end of her presentation, NALA believes it would cost &euro;50 million for the Government to provide a guarantee of support to all adults with less than a level 4 qualification to go back to learning and to provide an intensive basic education course at level 3.  She stated that we need to boost the current adult literacy budget to at least &euro;50 million.  Can NALA give a breakdown of that figure?  Obviously, courses must be provided.</p><p>Do the witnesses envisage that particular supports will be provided to those who will be participating in it?  Could they comment on the particular difficulties being encountered by part-time students who are trying to access maintenance grants and supports, such as the back to education grant, in respect of the part-time courses they are doing?  Many of the supports that are provided at the moment benefit full-time participants only.  That can be a particular problem.</p><p> I was reading this morning about the latest OECD Education at a Glance report.  I think it was published yesterday.  The report indicates that 98% of pupils in Ireland are now completing second-level education.  This compares with a figure of 85% internationally.  That so many younger people are going through the education system at the moment is a demonstration of the tremendous progress that is being made.  We are now seeking to target those who were failed by the education system in the first place.  It is good to see that strong progress is being made to ensure that our education system equips people with basic numeracy and literacy skills and with opportunities to progress their education.</p><p> Ms Bailey suggested that the further education system is not meeting labour market needs at the moment.  I ask the witnesses to elaborate on their thoughts on this matter.</p></speech>

I reiterate what Deputy McConalogue has said about the positive impact of the campaign and advocacy work they have been doing for many years.  Could they expand a little on the point Ms Bailey made about intensive learning options?  We know that the course options available to people are not sufficiently broad.  Do we have the infrastructure to provide the additional courses that are needed?  I presume many of them would be provided through the education and training boards.  Are the boards equipped from an infrastructural perspective to tackle the issue of adult literacy and numeracy?</p> <p>  Ms Bailey also spoke about the need for employers to engage with low-skilled workers in line with international best practice and policy.  They mentioned that there were examples in the US, New Zealand and Britain.  What has been their experience with Irish employers?</p> <p>  Much of the document presented by the witnesses focuses on literacy issues.  What steps do we need to take to deal with numeracy issues?</p> <p>  I will conclude by asking about the new system of apprenticeships that is being introduced.  I firmly believe that literacy and numeracy need to be incorporated into every apprenticeship that is to be rolled out under the new model.  If one is going to be a carpenter or a bricklayer, one will need a basic level of literacy and numeracy.  In addition to teaching people the actual skills they need to enter the workforce, we should provide for an opportunity to address some literacy and numeracy issues a part of that training and apprenticeship.  Do the witnesses agree with that analysis?  Our approach to these matters should be about lifelong learning.  We should not be suggesting that when one finishes education, that is it.</p></speech>

Ms Bailey suggested that the budget could be increased to &euro;50 million.  What is the current budget?  Where is the agency coming from in that regard?  Is it just a question of resources, or are there issues of organisation, structure and leadership as well?  The CSO statistics suggest that there was no difference from 1994 to 2012.  It is shocking that the resources invested over those years really had no effect.  To what extent is it a resourcing issue?  Do we need to revamp the whole approach to this matter?</p> <p>  Ms Bailey indicated that the target for the national skills strategy was to reduce the current figure of 15% of the population with qualifications lower than level 3 to 7% by 2020.  Where has that come from?  What progress have we made in recent times?</p> <p>  Deputy O'Brien mentioned intensive education courses.  Is the agency's objective merely to have those courses available?  What about participation levels?  This initiative will require people to get involved.  What effort is required to get people to the point at which they will really want to get involved?  If they see the benefit of it, they will want to get on board.</p></speech>

It struck me when I was listening to them that the provision of resources is not the only thing that is inhibiting participation.  I appreciate that the provision of resources is a very big factor in the overall situation, but I think it is a bit more complex than that.  I suggest that other factors, such as personal inclinations and dispositions, are inhibiting participation as well.  More than the provision of resources is required to tackle and overcome the hidden set of barriers that is sometimes deeply embedded in one's own outlook and experience.  The record of the education and training boards, which were founded on the principle of outreach, shows that they cannot really be faulted in terms of how they are reaching out and providing all sorts of relevant types of education and training in areas such as personal development and preparation for work, careers and all sorts of things.  Someone's personal disposition can also be an inhibiting factor.</p></speech>

Statistics from the PISA results, etc., show that we are improving.  Those who are children when one year's statistics are produced will eventually become adults when another year's statistics are being drawn up.  I believe for that reason that there must be some kind of change.  I presume the CSO does not test people's abilities.  Its results are based on surveys.  I ask the witnesses to clarify whether that is the case.</p> <p>  I would like to pick up on the point that was made by other Deputies about intensive courses.  I wonder what is meant by "intensive."  How can we get people to do such courses?  I recently attended a conference in Dublin Castle at which the Right to Read campaign was discussed.  I am sure the witnesses were present at it.  I was struck by an impressive presentation that was given by a princess from Holland.  Unfortunately, I cannot remember her name.  She seemed to be very passionate about this matter.  She has done a great deal of work on it.  It seemed from what she was saying that the Dutch authorities have done a great deal of work on outreach.  That point may have applied to Denmark, now that I think of it.  She was suggesting that outreach services have achieved a great deal of success by going to workplaces to capture people.  I do not think we are doing enough of that kind of work here.  Maybe it is happening, but I certainly do not see it.  I ask the witnesses to comment on the agency's work in that regard.  How is it funded?  How much of the funding that has been mentioned goes to the agency itself?  What does the agency use it for?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Inez Bailey" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#K00600"><p>I will start by responding to Deputy McConalogue's point about the &euro;50 million cost.  Maybe I will answer some of the other questions as I am doing so.  Our call for funding to reach that level has been supported by Social Justice Ireland, which has done an in-depth analysis of the budgetary requirements in this area.  We would concur with the results of that analysis.  We have said how much money is needed to build up the infrastructure of the adult literacy service within the education and training boards.  We are calling for additional supports to be provided to individuals to resource the intensive approach we are advocating.  Such supports could include paid learning leave or intensive courses that are supported through the Department of Social Protection for labour market activation.</p><p>This would be in addition to what the adult literacy service is getting.  The adult literacy service gets &euro;30 million, the same as it got at the peak of the crash.  It means that 0.01% of the education budget is being spent in this area, which is a tiny amount of money to service 55,000 adults, and that is why they only get between two and six hours per week.  If these people are going to make progress in a short space of time they need access to a more intensive programme.  Whether or not they can get it in the ETB system, they need other supports such as paid educational leave.  <br/><br/>We do not have any statutory underpinning of paid educational leave and we are one of the last few remaining countries in Europe not to have some basis for paid educational leave.  We are not empowering individuals within a workplace context to take up opportunities or motivating them with support from Government to take up lifelong learning.  Irish workers have a huge disincentive in comparison with other countries.  When paid educational leave was being heavily debated before the crash, the big issue was universalism and the fear that if we brought in such a provision for everybody the cost would be great, but we argue that it should be targeted at people who have qualifications lower than leaving certificate level.  We would take a finite group of workers or unemployed members of the labour force and provide them with an intensive skills initiative to enable them to get to the next stage in the educational system.  <br/><br/>We have not put a figure on how much paid educational leave would cost, but it would relate to a small number of people in the labour force.  It is also a declining number, so there is an opportunity, in the next 20 years while these people will be in the labour force, to give them a boost, maybe on a one-off basis.  The &euro;50 million would be to augment the level that the ETBs provide, but paid educational leave or tax support would also be required.  At the moment one can get tax relief on fees for higher education, and although people at the lower level do not have to pay fees, they still incur costs in taking up education and there is no support for them whether they are part-time or full-time, although there are no full-time opportunities.  We have not gone into the cost of tax support for those who are working or into paid educational leave provision at some lower level, but we think it needs to be looked at, perhaps in connection with the minimum wage discussions.  A lot of people who have low educational attainment or literacy issues are also caught up in the minimum wage.  It might be worth looking at connecting the skills agenda with the minimum wage.<br/><br/>No supports are provided on a part-time <i>pro rata</i>basis, as all the supports there used to be have been closed off to people.  There is no elder care for somebody going to the literacy service.  They do not get any bus fare and in rural areas there are huge transport issues.  There are huge physical barriers to participation and, while these have been acknowledged, nothing has been put in place to address them.<br/><br/>Ireland is performing extraordinarily well in OECD terms in higher education attainment rates and we surpass the tertiary rates of most countries in the world.  Equally, we are doing well in terms of our ranking in PISA.  Our retention rate of 98% is also high, but the children who get the benefit of this better education system have already transferred into the labour market and done the tests in the PIAAC survey.  They are given a different test in PIAAC from the one given in schools.  It lasts for an hour, so it is not a test one would go into lightly.  If a person had any doubts about his or her ability, he or she would probably not even take the test.  People are tested for an hour on a different range of literacy and numeracy competencies they will have encountered in their everyday life, not on abstract problems, as might be the case in a school test.  We are not holding the achievement we attained in PISA since 2000 in the scores we are getting for the adult population.  The 15 year olds from 2000 are in the labour market, so they are not the same people, though they were in the sample.<br/><br/>Nobody in the social research centre understands how we can be doing very well on one set of tests for 15 year old children in a test environment in school while those in the workforce who volunteer to do the test score very badly.  We are significantly behind the average on the PIAAC test in numeracy against all countries.  We are at the bottom.  We are also below average in literacy, though not quite as bad.  John Sweeney, the economist who was formerly a member of the National Economic and Social Council, has looked at the statistics and his view is that secular trends will not solve the problem.  We will not stop having people with literacy and numeracy difficulties just because our schooling system has managed to retain as many people as it has or is doing as well in PISA, because these figures are not transferring and we are not holding our position in lifelong learning terms.  Every other country which is doing well in PISA or in retention rates has far greater lifelong learning participation rates.  They are not just banking what they have in the school system; they continue with lifelong learning.  That is not happening in Ireland.  That is what the statistics show, and it demonstrates the challenge we are facing.  When I started in my career 20 years ago we were hoping to eradicate adult literacy and numeracy issues, and that has not happened in any country in the world.</p></speech>

They come out a few years later and do other tests but do not demonstrate evidence of having benefitted from completing second level education.  If we are not succeeding with second level we need to carry out an assessment of the reasons.  If we are not making tangible, lasting progress with people in the schooling system, we have to do it later on, as it is much more difficult to bring them back into the schooling system.  There is a big contradiction in the figures Ms Bailey has given.</p></speech>

Is it the vulnerable group that loses ground when they leave second level?  Is it those who were vulnerable 20 years ago who are not making progress or is it everybody?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.49" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Inez Bailey" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#L00500"><p>It is not everybody, but there are people who had higher education but who nevertheless scored at the lowest level of numeracy in the PIAAC test.  We had one of the largest sample sizes of all the countries that participated in the PIAAC study.  It is not that it is not being taken seriously, but there has been a sense that we can insulate all of the learning that takes place in school so that it lasts a lifetime, and that is not a reasonable proposition.</p><p>For example, I went to school and learnt Irish.  I do not use those skills now.  I cannot speak or read Irish like I did when I went to school.  In fairness there was nothing wrong with my education in terms of Irish when I reflect on it but I have not been using those skills and I have lost them.<br/><br/>Many people who were taught or developed their literacy and numeracy in school are no longer necessarily using those skills in everyday life, for example, in the workplace.  They are particularly not using them if they are not working.  Therefore, they are losing a lot of their competencies, which is what I think the PIAAC is taking up.  It is concentrated among those who are coming from socioeconomic disadvantage.  It is even worse in those areas and among those with that kind of background.  However, those who were surveyed in PIAAC had higher education attainment and scored very badly.  Certainly, on the numeracy area, they did particularly badly in how they were able to answer those questions.<br/><br/>We are commonly hearing from employers that they have higher education graduates coming to them who cannot do the job that needs to be done or whose communication skills do not seem to be good for what the employer requires.  Most of the employer surveys that IBEC has conducted will put the communication skills of graduates as one of the key areas where employers have grave concerns.  Therefore, this is not only evidence that is coming up through PIAAC.  It is coming up through other modes that the schooling system, or perhaps our expectations of what can be achieved through schooling and higher education, may not be sufficient to insulate persons throughout life or may not match the everyday requirements that we must embrace.<br/><br/>Another example, apart from Irish, I would take would be technology skills and digital skills.  I am not a digital native.  Those skills were not imparted to me when I was in school, nor in higher education.  I therefore had to learn them.  I have predominantly learnt them through my workplace.  If I was not in a workplace that was engaging in those skills, I would not have learnt them.<br/><br/>A lot of this is to do with the environment, the exposure and the expectation in society.  The literacy and numeracy competencies that are required of adults today are actually very high.  It would appear, through the testing, that people are being caught short in terms of their abilities to perform at a high enough level.  The level 1 in this survey is the lowest level.  While the OECD did not come out and say it, level 3 and above is considered what would be the ideal standard for the population.  We have still over half of the population below that level and this is just the population in the workforce.  We did not test anybody over the age of 64.  We are testing persons who are aged between 16 and 25, and in comparison to other countries, we did very badly.<br/><br/>The last question the Deputy mentioned was the alignment with the labour market needs.  A number of studies have been conducted in this area, particularly by the National Economic and Social Council, NESC.  The studies show, for example, that persons could be put on courses that did not have a vocational component and did not have a labour market value to the same extent.  Research we did with the ESRI on this showed that the unemployed were put on courses regardless of whether they had a literacy difficulty.  They were put on the same course as somebody who did not have a literacy or numeracy difficulty, yet they benefited to a greater extent in that they were more likely to exit from unemployment than the person who did not have a literacy difficulty.  There is something about what is provided to whom and how well it is provided.  We are not suggesting that all those who have literacy and numeracy needs need to be removed from vocational programmes, rather we suggest that the literacy and numeracy needs are built in to all vocational programmes as they are required so that participants can move and progress for them.  There is much to suggest that our courses are not sufficiently aligned with labour market needs and there are studies that have been conducted by the NESC and the ESRI on that point.<br/><br/>The intensive learning options is something of an infrastructural issue.  We would suggest that the ETBs would find it difficult to establish intensive learning options <i>en masse</i>at this stage due to the fact they have gone through a massive reform programme and are still trying to come out the other end of that.  Therefore, we are probably trying to suggest an intervention that will go directly to an individual, such as the paid educational leave idea, or that in the context of their programme to get out of unemployment they will be provided with a solution.  The solution is aimed at and designed for the individual as opposed to a large amount of funding given to ETBs to develop their infrastructure, if that makes sense.  We are trying to resource individuals so that the individuals then will be able to see what they need.  That is a better driver for ETBs to respond to that demand, as opposed to building up the infrastructure separately, but it does need some attention.<br/><br/>There is a workplace basic education fund that comes out of the national training fund.  It was set up in the early noughties.  It is at &euro;3 million and it has stayed at that for the entire period in question.  It is administered through the ETBs but most employers do not know anything about it.  It is supposed to be for small and medium-sized employers which can identify employees who have literacy and numeracy needs, and a customised programme can be brought to bear in their setting.  That does exist, but it has a very low profile.  It is low-funded.  Employers are not really aware of it and are not committed to looking at their workers from the point of view of getting access to that resource because they do not really know that it exists.  We believe it needs a considerable push in its own right.  Employers, we would suggest, are often aware that these are issues but are not aware of how they can resolve them and unless it is an easy solution for them, they will not necessarily go out of their way to address it.  However, they are aware that it is a problem and are looking for ready-made solutions that can be flexible to their needs.<br/><br/>In the area of numeracy, a review of the adult literacy service showed that there were very low levels of numeracy tuition available, even through the ETB service.  We have very few numeracy tutors.  We have a very small amount of numeracy tuition available to adults and as we can see from the PIAAC survey, we have now got an even greater problem of numeracy deficits.<br/><br/>What we have been looking at is how to integrate literacy and numeracy development across vocational education programmes.  Instead of assuming levels of literacy and numeracy just because children have been in school and are transferring in to apprenticeships or other forms of education, such as post-leaving certificate, PLC, programmes, there should be an assessment carried out to identify any literacy and numeracy needs at that point and also to identify programmes designed to support literacy and numeracy while they are on an apprenticeship programme or in a PLC setting.  At present that does not happen.  There is an assumption that everybody who comes into these programmes is able to read and write sufficiently, but there is no national assessment of everybody entering into these programmes.  That is a significant problem because participants are in the programme when they discover they possibly have the vocational orientation for the subject that they are studying but do not necessarily have the vocabulary or language.  That is what they think they are in college to learn and we would suggest that is what they should be being supported to learn while there.<br/><br/>We have called for an integration of literacy and numeracy across the vocational education curriculum.  SOLAS is still at the stage of conducting research about how that might happen.  It has been accepted that it should happen but it has not yet started.<br/><br/>Deputy Ryan referred to the budgetary aspect.  We are not suggesting that the increase to &euro;50 million in the adult literacy budget would address the issues we raise here as it would merely cater for the additional requirements within the ETB adult literacy service.  This paid educational leave idea for only this group of people, which would be over and above that, is the approach we suggest should be taken.<br/><br/>In Scandinavian countries where they identified persons with these needs, they took that cohort of the population and supplied them with an intensive learning opportunity within a year.  If they were in the workplace, they took them out of the workplace and supported them to achieve it.  If they were unemployed, they got an intensive programme.  They isolated the cohorts completely and invested directly in those people and they were quite successful in that regard.  We suggest a similar type approach where we support individuals to recognise whether they have needs and motivate them, through something like the paid educational leave idea or a tax credit, to take up the available opportunities, and increasingly use resources such as online learning and blended learning to extend the available learning time.</p><p>These programmes exist and are free but they are not very well known at present.</p><p> On the question as to where we have come from in terms of the national skills strategy, the relevant figure, I cannot recall precisely off the top of my head but it was certainly in the high 20s in 2006.  Therefore, we have made progress.  The bulk of that progress is coming out from the school system.  We have all these younger people who have more than a junior certificate entering the labour force and an older cohort who would have had only a primary certificate leaving it.  Therefore, a natural movement is occurring without us doing anything.  The national skills strategy outlines that this is the scenario we should aim for if we want to do nothing, based on just using the throughput.  However, the strategy sets targets that required people to do something more than that.  It required investment in the workers at the time, and that has not been realised.</p><p> The higher education targets are set to be surpassed.  All the investment in higher education has meant that Ireland is leading across the OECD in terms of tertiary participation rates.  We are not just above average but at the top.  That is how well we are doing in that area.  We have noted the achievements in the mainstream schooling system.  This part of the system, for those people who have not had the benefits of the earlier parts, has been left behind.  Even with the targets that were set, we have not come close to achieving them.  There is a serious question to be asked in this regard.  I can suggest some reasons.  Investment is a very big factor on my list, but we do not know enough about why we have been so poor in achieving the targets for the lower-skilled group under the national skills strategy.  What we are going to do differently will be a great challenge.</p><p> On the issue of motivation, when we started our work, we launched major campaigns.  At that time, a tiny percentage, approximately 5,000 people, were in adult literacy programmes.  As soon as we made opportunities available, people came forward.  They were not very hard to reach when opportunities were put in front of them.  They were not that difficult to motivate when they could actually hear from their peers that they were coming back into education.  Ms Phelan is a case in point.  She is doing great advocacy work and showing others the benefits of returning to education.  While motivation is a matter for us all, it has to be factored into any new strategy.  Paid educational leave, the tax credit or another incentive to motivate people to make an effort might go some of the way towards covering the costs of returning to education.</p></speech>

It commissioned a report on the progression for people with special educational needs in a post-school set of circumstances.  With regard to higher education, one gets to hang onto whatever supports one had, and one has access to many supports in higher education.  In full-time further education and training, one can get some supports, but if one is in the part-time system one can get nothing.  The bulk of the people we meet have never been diagnosed, although they may have an indication they have dyslexia, for example.  They cannot afford a &euro;500 assessment fee from an educational psychologist who might tell them whether they have dyscalculia or dyslexia.  The adult literacy service may help people address those needs if they have them, but it will be without an assessment.  It is often a matter of trying to cobble together a response to them as opposed to having a more desirable approach.</p> <p>  There are no specialist resources.  We advocate a joined-up approach between the National Council for Special Education and SOLAS to determine how we can share resources.  At present, most of the resources are not even shared.  We could save a lot of money just by sharing what is available in terms of our knowledge, guides and resources.  There is no comprehensive lifelong learning approach to any of these areas.  It is still quite siloed into the school system - the further education system - which is currently considered full-time.  Those in this system contrast with the plethora of people, amounting to hundreds of thousands, engaged in part-time further and adult education and training at local level.</p><p>They are all completely excluded from what the system ordinarily provides.</p></speech>

The hope would be that one would stop the flow out of the education system.  Based on the difference between the programme for international student assessment, PISA, and the programme for the international assessment of adult competencies, PIAAC, quite a deal of research is required to be done on this.  If the resources are going into education to deal with it at that level, there would be a reduction in the requirement for dealing with it at adult level afterwards.  Is that serious research going on to the extent a strategy can be put in place to deal with this anomaly?</p> <p>  I met some of the NALA representatives at the National Ploughing Championships.  They made me wear a coloured wig for a photograph with them.  That will always be with me.</p></speech>

They said they met Deputy Brendan Ryan at the championships, made him wear a wig and took a photograph of it.  Ms Olive Phelan, along with other former literacy students who have now become advocates, does great work trying to explain this issue.  There is a counterintuitive piece about the school system.  It is not to say that schools are not improving and we have fewer people with severe literacy and numeracy difficulties coming out of schools.  However, there is, apparently, some difficulty with the holding on to the attainment level of schools sometime later when people are tested.  I go back to my example of the Irish language.  We are not saying should we change how we teach Irish.  This is about recognising what we can get out of schooling.  It is important that everybody going through the education system would be aware of the vulnerabilities of some of the things they are learning, particularly in later life.  Evidence suggests that if one is not working in certain places, one is particularly at a disadvantage if not using those skills.  In an employment situation where one is doing the same job for 30 years, it might not make much of a difference.  However, in employment where people have to go through an information technology revolution and changing jobs, they are having to deploy different levels of skills and competencies all of the time.  This seems to be underpinned by the need to keep one's skills up to a certain level all the time.</p> <p>  We suggest that this kind of message needs to go out to people about the importance of continuing to read, knowing how to write and compose letters, even writing online, as well as keeping one's numeracy skills up but in a real-life context.  These are the different messages.  Whether more can be done, there is no research going on about these disconnects.  We have made a submission to the literacy and numeracy strategy for children and young people, which is being reviewed.  In it we suggested there is a need to make an explicit link between that strategy and the adult literacy strategy.  The review has said that this is possible.  However, it needs to think through what further needs to be done in that area.</p> <p>  There is no research.  The educational research centres themselves have said this challenging.  I presume that gives some indication that they think further research needs to be done.</p></speech>

What was the age profile and background of those who came to the NALA stand at the ploughing championships?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.62" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Olive Phelan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015112500002#O00500"><p>It was a great mix of age groups.  Deputy Brendan Ryan referred to the wigs.  They are used to take the stigma out of discussing this issue.  We find the wigs allow us to explain what NALA does which allows people bring out their own story.  One is always guaranteed that if they have not got problems with literacy, they would know somebody who has.  I could write a book about the stories I have heard which are heart breaking.  That is what drives me to speak about adult literacy and to reach out to people to take the stigma out of adults coming back to adult literacy classes.</p> <p>  I came back to adult literacy classes seven years ago.  I did an intense course of 16 hours a week for eight weeks.  That gave me the step-up I needed to get in there with reading, writing and a little bit of computers.  I went from a level 1 in writing and spelling up to level 4 but it took years.  Now, I do 2.5 hours a week.  To put that another way, that is one week in a year.  Somebody doing an apprenticeship will get six months to two years to learn a skill.  A week in the year is difficult.  An adult has other life issues to deal with such as looking after grandchildren or parents.  One might not even be able to do those 2.5 hours every week.</p> <p>  My age group would have left school with no IT skills.  Now, we have to have IT experience, especially where banks are concerned and other online activities such as dealing with government bodies.  Adult literacy is not a choice.  People affected must learn to have a good experience in life.  Other than that, they are hiding away from society, unless they get these lifelong skills.  That is not to say that we are not bringing our lifelong experience with us.  We might be the greatest talkers and organisers but we still need the reading, writing and IT skills.  It needs to be packaged around the individual&rsquo;s needs.  It is mainly reading and writing and IT skills.  Mathematics would be a luxury for many people to go back and learn.  </p> <p>  I have come across different examples of adult literacy and how it can lead to better quality of life.  I found going back to education had a ripple effect on all aspects of my life.  It gave me a much better life, whether it was speaking up or inquiring for myself or my family.  Adults need these skills.  When manning a NALA stand, I have met young 20 year olds who could not fill out their CVs, when I could tell they were well able to do courses.  As they are not able to do the reading and writing for the examinations, they turn their back on a F&Aacute;S course they might be doing because they do not want the stigma attached with having problems with their reading and writing.</p><p>They are not going to let the person beside them know they have problems with their reading and writing.  This applies to late teenagers up to people in their 70s.  I have experienced everything in between.</p></speech>

It is very interesting to stand for a day and meet people at a job fair who say they cannot read and write very well, have been unemployed for 12 months and nobody has done anything about it.  Coming to us to avail of a two-hour per week intervention will not address their unemployment.  It is a very serious issue for people who, on the one hand, are being targeted for labour market activation but on the other hand, do not have the necessary educational supports.  The programmes available to them are at a higher level and they are unable to take them up.  They either drop out or, as Ms Phelan mentioned, they put up some reason for which they will not engage in the programme.  At the fairs, increasingly, people were coming to us and telling us literacy was their problem.</p> <p>  Through the Department of Social Protection's probability of exit from the live register, PEX, profiling, unemployed people are asked whether they have literacy and numeracy needs, and people report that they do.  Therefore the Department has the information.  However, there is nowhere to send the people.  There is a significant gap for unemployed people with literacy and numeracy needs.  They are the people who are, increasingly, left in unemployment as the economy recovers.</p></speech>

As part of the PEX interview, on the basis of which a case officer will take on new unemployed people, people are asked whether they have literacy or numeracy difficulties, and they will report it.  However, there is not a sufficient response for unemployed people who have those low-level needs.  They will not be able to benefit from a MOMENTUM project.  When the MOMENTUM scheme was originally envisaged, programmes were targeted at people with low-level needs.  Those programmes no longer exist.  There are no labour market activation programmes targeted at those very low skilled people.  What is available is the existing two-hours per week ETB service.</p> <p>  There is an increasing number of unemployed people in the profile of the adult literacy services participant.  The bulk of the people in the literacy services are in the labour force.  There are hardly any people aged over 65 in the adult literacy services.  The average age of the 35,000 people in the service is 35 years, and they are either working or unemployed.  The number who are unemployed is increasing, given that the Department of Social Protection is referring them to the service.  However, it will take too long to address their needs.  They need a vocational programme that has literacy and numeracy built in and caters for this group.  Such a programme does not exist.</p></speech>

Somebody who had been getting in trouble with the Department of Social Protection for failing to participate in a training course came to my clinic to talk to me about it.  We contacted the Department, outlined the problem and got him onto a literacy programme.  It was probably the short ETB programme, which was probably of no long-term benefit.  This is an aspect we could address in terms of trying to provide something at that level in the Department of Social Protection as a response to the PEX profiling.  There must be an intensive literacy programme.</p></speech>

We have received apologies from Deputy Derek Keating who hopes to join us later.</p><p>I am very pleased to welcome Professor Jonathan Faull, who is the director general of the task force for strategic issues related to the UK referendum.  He will brief us on the current state of play.  As we are all aware, Prime Minister David Cameron, recently at Chatham House set out the UK's reform agenda for its membership of the European Union.  The UK will now begin discussions in earnest with the Commission so it is useful for us to hear from the Commission directly, in particular given that we recently carried out a report looking at the implications for Ireland.  Members will remember that there were 24 specific recommendations within that report which no doubt Professor Faull is aware of.  We hope we will have an opportunity to discuss some of those today and how the Commission might take on board those recommendations to make sure that Ireland's voice is heard in the negotiation process.</p><p>Before I ask Professor Faull to make his contribution, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or persons outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l)</i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons, or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I invite Professor Faull to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

It is a great honour for me to be here.  I have a great deal of admiration for the work of the joint committee and the report it issued in June which has been studied very carefully.  We are well aware of the considerable importance that Ireland attaches to these issues.</p>  <p>  Where do we stand?  The European Commission's view is, uncontroversially, that we want the United Kingdom to remain a member of the European Union.  We believe that is best for the European Union and we believe that it is also best for the United Kingdom itself.  We are, therefore, working to help respond to the concerns expressed by Prime Minister Cameron in his recent letter to the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk, and we are heavily engaged now, as the Chairman said, in a very serious process of discussions.  We have recently completed a round of individual meetings with each of the other 27 member states, including of course this one and will have to come to a view pretty soon &ndash; in the next few days I think &ndash; as to whether the President of the European Council considers that there is sufficient hope for a satisfactory conclusion to a discussion in the European Council in December to schedule such a discussion in the European Council in December.  That is only a few days away and, as I shall illustrate in a few minutes, there are still considerable difficulties around some of the issues under discussion.  A European Council meeting is scheduled in December and the next one scheduled after that will be in February.</p> <p>It is hoped that if it is not possible to reach final decisions in December then the period up to February will be used to resolve outstanding differences and the Council could reach its conclusions in February.  When the British referendum takes place is, of course, a matter for the British Government.  We do not know when that will happen.  The Act providing for the referendum is still making its way through the British Parliament.  All we can say is that we know, as does everyone else, that it has to take place by the end of 2017 but we do not know the exact date.<br/><br/>The implications for Ireland are considerable and the recent very good report on the matter raises a number of important issues in that regard.  This is widely understood in Brussels and in all of the other member states.  The outcome of the referendum will be an answer to the question, &quot;Do you want to remain in the European Union?&quot; and if the United Kingdom remains in the EU, as we hope will be the case, then the implications for Ireland are positive.  Based on my understanding of the Irish position, the <i>status quo</i>will prevail and whatever reforms have been agreed between now and the referendum in the context of the British re-negotiations, the reformed European Union which the United Kingdom will have voted to remain in will not be in any way objectionable to Ireland.<br/><br/>If, however, the United Kingdom votes to leave the EU, then we are in completely uncharted waters.  This has never happened before and nobody knows the outcome of the negotiations, which would certainly follow a decision by a member state to leave the EU.  Of course, we are aware of the particular concerns of Ireland in that regard but I do not wish to speculate about any of the details because I am unable to do so.  We do not know how the United Kingdom's Government, the governments of the other 27 member states and the institutions of the European Union would set about crafting new relationships in that unfortunate eventuality.  The voice of Ireland is being heard in London, Belfast, Cardiff and Edinburgh too.  We have every reason to believe that the other European capitals are also well aware of the particular implications for this country of this debate because of Britain and Ireland's shared history and the existence of the land border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.  <br/><br/>The British Prime Minister has set out in his letter four categories of issues that he wishes to be resolved.  They are the relationship between the euro area countries and the non-euro area countries, sovereignty, competitiveness and welfare.  I will take them one by one and try to explain how we see things developing.  The relationship between the euro area countries and the non-euro area countries is one which has come to the fore, for obvious reasons, in the discussions on measures in response to the financial and economic crisis.  In the building, for example, of the banking union, we have had to face what are often difficult, technical, political and legal issues about how we create mechanisms for banking union countries, which at present are just the euro area countries - other countries may join the banking union later - on the one hand, and those countries which retain their own national currencies on the other hand.  We have found solutions throughout the difficult discussions on the banking union, for example, on reassuring the non-euro area countries that their interests will not be harmed by discrimination on grounds of location or currency and on the difficult technical issue of how we use the EU budget as a whole to deal with euro area -specific issues.<br/><br/>We have found solutions to those problems and it is not particularly difficult to distil them down into principles which can give the necessary reassurances to both sides that there is no reason why the banking union in the euro area cannot co-exist with the wider single market.  The countries not using the common currency, the euro, are in different categories.  There are those countries which are preparing to join the euro or who want to join the euro as soon as they can and then there are two countries with rather different opt-outs, Denmark and the United Kingdom.  The latter says that its Government's intention is not to join the euro or the banking union.  We must look at all of those rather complex relationships and make the necessary arrangements so that all of the member states, whatever their status, feel comfortable in this new developing world.  <br/><br/>On the question of sovereignty, there are two main issues under discussion.  One is the notion of ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, which is an expression found in today's EU treaties and which goes all the way back to the very first treaty of the European Economic Community, EEC, the Treaty of Rome.  Indeed, it is to be found in the treaties of accession of new member states, including the United Kingdom, when they joined the European Union.  That expression has always been understood generally as not having any particular legal effect in its own right, but as expressing an aspiration of co-operation among the peoples of Europe but not integration among governments and states of Europe.  However, it has come to mean, in the British political debate, something rather different.  I do not know how it is understood here but I hear from other member states that what is seen as an aspiration about co-operation between peoples is somehow understood differently in the UK, where it is interpreted as symbolising a move towards further integration.  If that is true, and I have no reason to doubt the people who are telling us that, then as a matter of fact, it is understood in different ways in different places and that must be addressed.  I hope that will be possible.<br/><br/>The second sovereignty issue, one no doubt close to the hearts of the members of this committee, as parliamentarians, is the role of national parliaments in the decision making processes of the EU.  As the committee will know, over the last few years in successive amendments, national parliaments have taken on a greater role in considering European Union business.  My understanding is that the British Government would like to go a step further and give a further enhanced role to national parliaments, particularly in respect of subsidiarity issues.</p> <p>The idea is that if a number of national parliaments object to a particular proposal on the grounds of subsidiarity, something should happen.  What that "something" is would be a matter for debate.  Should it be stopped, for example, should further consideration be given and what further process should take place after such an event?  That is a matter for further discussion and it is fair to say the United Kingdom was not alone in thinking that national parliaments could play a greater role without, of course, in any way undermining the particular institutional role of the European Parliament.</p> <p> The third basket of issues concerns competitiveness and what the British Government wants to see.  Prime Minister Cameron's letter sets this out.  It indicates the British Government wants to see a greater focus on efforts to boost competitiveness, growth and employment creation in the European Union.  That is a very widely shared view and something that the European Commission believes is already happening.  There is no doubt it could be done even more effectively than it is now and what we are doing must be explained very clearly.  The new Commission under President Jean-Claude Juncker has made it clear that it wants to concentrate on the essential matters; we say "big on the big things and small on the small things".  It is about doing everything we can to get growth and jobs back into the European economy by focusing on the various tools at our disposal, making the Single Market a reality and making good, effective and fair trade agreements.  It is generally about taking measures to ensure that our companies, particularly the small and medium-sized companies sector, will not be overly burdened by regulation and are enabled to become more competitive.</p> <p> The fourth issue and no doubt the most controversial in our discussion so far is what the British Prime Minister's letter calls immigration and we think of as raising issues of free movement and the relationship between free movement and welfare systems between member states of the European Union.  As is well known, the United Kingdom - although not alone in this - has seen a large and essentially unpredicted influx of people from other member states in the past decade or so.  The British Government has identified certain incentives that it believes may be acting as an artificial pull factor for such an influx of workers using their free movement rights as citizens of the European Union.  The British Government wants to alter the incentive effect that some aspects of its social security system seem to create.  It is controversial because the mechanism identified both in the Conservative Party's manifesto before the last general election and in Mr. Cameron's letter is a four-year delay in eligibility for certain in-work social security benefits.  There is the challenge of how to reconcile that sort of measure with the fundamental principle that in the European Union, workers should not be discriminated against on grounds of nationality within our Single Market.  I do not hide from the committee that this is not easy and it is controversial; unsurprisingly, it is the issue that many other national delegations raised with us when we met.  I hope our colleagues in London are working very hard to try to find solutions.  It is the most difficult technical, legal and, perhaps, political example of the problems we face.</p> <p> I hope all of this will be resolved.  The European Council is the forum in which this will be decided, so the Heads of State or Government of our member states will come together in a summit and reach decisions that will enable Mr. Cameron to go home and start the campaign for the referendum.  That will take place and we hope it will have a positive outcome.</p></speech>

In that way, we can give everybody a chance.  I will kick off and try to keep within the two minutes.</p>  <p>  I thank Professor Faull for his comments.  He mentioned our report.  I welcome that the Commission is engaging on this and my understanding is that this is the first time the Commission has publicly engaged with a committee process.  We very much welcome that and appreciate the delegation taking the time to be here.  I come from the north east of this country and we are particularly concerned about a potential exit of Britain from the European Union.  We have seen the benefits of the peace process and that is one of the reasons we heard from experts about the potential impact.  Our report contains four recommendations relating to the North, with three being bilateral recommendations between ourselves and the UK, whereby we need to put in place funding for the European bodies that might be abolished.  We have a proposal to ensure the impact on agriculture and tourism is taken into account.  We also have a proposal on the future role of the Irish Government in the negotiations.  What role does Professor Faull envisage the Irish Government having in these negotiations, specifically relating to Northern Ireland?</p>  <p>  A second question relates to a potential exit.  We asked our Minister recently what plans the Irish Government has for a potential exit and whether there is a plan B.  What is the Commission doing with respect to contingency planning?  Does it have a plan B in place so that if a referendum leads to a British withdrawal, the Commission will be in a position to act?</p></speech>

It is very encouraging.  The witnesses' position is interesting and there will certainly be no misunderstanding of Professor Faull's knowledge of Britain and its role in the European Union.  That is helpful, to say the least, as he knows the nuances and background of what has arisen in the context of the British idea of having a referendum.  It will be a once-off and it will not happen too often.</p>  <p>  The points made by Prime Minister Cameron are not all that unreasonable.  They are manageable within the European Union.  We have faced major crises in the past with respect to different issues and treaties.  With the connections with colleagues and the European Council, there will be a positive outcome, which is very important.</p>  <p>  Will the witness remind the negotiators of the effect if Britain withdraws?  For example, it could affect US-European Union negotiations on treaties and exports from the United Kingdom to the rest of Europe.  There would also be implications for the car industry and financial services in London, as well as the strength of sterling compared with the euro.  There are many issues that are not necessarily evident on the negotiating side from Mr. Cameron and I hope they will be reminded of the position.  Of course, we would be most directly affected and our position would have to be fully taken into account as working and long-standing members of the European Union.</p> <p>I have a certain sympathy for Mr. Cameron on the points he made regarding how European legislation is transposed into the laws of member states.  Far too many statutory instruments are implemented here without proper debate in the D&aacute;il or Seanad.</p></speech>

On the question of eurozone versus non-eurozone countries and the relationship they expect to have in the future, we should be moving towards a situation where all countries within the European Union use the euro.  I have always held the view that it is not feasible or sustainable to have that division there.  With the passage of time, I am further convinced of it.</p>  <p>  In regard to national parliaments versus the EU, we have spoken about this issue on numerous occasions.  I have yet to find the person who can tell me how national parliamentary policy, when superimposed on the EU, is going to be accepted by all member states.  Each parliament has its own priorities and shopping list.  I would love to hear how it is intended to marry the wish lists of national parliaments with the requirements of the European institutions.</p>  <p>  I will not refer to competitiveness because I expect it to be covered by colleagues.  In regard to the UK and its welfare system, I cannot understand the argument that is being made.  If we compare our welfare system with that of the UK, we do not come off all that badly.  It is at least as good as the neighbouring system.  There may have been a misunderstanding somewhere along the line but I do not think this is to do with welfare.  People who converge on the more developed countries within the EU do so for economic reasons which are not beyond explanation.  People from this country have done the same and will continue to do so.  If freedom of movement is to mean something, then the presumption must be there that people will move freely to achieve a better result economically for themselves.</p>  <p>  We all know the consequences of a British exit from the EU.  It will not be good for the Union.  If some member states come to the conclusion that we will get along fine without the UK, they will be wrong.  Brexit would be the beginning of the end, the beginning of the break-up of the EU and the ending of a project we have come to appreciate over 50 years.  It will be a very sad and bad day if that happens.</p></speech>

The problem for the European Union is that, on one hand, it cannot be seen to give Britain too much.  The UK must be given enough to encourage its people to vote to stay in the Union.  On the other hand, however, if too much is ceded, there is a danger that other member states will try for the same.  The delegates must attempt to marry those two considerations.  I do not see how we can change the fundamental pillar of EU membership that is the concept and practice of the free movement of peoples within the Union and the expectation of a uniformity of application in respect of workers' rights.  Ireland is a small country and we have managed that well.  When ten new member states joined the EU in 2004, we were one of the few countries not to impose any restrictions on persons from those states coming here.  That was not universally welcomed by the population but we did it.  It could be argued, of course, that it led subsequently to difficulties for us as we faced severe economic challenges.  The point is that there are both gains and losses in being a member of the Union.  For me, the gains far outweigh any potential losses.</p>  <p>  We must move relatively quickly in this negotiation process so that the question can be put to the British people as soon as possible.  It is at that point in the course of the referendum campaign that voters, when all the aspects of membership of the Union are put starkly to them, will make up their minds.  The delegates are aware of the decisions we have had to take in the past in respect of the failure to pass certain treaties and so on.  When the politics was stripped away and those who have a real stake in society, whether they be employers, support organisations or other groups, got to have their say, it gelled with voters.  I have great faith in the capacity of the British people over time to see the benefits they gain from membership of the EU.</p></speech>

As colleagues noted, we have debated this issue in great depth here at the committee.  The collective conclusion of those debates was that Ireland will suffer terribly if the UK decides to pull out of Europe.  We also discovered from our academic and financial advisers that Britain, equally, would suffer terribly.  It is saddening that the UK is considering a withdrawal from the EU at a time of great crisis not just in Europe but throughout the world.  There is a greater case to be made for unity as against individual nations taking sovereignty to the degree to which Britain is taking it.</p>  <p>  The document Prime Minister Cameron gave to Mr. Tusk is very valuable because it tells us the issues that are of most interest to the UK.  We have no problem with some of them, such as measures to combat fraud, sham marriages and other peripheral stuff.  I foresee no problem with negotiations on those proposals.  However, we have a fundamental problem with the proposals the UK is making in regard to welfare.  I would argue strongly that Ireland's welfare system is superior to that of the UK but there is no argument being made here - certainly no argument based on fact - that welfare is the attraction for people coming to our country.  To dismiss the 300,000 migrants coming to Britain as welfare tourists is fundamentally wrong.  The UK will have to explain to Europe and the world how it proposes to discriminate against those who might be deemed to be welfare migrants as opposed to the doctors, architects, lawyers and so on it wishes to welcome.  How will that differentiation be managed?</p>  <p>  The argument for controlling the movement of EU citizens between member states requires significant elaboration.  One might understand the desire to control the numbers coming in from outside the Union but when it comes to internal movement, the UK is on very dodgy ground.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.88" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112500005#D00500"><p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their contribution.  We all are aware of the negative impact a UK exit from the European Union would have on the Irish economy, particularly the agricultural, food and drinks industries.  The worst-case prediction is that it would affect our GDP by up to 3.1%, with the figure being 1.1% in a best-case scenario.  There is no doubt it would have a detrimental effect on this country.  Ireland is the only member state which has a border with the UK, which has its own particular consequences.</p>  <p>  Many of us have travelled to Britain to meet members of the Government and Opposition there.  I attended such meetings as part of a delegation representing European socialists.  What we saw clearly is that there is a continuous opposition to the EU within the Conservative Party irrespective of what negotiations are actually taking place in Europe.  Many of those people just want out and that is it.  It was extraordinarily interesting to discover there are elements within the British Labour Party who are likewise sceptical about remaining in Europe, even if they do not voice that scepticism openly.</p>  <p>  Reading the British newspapers, one gets the impression that for the people of Britain, this is really all about freedom of movement.  The ordinary man in the street seems to be expressing the view that there are too many people from other countries living in Britain and that is the fault of the UK's EU membership.  Even though that is a falsity, the fact remains that it will be extremely difficult to convince the British public otherwise.  When the three main parties remain divided on the issue - not to mention the position promoted by UKIP, which polled quite well in the last election but did not get the seat numbers reflective of that - and the public is inclined towards the simplistic view that the UK should get out of Europe because of the apparent consequences of freedom of movement, it seems clear there are real dangers in terms of the outcome of the referendum.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.89" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112500006#E00100"><p>I approach this debate from the perspective that we need serious and radical democratic reform within Europe.  Only a fool would suggest we did not need to strengthen the accountability and transparency of European institutions.  We also need to be honest about the mistakes and failings which have led to a growing number of people across Europe being alienated from the institutions of the European Union.  Starting from that basis, I note that Professor Faull said at the start of his contribution that there was a clear understanding within member states of the difficulties facing Ireland in relation to the British exit.  Has the Irish dimension been formally discussed at any level?  How have the member states actually reacted to the negotiations so far?  Are people up for discussing the serious issues I have outlined that the British Government has lumped in with its concerns as well?  Is there a view across Europe that the British have gone too far?  I met Alex Salmond, the leader of the SNP in Westminster, and we spoke about the free travel between Ireland and Britain.  How significant is the fact that it pre-dates both of our European Union membership?  Ireland has concerns about that free travel.  When will the negotiations themselves finish?  There was talk at one stage of December, but I do not think that is going to happen.  There are issues around migrants and welfare reform and there has been an awful branding of people as "welfare tourists".  Does the British Government have figures to back its argument on this up?</p></speech>

I confirm that this is the first time I have spoken to a parliamentary committee.  Even though this is at a, frankly, delicate stage and there are lots of things, as the members will see in a moment, on which I simply cannot answer, I thought it was right to come here first because we acknowledge that Ireland has a very specific and important stake in the outcome of these discussions.  To make a few general remarks first, I am not here as a Brit.  I happen to be a Brit, but I am also a European Commission official.  Certainly, I do not represent the British Government.  When I say "we" and "our" occasionally, it is because it is an easy way to explain things.  However, I am a European civil servant.  My job is to try to understand what Mr. David Cameron wants and to help craft the appropriate responses.  That means a great deal of legal analytical work and a great deal of discussion with the other member states on what they, who are the ones who will ultimately have to decide, can agree with the UK.  What all this means for the referendum campaign is a second and completely separate issue.  Who knows to what extent whatever happens in these negotiations will have an impact on the way the men and women of Britain vote?  No one can tell.  To what extent some of the issues the committee members raised, including the City of London, sterling, exports and agreements with the United States of America, will play a role is not something anyone knows at the moment.  I would be surprised if they were not mentioned and debated in the campaign which is barely beginning now, but they are not matters on which we are negotiating with the British Government.  They are not matters that Mr. Cameron wants to see Brussels reacting to immediately, as he set out in his letter, other than under the general notion of competitiveness where, no doubt, he wants to see more effective trade agreements.</p>  <p>  What is the role of the Irish Government in the negotiations now?  The members should ask the Irish Government.  Like all other member states, it is involved in the discussions in Brussels which have taken place and which will continue to take place in the run-up to the European Council meeting on 17 and 18 December 2015.  It will be involved in such subsequent meetings as may be necessary.  I talk to Irish officials.  I did so just this morning before coming here.  There is a regular round of contacts in Brussels and I am sure Irish Ministers and diplomats all over Europe are talking to their counterparts in other countries and leaving them in no doubt of the importance Ireland attaches to this issue.  Everybody understands that instinctively, but it also needs to be brought home to them precisely what it means for the Border, the Border regions on both sides and, more generally, for Anglo-Irish relations.</p>  <p>  Do we have a plan B or contingency plan?  No.  There is no speculation or consideration about the outcome of a referendum which has not even been called yet and on which the campaign has barely begun.  We hope the outcome will be that the United Kingdom remains in the EU and therefore the EU remains united.  To those committee members who mentioned the other huge crisis facing us, I come from a city which is still largely in lock-down because of a very serious terrorist threat.  We all know the major challenges facing Europe politically, economically and in security terms and we certainly believe the unity of Europe is very important at this moment.</p>  <p>  Somebody said that all member states should be in the eurozone.  I think it was Deputy Durkan.  The treaty says very clearly that the euro is a currency of the European Union but as a matter of fact we know that some member states do not have it as their currency.  We also know that they are not obliged to have the euro as their currency.  The United Kingdom and Denmark have legal opt-outs of slightly different kinds, but they both have them.  It is fair to say that the relationship between eurozone and non-eurozone countries is a genuine issue and it will not disappear overnight through everybody joining the euro.  That is simply not the world we live in.  In the Single Market and on this island we have to live with that reality and make sensible arrangements for doing so.</p>  <p>  The challenge for national parliaments in working together is a considerable one.  National parliaments have their domestic role and there are several ways they can feed into European business by controlling their own executives but also by taking positions in co-operation with other national parliaments.  How that is organised is largely a matter for the committee members and their colleagues but it is an area of considerable importance.  We are talking not so much about whether a particular policy choice is a good one; subsidiarity is much more fundamental.  Whether a particular issue is best dealt with at national or at European level is an issue that is often very important and people have different views.  I agree that national parliaments are very well placed to have strong views on the subject and should share those views with colleagues in other places and bring them to bear on the Brussels process.  That is the general idea.  How it is organised-----</p></speech>

It is hard to determine precisely what causes individuals to move in search of work or to take up a job offer from one country to another.  The availability of work is obviously important.  Our shared language must play a role too because we speak the language which most other Europeans today learn as a second language or want to improve their proficiency in.  We have wonderful weather in our countries and so forth.  There are many factors which go into the decision to emigrate, which is not an easy one.  Ireland knows very well how much turmoil and upheaval emigration can cause.  For people to take that step, the question is to what extent does the welfare system in the host country play a role.  There are some data on it.  The British Government has put forward some data on this too.  For us, it is simply a matter of fact that this is what the British Government wants to discuss.  Therefore, we are discussing it.  All other European Union member states have to proceed on that basis.  This is what Mr. Cameron has said he wants to change and what the other European Union leaders, collectively, have to decide is acceptable.  It is also complicated by the fact that the British welfare system, domestically, is undergoing a process of reform.  We are not quite sure precisely what the criteria would be to whom a particular measure would apply.</p></speech>

I know the British Chancellor of the Exchequer is delivering his autumn statement this afternoon.  Against that background of reform of the domestic welfare system, one now has this European issue.  Discrimination is obviously at the heart of the problem it causes for the European Union to treat people differently in the Single Market.  We will have to look at that carefully.</p>  <p>  As some members said, this, of course, feeds into the timing question.  The European Council will meet on 17 December, roughly 20 days away.  Is it possible to conclude these discussions, at least between civil servants, so that prime ministers and presidents can have a detailed substantive discussion in a few weeks&rsquo; time?  It is not impossible but given the complexity of some of these issues and the relatively recent date on which the United Kingdom Prime Minister sent his letter to Mr. Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, it is not going to be easy.  We will see where we are before the European Council meets on 17 December.  If there are papers to be written, they have to be given to prime ministers in advance so they can study and analyse them to come ready for a serious debate.  If that is not possible, we will go into next year.  The next scheduled European Council is in February.  That gives us a few more weeks to work on these very tricky issues.</p>  <p>  As to when the negotiations will finish, they will finish when they finish and we find mutually acceptable ways to resolve these problems.  It is not for me to answer whether the United Kingdom has gone too far or not far enough.  People will have political views on that.  I am not a politician.  What I know is what Mr. Cameron has written down in his letter.  That is what we have to engage with.</p>  <p>  The Irish position is pretty well-known in the capitals around Europe.  I am sure Irish diplomats, officials and Ministers are losing no opportunity to make that clear.  There is considerable understanding, therefore, of the Irish position because of its geography, history and economic with the United Kingdom.  The Irish dimension is clearly under discussion and understood.  The very effective Irish Civil Service is very busy doing that.</p>  <p>  It is certainly not for me to comment on whether a Brexit would be the beginning of the end, as Deputy Durkan said in rather apocalyptic terms.  I hope it does not happen.  We are working hard to ensure it does not happen.  However, there is no doubt that a Brexit would have considerable consequences for the Continent and our Union.  Some of those are perhaps predictable, while some of them will be unpredictable and, therefore, unpredicted, as Europe reacts to this new and unprecedented development.  Our outlook on all of this is that we have Mr. Cameron's proposals.  We are discussing them in enormous detail in Brussels with each of the other 27 member states and other European institutions.  A real negotiation has started but it is only recently started.  Mr. Cameron's letter was dated 10 November.  There were all sorts of exploratory talks before that. Now, we are in serious and earnest negotiations.  The stakes are high for us all and we will try our best to ensure we resolve this problem as soon as possible.</p></speech>

The committee has had interaction over the years with different EU presidencies and strong views have been expressed by some countries about the importance of ever-closer union.  None of us disagrees with the idea that we need to be more democratically accountable to the individual peoples and that parliaments need to have a greater role.  How does Professor Jonathan Faull see Britain negotiations in this ever-closer union dimension?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Jonathan Faull" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015112500007#F00600"><p>The expression of ever-closer union has been in the treaty since the beginning.  It is ever-closer union among the peoples.  It is not never-ending integration between states and governments.  It seems to be understood differently in different places.  The reality of today's Europe is, as we know it, different member states are doing different things.  Some are in the euro, some are not.  Some are in Schengen, some are not.  The United Kingdom has quite a catalogue of protocols, declarations and opt-outs which have co-existed quite happily with the language of ever-closer union among the peoples of Europe remaining in the treaty.</p>  <p>  Again, however, political facts are what they are.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Osborne, made a speech in Berlin recently where he said frankly that we have come to understand this term differently in Britain from most of the rest of Europe.</p> <p>It has come to symbolise for some in Britain a never-ending, relentless move towards further integration, so they say they want that issue addressed.  Can it be addressed in a way that allows other countries to continue to understand it in a way with which they are comfortable?  I do not believe that is impossible.  That is one of the challenges facing us.  It is not an expression that has legal effects on its own, and it is not a basis for European legislation.<br/><br/>The finest bit of ever-closer union I have seen recently was the football crowd in Wembley Stadium singing the <i>La Marseillaise</i>the other day.  This was an example of people understanding that they have a common destiny and face common challenges.  It was not about committee meetings and regulations in Brussels.  Whether it is a different understanding or a misunderstanding, it is a fact and we have to deal with it.  I believe we can find ways of doing so.</p></speech>

CUDA is grateful for the invitation to discuss topical issues pertaining to credit unions.  CUDA was formed in 2003.  It is owned by and represents many of the largest credit unions in the country.  It also provides a wide range of support services to them and a growing number of credit unions throughout the country.  I am the CEO of CUDA and I am joined by my colleague, Ms Elaine Larke, who is head of legal and compliance at CUDA.  Members have a copy of my slides which I will go through.  <br/><br/>The blueprint for the future of credit unions in Ireland has been set out in the report of the Commission on Credit Unions which was published in April 2012 and resulted in the Credit Union Act 2012.  The commission's report provided a factual insight into the financial position of credit unions.  It looked at international best practice and presented its views on where the credit union movement in Ireland should be headed.  It went on to make proposals for stabilising and restructuring the sector and for strengthening the legislative and regulatory frameworks, including an improved governance regime.  We are now in the final stage of implementation which should see the introduction of a tiered regulatory framework.  Unfortunately, we are not getting that and this deviation has the potential to place the credit union movement in jeopardy.<br/><br/>CUDA works with credit unions to help them develop their business models in line with their requirement to remain viable and relevant.  These business models reflect the needs of the credit union members.  Like the commission, we realise that not all business models are or will be the same.  The commission envisaged an environment that offered a flexible approach to the regulation of credit unions and assists credit unions in determining the business model they wish to adopt.  Some examples have been illustrated on slide No. 3.  It was to allow some credit unions to continue to offer basic savings and loans.  It was also to allow other credit unions to develop and offer a greater range of services as long as they have the necessary scale and comply with specific additional requirements.  This is what is meant by a tiered regulatory framework.<br/><br/>While sharing the same ethos, values and principles, the business models vary as they are driven by the needs of their respective members.  Slide No. 4 demonstrates the breadth of needs that exist which can be categorised across personal business and community needs.  CUDA supports credit unions achieve their clear vision of helping members become financially independent through access to financial services, products and education.  CUDA has identified a spectrum of co-operation which ranges from knowledge sharing right through to the good work of the ReBo team who support credit unions which wish to merge.  <br/><br/>In 2011, CUDA developed the credit union support platform.  Building on that success, CUDA introduced a shared compliance and risk management officer service and now a series of exciting and innovative projects are ongoing under the auspices of the solution centre.  There is little point in working on expanding these services if we do not have an enabling regulatory and legislative framework that supports the development of enhanced business models.<br/><br/>Credit unions have taken on significant change and the <i>quid pro quo</i>was that there would be a tiered regulation.  Unfortunately, the Central Bank is now choosing to deviate from the commission's recommendations.  New regulations for credit unions, following the consultation paper CP88, primarily focus on minimising or eliminating risk to the detriment of the appropriate development and evolution of the sector. <br/><br/>The vast majority of credit unions are financially sound, compliant, competent and ready to provide more services to more people.  It is time to recognise that fact and to allow them to do what they do best which is to offer the services their members rightly expect from a modern credit union.  Strangling credit unions with over-zealous regulation will see their demise and force credit union members to switch to more expensive banks.</p><p>There is a simple answer to this dilemma.  Before the Minister, Deputy Noonan, allows further rules to come into effect, by commencing the remaining sections of 2012 Act, he should conduct a review on how the commission&rsquo;s recommendations are being implemented and whether the legislation and regulations reflect the current needs of credit union members.  This will afford the opportunity to ensure there are no unintended consequences and that all the good work of all the stakeholders, is not unravelled.</p></speech>

I am the chair of the Credit Union Managers Association, CUMA, and I am joined today by my colleague Ms Lisa Stapleton.  I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for invitation to come here to discuss recent regulatory matters and their impact on the credit union sector.</p> <p>  CUMA is the professional representative association for managers of credit unions in Ireland.  CUMA provides professional development training and assistance to its members and engages with a wide range of stakeholders and industry bodies in our pursuit of excellence in professional standards in credit union management.  Our main priority is to ensure that members&rsquo; savings are protected through prudent, transparent and effective professional management.</p> <p>  CUMA fully supports the introduction of a strong regulatory framework for credit unions as recommended by the Commission on Credit Unions.  Credit union boards and management teams have successfully introduced major regulatory changes over the past three years.  The introduction of these new requirements in the areas of risk, compliance, internal audit, fitness and probity and minimum competencies, policies and procedures were, we understood, designed to prepare credit unions for the future growth and development of our sector.  This we believe would enable credit unions to further provide excellent high-quality services on a local basis to local communities.</p> <p>  Despite the prophecies of many, we have come through the financial crisis relatively unscathed and are well placed and prepared collectively and locally in the interests of our members to move to the next exciting stage of our development.  However, CUMA is extremely disappointed at the outcome of the consultation process with regard to CP88.  Following consultation with the movement, the Central Bank received 117 submissions all of which rejected the proposed regulations for sound business reasons.  Having reviewed and then ignored these submissions, the Central Bank is proposing further restrictions on our business, the most controversial and ultimately damaging to credit unions being a cap on shares, a new short-term liquidity requirement, a cap on lending terms and, most controversially, the intention of the bank to regulate credit unions on an undifferentiated one-size-fits-all basis.  CUMA believes that some of these proposals run contrary to the objects of credit unions, as enshrined in credit union legislation, and are disproportionate, unnecessary and potentially damaging to our future growth.</p> <p>  CUMA has contended in the context of previous consultation papers that the sector should not be regulated on a one-size-fits-all basis.  Rather, we contend that a tiered regulatory approach which supports growth and development and which can be adapted to reflect proportionality and complexity, as recommended by the Commission on Credit Unions, would be more appropriate.  This type of model is recognised as a strategy requirement in the Central Bank's strategic plan for the period 2013 to 2015.  All stakeholders, including Government and the Central Bank, signed up to the recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions.  Credit unions have complied with the new extensive governance requirements as outlined earlier.  We have participated in restructuring and have awaited the tiered framework to allow us to evolve under regulations based on the nature, scale and complexity of our chosen business model.  The Central Bank, however, has diverged significantly and on a selective basis from the agreed set of recommendations by omission and by planning the introduction of this most recent manifestation of the one-size-fits-all regulations that will undermine the sustainability of credit unions, both small and large.</p> <p>  CUMA is concerned that the planned commencement at the end of December, without amendment, of the remaining sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 and the regulations set out in the Central Bank's CP88 pose a significant threat to the competitive viability of the credit union sector.  We believe CP88 regulations are an unnecessary involvement by our regulator in the day-to-day operations of credit unions.  CUMA, therefore, calls on the Minister for Finance not to commence the remaining sections of the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 pending a focused review of the proposed regulations in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Credit Unions.</p></speech>

I am joined today by John Knox from the research and development department of the league.  The Irish League of Credit Unions represents 437 credit unions across the island of Ireland.  The league-affiliated credit unions in the Republic of Ireland have almost 3 million members, savings in excess of &euro;11 billion and over &euro;13 billion in total assets.</p> <p>  As the committee is aware, credit unions are a voluntary, visionary movement.  Members own and run their credit unions.  Being a grassroots, not-for-profit organisation founded and run for a social purpose, credit unions are a unique financial institution.  Democratically run, volunteer-led, and based on helping members and not profiting from customers, our ethos sets us apart.</p> <p>  The economic crash has put enormous pressure on families and credit unions have been there for them.  Now we want to do more.  The clear, focused policy steps we advocate will strengthen credit unions, ensure that prudent lending is available to those who cannot access it elsewhere and make a major contribution to key national objectives including social housing and small business.  The specific policies we advocate for are set out in the league&rsquo;s six strategic steps policy document.</p> <p>  Credit unions have an exciting developmental agenda as demonstrated by our payments company CUSOP.  We are rolling out electronic payment facilities in credit unions and with some financial assistance this could be done much more quickly.  As members will know, providing loans at affordable interest rates for those who cannot access credit elsewhere is the reason credit unions were established.  With this in mind, credit unions are at the forefront of a project to provide those on welfare with a real alternative to moneylenders.  Led by the Department of Social Protection and in conjunction with the Social Finance Foundation, over 30 credit unions are involved in a six-month pilot of a new loan scheme which we hope will be a solution to this pressing social need.</p> <p>  Providing credit to small and micro-businesses is something credit unions already do and is a key contribution our movement can make to a recovering economy.  Our aim is to create a central fund in which individual credit unions could invest so that loans would be available to small businesses nationwide.  Expertly supported and effectively regulated, pooling the resources participating credit unions hold individually will ensure availability of credit more widely throughout the economy.  This would match available credit union capacity with small enterprise that needs credit to survive and develop.  This proposal meets a need that clearly is not being adequately met by other lending agencies and it is in keeping with the social, community-based objectives of our movement.</p> <p>  Serving a broader social agenda is part of what credit unions were set up to do.  At present, credit unions hold surplus funds of &euro;8 billion in investments on behalf of members.  We believe these surplus funds could be used more effectively.  Under current regulations, there are limited options for the management and placement of these funds.  We believe these funds could be better used to deliver key social goals, while also fully protecting them.  For example, credit unions surplus funds could be used to assist in important areas of Government policy such as social housing.  In this regard we have recently submitted a detailed proposal to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  However, a major barrier to this and many of the other initiatives I have outlined is the impending regulations which are due to apply to credit unions.  The final sections of the Credit Union and Co-Operation with Overseas Regulators Act 2012 are due to be commenced in January 2016 and the accompanying regulations will place limits on the savings credit unions can take in from their members, but also limit the types of investments they can make.</p><p>There now is a growing disconnect between the ethos of credit unions and that of our regulator, the Registry of Credit Unions, which sits within the Central Bank.  That disconnect is highlighted again in the recent publication by the Central Bank of the report by the International Credit Union Regulators Network, ICURN, entitled Central Bank of Ireland Peer Review Report: Central Bank Performance of its Regulatory Functions in Relation to Credit Unions.  We note the ICURN review team expressed concern at the sheer volume and complexity of the requirements with which credit union boards of directors and management must now comply.  It therefore is very frustrating that the views expressed on behalf of credit unions regarding the overly onerous regulatory approach of the Central Bank have not been taken into account or acknowledged.</p><p> This is not about being for or against regulation.  It is about better, more effective regulation and doing the right thing.  A lot has changed since the report of the Government's Commission on Credit Unions was published and its recommendations partially implemented and the Government's own analysis of Ireland&rsquo;s economic position says as much.  Now is the time, we strongly believe, to pause briefly, review and then move forward on the basis of better regulation for the future of credit unions.  I again thank the joint committee for its invitation.</p></speech>

Before I call on Deputy Michael McGrath to begin proceedings, I presume the witnesses have seen the transcripts of the debate last night on the Private Members' motion in the D&aacute;il.  I am aware some of the witnesses already have had meetings with the Minister and his officials.  The joint committee intends to prepare a report to be submitted to the Minister and the regulator will appear before the joint committee on 16 December.  Consequently, when replying, witnesses should bear in mind that the committee will try to tease out more answers for them with the regulator and the Minister.  Consequently, they can put such points on the record when giving their replies.</p></speech>

This meeting is a great opportunity for the credit union movement to state its case before an Oireachtas joint committee, and in their presentations the witnesses have done this clearly and cogently.  It is clear that there is a huge amount of goodwill towards credit unions across the political spectrum.  However, it also is clear that this no longer is enough and credit unions now need practical support at a political level to ensure the movement has a viable future.  At the outset, I will express my hope that the outcome of these hearings will be that agreement can be reached on an all-party and non-party basis to call on the Minister to press the pause button and to not sign into law the remaining sections of the 2012 Act pending a review of the implementation of the recommendations of the commission.  I hope such an agreement can be reached, and I am putting down a marker that I do not believe the joint committee can wait until after meeting the registrar on 16 December to make that recommendation, because the horse could well have bolted by then.  That is my view, but it will be a matter for members to make that final decision.</p> <p>  One key issue that continues to emerge is this one-size-fits-all approach to regulation and the non-implementation of the recommendation from the commission for a tiered approach to regulation.  I note Mr. Johnson addressed this point in his presentation, in which he outlined three separate strands, but on a day-to-day basis, what difference does this uniform regulatory approach make to credit unions despite the diverse nature of independent credit unions in terms of scale, complexity and their day-to-day operations?  What problems is that causing?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.123" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Johnson" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015112500002#D00400"><p>I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for the question.  The idea of setting out on the third slide that illustration of what business models could be like was an attempt to reflect the obvious diversity within each credit union.  The problem is that when one is pitching one-size-fits-all rules, it is aiming at an average, and we do not have an average credit union.  Incidentally, if one goes back to the objective of the commission report, the idea behind tiered regulation was twofold.  In the first instance, it was to protect the smaller credit unions, which does not necessarily just mean size - although it tends to be related to the asset size - but means smaller in the sense of its business model, that is, in the services it provides.  In looking at that illustration, it would be the more traditional model of basic savings and basic personal unsecured loans.  The idea here is that appropriate governance would reflect this in order that the cost of meeting all these regulatory requirements would be proportionate to the level of business the credit union is doing.  On the other hand, other credit unions are much bigger in size and scale and could have 30,000 or 40,000 members.  Consequently, the joint committee can imagine the diversity of needs in such credit unions, as some may be community-based and some may be industry-based.  In the fourth slide, we are trying to show the wide range of needs people have, which can be personal or for small business, things at which credit unions again traditionally have been very good, as well as some of the other opportunities to provide some genuine competition on home loans and to provide some proper financing for social housing.  There are many different ways to so do and, as was mentioned last night, several proposals have been submitted to the various Departments.  Again, to be allowed to move on and to provide more services, we expect that a little more risk will be taken on and, therefore, we accept that it is proportionate that those risks would be managed.  However, one cannot have a situation in which the average one-size-fits-all model takes in all of the requirements.  For example, over the past two or three years, credit unions have been obliged to develop compliance officers, to implement risk management frameworks with a specific risk officer and to introduce internal audit functions.  That may be totally overplayed in respect of the small, traditional business model, but for those that now have this in place and are building up such expertise and competence, we believe this is the appropriate platform from which to provide more services, because one has put in place the risk management structures and infrastructure.  To be blunt, to be able to pay for all of that, one must be able to generate the income to cover it.  The great thing is that in so doing, we are providing a lot more services for a lot more people.</p></speech>

In the dark days of October 2011, the Minister for Finance told the Seanad that the cost of rescuing credit unions could be between &euro;500 million and &euro;1 billion, but thankfully this was far wide of the mark.  However, Mr. Farrell probably is best placed to tell members today what is the underlying health of the credit union sector.  There have been problems in individual credit unions and some high-profile cases, but at present, in November 2015, what is the state of the credit union movement and of the credit unions represented by the Irish League of Credit Unions?  While obviously there will be consolidation, are bailouts in prospect?  I ask Mr. Farrell to give members a sense of the underlying health of the sector.</p></speech>

We always objected to those numbers, having conducted our own stress tests on the figures for the credit unions individually and for the credit union movement, and we thought those figures were way off.  Four credit unions have received assistance from Government funds over the past four years - that is, 1% of credit unions - of approximately &euro;20 million.  Through the league's own savings protection fund, which is a prudent rainy-day fund it set up 20 or 30 years ago to help credit unions that might get into financial or other difficulty over the years, the league has helped a small percentage of credit unions over those tough days since Ireland came into the global financial crisis.  That fund had &euro;120 million in it five years ago and still has &euro;100 million in it after helping a small percentage of credit unions.  If one rolls forward to September 2015, the credit union movement across the board has 15% in capital, while it needs to have 10% in capital.  As I stated earlier, credit unions have &euro;13 billion in assets and the capital requirement, if one likes, is 10% of total assets.  This is one of our ongoing issues with the regulations, in that it is not risk-weighted.  Anyway, the capital requirement at 10% is &euro;1.3 billion.</p><p>The credit unions have &euro;2.2 billion in capital, which means that we have &euro;700 million or &euro;800 million extra.  We have better capital reserves than we need.  Some credit unions are merging through the auspices of the Credit Union Restructuring Board, ReBo, while others are merging with capital assistance from the savings protection fund.  We have handled half a dozen of these so far this year and do not believe anything unforeseen will happen.  A handful of credit unions are just under the 10% minimum figure and we are working with them on a stand-alone basis or helping them to merge with a view to bringing them above the 10% level.</p><p> The good news is that there is &euro;3.5 billion in loans.  We have &euro;13 billion in assets, &euro;11 billion in savings and &euro;3.5 billion in our loan books.  We have turned a corner.  In the past two quarters there has been a slight increase in the loan books of approximately 0.5%.  After the onslaught of the recession, many people turned away from borrowing and repaired household balance sheets, as we have heard.  That the total credit union loan book has started to grow in the past two quarters is important if credit unions are to increase their incomes.</p></speech>

I will discuss with Mr. Hosford the issue of section 35 lending restrictions.  Representing the managers' body, he is well placed to tell us what impact they are having.  The commission recommended a review of the operation of section 35, but lending is credit unions' bread and butter.  Without being able to lend, they do not have a viable business model.  What impact does section 35 in its current construction have on the day-to-day operation of credit unions?</p></speech>

We like to believe we are coming out of the tail end of the recession.  Demand for loans is beginning to grow.  As the committee can imagine, any restriction on our lending in the marketplace damages our business.  We accept that our core business is personal lending of less than five years' duration.  We are good at it, but, as the committee knows from discussing the housing crisis, there is pent-up demand for longer term lending.  The section 35 limits and the proposed 25-year limit in consultation paper 88, CP88, will affect our ability to lend money to our members.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman.  </p> <p>  I thank the delegates for presenting.  I have engaged on this issue numerous times nationally, as well as locally.  I subscribe to the idea that the credit union model is the best in terms of local knowledge and the personal touch.  Since the pillar banks are moving further and further away from this model, credit unions' current model of short-term lending places them in a position where they can capitalise on their relationship management.</p> <p>  I would like to see the credit union movement heading into the mortgage sector.  It has considered how it can assist communities via social housing, something in which the banks will not become involved.  They will provide no community gain in that regard despite the fact that we own them.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael McGrath hit the nail on the head.  The movement has a problem.  It is in discussions with the Department of Finance and this issue will be debated in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.  The movement is getting political support from across the board, but is there a way to put credit unions in a regulatory format that will leave them as individuals, while affording them the autonomy required to deal with a regulatory body in the same capacity as the banks?  This is the comfort blanket the Central Bank and the Department of Finance need.  It will give credit unions the capacity they need to expand and the key ratios may loosen.</p></speech>

We should regulate credit unions according to their scale and the complexity of their business.  The original proposal which the Central Bank asserts was rejected in CP76 was related to scale, that is, over or under a figure of &euro;100 million.  In their submissions on CP76 the three organisations made it clear that they were in favour of tiered regulation but not in the manner - purely on scale - the Central Bank wanted to do it.  There are credit unions with a figure of &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million that are well capable of doing the same business in a safe manner as some of the larger credit unions, whereas there are credit unions with a figure of &euro;50 million that may not be able to do this.  Basing tiered regulation on nature, scale and complexity was the commission's recommendation.  Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Simon Harris, stated the commission's recommendations were clear Government policy.  We are asking for nothing more than what was contained in these recommendations.</p></speech>

Is there any way to simplify it for the purpose of giving regulatory bodies comfort as regards what the credit union movement is trying to do and its expansion?</p></speech>

It is an interesting one, as there is a danger one will create a contradiction.  According to an interesting survey recently conducted by Customer Experience Insights, CEXi, to review all 157 brands in Ireland across all industries, credit unions were the most trusted.  It is incredible that a financial organisation would be regarded in this way.  As the Deputy rightly stated, one of the great strengths of credit unions is their local presence.  While there has been some consolidation which has strengthened credit unions, they have managed to maintain their presence in local communities.  That is important.</p> <p>  Given the initiatives that would involve greater lending in support of the likes of social housing, the legislation and regulations need to be examined.  A credit union would run into a commercial problem with the latter straightaway.  It might have the necessary expertise, but only 10% of its loan book could extend beyond ten years.  There are also legislative constraints on the market credit unions can serve.</p></speech>

It is timely and important and I thank the representative bodies for attending.  In Mr. Farrell's opinion, what has been the greatest change in the credit union movement?  I am a strong supporter of it and a member of a credit union.  From the report, I see the type of lending has changed considerably.  The movement has transitioned from being a local, small loans organisation to a lender of larger loans.</p></speech>

Since moving from the Registrar of Friendly Societies to the Registrar of Credit Unions within the Central Bank, there has been a rewrite of the rule book on how credit unions operate.  There has also been a great deal of hardship for them, their business, paid employees and volunteers.</p><p>There has been a huge change in governance, which as Mr. Kevin Johnson said earlier we have bought into and implemented.  The additional paperwork and regulatory burden in respect of the smaller loans has made it much more difficult for credit unions to do character based lending, with which traditionally they would have been very good.  They would have been able to lend on a person's previous record of repaying his or her loan and from knowing the character of a person from the community of the credit union but now lending is based on rules, regulations and paperwork.  If the credit union does not have the right paperwork and background checks on the person, even though it knows the person is good for the loan, then it is very difficult to do business with the same people for which the credit union was established to do business.  The most significant change has been the rules and operations around lending practices, even for smaller loans.</p></speech>

My colleague, Mr. John Knox, Mr. Sean Hosford and one of Mr. Kevin Johnson's colleagues sit on a stakeholder implementation project group.  That project is being officially launched on Friday by the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister of State in the Department.</p> <p>  There was a soft roll-out last week so about a dozen loans have been made in the pilot project among the 30 credit unions.  All the stakeholders in that project are very pleased because a lot of work had to be done to get a simple loan product across the table so that people on welfare with household budgets could apply for and get a loan with less red tape and paperwork than what I outlined.  Everybody is very pleased that this is up and running and that a dozen loans have gone out in the first couple of days.  There will be more about it on Thursday.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilt&iacute;m roimh na finn&eacute;ithe.</p> <p>  There is a major problem in the banking system, which is a tight concentrated oligopoly and it means behaviour of the banks is not tempered by their need to meet the needs of citizens.  There is a problem in the structure.  Credit unions can provide a solution to that problem with the structure.</p> <p>  Sinn F&eacute;in supports the credit union movement playing a greater role in the area of financial products.  There seems to be an ideological brake with regard to the sector evolving further.  I notice the use of language in today's presentation, with words such as "jeopardy" and "threat" being used.  This is a major difficulty currently for the sector.  </p> <p>  Obviously another factor of the credit union sector is the social enterprise element.  Most people think of social enterprise as very small constructs.  This is a social enterprise with &euro;13 billion in assets.  It is one of the largest financial social enterprises I am aware of.  As is the case with my party, it is an all-Ireland body, which is always good.  </p> <p>  We live in a society with major problems with moneylenders and with finance for small businesses and housing.  It is hard to believe that the credit unions have a capital surplus and yet it is being kept away in terms of addressing outstanding issues.  Why is the Central Bank deviating from the initially agreed tiered regulatory approach?  The witness can self-select in regard to who answers that question.</p></speech>

It was endorsed as a package.  For example, all of the new requirements around governance, including the significant cost that came with it, was to be balanced by it being proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of the business of each credit union.</p> <p>  The Deputy makes a very valid point regarding the distinction between the structure of banking and credit unions.  The credit union is an integral part of the community.  It is a self-fulfilling success. That is the reason why credit unions succeed.  We need to be very careful not to dismantle that.  We have to build on the strengths that are there and not try to mimic something else that has failed in the past.  The ideology has not changed.  We are simply seeking to modernise it.  We are also seeking to be able to satisfy the needs of more people.  The Deputy asked earlier about small loans, which is still a core element of the business, but much more can be done.</p> <p>  There were very good examples of credit union involvement in social enterprise.  A credit union in Galway was mentioned last night.  I am familiar with one in Galway that funded an enterprise centre which now provides significant employment.  It has a major social and economic benefit.  This is what credit unions can do.</p> <p>  The point in regard to the Central Bank is a question for the registrar.  Our view is that the Central Bank is being over-zealous.  It is taking risk management to the extent where it is risk prevention.  We have built up skills around risk management in recent years and we believe that credit unions are in a position to do more for people.</p></speech>

It was more a regulatory procedure rather than any changes and the regulator.  The registrar's people are part of the project group.  They have been able to work with the group.</p> <p>  Housing and the small business are the two sectors that will need regulatory changes over investment rules that credit union are bound by at present.  Credit unions have very few options on where to place the surplus money they do not lend.  If they do not lend the money to their members, it is really a choice between bank deposit accounts or Government and-or bank bonds.  Some 80% to 90% of our surplus money is in bank deposit accounts lying largely idle and earning very small income.  It is against that background that we have the central vehicle in the six-step plan for small business and social housing to try to have a central pool of money so that the credit union, subject to the regulator changing the investment rules, could place the money into a central fund or trust.  There would be expertise employed by that trust to assess the loan for the SME or the loan to the housing body for the social housing.</p><p>We are trying to centralise decision making and underwriting to convince people that this is a safe and prudent alternative use of credit union funds.  </p><p> We launched our social housing proposal on international credit union day, approximately a month ago.  When the Government launched its social housing strategy at the end of 2014, it talked about the formation of a financial vehicle into which pension funds and credit unions could place money which could then be used to build social housing.  In our early engagement with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, it became clear that it was a medium-term, rather than a short-term, priority and the Department asked us to think about the issue in some other way.  Our paper contains two options.  It makes reference to the Government's financial vehicle but also leaves open the option of credit unions creating their own financial vehicle, which would have underwriters and lending people who would access the loans from the approved housing bodies, namely, the not-for-profit companies which build social housing.  This puts it further from the State's balance sheet.  We were asked to do this by the Department because its vehicle was for the medium term, whereas we have the money ready to roll.  We look forward to engaging with the Department and there is a meeting next week to get it started.  It would require a small enough regulatory change to allow the investments, and not just bank deposits, to be formed in a central pool, properly managed and regulated as a central vehicle to lend to housing bodies that are also regulated entities.</p></speech>

An accountancy firm is assisting us with these proposals and it is familiar with the workings of, and the people in, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  Some of the proposals in the paper will consider the question of the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland providing funding to banks to lend on.  It will ask whether we could be a part of the on-lending, although the credit unions would not provide funding to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland for it to give to the pillar banks to on-lend.  We would try to work with a slightly different model.  It will be our money ultimately going to SMEs in the localities of our various credit unions.  The paper will be out in a couple of weeks and we will have a meeting with those people to see if there could be a solution there.</p></speech>

As regards the funding model, we believe the UK credit unions are being funded by central government in the area of additional services, and particularly in the area of technology.  We understand the Government has to work very closely within EU rules on state funding, but it is an initiative that we could certainly discuss further.</p></speech>

As Mr. Farrell outlined, there is a mechanism to do so as an investment.  We have produced a very detailed proposal on how this can be done as a loan, which is traditional within the credit union business.  We are very happy to share that with the committee because we have been working on it for some time and it would be fantastic to get the support of the committee for it.  It requires a small enhancement - not a change - to the legislation to permit the credit unions to do it.  I would be more than happy to circulate that.</p></speech>

What would the witnesses see as the advantage in delaying the implementation of CP88?  How would the witnesses see the modernisation of credit unions, with modern technology and so on, coming about?  There would obviously be a hope of some Government involvement.  How might that work out?</p> <p>  On providing funding for social housing, would the Government be the borrower?  How would it operate in practice?  Some credit unions are very substantial bodies while others are small.  Would a programme of widespread amalgamation assist the smaller credit unions in strengthening them and their operations?  It is really important that we continue to have a very strong credit union movement and it is even more important now, for the reasons Deputy Spring mentioned, with so many commercial banks becoming more removed from the general public.</p></speech>

That was the agreement, but we have got to this stage and some of the recommendations have not been acted upon, particularly those on tiered regulation and the review of section 35.  These were major issues.  The Minister signs the order on 31 December and it is then the Central Bank's role to regulate it.  We have no issue with that, but we agreed to something and yet have only got 75% of it.  We are being asked to move on, but it is not fair to ask us to do that.  The Government made the agreement and this is its policy.</p></speech>

In my day job I am the CEO of a fairly large credit union.  Mobile technology, digital marketing and such stuff are important to us as they are the gateway to our younger members, whom we have difficulty attracting because of the business model we operate at the moment.  There are local and segmented efforts.  We are a member of a group of 11 credit unions at the moment which is trying to introduce a debit card and it has been a tortuous road.  My own credit union has been in and out to the Central Bank for four and a half years just to try to get agreement to introduce technology that is over 20 years old.</p><p>As members know, the debit card is now moving towards contactless and mobile formats.  We openly admit we are struggling to catch up.  We need to catch up but we just find that hurdles are consistently put in our way in trying to get into the market.  Unless we get into it, we will not attract younger members.</p><p> The amalgamations are happening.

With a view to having a sustainable model for credit unions, what are the current policies or changes that need to be made to provide a credit union with a balance sheet that is solvent and profitable, that can result in the paying of a dividend to members and that allows for lending to individuals and small businesses?  What is the logic for wanting to go into the property market?  There are risks associated with it.</p> <p>  I am a great believer in the credit union movement and have dealt with it professionally at every level over many years.  I just want to get into the space on a practical level and strip away all the abstract talk and distil the matter to the basics regarding what the credit unions need to have in place.  There are obviously risks and that is why only 1% of deposit holders have over &euro;100,000 on deposit.  Could the delegates strip it down to the basics?  What needs to be put in place to bring about a solvent, profitable and dividend-paying credit union movement for members?  I am really referring to the old basics.</p></speech>

Some balance needs to be brought to our loan books.  As Mr. Johnson rightly says, the loan-to-share ratio nationally is between 25% and 30%, which is quite low.  We have an amount of money to lend.  Our traditional market has been the personal loan market, involving loans with terms of under five years.  We need to  look beyond that.</p> <p>  On the housing market and risks attached thereto, we have all learned a salutary lesson.  There are risks in the personal loan market.  Lending is risky, full stop.</p></speech>

I am CEO of the Health Services Staffs Credit Union, a large industrial credit union.  We have a loan book worth over &euro;100 million.  The loan book turns every 28 or 29 months, that is how quickly the loans are repaid.  Therefore, one must be lending very quickly because the money is coming back in as quickly.  If a certain proportion of our book had loans with terms of ten, 20 or 25 years, it would give a steady stream of income and put us in a stronger position.</p></speech>

I did not really have any doubts about the case they made on the credit union legislation.  If I did, they completely persuaded me as to the merits of their case.  Given all that has happened, it is really quite extraordinary that the case they are making is not having a greater impact on the Government.  Lending is risky but, quite obviously, lending by institutions that are not for profit is less risky.  To me, that is so self-evident that it is beyond question.  The credit union movement has proven itself in that regard in the teeth of the biggest financial crisis the country has ever faced.  Whatever problems it had - it had a small number - they were just a drop in the ocean by comparison with those of the profit-oriented commercial banking sector.</p> <p>  The entire banking system should be run like the credit union movement.  For-profit banks should be put out of business.  I am completely on the side of the delegates.  Could they enlighten me as to why the Government is not listening?  There are Members of the Houses who, in this debate and in that relating to the credit union legislation, have been falling over themselves to say how much they love the credit unions.  However, they do not seem to have listened to the case the delegates made this time around and in respect of the legislation.  They said that the one-size-fits-all approach and tiering proposed by the Government are not appropriate for the credit unions and are a stumbling block to the development of new services and to the sustainability of the movement.  Therefore, why the hell is the Government or the Central Bank not listening?  Perhaps the delegates will enlighten us as to which one is not listening.  I am a bit baffled.  I am shocked to my core that the Government and Central Bank have not taken up with speed and urgency a suggestion made by the credit union representatives in 2012 when what became the Credit Union and Co-operation with Overseas Regulators Act was being debated.  They said they could contribute substantially to dealing with the social housing crisis.</p><p>All we hear from this Government is that it takes a few years to build houses so it cannot solve the problem immediately.  The big issue that the Government always cites is that it does not have the capital upfront, but two years ago the credit unions offered the capital upfront to help solve the social housing crisis.  Mr. Johnson or Mr. Farrell said that in response to the credit unions' suggestions on this, the Government said that it was only a medium-term priority.  Is that really what it is saying?  That is quite extraordinary.  We are in an emergency situation which has been looming for two years around social housing.  The credit unions offered the Government the capital on a plate.  I do not know what the Government is saying.  Could Mr. Farrell or Mr. Johnson elaborate on that?  I am baffled that the Government considered it a medium-term issue.  Could Mr. Farrell or Mr. Johnson enlighten me about what is wrong with the Government?</p></speech>

That piece of the social housing strategy was medium term.  It had other ways of getting funds, probably more directly, and the priority was to get that piece moving.  This was a second phase.  On that basis, we put the current proposal together to construct our own vehicle.  It was not that social housing was a medium-term strategy but that that element of the strategy was medium term.</p></speech>

This time we are not asking for anything other than what we all signed up for.  There was a package of recommendations from the commission.

The thing that seems to be thrown around is the management of risk, which baffles me somewhat.  Obviously, risk has to be managed, but the record would imply that, in general, the credit union movement has managed the risk pretty well.  It did not require big bailouts.  Only a few credit unions got into trouble - one in particular - and a few others had some small problems.  How is the Government or the Central Bank - whichever is making the calls on this - justifying the delay or the failure to respond the credit unions' requests?</p></speech>

I am sure they will tell us what great people we are.  It is credit union money that was put into this scheme; it is not Government money.  Credit unions have always worked in this area.  It is nothing new to us.  Eight or ten years ago, we presented to Deputies and the Central Bank on the interest rate that was being charged by licensed moneylenders.  Nothing was done about it.

As I said earlier, investments are either bank deposits or Government or bank bonds.  The banks are closing down local branches and credit unions are trying to stay open.  The introduction of the &euro;100,000 restriction means that when more mature members come in and their balances go above that, the credit unions will have to send them back out to the branch of the bank.  If it is closed, they will have to go to the next town to wherever a bank is open.  Directly and indirectly, credit union members' money is ending up in the banks.  There are people who think it is a result of policy rather than accident.</p></speech>

There was a huge debate on how we could withdraw money.  In credit unions, if members have a loan, the shares are pledged against it.  We got over that obstacle and the next one was whether it was an exempt service under section 48 of the Act.  We got a legal opinion and so too did the Central Bank.  We eventually had to agree to disagree.  It then moved onto the question of whether or not we could operate a payments account.  The European payments directive said that we could operate a payments account but the Credit Union Act does not say that specifically.  Arguments like that delayed the project, but I am happy to say that it is in its pilot phase and is ready to go.  We have been trying for four or five years, so it is old technology and is leaving us behind in the race.</p></speech>

There are many new competitors in the personal lending market and there are new delivery mechanisms.  The credit unions need and want to evolve.  That means having to do some new things and doing some of the old things in a new way.  I would not like anybody to think that we suddenly want to jump from being a credit union to being something else.  That is not the case.</p><p>It is an evolution and we are very conscious of managing the risks along the way.  I would hate anybody to think we want to go into development finance or anything bizarre like that.

There is a debate in the D&aacute;il tonight and there are parallel debates going on between the credit union sector and the Department.  I hope we can collectively aim for an end game which involves something that is workable for everybody, not least the punter out there who puts his or her money in trust with the credit unions.  I know that is what the credit unions want as well.  We must be cautious as we go from an era of light touch regulation that we do not end up with a situation where we put people into a straitjacket that would not work for them either.  I am generally conservative on the matter.  I am in favour of making haste slowly.  I would rather err on the side of caution than make the mistake of not sufficiently regulating the sector.  We are involved in a process on which I hope we will reach a successful conclusion.</p> <p>  With your indulgence, Chairman, I will do a little bit of fishing.  I do not wish to ask anyone specifically but whoever thinks it is appropriate to his or her area can respond.  Most of the people in financial services to whom I have spoken said that in a recession people saved more.  The credit unions now have to deal with a lot of money sloshing around and on which they must get a return.  People have not been borrowing as they were previously because they were mending household balances among other issues.  The credit unions now have the problem of having a lot of money on deposit.  Is there a danger that the credit unions will get the balance wrong between long-term lending, which they want to get into, for example, the housing market, and short-term lending, which has been the core business of credit unions?  I refer to the college grant, replacing the car, dealing with the hole in the roof or whatever else.  Just because the credit unions have the immediate problem of having a lot of money on deposit, they could get the balance wrong and we could make regulations which might be out of sync with what might be a more normalised economy in a few years&rsquo; time.</p> <p>  The credit union movement is a very effective lobby group.  I received many representations in my constituency but I did not get representations from all of the credit unions that operate there.  I thought that was strange so I decided to make some inquiries on the matter.  Why do some credit unions currently have their own in-house rules to the effect that they do not want deposits in excess of &euro;100,000?  Why do some credit unions consider that prudent and others do not?</p></speech>

Some credit unions decided themselves during the recession when people were saving, and essentially paying them credit, to prudently, as the Deputy correctly said, impose a savings cap.  I am not aware of how many did that.  Most of my experience is from a background in an industrial credit union.  We have loan demand and where that exists, we will continue to take in savings.  We are above the national average.  The indications in the movement are that loan demand is beginning to return.  The answer to the question is that individual credit unions have taken that choice.  What we look at, as a credit union, is consumer choice.  Effectively, if a cap is imposed, there may not be many but we would have to go to a number of members in our credit union to ask them to take their money out.  Where will they take their money?  Essentially, they will take it to the high street bank.  Is the Central Bank or the Department telling us that it is safer for people to put their money in a bank than in a credit union?</p></speech>

In our case, there will be a requirement on us, if we want to apply to keep the amount of money that we have over &euro;100,000, to move &euro;7 million in investments from higher earning deposits to lower earning deposits because of the requirement to increase our liquidity.  In actual fact, it will cost the credit union more in income to apply to hold those moneys than the money is earning for us.</p></speech>

We need to be careful.  If we link the two questions, the earlier one was about regulation, one point on which we should be very clear is that all three bodies have been very consistent in stating that they want robust, appropriate and proportionate regulation.  That is not in question here.  I think what the Deputy is saying is that the fear was that in seeking to involve the credit unions, we would be looking for lighter touch regulation.  That is not what we are saying.  What we are saying is that what was agreed by the commission should be proportionate and that it would reflect the nature, scale and complexity of each credit union.  The problem we have had is that we are presented with a one-size-fits-all solution and this is the second time around with CP88.  It is important to remember we also had CP76, which was the first attempt to present a tiered regulatory structure.  What that did was put all the credit unions on the left hand side of the diagram that I showed the committee and then there was an unknown process to get out of it but it was never explained how anybody could ever get out of it.  The concern that we had then, and we still have now, is that there is insufficient consideration for future advancement of the changes to the credit union business model.  The registrar and the Central Bank have stated on occasion that there would be engagement with stakeholders on development, which is very welcome, but that should happen before the rules are put in place not after.</p> <p>  To tie in what I have said with the savings limit, first, one must remember that savings are the only source of funds a credit union has, as we do not take capital from external sources.  The second thing is that it is a member&rsquo;s choice.  Even with all the new deposit guarantee scheme requirements coming in, no matter what institution a consumer saves with, they must be informed about exactly what is covered and what is not.  It is no different with us.  Ironically, there are even opportunities within the new deposit guarantee scheme, DGS, requirements where amounts of more than &euro;100,000 would be covered and yet a person could be penalised if he or she were with a credit union, as he or she would not get the advantage of that.  The point I am trying to get at is that nobody is suggesting that there needs to be lighter regulation-----</p></speech>

Since we are coming out of the recession, credit unions have a lot of money on deposit.  As the economy picks up, people might consider changing their car, going on holiday or extending their home.  As that level of activity picks up, the credit union business of short-term lending will pick up and that money on which credit unions are searching for an optimum return on now, which might be in longer-term lending, may no longer be a problem in two or three years time.  The credit unions are looking for an immediate, long-term solution for what might be a short-term problem.  If the money on deposit was put into long-term loans, it might not be available then for the core business.</p></speech>

I tried to make the point earlier that we are not talking about shifting from one end of the spectrum to the other end overnight.</p><p>That is not what is intended at all.  As Mr. Hosford mentioned earlier, it is about balance.  Credit unions have operated a personal lending market.  As was pointed out earlier, in a recession people save more and borrow less.  The actual market has declined by over 66%.  Credit unions have held their market share in all of that.  As a result, there are more funds available.</p><p> We are not suggesting that there has to be a free-for-all of providing loans.  We are saying that the expertise resides within credit unions to enable them to meet a lot more of the existing needs.  The types of things we have been talking about this afternoon, such as social housing, have a definite requirement for funds - for example, the housing boards.  They are crying out for funds and we are saying they are here available.  That is a relatively low-risk model and fits nicely in with the credit union.</p><p> If the credit unions are able to do some longer-term lending, they can start providing longer-term savings for members and the internal balance management will start to take place.  There is a lot of expertise within the credit unions.  This is already manifested among those which impose their own limits to manage their balance sheets appropriately and ensure they are viable.</p></speech>

I was at another committee, but I am familiar with what they require and very supportive of it.  It seem to be a relatively straightforward requirement.  The demands of credit union members are changing and the credit unions are responding.  The difference between them and a bank is that their principal requirement is to serve their customers.  At the end of the day the bank is ultimately about serving the shareholders, which is a completely different subset of individuals within the overall mix.  I fail to understand why the Government would not respond in a more favourable way and recognise where the credit union is coming from as a not-for-profit organisation.</p> <p>  There are a couple of things that follow from this.  Diversification can only reduce risk.  The more a product offering or investment strategy is diversified, the safer the overall standpoint has to be.  If the demand for the credit union's product mix is changing, its investment strategy would have to change in line with that.  However the customer might view the product, the people who have to provide the funding behind it need an investment strategy, exactly as Mr. Johnson has said.  I disagree with my colleague who has left in respect of the size of the investment and the nature of the money.  The credit unions are not looking at this purely from the point of view of having a lot of cash washing around.  That does not reflect where they are at.  We must recognise that the credit unions have a changed environment, with changed demands from the customers.  There are opportunities there and the credit unions can provide competitive products, and rightly so.  If they sit on their hands and continue to provide the same products they will become insolvent over time and irrelevant.</p> <p>  Taking all that into consideration, it is a compelling case that will have to be addressed over time.  There is a unique opportunity now that we have come through the banking apocalypse, as it were.  The credit unions are starting from a completely different point.  There is definitely a need for competition within the lending sector.  We all know about that from the number of representations we get from constituents on an ongoing basis.  We regularly refer people to the credit union.  Some lost touch with the credit union during better times when money was being doled out like confetti.  They are now re-engaging.</p> <p>  From my experience in assisting constituents, they are getting a very fair hearing, whatever their credit rating might be.  The credit union's community structure is far more intuitive in terms of understanding risk, in contrast to the way in which the pillar banks have gone.  A lot of the assessment is at a remove and online, and there is an awful lot less personal interaction.  The credit unions maintain that, which gives them a better capacity to profile the risk of the individuals within their membership base.</p></speech>

We are down in the bowels of this place and even though we might think we are on TV, nobody is watching.  It is the nature of these committee hearings.  In the D&aacute;il Chamber the tone is more "Credit unions, good; Government, bad," and there is nothing in between.</p> <p>  There are issues here.  A report was written by the commission with 75% of the recommendations.  Everybody was represented on that commission.  What has gone wrong?  Things are better.  The credit unions' financial position is better and there is less concern.  What is the story?  Is it a very conservative regulator who is opposed to taking on too much of a workload in dealing with tiered regulation through the credit union system?  Is there a fear that if something goes wrong or is missed there will be a blot in the copybook?  Is the conservative approach being chosen of imposing restrictive regulations and treating them all as bad boys?  We have passed a lot of the legislation here in conjunction with the credit unions and with the recommendations of the commission.  We have all been playing ball together, so what has suddenly gone wrong that we find ourselves at odds?</p></speech>

The CP88 document has been published for almost a year.  It was published before Christmas.  Even before that, there was a particularly difficult relationship between the movement and the Central Bank of Ireland.  I suppose this has built to something of a climax now.  The CP88 document has been out for a year.  There was a three-month window during which over 100 submissions were made by the end of March.</p> <p>  At the end of July the final CP88 version came out.  It took on board practically nothing from the 100 submissions.  It has not proved to be in any way a two-way dialogue.  In the coming five years we see credit unions being micro-managed by the same rules that have been in place for the past 20 years.  Indeed, the rules seem to stretch backward in the area of savings and so on.  It is keeping or even pushing credit unions backwards rather than allowing them to develop.  This is not sudden.  There has been a hardening of the relationship for quite some time.  We do not seem to have a regulatory process that has the understanding of the details of credit unions.</p></speech>

A major flaw in the CP88 paper was that the regulatory impact analysis attached to the document was based on the credit union as it is today.  However, our regulatory authority has told us in numerous speeches that our business model needs to change.  Really, we are calling for a regulatory impact analysis to see how CP88 would impact on credit unions in future, in other words, on how credit unions would look in five years time if the regulations from CP88 were imposed.  There is a need to change our business model.  We know that.  The regulatory impact analysis did not take that into account.  It did not take into account that we need to consider other means of savings and lending products.  That was a serious flaw.  Perhaps it is one of the justifications in suggesting that CP88 is appropriate, because it relies on the regulatory impact analysis.</p></speech>

You are saying the regulator is not taking into account the future of the credit unions and that the regulator does not understand the business model of the future for credit unions.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It copper-fastens those for the coming years.  Then, it added more on top.  A major concern we have relates to lending.  We had a good discussion around section 35.  However section 35 was supposed to be overhauled as part of this process, but it was not.  It has now been copper-fastened.  On top of that, we get categories of lending with additional limits on those categories.  It is always the lower of the two.</p></speech>

Again, in the interests of fairness, some of the engagements directly with credit unions in recent years have strengthened the credit unions and improved the overall governance.  That is why we have bought into a package.  However, when we get to the one area that allows us to move on, that is the concern we have and that is the part we do not understand.  Why is that the case when we now have stronger, more competent and more capable credit unions?</p></speech>

Obviously, you are embedded in this considering your role.  Are you saying that the relationship between the credit unions and the regulator needs to be improved dramatically?</p></speech>

It has been 11 or 12 years since the credit unions began to be regulated by the Central Bank.  As the crisis proved, the credit unions did not mis-lend or over-lend.  That is clear because only a small number were in trouble during the crisis.  They proved that they managed their balance sheets fairly prudently.  Yet they have been subjected to a rather difficult and uphill regulatory environment and a particularly negative one.</p> <p>  Credit unions are in contact with us on a regular basis.  We try to help them through the processes, debates, dialogues and meetings with the Central Bank.  It has been a difficult relationship.  Credit unions find that they are over-regulated.  They were never subjected to light-touch regulation.  Thankfully, I suppose, we came out of the other side of the crisis intact because of prudent management and appropriate levels of regulation.  However, certainly in the past five or six years it seems to have become far heavier than it was.  This was probably unnecessary, because we were managing our balance sheets and moneys in a prudent fashion.  We bought in to it.  We undertook risk, compliance, internal audit, strategic planning and fitness and probity work.  All voluntary people now must subject themselves to testing in the Central Bank.  Even the voluntary chairman of a credit union has to be interviewed by the Central Bank to take on the voluntary job as chairman of a credit union.  That is a considerable journey that credit union people have taken.  They have bought into it and they have taken it, but they cannot see the reward of developing a business model as the gain for the pain, as it were.</p></speech>

They can establish a fund.  In the first stage a credit union can put in 2.5% of reserves.  Following that 0.5% of the annual surplus can be put into that fund, with the permission of members at an annual general meeting.  However, that is for a different purpose.  Many credit unions use that.  However, what we are talking about is on a larger scale.  It would need to be done.</p></speech>

Motion No. 5 concerns the appointment of honorary consulates in Australia.  Senator Daly has submitted two motions.  Before calling on Senator Daly to move the motions, I should say to him this may be a question the Senator could ask the Minister today, rather than tabling a motion on it.  The Minister will answer the matter for the Senator and perhaps could give an instant answer on the whole thing, which I cannot do.  Perhaps a better way to present the Senator's question might be to ask the Minister directly whether he intends to appoint honorary consulates in Australia for the two regions.  Does the Senator wish to comment in this regard?</p></speech>

However, in Australia, in a place like Melbourne that has a huge Irish population, both those newly arrived and those who have been there for generations, in some instances, the ambassadors have not visited Melbourne for one or two years and an honorary consul would do that.  I will ask the Minister about that.  </p> <p>  The second one concerns a problem I am sure many members have encountered.  There are dedicated sections to deal with Oireachtas Members in agriculture, health and elsewhere and I must state-----</p></speech>

Members are provided with direct numbers for divisions in other Departments and a similar system should be in place for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  This again might be a matter about which the Senator could ask the Minister directly today.  However, the Senator may also wish to speak on it now.</p></speech>

That is the best way I could put it.  In situations where this arises and Oireachtas Members need it, a list of numbers should be provided, be it to members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade or to all Members of the Oireachtas, but such a facility is in place in other Departments.  However, when I ring the Irish abroad unit and ask for a contact number in Spain, I am given the switchboard and this simply is not good enough.</p></speech>

If an emergency crops up, he or she can be called and that duty officer has a link person at each embassy around the world who is on duty 24-7.  I have done it that way and have found it to be robust and quick.  I got through and the people concerned got back to me very quickly.  From my inquiries, I understand this system has worked fairly well but again, this is a matter the Senator can put to the Department.  Perhaps other members may wish to comment on this issue.  Have they perhaps used the service?</p></speech>

I have not had any issues, either in opposition or in government.  I have had reason, in both circumstances, to make contact with the relevant authorities and always have been given a rapid response.  Moreover, all efforts that could be made to respond were made and this has applied over the past ten, 15 or 20 years and more, covering all shades of Government.</p></speech>

The duty officer in Dublin can then contact this person and ask him or her to revert to one immediately.  Has the Senator encountered problems or something?</p></speech>

We now will continue with the next part of the meeting, which is the main reason members are in attendance today.  I welcome warmly the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and his team before the joint committee.  The joint committee had an opportunity last week to commend the work done at Stormont by the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and to acknowledge the success of the Fresh Start agreement in Northern Ireland.  Members thank the Minister sincerely for ten hard weeks of negotiations in Belfast into which he put much time and effort.  I congratulate him for this as well.</p> <p>  Today's meeting is timely, as an number of issues to be discussed today were considered at the recent Foreign Affairs Council meeting and I am sure they also will form part of the central proceedings of future meetings.  I am sure members have many questions to ask in respect of the current situation globally.  I refer to the Paris attacks on 13 November, the downing of a Russian aircraft yesterday, the situation with the migrants and the world trade talks coming up in Africa and there is a lot on the agenda in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade at present.</p> <p>  I will get down to business.  The same format as previously will apply for today's meeting.  The Minister will make an opening statement after which we will go into a question-and-answer session with members of the joint committee.  I thank all members who have turned up for today's meeting and note they have done so in large numbers.  Before I start, I remind members, witnesses and those in the public Gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off completely during the meeting as they cause interference with the recording equipment here in the committee rooms even when in silent mode.  Today's meeting is being broadcast live on Oireachtas TV across the various media platforms.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br/><br/>I welcome the Minister and thank him for appearing before the committee.</p></speech>

I received the sad news this morning that two young Irishmen had lost their lives in an accident in Perth, Australia.  As the committee is aware, this year many Irish families have lost loved ones overseas.  I am aware of the work and commitment of the committee to Irish citizens abroad and I am sure the Chairman and members will join us in expressing our condolences and sympathy to the families of the deceased.  I assure the committee that, as in all such tragic cases, our embassy and consular network will provide any and all assistance that may be required at this difficult time.</p> <p>  My statement will focus on the Foreign Affairs Council meetings held in July, October and November.  In addition, I will look ahead to the Council meeting in December.</p> <p>  During the period under review many issues have been addressed by the Council on which I will provide an update for the committee.  I will then be more than happy to answer questions and hear suggestions members may have.  It is important to look forward and I always welcome the positive and constructive engagement of the committee.  I acknowledge the non-partisan nature of its deliberations and engagement. </p> <p>  I attended the most recent meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, 16 November, which took place in the shadow of the horrific attacks in Paris.  The meeting was an important coming together of EU Foreign Ministers at a critical time to demonstrate our support and solidarity with our French colleagues and our unity as a union of member states in the face on this assault on citizens and our value system.  I conveyed the condolences and fellowship of the Irish people to the French Minister for Europe, Harlem D&eacute;sir, who was present at the meeting.  </p> <p>  The Foreign Affairs Council had a discussion on migration and there was a clear view that the issue of could not and should not be conflated with the appalling acts of terrorism in Paris.  Migration has been a key topic at many recent meetings of the Council.  The scale of the migration challenge facing the European Union is enormous.  The conflict in Syria, the biggest driver behind this year&rsquo;s migrant flows, has led to the world&rsquo;s largest humanitarian crisis, but the problem is bigger than Syria.  An estimated 60 million displaced people worldwide are on the move, the highest number since the Second World War.  They are coming not just from Syria but also from such places as Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza and a dozen or so countries in sub-Saharan and north Africa. </p> <p>  In recent weeks the European Union has intensified its response to the crisis.  During the Foreign Affairs Council meeting last week my colleagues and I discussed the importance of implementing the decisions already taken in this area.  In particular, we welcomed the action plan agreed to at the Valletta Summit of 11 and 12 November.  The action plan lays out medium and long-term policies to address the root causes of migration.  The key deliverable of the summit which brought together EU and African leaders was the establishment of the trust fund to address the root causes of migration in Africa, with &euro;1.8 billion from the European Development Fund and additional bilateral contributions, to which Ireland is contributing &euro;3 million. </p> <p>  In addition, there was a Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on Monday, 9 November, while the Valletta Summit was followed by an informal European Council meeting called by President Tusk to assess the progress made by the European Union in fulfilling its earlier commitments.  The October European Council agreed that tackling the migration crisis was a common obligation which required a comprehensive strategy and a determined effort over time &ldquo;in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility&rdquo;.  The Council welcomed the EU-Turkey action plan, a key element of which is addressing migration to the European Union via Turkey.  The Council also agreed to new measures aimed at strengthening the European Union&rsquo;s external borders.  Third countries are key players in reducing the volume of migration flows and Turkey, in particular, since the majority of migrants transit through it on their journey to Europe.  Turkey and the European Union are working to finalise a joint action plan.  At the informal summit called by President Tusk on Thursday, 12 November, EU leaders agreed to hold a special summit with Turkey at the end of November.  This summit will take place this Sunday, 29 November. </p> <p>  The migrant crisis resulting from the continuing conflict in Syria has brought a foreign policy issue to European doorsteps in a way that is rarely seen.  It has brought home to us how conflicts in the European Union's neighbourhoods can impact on the union, down to the level of towns and citizens.  The newly formed International Syria Support Group brings together all of the key external stakeholders in the conflict.  The high representative is one of those attending.  The coming together in that context of countries that otherwise have little or no direct engagement shows a seriousness of purpose which is essential in dealing with the massive challenge faced.  They have set themselves ambitious goals to be achieved in a tight timetable.  The key elements include formal negotiations with the aim being that they should start by 1 January; establishment of a credible, inclusive and non-sectarian government; a constitutional reform process and free and fair elections under UN supervision within 18 months.  This is in line with the conclusions adopted at the October Council which underlined &ldquo;the need to accelerate the work of the entire international community on the political track in the framework of the UN-led process&rdquo;.</p> <p>  The Middle East peace process appeared on the Council&rsquo;s agenda in July and November and is expected to be discussed again at next month&rsquo;s meeting.  Conclusions were adopted in July.  That period has also coincided with a significant upsurge in violence, primarily in Jerusalem and Hebron but also spreading to other areas.  In common with others, I deplore any resort to violent attacks on civilians.  I have condemned any use of violence, encouraged calm and de-escalation and urged positive leadership on the issues that may be contributing to individuals adopting such a dreadful path.  While I appreciate the frustration of those who see no political end in sight, it does not justify resorting to violence.  However, any security response to the violence must be proportionate. </p> <p>  Just ahead of the November meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council, the Commission published an &ldquo;Interpretative Notice on indication of origin of goods from the territories occupied by Israel since June 1967&rdquo;, also called, in shorthand, the guidelines on the labelling of goods from the settlements.  I was one of those who had called for this notice to be published and I welcome it.  However, I want to be clear that it does not represent sanctions on Israel.  It involves no new law; instead, it is a tool to ensure consumers can make informed decisions.  </p> <p>  The agreement reached on Iran at the beginning of July was very significant and welcomed by Foreign Ministers at the Council meeting in July.  Significant potential hurdles in implementing the agreement in both Iran and the USA have been surmounted.  To date, reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, and others indicate that the steps required to implement the agreement are being carried out as intended.  It remains the assessment, therefore, that the agreement is on schedule to be fully in operation early in the new year, at which stage most of the nuclear-related international sanctions on Iran will be removed.</p> <p>  Libya is currently in political limbo as it continues to transition towards democracy and stability.  The matter was discussed at the July Foreign Affairs Council when it seemed that the disparate factions were beginning to approach agreement, although the General National Congress in control of Tripoli remained largely outside the process.</p><p>Following the announcement by the UN special representative, Mr. Bernardino L&eacute;on, of nominees for the government of national accord the week before, Libya was added to the October Foreign Affairs Council agenda.  Council conclusions were adopted supporting the progress made by Mr. L&eacute;on and encouraging the various parties to endorse the peace agreement.  The European Union stated it would work in close partnership with the government of national accord, once formed, and that it was prepared to offer immediate and substantial support.  Sadly, little progress has been made since.  The agreement remains unsigned as the factions continue to debate, in particular, the composition of the presidential council.  Libya is again on the agenda for the December Council meeting.  Mr. L&eacute;on was replaced on 17 November by Mr. Martin Kobler, whom I wish every success in this new role.  I emphasise my support of the position stated repeatedly by the European Union, namely, that there is no military solution to the Libyan crisis.  Only a political settlement can achieve peace and stability for Libya and its people. </p><p> At the July Council meeting I spoke directly to the Prime Minister, Mr. Essib, and the Foreign Minister, Mr. Baccouche, to underline Ireland&rsquo;s support for Tunisia&rsquo;s transition to democracy and the need to counter the terrorist threat to Tunisian political and economic reform.  I also made clear our absolute abhorrence of the murder of three of our citizens in Tunisia would strengthen our solidarity with the people of Tunisia, who have also suffered greatly from the impact of terrorism.  The European Union has already made clear its commitment to support Tunisia in its development towards a prosperous, secure and democratic state.  The core issue is how the European Union can strengthen Tunisia in tackling the threat of extremism, strengthening democracy and the rule of law, supporting stability and prosperity for the Tunisian people.  This will be an ongoing, if challenging and difficult, effort.  Our task is to work through the European Union with the Tunisian authorities, the legitimacy of which must also be strengthened.  It is for us to engage with them and work collaboratively to address our shared needs and interests.  That was the clear consensus among European Foreign Ministers and, equally importantly, with the Tunisian authorities.  This consensus to work together is underlined all the more by yesterday's brutal and horrific attack with consequent loss of life.  It confirms our need to ensure active and positive engagement.</p><p> I welcome the adoption of the second EU action plan on human rights and democracy for the period 2015 to 2019 at the Council on 20 July, following on from the first plan adopted in June 2012.  The plan will help to increase the effectiveness of the European Union in promoting and protecting human rights worldwide at a time of increasing violations and abuses.  It covers a wide range of issues; however, the increasingly vicious attacks on religious minorities, particularly in the Middle East, are a cause for serious concern.  Members of minority religious communities, including those of Christian, Muslim and Baha&rsquo;i faith, have been subjected to appalling levels of violence, discrimination and harassment.  Ireland has been vocal in this regard and pressed for the inclusion of a specific action on the freedom of religion or belief, which is reflected in the action plan.  I am also particularly concerned about the increasing attacks on civil society in several countries and the parallel harassment of human rights defenders.  Ireland worked within the European Union to ensure these concerns were included in the action plan. </p><p> The European Union has commenced consideration of a possible successor framework to the Cotonou partnership agreement which covers the Union&rsquo;s relationship with the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, group of countries.  Given the focus of its aid programme, Ireland attaches great importance to its relationship with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.  Eight of the nine of our programme countries are in sub-Saharan Africa where poverty remains most persistent.  The European Development Fund which allocates more than 90% of its funding to programmes in Africa complements our aid focus.  The upcoming expiration of the agreement in 2020 will provide an excellent opportunity to take a close look at the ACP-EU partnership and assess whether the Cotonou framework is still the most appropriate model for the European Union's engagement with the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of countries.  I understand this issue was addressed recently by the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, at a meeting of the committee.  In this context, we must be open to all ideas, taking into account the recently agreed 2030 agenda which, given its universal nature, provides a new approach for a strategic and equal partnership with the ACP countries.  The Council meeting in October stressed the need to keep an open mind at this stage of the process.  A staff working document is expected by next spring and will serve as a basis for further discussions in the Council and with ACP partners.  Ireland looks forward to constructive negotiations which will benefit all partners in the strengthening and evolution of our relationship post the Cotonou agreement in order that we can find the most appropriate and effective way to deal with the common challenges and opportunities ahead.</p><p> I now turn to the upcoming December Council meeting.  The agenda for the meeting has not yet been settled; however, the high representative has indicated that the Middle East peace process, Libya, Iraq and the Eastern Partnership may feature.</p><p> The Eastern Partnership was due to be discussed at the November Foreign Affairs Council meeting when the high representative was expected to report on her recent trips to Ukraine and Georgia and discuss the situation in Moldova.  Ministers were also expected to discuss broader developments in the Eastern Partnership region, particularly in the light of commitments made at the Riga Summit.  Owing to a full agenda, however, particularly following the terrorist attacks in Paris on 13 November, this discussion was postponed until December. </p><p> The security situation in the east of Ukraine has greatly improved in recent weeks, with a significant reduction in violence since a new ceasefire was agreed on 1 September.  The position, however, remains fragile and I am concerned about reports of an increase in the number of incidents along the contact line in the past two weeks.  I commend the OSCE special monitoring mission for its impartial reporting on the ceasefire and pull-back of weapons, as well as the role it plays in facilitating the restoration of vital infrastructure, prisoner exchanges and demining operations.  The respite in violence has provided a platform for progress to be made on the political track.  While this progress is welcome, we cannot lose sight of the fact that key elements of the Minsk agreements remain to be addressed.  They include the withdrawal of all foreign troops and equipment from eastern Ukraine and the restoration of Ukrainian control of its border with Russia.  For this reason, it is vital the positive momentum we have seen in recent weeks is maintained and that work to implement the remaining parts of the Minsk agreements is treated as a priority by all involved.  The discussion will provide Ministers with an opportunity to assess the implementation of Ukraine&rsquo;s national reform programme.  I visited Kyiv in July and at meetings with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, Mr. Klimkin, and others in government and the parliament I was greatly impressed by the resolve on the part of Ukraine to address the many challenges the country faced and its determination to offer a better future for its people.  I underlined the importance of continuing on the reform path and assured those whom I met of the European Union's commitment and Ireland&rsquo;s continued support for the transformation process in Ukraine.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their time and patience in allowing me to give them a review.  They will agree that the Foreign Affairs Council has faced a varied and diverse agenda in recent months.  I am happy to deal with questions or observations they might have.  On international challenges and relations, the agenda is always full.  I would like to see the Chairman and the committee continue the great level of engagement and commitment they have shown in recent times.  Notwithstanding the events of next spring, I hope the committee will continue its active travel and engagement on the international stage.</p></speech>

An issue discussed before the Minister came into the committee room was the EU measures taken recently on the labelling of goods from the territories occupied by Israel.  Will he comment on the implementation of this agreement in Ireland?  I also ask him for a brief comment on yesterday's attack on the Russian aircraft which was downed by Turkish F-16 fighters and its implications.</p></speech>

On 11 November the European Commission adopted the formal notice.  It underlines that settlement goods may not be labelled as having been made in Israel or simply as having come from the West Bank without making it clear they originate from a settlement.</p><p>This applies where origin is indicated.  It does not introduce a blanket requirement for origin indication on all goods.  No new law is involved; it is a clarification of existing requirements.  Already, the measure has been criticised by some in Ireland who say it goes too far, while others say it does not, by any manner or means, go far enough.  However, the guidelines are in line with other measures which differentiate the EU's relationship with Israel from the relationship with the settlements.  These include the fact that EU research funding may not be spent in settlements, while universities in Israel are in a position to access it and the EU advice warning citizens against any form of continued investment in the settlement areas.</p><p> With regard to implementation, as a first step the Secretary General of my Department has already written to the Secretaries General of other Departments drawing their attention to the notice and the import of the guidelines and assuming that all will embark upon the process of implementation, which is ongoing.</p><p> On the downing or otherwise of the Russian aeroplane, this is a matter of great concern.  The incident is a bilateral matter between Russia and Turkey.  It would not be appropriate for me to make any comment.  The detail on it is not yet to hand.  I assure the committee that it is the belief of the Irish Government, in common with many of our EU colleagues, that this is a time in which great restraint should be exercised by all involved.</p></speech>

He explained that he asked the Secretary General of his Department to contact the other Secretaries General but could we get a note on how that will be implemented practically?  Will we receive a list of goods from his Department or the appropriate Department which will outline the goods that should be labelled?  That would inform the suppliers, wholesalers and retailers that it is a requirement under EU law that they be labelled.</p></speech>

Palestine is producing excellent herbs and citrus produce.  Are these goods listed as Palestinian in order that we can choose?  Rather than arguing against purchasing Israeli goods, let us argue in favour of recognising the Palestinian produce on the market.  Is there a formula in that regard?</p></speech>

I stress that the process is in the course of implementation and that it is ongoing.  There will be further implementation measures, the particulars of which I will be happy to share with the committee.</p> <p>  On Deputy Eric Byrne's question, these issues would be covered by our consumer protection legislation.  If people wish to make complaints or observations, it is open for them to do so.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would be happy to engage in this regard.  Ultimately, however, this is an issue for the consumer.  This is not any form of banning or outlawing.  It is an agreement that the labelling of origin should be made clear on the products.  It is important that this be the case.  Of course, goods from the Palestinian territories can also be labelled as made in Palestine if the producers so wish.  However, it is a choice that will be ultimately determined by the consumer.</p></speech>

When chickens were being imported here from Brazil or elsewhere, it was a matter for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to ensure they were properly labelled.  If goods are coming here from abroad, it is the responsibility of some Department to ensure they are properly labelled and if they are not so labelled, to ensure that is identified at an early stage.  If after that they still end up on the shop floor or in these pop-up shops in supermarkets, there must be somewhere to which the consumer can complain.  It is not a matter for the consumer rights authority but for the Department because it is a foreign affairs or international trade issue.  There must be some mechanism-----</p></speech>

That involves the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  In the same way as with the food product from Brazil to which he referred, the implementation will be the same in terms of the labelling.  A food product will be a matter that will go to the appropriate Department, which in that case is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p></speech>

As there are so many topics to be discussed with the Minister, I will confine members to questions.  There will be much better interaction if there are questions rather than statements.  Deputy Smith was late to the meeting so I will give him time to digest the Minister's statement.  I call Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan to ask her questions.  I will be quite strict and insist that members ask questions.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned the EU and the ACP.  There have been serious issues in Colombia involving the murder of three human rights activists, the death of a peasant farmer and displacement of the farming community.  We have signed this agreement with Colombia and part of the reason for doing so was that it would strengthen the position regarding human rights issues.  However, these events have happened and we do see human rights issues being taken up.  We heard about the supposedly robust mechanisms throughout the free trade agreement, FTA, but be do not see them.  There is also the issue regarding Senator Iv&aacute;n Cepeda, whom we met.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on those issues.  I brought this to the attention of the Latin American desk so I am also raising it again today.</p> <p>  That leads to migration, which the Minister mentioned.  Last week, we discussed the economic partnership agreements, EPAs.  Undoubtedly, there are concerns about the EPA with west Africa.  That could also lead to more migration because we are denying certain areas in west Africa of the ability to feed themselves.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p> <p>  I have two further questions and I will be brief.  On the Middle East peace process, it was brought to my attention that there was an Israeli raid on Aida camp in Bethlehem, at the Lajee Centre, a community and youth centre which I have visited twice.  There is a group there, Alrowwad, a theatre and cultural group, whose members visited us in the D&aacute;il about a year ago to talk to us about their culture and to give us a demonstration of their dabke dancing.  How can the Israeli army firing tear gas in a youth and community centre contribute to a peace process?  I ask the Minister to comment on that.</p> <p>  The D&aacute;il has been discussing the Stormont House Agreement today.  There is no doubt that there are unresolved issues.  We visited Maghaberry Prison last week.  There is no movement on resolving the prisoner issues.  Regarding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, there is a need for the British Government to define national security.  We know there was collusion and it will be embarrassing for that government, but surely that is not a matter of national security.  When will we demand full and open disclosure, instead of just saying the words?  The families are tired of the same answer.  The Minister says what he is doing but it is not leading to action on the part of the British Government.</p></speech>

That will feed in, perhaps, to a greater level of engagement on our part in the process in Colombia.  I am concerned with regard to the killing of three human rights defenders last week.  Representatives from our embassy in Mexico continue to discuss human rights with the Government of Colombia at every opportunity in meetings at official level.  Human rights are of great importance.  The direct engagement of the former Minister, Deputy Gilmore, will ensure that this country can reflect a greater level of engagement than was the case in the past.</p> <p>  On the Middle East peace process, I repeat the call for the violence to cease.  I accept the fact that progress has been slow but I believe there is a need on the part of civil society to disengage from acts that are violent in nature.  I hope the European Union will play a stronger and more co-ordinated role.  I expect that the matter will be on the agenda in December.</p> <p>  On Northern Ireland, the Deputy is correct: the fact that we did not reach full agreement on the historic legacy issue of the past is a matter of concern.  I met some victims' groups as recently as last night and I intend to meet more perhaps even tomorrow as well.  I am happy to share with Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan information regarding my engagement on this matter at any time.  However, it is not entirely within the authority of the Government to ensure a solution.  Now that we are in a period of reflection, I call on all the parties to reflect on the level of agreement we reached in respect of the range of institutions and the need to ensure an appropriate process to allow people to seek the facts and seek the truth.  We can do so if the will is there.</p> <p>  On the matter of the EU-ACP economic partnership, negotiations on three further economic partnership agreements, EPAs, concluded last year and it is important that there would be ongoing, active engagement in that regard.  I understand that this was an issue that was discussed with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, last week, who, in turn, discussed the matter with me during the week.  I am happy to ensure that we have ongoing engagement in that regard.  Deputy Maureen O&rsquo;Sullivan requested a debate on the issue.  We will facilitate a debate on the matter of the EU trade agreements but, ultimately, this is a matter for the Chief Whip.  I would be happy to talk to the Chief Whip in conjunction with the Deputy.  I expect her group will be in a position to prioritise such a debate in terms of the agenda.</p></speech>

I congratulate the Minister on the role he played in the peace reconciliation negotiations in Northern Ireland.  I also compliment all the participating parties on the work they did.  We should note the importance of that particular agreement at a crucial time.  There was very little public acclaim for it but it is equally as important as any other agreement that was reached.  It is second only to the Good Friday Agreement or the St. Andrew&rsquo;s Agreement.  My congratulations also extend to all the officials involved.</p> <p>  Arising from the issues in Paris and Brussels in recent weeks, I wish to ask the Minister whether there is a consciousness within the European Union as to the seriousness of the situation that is now confronting the globe - not only the European Union but the globe - and the threat to peace.  To what extent is the European Union going to address those issues and the inevitable and inexorable direction in which they are now headed?  Is there a consciousness within the European Union as to the potential for a major international conflict and conflagration the like of which we have not seen in the past 100 years?  I am serious about this hugely important issue, on which all of the bodies involved must focus and which is slowly but surely moving in a particular direction that will give rise to disastrous consequences.</p> <p>  I wish to ask also about the vacuum created by the ongoing situation in the Middle East, where nobody wants to accept responsibility, nobody wants to move forward, nobody wants to concede anything and everyone wants to live in the past, focus on the historical grievances and continue to blame each other.  This is having inevitable consequences.  To what extent is the European Union conscious of the impact that particular vacuum is having and of what is likely to occur?  Is the European Union conscious of the need to get the UN involved in situations such as that which obtains in Libya?  The latter would be ideal in the context of UN involvement.  The international community needs to become involved in Libya.  It is now a war zone in respect of which no progress is being made as a result of intervention by various well-meaning people who were wrong and who have now walked away.  Nobody accepts responsibility and everybody has gone off on a tangent.  Those to whom I refer think it is good to move their attention elsewhere.  What I say is not directed at the Minister, rather it is directed at the international community.  I wonder whether the latter is aware of where the entire Europe-Middle East situation is heading.  This is not going to be a simple thing that will blow away overnight.  I wish to know whether action is being taken.</p> <p>  What is the European Union expected to do in Ethiopia and is it going to invoke the UN again with regard to the serious starvation crisis that is likely to emerge there not in the next two or three years but in the next six months?  What provisions are likely to be put in place?  Again, this is not a criticism of anybody, this is a plea for the recognition of something that is going to unfold with disastrous consequences.</p> <p>  My final comment relates to what has happened in Iraq, ISIS and all that is associated with it.  Whether we wish to believe it or not, the situation there is a result of populism and a withdrawal by the international coalition from a war zone, leaving the place open to those who had a particular agenda.  That is going to continue for as long as the international community fails to accept its ongoing responsibilities.  Could the Minister give us some indication of what is going on?  Again, the question is not directed at him personally.  It is directed at the international community and those who have direct responsibility, namely the EU and the UN in particular.  Could the Minister give some indication to us as to whether there is likely to be any action to confront the direction in which some areas are now heading?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.337" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015112500002#G01300"><p>I am sorry for the long outburst.  The Minister can give me written replies at any time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015112500002#G01400"><p>Obviously, there can and must be a number of responses in respect of the horrific atrocity in Paris and the threats in other European capitals and beyond.  It is important that the European Union appears as a powerful force.  It will do so, assuming that agreement can be reached on a co-ordinated approach.  As well as the Foreign Affairs Council being actively engaged, there is an ongoing role and function for EU justice Ministers and these meetings are taking place on a weekly basis.</p><p>Of course, in short, defeating Daesh cannot be separated from ending the conflict in Syria.  It is the latter conflict and above all the actions and policies of the Assad regime which have given rise to these terrorist threats and acts.  Therefore, I welcome the efforts on the part of the EU to press for a negotiated settlement and I call on all parties to support the UN efforts.  In the meantime, we must counter the terrorist threat.  An element of good progress has been made on a range of fronts to ensure an active and comprehensive counter-terrorism policy while working towards building that capacity by ensuring a funding commitment.  There is much that EU states can do by way of sharing information, looking at the availability or otherwise of firearms, and also considering our external borders.</p><p> As regards the Middle East, I share Deputy Durkan's sense of frustration and his perception that there is something of a vacuum.  That is why this issue has moved up the agenda of the Foreign Affairs Council.  The EU needs to be more active in respect of practical issues on the ground, especially Israeli policies on settlements and any acts that might be seen to undermine any possibility of successful political progress.  The Irish Government continues to believe that the only option in terms of a resolution is the two-state solution.  I look forward to participating on this issue in December at the Council.</p><p> I acknowledge that the current political situation in Libya remains unresolved.  At this stage, there is no framework involving the two rival governments to raise confidence that matters might be brought towards a conclusion.  However, the EU will continue to support a settlement in Libya which will involve not only political dialogue leading towards a unity government, but also an EU package that will involve an injection of finance, which is ready to be implemented assuming that agreement can be reached from a political perspective.</p><p> We continue to engage actively with the UN, ensuring that that body continues to play a most important role in areas of conflict.  As regards the situation in Iraq, Ireland has repeatedly made clear its support for the new government of Mr. al-Abadi and the political process of reform as set out by him.  The security operation to which the Deputy refers must go hand in hand with political engagement between national authorities and the Sunni population in Iraq.  Ireland strongly supports the territorial unity of Iraq and its sovereignty. </p><p> Ireland has had a long-standing engagement with Ethiopia.  The government of Ethiopia faces great challenges from severe ongoing crises, including drought and other disasters.  We operate an ongoing programme of support and will continue to respond in any way we can to requests for humanitarian support from the Ethiopian authorities.</p></speech>

As we know, terrorism knows no borders and it would appear that we need borderless intelligence.  Did the issue of greater intelligence sharing among EU member states arise at the 16 November EU Foreign Affairs Council in light of recent terrorist attacks?</p> <p>  The Minister referred to the establishment of a trust fund to address the root causes of migration in Africa.  I understand that we are contributing &euro;3 million to that fund.  If the Minister does not have them readily available today, perhaps he could send us some details on how that fund will operate.</p> <p>  In his contribution, the Minister also referred to 60 million displaced people on the move.  Is that a UN figure and, if so, is it believed to be a reasonably accurate one?  Who are the authors of that statistic?  </p> <p>  Has the Minister had an opportunity meet recently with the Israeli or Palestinian representatives in Ireland concerning the escalation of violence in Jerusalem?</p> <p>  As regards that and other areas of conflict, is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade continually updating its advice to Irish people living in such regions or people who may be planning to travel there?</p></speech>

That involves a multilateral approach on a range of issues, including information and intelligence sharing, international passenger name recognition, the availability of firearms in member states, and a response in the criminal justice area.  That project is ongoing.  Member states must continue to ensure that we speak with one voice on the issue.</p> <p>  On the question of the EU's trust fund for Africa, Deputy Smith is right to say that the proposed sum is &euro;3 million over five years.  The Irish position is that we are actively engaged in designing projects under the fund, especially in the east African region.  This is a total fund in excess of &euro;1.8 billion.  Ireland will continue to play a positive role in relieving many of the challenges of this region.</p> <p>  The figure of 60 million displaced people obviously changes from time to time.  It is, however, true to say that all international agencies agree that this is a crisis the level of which has not been seen since the end of the Second World War.  The total has gone from an estimated 52 million to almost 60 million.  It is very difficult to provide an accurate figure, but the range from 50 million to 60 million - it is 60 million plus from some sources - is indicative of the real and serious crisis we are facing. </p> <p>  On the important issue of travel advice, I assure the committee that the travel advice for individual countries is reviewed on an ongoing basis.  It is publicly available on the Department's website and its official Twitter account.  The advice is made available to Irish citizens so that they can make well-informed decisions.  As well as adhering to the advice, however, we would also encourage people travelling to regions where there may well be potential difficulties to register their details with the Department.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.343" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015112500002#H00500"><p>I welcome the Minister and, to get straight to the point, I would like him to answer a couple of questions.  We are looking at Europe through the eyes of a small island nation, and then we have the bigger conflicts in the greater world.</p><p>Would the Minister agree with me that the last thing the world required was the shooting down by Turkey of a Russian jet on the border with Syria?  As a result of the tragic events that unfolding <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the downing of a Russian passenger aircraft over Sinai by Daesh and the systematic slaughter of Russians and Chinese in Bamako by those fundamentalists, I suspect the hope was that there would have been a unified world response to the activities of Daesh.  What are the Minister's views on the newly developing relationships, given the downing of the Russian fighter jet?  Does he believe it will further embolden the Russians in the other regions of the Eastern Partnership, for example?  I will not detail them all now but there were allegations that the Russians have been messing about again in South Ossetia and Transnistria, with both countries retaliating, and that there were counter retaliations in the form of blocking wine and agriculture imports.  Does the Minister believe that as a result of the downing of this plane, a wedge is being driven through what was developing as world opinion on what Daesh was all about?<br/><br/>Does the Minister share my concern that Europe is in a dodgy state?  We have just seen an attempt to form a new government in Portugal, which may or may not survive.  We have seen a general strike in Greece, orchestrated by the trade union movement and supported by Syriza.  British representatives appeared before the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs this morning complaining about their membership of Europe and discussing immigration.  They said that 300,000 immigrants annually is too many and they want to consider putting a proposal to their people to withdraw from the European family.<br/><br/>With all our existing problems in Europe and the additional dimension of the movement of migrants, will the Minister confirm that while Ireland has contributed &euro;3 million to address the problem of the unfolding Ethiopian famine, in terms of the undercurrent of emigration, many Eritreans have been coming in under the radar because of the dictatorship in Eritrea?  Eritrea has a population of 6 million or 9 million people.  Its neighbour, Ethiopia, has a population of 94 million or 95 million people.  Does the Minister believe we could contain that flow of people from Africa if famine and poverty is reinforced in Ethiopia?<br/><br/>I compliment the Minister's Department because I had occasion to deal with its officials regarding the Libyan students studying here whose government scholarships were interrupted because of the divisions in Libya.  I thank the Department for intervening effectively and reassuring the Libyan representatives here that it was familiar with their problem.<br/><br/>I have put a few awkward questions to the Minister but on another Eastern Partnership country, Moldova, and it is not just a Transnistria issue, the corruption in Moldova has resulted in the collapse of a government.  The biggest political party, the Socialist Party of Moldova, is almost a copy of Putin's party.  It is so pro-Russian as to represent extreme dangers for Europe.<br/><br/>I have a final question for the Minister.  He said that he felt the situation in Ukraine was stabilising but is he up to date on what is happening in Crimea and the role of the volunteer brigades working in conjunction with the Right Sector and now the Tatars?  Is he being serious when he says the situation is becoming more stable?</p></speech>

I repeat my call for restraint on all sides in what is a difficult and challenging time for Europe.  The attacks in Paris, and previous attacks both in Europe and beyond, highlight the fact that international terrorism has no regard or respect for international boundaries.  We continue to work at EU level, however, and it is important that we accept that the European Union is a force for good, stability and peace.  It is important also that we use our collective response in a way that ensures we play our part on the international stage and the approach from the European Union must be comprehensive.</p> <p>  Deputy Byrne is right that we must address the underlying causes of so much conflict and so many displaced persons.  We must promote a narrative that counters the propaganda of Daesh and terrorists, and work within the European Union and the United Nations in that regard.  It is important we ensure our fundamental principles are very much to the fore.  That will involve challenges for Ireland in terms of our active engagement of a type that perhaps we have not seen in the past by way of resolve.</p> <p>  On the specific area of Eritrea, we continue to provide a financial contribution and we will continue to work closely with the Government and communities on what is an ongoing and deeply worrying crisis in that country.  We are looking to how we can provide direct assistance in Eritrea.  The Deputy will be aware of the very difficult environment there but we work closely with the United Nations and its humanitarian arrangements in that country.</p> <p>  On the matter of Moldova, I had the opportunity recently of attending an Eastern Partnership meeting with my EU colleagues covering updates on many countries in the neighbourhood.  The situation in Moldova continues to be of great concern, particularly following the dismissal of the Government due to a vote of no confidence by parliament.  It is important that a new government be formed soon.  In the meantime, without an acceptable government, Ireland agrees with the necessity to suspend EU funding to Moldova pending a reform programme, which will have to be more meaningful than that we have seen to date.  It will involve efforts on the part of the Government to come together in a way that ensures authority and the rule of law.  I would be happy to engage with the Deputy further on the particular area of Moldova.</p></speech>

While there has been a measure of progress, it must be considered against the challenging and conflicted situation that arose last year.  It is important that all sides of the conflict continue to engage in ensuring the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in most need of it.  That cannot be done because it presents a great challenge in terms of the delivery of humanitarian aid while active conflict is taking place.  As the fighting has subsided, it is important we turn our attention to the delivery of the humanitarian aid to those who need it urgently.  We are also conscious of the fact we are now in a challenging time in terms of winter months.  Repair of damaged buildings is essential and gas, water and electricity must be provided in spite of the difficult circumstances.</p></speech>

There is a recently appointed new Israeli ambassador.  I have had the opportunity to meet with him and have a frank engagement.  There was a senior delegation at official level from Israel here last week.  I had the opportunity to meet the Palestinian foreign Minister in late September in New York.  I continue to raise the unacceptable escalation of violence at every opportunity with both Israeli and Palestinian representatives.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.351" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015112500002#K00200"><p>I have a number of questions across a few different issues but I will try to be as brief as possible.  In respect of the dashed hopes of victims' groups, North and South, due to the failure to sign off on a truth recovery process in the recent agreement, can the Minister enlighten the committee on the process for the future?  How is he going to ensure the British Government lives up to a motion taken twice by the Houses of the Oireachtas, calling on it to release files on Irish citizens killed by the British state through collusion or by its state forces?  I welcome the representatives of Justice for the Forgotten who are in the Visitors Gallery.  The Minister answered some of my other questions about the agreement in the Chamber earlier on.</p> <p>  Given that some EU countries have rowed back on their stated commitments to take and settle refugees from war-torn Syria and elsewhere, can the Minister confirm that Ireland still agrees to abide by its public commitment to take, I think, 4,000 refugees?  Is it intended to segregate those refugees in any way or will we treat them as the UNHCR encourages us to do?</p> <p>  I know the Minister is aware of the case of Ibrahim Halawa.  Is he aware that he is stated to have been on hunger strike for 34 days?  If that is true, it means he could possibly be dead by the time of his trial, which is set for 15 December, two days after his twentieth birthday.  Has the new ambassador to Egypt been to visit Ibrahim?  Will the Minister raise his case at the Council meeting?  He was a teenager at the start of all this, now he is nearly 20, and he is an EU citizen who has been held without trial for many years.</p> <p>  We discussed labelling earlier, so I am not going to go over that.  Given that the settlements are illegal, will the Minister ensure at the Council meeting that the EU condemns the decision by the Israeli Government to approve a further 800 homes to be built in the occupied territories?  That decision is contrary to EU laws and the UN.  Will he ask that penalties be triggered which were supposed to be invoked under the Euro-Mediterranean agreement, other EU trade agreements with Israel, or even the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy, which he was quoting earlier?  We should ensure that Israel knows of the EU's displeasure on this.  </p> <p>  The Minister mentioned the huge escalation of violence in the Palestinian and Israeli area, which has resulted in the deaths of more than 70 Palestinians and 11 Israelis in October alone.  Nearly 7,000 citizens have been injured and more than 1,000 Palestinians arrested.  Does the Minister believe, as he said in his speech, that any security response to the violence must be proportionate?  Does he believe those figures show a proportionate response by Israel?  If he does not, what action will he encourage the EU to take to ensure the escalation is reduced and that, at the very least, there is a proportionate response by both sides to any future escalation?</p> <p>  Ethiopia was mentioned.  In respect of disaster planning and humanitarian aid, are the stocks held by Ireland replenished?  Are they ready if there is a humanitarian disaster?  There is a cyclical weather pattern called El Ni&ntilde;o which is predicted to hit the Americas again this year.  In the past, it has caused huge disasters.  Ireland and other EU countries have played a great role in terms of humanitarian aid.  Most countries are coming out of recession and stocks may be reduced.  They should be replenished and available so that we are able to help those countries that may need aid in the next months.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the presence in the Visitors Gallery of members of the Justice for the Forgotten group.  I had the opportunity to meet with them recently.  It is a source of great regret to me and to the Government that we were not in a position to reach agreement over the entire gamut of legacy issues.  However, it would be unfair of me to go into great detail with Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, as he represents a party that was actually seated at the talks for their entirety.  He is most familiar with the level of progress made on that issue.  It was certainly not due to any lack of capacity on the part of the Irish Government that no final agreement was reached on the very important legacy issues and institutions.  I reiterate my call for all parties to continue to engage and to find solutions.  In that regard, the party to which Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh is affiliated has something of a role.</p> <p>  On the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, I wish to assure the Chairman and committee that we will continue to regard this issue as one of importance and urgency.  We fully support the all-party motions.  I had an opportunity in the course of the recent talks to raise the issue specifically with the Secretary of State, Ms Theresa Villiers MP.  She has assured me that she will consider afresh how the British Government can respond fully to the D&aacute;il motions.  It is important for that engagement to continue.  In seeking the truth on this issue, there are aspects over which the Irish Government does not have complete authority.  I assure Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh, the Chairman and other committee members that we will continue to raise the issue at every opportunity.  We will continue to urge the British Government to allow access to the appropriate files and papers by an independent and international judicial figure and to make all the documents available.  I travel to Belfast tomorrow and will engage further with victims and their representatives there.</p> <p>  On the matter of the refugees, the Irish acceptance of up to 4,000 refugees is in the course of being implemented.  There are issues pertaining to screening, which must take place.  This is important for security purposes.  We do not intend to apply any ethnic test or confessional approach, however.</p><p>I hope the issue can be progressed in a most humanitarian way.  I welcome the acceptance on the part of the Irish people towards ensuring that we play our part in what is a humanitarian crisis of huge dimensions.  </p><p> The matter of Ibrahim Halawa continues to concern me.  I am in regular contact with the authorities in Egypt and have had active engagement with the recently appointed Egyptian ambassador here.  I was asked specifically about the involvement of the European Union.  I discussed the case as recently as two weeks ago with High Representative Federica Mogherini.  She has assured me that the case continues to remain high on the agenda of the European Union in terms of its bilateral engagement with Egypt.  I continue to receive suggestions, views and proposals in terms of action and keep these proposals under constant review.  However, I have to say, as I have said before, that I am guided at all times by the type of action I believe is likely to achieve a measure of progress for our citizen.  We supported the application for bail and will continue to do so.  Ultimately, this is an issue that will be decided by the Egyptian authorities.  In the meantime, I will continue to make a strong case on his behalf, as I have been doing, for humanitarian reasons and having regard to his age and conditions and the fact that he is an Irish citizen remanded in custody awaiting trial for a period of time which I would regard as both inordinate and less than acceptable.  I have conveyed these views to the Egyptian Foreign Minister, Sameh Shoukry, and will continue to engage at the highest level.  </p><p> There is no disagreement in Ireland or throughout the European Union on the legality or illegality of the settlements.  They are illegal.  Ireland will continue to ensure that this issue is high up the agenda, notwithstanding the challenges Europe faces in terms of the management of the crisis from within its own boundaries and beyond.  As I stated at the outset, I accept that this apparent vacuum in the region has resulted in a situation where a two-state solution may well be less viable than heretofore.  This is why it is important that the viability of the two-state solution remains.  The European Union has a strong and positive role to play in a way that perhaps it has not in recent times.</p></speech>

It took Europe a while to wake up to the migration issue, the wave of people coming from Syria, the deaths in the Mediterranean Sea and so on.  Eventually, though a consensus has not been reached, there was at least some kind of a programme with increased emphasis on periphery border control and dealing with the problems where they arise, be that in Syria, sub-Saharan Africa or Libya.  There is also an increased emphasis on dealing with migrants in their first country of arrival, be it in the EU or elsewhere.</p> <p>  The Minister rightly states that the migration issue cannot be conflated with the acts of terrorism in Paris the weekend before last.  He is absolutely right.  One does not have to know anything about the problem because one needs only to look at his or her television screen to know that the vast majority of people risking their lives are literally running for their lives.  Nevertheless, we know that there is a certain trickle of terrorists coming into Europe.</p> <p>  Since the Paris event, we have heard the French Prime Minister saying there will be no more migration into France.  Migration is the political issue of the day in Germany.  While it says it can just about cope with the 1 million or so people it received this year, it says it will not be able to cope with another 1 million people next year or the year after or the wave of people that will inevitably try to come from Africa in the years to come.</p> <p>  There is a growing waking up to the reality that our part of the world has become an awful lot more dangerous in recent months.  That was demonstrated again yesterday with the plane that was downed over Turkey or Syria, depending on who it is one is listening to.  As a result of all these rapidly happening events and the way the situation is changing, does the Minister detect a change in attitude to migration on the part of the European countries?  I am talking about a hardening of attitude against migration in our part of the world, based on a fear of a destabilising effect in Europe.  I stress when I ask the question that I am not talking about Ireland specifically or particularly.  Our response in taking in refugees is fairly modest to say the least.  We could probably take in an awful lot more.  I wonder about what must be an increased concern about peace and security in the European region.  I realise it is a big question and that it is early days but does the Minister sense a change in attitude since the events in Paris?</p></speech>

Like others, I commend the Minister on his role in the talks in the North but I would go further.  His advent to the office has heralded a keener and renewed interest in and engagement with the North of Ireland.  I commend the Minister in that regard.  He has done well on other issues too in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  He was a very good appointment and I do not say it to patronise him.  Perhaps I am doing it to soften what I will say to him now.</p> <p>  I sat in these rooms for a number of years as a member of the committee which looked at Mr. Justice Barron's report on the victims and how they were treated.</p><p>We concluded that the Irish State had failed the victims and that is in our report.  That was a joint committee report made up of people from the Minister's party, my party and others, including Independents.  We felt the legacy issue would be an integral part of this agreement.  To me, it should be a red-line issue.  It is to the shame of Sinn F&eacute;in, the SDLP and the Government that we did not make it a red-line issue.  By not doing so, we are in our own way co-operating with the continued collusion of the British authorities in these events.  There is no doubt in my mind or our report that the collusion went to a very high level and even to the top of the British Administration, and that is why it is not being released.  Does the Minister agree with our report in saying the State has failed the victims and we are continuing to do that?</p><p> An unrelated matter has not yet come up.  I have heard from the Parliamentarians for Nuclear Non-proliferation and Disarmament that on 5 November, the first committee of the UN General Assembly passed a resolution that included establishing an open-ended working group, OEWG, to work on legal measures to achieve a nuclear weapon-free world and other measures that would contribute towards that.  What active role will Ireland play in supporting that and building the necessary political cohesion for effective measures proposed by the OEWG?</p><p> My last area deals with migration.  I have three short questions relating to that.  I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive report covering a range of issues and particularly this important area.  He mentioned the 60 million displaced people, which is an appalling vista if we think about it, who are suffering terribly right across the globe, especially in the Middle East.  The Minister mentioned sub-Saharan Africa.  The Vice Chairman accompanied me to a seminar I attended recently in Luxembourg with an address from Ms Federica Mogherini, who is a very impressive lady.  If I recollect them correctly, the statistics indicated that much African migration is to Europe, with 20% of Africans migrating.  That is a very high figure.  Given that the population of Africa will grow to more than 1 billion in the next few decades, that will pose a great challenge.  What preparation is being put in place at a European level to deal with it?</p><p> On page 3-----</p></speech>

Others have had five minutes.  The Minister indicated that the Council agreed on new measures aimed at strengthening the EU's external borders.  Will he outline what they are?</p> <p>  I raise the issue of the whole migration policy.  Many Muslims who have immigrated to Europe feel culturally alienated from the societies in which they live.  Some second generation Muslims have resorted to becoming jihadists.  We have also seen other examples from Britain, including a young man who converted in 1996 to Christianity, having been a Muslim, who is in hospital today because of continuing persecution.  That is happening in Britain.  I had this conversation recently with a senior British politician and the issue will feed into the referendum in Britain, so it is relevant for us to hone in on it.  His idea was that although we must take our share of migrants, we could prioritise Christian migrants who feel vulnerable and alienated in their societies.  We have very valuable Muslim members of society who make a great contribution to the State but why are other Muslim countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar and others, which sponsor some of the people who radicalise young Muslims, not taking any responsibility with this migration crisis?  That must be very much part and parcel of what happens in this process.  Those who come here as Muslims and are radicalised might feel more at home culturally in those societies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.367" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1055" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015112500002#M00800"><p>Both Deputy Mitchell and Senator Walsh spoke about concerns regarding migration.  This is a real challenge and migration is never anything like an appropriate solution to conflict.  Migration is a consequence of conflict.  From an EU perspective, the priority must be to address the root causes, particularly in areas like Iraq, Syria, Libya and other states experiencing conflict and horror, meaning people are left with no choice but to flee, often without belongings or family members.  It is a major issue and therefore it is important, as European foreign Ministers continue to stress, that we implement decisions that have been taken with regard to migration.  An action plan was recently agreed in Valletta.</p> <p>  Deputy Mitchell is right and I will respond to her in a most frank and direct way.  The sheer volume of refugees coming into the European Union has strained the ability of some of our partners to cope, and this has led in turn to strained relations between some neighbouring states as they attempt to offer a form of management.  In Slovenia, a fence was erected along the border with Croatia.  Some member states have taken unilateral action that has given rise to difficulty.  Hungary has closed its border and Slovenia imposed a daily limit on new arrivals.  In more recent days, the debate has shifted between Germany and Austria, and their relationship in the debate has appeared somewhat fractious.</p> <p>  Europe needs to continue to strive for a comprehensive approach involving some hotspots within the region being set up in Greece and Italy, for example.  We need to be especially engaged with neighbourhood states and beyond, for example, including Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon.  We need to involve states in that area experiencing major challenges in managing the issue.  We can consider Sweden as an example, one of the main European destinations for migrants for many years, as it has temporarily introduced border controls.  It is now requesting a refocusing process.  It is important that Europe responds in a way that will tackle the criminal networks of smugglers and traffickers.  We should be in a position at all times to distinguish between refugees and other economic migrants.  This presents a major challenge, and that is why there have been so many European meetings in the justice, foreign affairs and particularly at the Council and Heads of State areas.  We are seeking to implement decisions that we have already agreed to take and have not adequately implemented.  We must ensure there is a medium to long-term strategy, which can often be difficult.</p> <p>  Senator Walsh commented on legacy institutions in the North.  I stress, as I have done in the House already, that I was most anxious for agreement to be reached in a comprehensive way, addressing many of the issues referred to by Senator Walsh.  It was not the Irish Government that pressed for an agreement that completely left out the issues pertaining to legacy.</p><p>It became clear that there was a choice between having an agreement which saw the uncoupling of the past or having no agreement.  In the circumstances, let me add with great reluctance, the agreement was to be ultimately less comprehensive but at least it ensured the devolved institutions were protected and placed on a stable and sustainable footing.  There are a range of legacy issues upon which agreement was reached, and this has not been adequately recognised.  I referred to them in the D&aacute;il and it behoves everybody now, in the first instance, to reflect.  The consequences of such reflection, however, must always be action.  If the political will exists, which will involve an element of compromise on all sides, including the British Government to a large extent, we can set about the process of finding and determining answers to unresolved issues which have resulted in great hardship and trauma for families and communities over many decades.  That must be seen, however, in the context of reconciliation because reconciliation is a prerequisite for a stable society where normal politics is working and seen to work for and on behalf of communities.</p><p> On the matter of nuclear non-proliferation, the most significant achievement was the passage of a resolution mandating the open-ended working group to be convened in Geneva.  Ireland was one of the leaders in achieving agreement and we have a very proud record in this regard going back to the time of a former colleague, the former Minister for External Affairs, the late Frank Aiken, whose work was perhaps unappreciated and who was probably the longest serving Minister for External Affairs.  I acknowledge his great contribution over a range of issues but in particular in the area of nuclear non-proliferation.  His legacy is such as to require me to remain active in that regard, which I will.</p><p> On the migration issue, it is important we ensure Ireland can play its role in offering an element of humanitarian relief to people.  I recently met refugees in my constituency who had just come from Syria and, as members will know, it was a most challenging endeavour for them.  It is difficult for such people to relocate here in the winter and many of them do not speak English and have no experience of our way of life, culture, people or housing.  I continue to encourage our society to offer an open welcome to these people who are fleeing the most horrific of circumstances, many of them without any worldly goods and many of them without any family.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.369" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1118" speakername="Michael Mullins" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015112500002#N00300"><p>I apologise for having had to step out for a number of votes that were called in the Seanad, and in doing so I have probably missed some of the answers to questions.  I compliment the Minister on the hard work and the efforts that were made in kick-starting the Stormont House Agreement recently and, I hope, building very significantly on the peace process into the future.  The legacy issues were referred to and it is a source of regret for the Minister and many others that further progress was not made on those.  Is it proposed that the parties will get around the table again specifically to address the legacy issues separate from the agreement and, it is hoped, with a view to reaching agreement on most, if not all, of them?</p> <p>  On the Paris attacks and in light of the grave concern throughout Europe and in our own country, is the Minister satisfied we have sufficient intelligence on potential terrorists living here who would have the potential to cause severe havoc if they were to act as their counterparts did in Paris?</p> <p>  With respect to the awful Syrian situation the Minister has just described, it is very much to be welcomed that the newly formed International Syrian Support Group hopes to start formal negotiations in January.  It is to be hoped we will see progress but it is very difficult to envisage much progress in the short term, particularly as the regime there and Russia continue to bomb civilians and the opposition in Syria daily.  Does the Minister consider there is any possibility of a ceasefire being demanded by the international community that would in some way assist progress being made on those negotiations due to start on 1 January?  Is he confident progress can be made in the short term to try to put together a solution which in the long term will end the appalling killings we have seen, with 250,000 people having been killed in the past four years and 12 million people having been displaced?  I agree with the Minister's words of advice encouraging us all to look favourably on welcoming those people who have been left with just the clothes on their backs as they have fleed the appalling situation in Syria.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.370" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015112500002#N00400"><p>I apologise for being late due to a few votes having been called in the Seanad.  It is amazing that we are approaching the anniversary of the appearance of the late Mr. Justice Barron in December 2003 before an Oireachtas committee on the issue of his report on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and yet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is still considering whether to release those files 12 years on from that.  Even today the High Court in London is examining a case concerning an incident that happened in 1954 in regard to the Scots Guards and the killing of 24 people in Malaysia.  That shows how their system works.  They wait until everybody is dead or gone and then they might issue an apology which is meaningless because there is no urgency and they do not want to release the files.  We should remember that this was the biggest mass murder in the history of the State.  If I were accused of it or being involved in it, I would release all the files and say we had nothing to hide, but obviously they have plenty to hide.  If they wanted justice, they would assist us.  I know the Minister has responded to that question but I ask that the latest correspondence to the Minister's counterpart or to the Prime Minister seeking that file would be circulated to the committee.  We have had motions on this atrocity but I do not believe they understand they are being accused of being complicit, by silence or otherwise, in that atrocity.</p> <p>  On the issue of refugees, the Minister referred to screening.  We are not suffering from the hysteria the rest of Europe is suffering from following the Paris attacks.  We much remember that similar to the 9-11 atrocities in New York, of the 19 attackers, 15 were from Saudi Arabia, one was from Lebanon, two were from the United Arab Emigrates but none was from Afghanistan, yet it was the country that was attacked.  Osama bin Laden was from Saudi Arabia.  More than a decade later we have had the Paris attacks but none of those involved was from Syria.  There were all Belgian or French citizens.  It is the idea we need to attack, not the territory.  A point that was raised by others is that Saudi Arabia is doing nothing that we can see but it is doing plenty we cannot see.  Its people are the perpetrators of this idea, whether officially or unofficially.  Has any of the Minister's colleagues on the EU Foreign Affairs Council challenged Saudi Arabia on the issue of what it is doing for the refugees who are on its borders and doorstep?  hey are on our borders or doorstep.</p> <p>  On a more practical housekeeping issue, a report from the Ireland Australia Chamber of Commerce on consular representation was circulated to the members of the committee.</p><p>We have excellent consular representation in jurisdictions like Canada, where we have six consulates, in Winnipeg, Halifax, Edmonton, Montreal, Newfoundland and Vancouver, as well as our embassy in Ottawa.  However, in Australia we just have Perth and Sydney.  Before he leaves office, could the Minister look at the idea of having honorary consulates in Melbourne and other cities, such as Adelaide and Brisbane?  There are huge Irish communities there, but in the case of Adelaide, because the ambassador covers not only Australia but also New Zealand, Samoa and other parts of the Pacific, he could not get there for three years.  If we had an honorary consulate, it would be representation for Ireland there.</p><p> My colleagues have brought up the case of Ibrahim Halawa.  I am sure the Minister has the document that came from Doughty Street Chambers giving their opinion of the similarities between him and Peter Greste, the Australian citizen.  The Australian foreign Minister acknowledged, on the day that retrial was ordered for Peter Greste, he is now back in the position of an accused person awaiting trial, yet we persist in saying that we cannot do anything until Ibrahim has finished his trial.  I will circulate it to the Department and to the Minister, but the family has called for the Taoiseach to get involved and has said the Government can do more.  It is their legal opinion that Law 140 clearly allows for the transfer to Ireland of Mr. Halawa prior to a final judgment being given in his case.  That is from Doughty Street Chambers, which represents people who have suffered human rights abuses all over the world.  I ask, as my colleagues have asked, that his case would be on the agenda for the European Council of Ministers in December, which has not been finalised.  His case is important because he is the only one of our citizens abroad who is facing the death penalty.</p></speech>

For my own part, and on behalf of my constituents, I thank him for the work he puts in.  It is clear that he does great work and puts in a huge effort.</p><p>I cannot underscore more heavily than Senator Daly has the imperative of saving a life.  For anybody to be held the way Ibrahim has been held is appalling.  He is my constituent.  Today on the Luas line in Leopardstown at the Gallops at 7.45 a.m. I met one of his classmates from school and college.  This man is doing his final year of engineering and he is a best friend of Ibrahim.  He was a very well-adjusted and well-rounded man, who will be doing a master's in the UCD Smurfit School next September.  I want to underscore that imperative.  The Taoiseach should lift the telephone and arrange for a presidential decree request before 15 December.

Why are these things not being used as the bedrock principles and frameworks for a liberated Iran?  There are 85 million people there.

On Northern Ireland, of course there is ongoing engagement.  I very much regret the fact that some aspects of the agenda were not fully dealt with, but that does not detract from what is an important agreement and I acknowledge the contribution of Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's party towards that.  Now, for the first time, there is a comprehensive plan in place to end the scourge of paramilitarism from the island of Ireland and as Minister, I will monitor the commitments entered into by the parties.  The devolved institutions are on a sound financial footing and there is agreement by all to tackle the scourge of organised crime.<br/><br/>However, there are aspects of the agenda on which we were not in a position to reach a final agreement.  Following the period of reflection we are now in, there needs to be ongoing engagement and I believe we can succeed in that.  I believe that part and parcel of ensuring we tackle the legacy issues of the past, are the commitments given on the matter of the release of papers with particular reference to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings.  I will continue to engage positively in that regard.<br/><br/>On the matter of the Irish citizen detained in Cairo, I wish to stress how important it is that people do not lose sight of the fact that any decision on the matter of his release will ultimately be taken by the authorities in Cairo, not the authorities in Dublin.  I have been asked to assist by advocating that the Taoiseach lift the telephone, but he has done more than that.  He has actively and positively engaged on a regular basis, as have I, on this issue.  I acknowledge the Senator's visit to Cairo was recognised as important at the highest level.  The Government continues to engage at all levels.  I am aware that some in this room do not agree with the Government's approach, but I appeal to everyone who has the best interests of this citizen in mind to ensure that actions taken and public statements made are not such that they would ultimately jeopardise his position.<br/><br/>As the Chair is aware, we continue to engage at the highest level.  Of all the consular cases and files the Department has ever had, this case is high among them in terms of commitment on the part of officials, ambassadors and the engagement of myself, the Senator and the Taoiseach.  We want to achieve a positive result for this citizen and to see his release at the earliest opportunity.  We will continue to work towards that.  Mention was made of the Australian foregin Minister and other international figures.  I met with the Australian foreign Minister on this issue and have engaged with other international representatives to try to ensure the case of the Irish citizen can be made firmly and in a way that ultimately will give rise to a satisfactory conclusion.  It is my hope that the trial will take place on the return date in December.<br/><br/>The matter of Syria is a huge challenge with which we are all familiar.  For a long time now, a ceasefire has been sought.  Staffan de Mistura has given a great commitment at local level.  Despite the horror and ongoing atrocities, there are signs of hope.  Key players are now around the table, including Saudi Arabia, Iran and Russia.  There are hopeful signs that people are working sincerely and urgently to negotiate a peace settlement that will protect the rights of the Syrian people and move matters towards a more stable footing.<br/><br/>The question raised by Senator Mullins on the position of Ireland <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>national security and a possible attack within our jurisdiction was raised by Members in the House earlier today.  The Minister for Justice takes the lead in regard to national security and I keep in close, regular contact with her.  I assure members that the level of threat is kept under constant review by our security forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but nevertheless there is always a possibility of an attack.  We need to ensure that the Garda continues to co-operate fully with our EU partners and that we intensify our intelligence and information sharing capacity.  This is happening.  <br/><br/>The likelihood of an attack on Ireland must always be considered a possibility.  However, it is unlikely.  We have no information containing any form of threat from international terrorism.  This is an international problem and we need to ensure we have an appropriate and adequate level of intelligence sharing.  The activities of a small number of people based here whose behaviour may well be of concern to the Garda is known and is monitored closely and all appropriate measures are being taken in that regard.  Ultimately, at EU level and beyond, through the international community and through important influencers in middle eastern states and the Arab League, we must use every opportunity to bring an end to the conflicts giving rise to mindless acts of international terrorism by people who have no regard for the rule of law or democracy, a consequence of which is the unprecedented international movement of people we have referred to.</p></speech>

It has been a long day, but we have done well and have had a good exchange on the questions.  We do not normally deal with issues relating to Northern Ireland in this committee, but because the Minister was so deeply involved in the talks, he was anxious to answer questions raised by members and I allowed some leeway in that regard.  However, I advise members that I am not setting a precedent for the future.  I thank the Minister and his officials for their attendance.</p></speech>

The Bill will set credits for the 60 to 64 age group at zero and increase the credits payable for those aged 65.  The Bill also provides for an improvement in the health status measure under the scheme by expanding the setting in which a utilisation credit will be payable.  It will now include day case admissions.  This increases the support provided by the scheme to less healthy people.  The Bill also provides for consequential amendments to the Stamp Duty Consolidation Act 1999 and a technical amendment to the Health Insurance Acts is also included.</p></speech>

Its seeks to limit the payment of lifetime community rating loading for ten years.  Given that lifetime community rating is now in place, it could be argued that continual loading is unnecessary and that there should be a ten-year cut off.  In view of the fact that the person has committed himself or herself to that timeframe, one would have thought he or she would make every effort to stay in private health insurance.  Is there a logical reason to oppose it?  We have had this debate on the bigger issue of universal health insurance and the abandonment of that policy.  Clearly, lifetime community rating would not have been necessary if we had compulsory universal health insurance but we now have the option of taking out private health insurance.  There is a need to incentive to ensure intergenerational support and solidarity and a vibrant private health insurance market to fund the elderly and the challenges that will have be faced in the years ahead because of the demographics, the changes in medical technologies and the costs that will be incurred.A continual penalty is unnecessary and I ask the Minister to look at that ten year limit.</p></speech>

Section 7A of the principal Act refers to premiums which may be charged under health insurance contracts in certain circumstances and provides the legal basis for Statutory Instrument No. 312 of 2014 which allows for late entry loadings.  Under lifetime community rating, late entry loadings apply and policies written after 1 May 2015 where the person is taking out health insurance for the first time and is aged 35 or over or where 93,000 people avoided loadings by taking out health insurance since January 2015 in the lead-up to its introduction.  Lifetime community rating supports intergenerational solidarity but also rewards those who take out health insurance at a younger age with a lower price.  The continued encouragement of younger people into health insurance is necessary in order to make health insurance affordable and accessible to more people.</p> <p>  The scheme has only been in operation for a relatively short period, a matter of months.  Provision is made in the regulations for a review to be carried out by the independent regulator, the Health Insurance Authority, after April 2017.  While the Deputy's proposal does have merit I would like to receive proper consideration in the context of that review of the legislation as a whole.  Following the review, any actions deemed appropriate to further enhance the working of the scheme will be considered, therefore I do not propose to accept the amendment at this time.</p></speech>

On the broader issue, the claim is that lifetime community rating is actively encouraging people to take out private health insurance.  One would be forgiven for thinking the Minister was applauding himself or the decision to introduce lifetime community rating.  However, a number of factors are at stake here.  Thankfully, we have a growing economy and there are more people at work so more people are taking out private health insurance.  The key question one has to ask is why people are taking out private health insurance.  The biggest advertisement for private health insurance is the waiting lists in the public health system.  That is what is encouraging people to take out private health insurance.</p><p>They are taking it out because of fear, anxiety and concern that they simply will not be able to access diagnostics or treatment in the public health system.  The Minister cannot claim the policy is working because lifetime community rating has been brought in and the number of people now taking up private health insurance is increasing.  He has to accept there is a major concern out there that people cannot, in a timely fashion, access basic treatments, appointments with consultants or diagnostics.  The biggest recruiter of private health insurance are the appalling waiting lists in the public health system.</p><p> There should be continual review of the lifetime community rating policy.  This amendment should be considered in order to reduce that burden on people after a ten-year period.  While there is a weighting and encouragement for young people to take out insurance, the real encouragement is the fear of not being able to access the public health system.  That is what is supporting the private health insurance market more than anything else.</p></speech>

However, it is obviously not necessary that we do it now because nobody has been paying the loading for a year, never mind ten years.  I would like to review the Act in 2017, when it has been proposed to do that.</p> <p>  There are quite a number of reasons people are taking out health insurance, including a recovering economy at long last, increasing employment and increasing income, as well as the young adult discounts and the fact lifetime community rating is now in place.  At the same time, I have no doubt what the Deputy says is true, namely, long waiting times are one of the things that encourage or drive people to take out health insurance.  However, so long as we have those issues - we have had them for quite some time, for lots of reasons, particularly the capacity of our public health service - it is important we regulate health insurance to ensure that those who are older and those who have illnesses are not discriminated against.</p></speech>

That is why we tabled the amendment.  There is a concern in that the levy was previously going to Revenue.  While I accept there would be challenges in terms of cash flow and administration, I decided I would table the amendment in order to raise the issue that people pay the levy upfront but the credits are paid in monthly instalments.  I am looking for observations on why that is the case and whether there would be administrative difficulties in addressing it.</p></speech>

Section 125A of that Act provides for a levy payable by insurers on each health insurance policy written by them.  The amount of this levy is reviewed annually and section 6 of the Bill amends section 125A of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act by specifying the applicable stamp duty rates for, first, the period 1 January to 29 February 2016 and, second, the period 1 March 2016 onwards.  Stamp duty for health insurance involves a four-rate structure depending on whether the policy written is for an adult or child, or for a non-advanced or advanced plan.</p> <p>  I am advised by the Department of Finance that the proposed amendment is not supported by the Revenue Commissioners as it would create an additional administrative burden with the reconciliation of the returns and payments submitted by health insurers, while not having any clear demonstrable benefit to consumers.  Therefore, recognising the concerns expressed by the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, I am not in a position to accept the amendment. </p></speech>

Perhaps it is because I am spokesperson on health, but we are daily getting calls, letters or e-mails from people who, when they avail of their private health insurance, are being informed they have to make a partial payment, which they previously would not have thought of.</p> <p>  There is something of a campaign to ask people to consider other insurance policy cover but, if they do take it out, they find there is a reduction in the cover.  Surely the Health Insurance Authority has an obligation in this regard.  While it has a great website and people can make comparisons on it, if we are to have a health insurance market, everyone should at least be able to understand what is being covered.  It is impossible for a person to assess all the various policies that are out there and find the option that suits them most.  Among some health insurers, and in some policies with all health insurers, there seems to be a reduction of cover for people when they most need it.  For example, as people get older, it is more likely they will need cover in the area of ophthalmology and orthopaedics.</p> <p>  I would like to know if the Government Members are hearing of this level of concern because we certainly detect it is becoming a big issue.  I would imagine it is primarily because people revisited their health insurance policies during the difficulties of the economic downturn, when, rather than dropping their health insurance completely, they may have been encouraged to change policy.  I wonder whether they were given a full explanation of the cover they are entitled to.  We now have many cases where people are paying for overnight stays in private hospitals or are being charged &euro;350 or &euro;400 for four hours of treatment, whereas, until recently, their health insurance would have covered that.  Is the Government detecting this as an issue?  If so, it really should be addressed so the health insurance market is seen to have absolute integrity in terms of how it promotes its products.  If insurers do not promote them with that type of integrity, there should be some sanction but I do not believe there is such a sanction at the moment.</p></speech>

I recently rang my health insurance company to go through the policy I had in the past year.</p><p>If I become stroppy, say the premium has gone up too much and am about to hang up, they will say they can offer the same premium.  Why is maternity cover pushed on women who are over the age where they require such cover?  I acknowledge the Minister explained this previously.  Perhaps I stand to be corrected but I understand men pay for this cover as well, which is ridiculous.  Why would that be built into insurance cover?  One has to become stroppy and with the last throw of the dice say one is leaving the company before they come up with an alternative policy that might be &euro;400 or &euro;500 cheaper.  I do not expect the Minister to address that but I would say to the insurance companies that this is not good enough.</p><p> They also offer a corporate rate.  They will ask whether the customer is in a union or a company and they are willing to offer a cheaper rate to keep the person on side and this is also not good enough.</p></speech>

There are few things in the mix.  We always have to be aware of competition legislation.  This is a private industry and it is also a financial services industry.  The Competition Authority, Central Bank and Health Insurance Authority all have a role.  There is confusion given there are 300 or 400 plans.  Some have an excess; some do not.  People like the fact that they can opt for an excess because it reduces their premium if they are willing to pay the first couple of hundred euro.  Usually, that is well flagged and sometimes items are not covered.</p> <p>  There are minimum benefits, which every plan has to cover.  They are set down in law and the minimum benefits include maternity cover.</p></speech>

My health insurance policy covers maternity.  The reason it does is community rating.  The rating is designed to spread the burden of the cost across society and if it did not include maternity cover, then women would pay more for health insurance than men.  We could do that but it would not be fair.  That is one of the benefits that should be covered across society.  The reverse could be applied as well.  For example, why should women pay for prostate cover?  There are swings and roundabouts.  We could amend the minimum benefits to include, for example, orthopaedics.  What might work is having a certain number of standard plans such as the old VHI A, B and C.  People would at least know what they are and then the insurers could have variations on those plans.  In my discussions with insurers, they point out that anything that reduces the number of plans available may increase costs overall and we would have to bear that in mind.</p> <p>  Everyone is entitled to the corporate rate such as the teacher's policy whether one is a teacher or not.  Corporate rates have to be open to everyone even if they are not in that profession or a corporation, which is a bit odd but that is the way it is.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by Mr. John Coyle, head of Circuit Court and District Court operations throughout the country; Mr Se&aacute;n Quigley, head of resource management and accountant for the courts of justice; and Ms. Marie Ryan who is a principal officer in the Courts Service of Ireland and heads up my office.</p> <p>  The Courts Service of Ireland is responsible for the management and administration of the courts.  As members are aware, the administration of justice is a matter for the Judiciary which, in accordance with its constitutional independence and the provisions of the Courts Service Act, is outside the scope of the functions of the Courts Service of Ireland.  Members will appreciate, therefore, that in my discussions with them I am precluded from commenting on any matter relating to the exercise by a judge of his or her judicial functions or to the exercise of quasi-judicial functions by an officer of the court.  I am also, of course, precluded from commenting on matters of Government policy.  </p> <p>  Since its establishment, the Courts Service of Ireland has worked to ensure the courts operate effectively and efficiently, that the use of available resources is optimised, that value for money is achieved and that the best possible service is provided for court users.  In the past six years, in common with all Departments and agencies, it experienced very severe reductions in funding and staff numbers.  To address this and ensure the courts continued to sit and be supported, it has worked with the Judiciary to introduce a broad range of changes and reforms which have yielded significant savings for the Exchequer, while maintaining access to justice and services for the public.  The service has diligently cut expenditure and, through proactive management, increased court fees, resulting in a significant contribution to the Government's recovery programme.  We have robust financial control measures in place across the organisation to ensure expenditure is kept to an absolute minimum and incurred only where it is absolutely necessary and unavoidable and that value for money is achieved.</p> <p>  In the past six years the Courts Service of Ireland has engaged in a comprehensive range of operational and structural reform measures to achieve greater value for money, improved efficiency in processes and optimisation of the available funding and staffing resources.</p><p>This has resulted in significant increased productivity and efficiency in the delivery of services.  It also supported and facilitated a reduction of up to 41% in the net cost to the Exchequer of running the courts since 2008.</p><p>  Given the severity of the funding and staffing reductions in the Courts Service, which gave rise to a 16% reduction in staff numbers - double the Civil Service average and significantly greater than the public service average of 10% - it would not have been possible to maintain court services and sittings without introducing a range of efficiency and productivity measures across all aspects of court structures, administration and operation.  The measures implemented included reform of the court regional structures and court office structures, with the introduction of cross-jurisdiction combined court offices, the closure of smaller court offices and the ongoing rationalisation of court venues.  These measures have maximised the use of resources and successfully freed up both judicial and staff time to support the hearing of cases.  We have also worked to introduce a substantial programme of legislative and process reform with the ongoing streamlining of court office business procedures to enable improved operation of the courts and efficiency in deployment of court resources.</p><p> The implementation of our ICT programme has resulted in the optimisation of courtroom and court support technology, including: the rolling out of digital audio recording to all court jurisdictions and venues; extended use of video link and video conferencing, which has resulted in significant cross-justice sector efficiency; and the development of case management and e-filing projects, including the case management systems for the personal insolvency service, the Court of Appeal and Supreme Court and ICT support for the new fines legislation and e-filing projects, such as the debt claims online project and e-licensing, which are still under way.</p><p> There has been increased staff flexibility in a number of areas, such as logging of digital audio recording by court registrars, increased in-house ICT support and legal support, all of which have yielded significant savings.  The Courts Service also continues to support the mediation initiative in Dolphin House, resulting in minimum savings of 315 days in court since inception to the end of 2014 and other cost-reduction measures.</p><p> The Courts Service fully accepts and supports the Government&rsquo;s ongoing requirement for savings to be achieved and is very conscious that although there has been an easing of the financial crisis, the need for reform in the delivery of public services remains.  We are, therefore, continuing our ongoing review of the operation of the courts and the implementation of our modernisation programme.</p><p> The improved financial situation has been reflected in the Government Estimates for 2016, and the Courts Service has received a very welcome increase in additional funding of &euro;1.75 million, or 1.6%.  This will allow us to begin to address the key challenge for the service in recent years, namely, the lack of sufficient staff, which, despite the reforms introduced, has had an impact on the support we can provide for the Judiciary and court sittings and on the provision of core court services to the public.  The reduction of up to 16% in full-time staff numbers coincided with an increase in workloads in a number of areas of our operations, most noticeably possession cases, in respect of which the number of civil bills increased by 883% in 2014 and the number of court orders increased by 105%.  There has also been an increase generally in the complexity and length of court hearings, an increase of 10% in the number of court sitting days and an increase in the number of judges, which has resulted in the ratio of staff to judges falling from 7.3:1 in 2009 to 5.8:1 in 2015, a reduction of 22%.</p><p> That the Courts Service is providing a skilled front-line service to court users from geographically dispersed court offices and that a significant number of senior staff have retired, with the consequent loss to the organisation of technical expertise and knowledge, increased the adverse impact of the severe reduction in staff numbers.  This, in fact, placed considerable and unsustainable pressure on court staff in a number of offices, which has been a cause of ongoing concern.  The reduced staff numbers also meant that the Courts Service was no longer able to support the additional court sittings required by the presidents of the different court jurisdictions to meet the needs of court users.  Unfortunately, this has led to increasing and unacceptable delays in the hearing of cases, particularly serious criminal trials and domestic violence order applications in Dublin.</p><p> There is no doubt that the Courts Service had reached a tipping point and that additional staff were required if the service was to continue to support court sittings adequately, maintain court services in offices around the country and adequately support Government initiatives such as the restructuring of the family law courts, which is under consideration at present.  The additional funding to be allocated to the Courts Service in 2016, while it was not all that was sought, will allow for the appointment of roughly 30 additional staff.  This process is already under way and priority is being given to supporting the additional court sittings required to address delays and providing additional resources to those offices most severely impacted by staff losses in recent years.</p><p> In common with many other organisations, investment in staff training in the Courts Service also suffered over the past six years.  This coincided with the substantial loss of corporate knowledge and expertise.  This represents a significant risk for the organisation, which relies heavily on the technical knowledge of its staff to ensure that it can effectively support the courts.  Therefore, in the context of the major changes implemented in recent years and the challenges facing the organisation, it was decided to reassess our learning and development requirements fundamentally so as to ensure that any new arrangements put in place will be focused on those steps that will have the biggest impact, help realise the potential of all our staff and ultimately ensure the Courts Service is achieving high levels of performance.  A learning and development strategy is now being finalised and it will ensure all staff and managers have the requisite skills to perform their roles at a high level of competence; enhance and maintaining the legal and technical skills and knowledge; and support and develop our managers and staff in dealing with the wide range of challenges and issues that they face on a daily basis. </p><p> Progress is also being made on the Courts Service capital building programme.  We very much welcome the inclusion of a number of Courts Service projects in the Government&rsquo;s capital infrastructure and investment plan for the period 2016 to 2021.  Funding has been provided for the provision of a new family law and children court complex at Hammond Lane by way of a PPP project.  This will provide a dedicated and integrated family law and children court building and new court accommodation for the Supreme Court.  It will also house a number of Courts Service offices.  This is a major development that is long overdue.  It will replace the current inadequate facilities at a number of locations with a single site development with custom-built facilities.  Discussions have already commenced on the provision of this project.</p><p> The plan also confirmed funding for the provision of seven state-of-the-art courthouses at seven locations around the country by way of PPP projects.  The contracts for these projects are due to be signed in December and the construction will commence immediately thereafter.  The projects will be completed within a two-year timeframe and will provide 31 fully fitted courtrooms with all the relevant support facilities across the seven projects.</p><p> On completion of Hammond Lane project and the seven provincial venues, there will remain only five provincial city and county town venues in need of significant improvement: Galway, Tralee, Roscommon, Portlaoise and Wicklow.  The Courts Service will continue to press for funding for the development of these remaining venues to bring them into line with other county towns, whether through the PPP process or as traditional capital building projects.</p><p> Perhaps the most significant challenge facing the Courts Service at present is that there has been no additional funding provided for ICT investment.  Investment in ICT was another of the casualties of cuts since 2009 and ICT has been consistently under-funded year on year since then.  Significant and ongoing investment is required if ICT is to achieve its potential in bringing about a transformation in the way the courts operate and achieve significant further savings.  In the context of reduced resources and growing workloads, technology offers the best solution to enhancing customer service and delivering improved value for money.  Additional investment is required to extend the civil case management system across all jurisdictions, develop e-filing capabilities and extend courtroom technology to additional courtrooms around the country.  This would be a major advance in the delivery of the e-government agenda in the courts system and would deliver efficiencies in the handling of both civil and criminal business to the benefit of court users, the Courts Service and a number of other justice agencies.  The Courts Service will continue to press for additional funding to progress the development of ICT in the courts system.</p><p> The Courts Service priority will continue to be the provision of front-line core court services to support the Judiciary and court users.  This can be achieved only through the ongoing review of the organisation and the delivery of services and the continued implementation of our change modernisation programme.</p><p>The Courts Service Strategic Plan 2014&ndash;2017 sets out the key priorities for the Courts Service over the next three years.  Over the lifetime of the plan, we propose to build on the progress already made in the review and reform of our structures and service delivery and to focus on maximising the use of technology, developing our staff and rationalising process to enable us continue to improve services to court users, to make the courts as accessible as possible and achieve real value for money in the provision of these services.</p></speech>

Members appreciate the pressures under which the Courts Service operated.  Members have questions and Senator Bacik, who indicated first, has three questions.  She will be followed by Deputies Niall Collins and Mac Lochlainn.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.465" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015112500002#C00300"><p>I thank Mr. Ryan and his colleagues for the presentation.  I agree absolutely with the Chairman's comments and commend the Courts Service on the reforms and efficiencies it has introduced in the face of such cuts.  I have three questions and the issue that jumps out from the presentation is Mr. Ryan's concern regarding the increasing and unacceptable delays in the hearing of cases, particularly serious criminal trials and domestic violence applications, which he stated were directly due to the reduced staff numbers and lack of availability of support for the Judiciary.  While Mr. Ryan stated the Courts Service had reached a tipping point, will the appointment of 30 additional staff members, for which the Courts Service has received funding, resolve the issue or are delays still continuing for the same reason?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.466" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Ryan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015112500002#C00400"><p>This will resolve those issues, albeit obviously not overnight.  On the 30 staff members, for instance, I have agreed to appoint six or seven additional staff members into the family law area in Dublin.  Our proposal is that Dolphin House will revert to being a family law centre only in the interim, pending the building of the Hammond Lane site, while the Chancery courts in the Bridewell, with which the Senator may be familiar, will become the child care courts.  We need seven staff to support the splitting of that business and of the 30-odd staff members for whom I have received funding I have allocated seven to Mr. Coyle, who is in charge of that area, to set up this business.  The waiting times in respect of domestic violence in Dublin, which probably are the worst nationwide, are approximately 14 weeks and we hope to reduce that significantly once we start.  The difficulty is we must now undertake some building work in the Chancery courts because the child care courts will go there and it is not really a suitable venue for child care but we will do our best in the intervening period.  We must do some remedial work there and must transfer some of the present sittings up to the Criminal Courts of Justice, CCJ, and probably out to Blanchardstown.  There is some work to be done in this regard, which will take a few months.</p> <p>  As for the Central Criminal Court, where the waiting time went out to 17 months, the President of the High Court decides on the allocation of judges for various business and he has indicated his immediate assignment of a fifth judge to Central Criminal Court work.  The difficulty for me is I did not have a registrar to support this unless the President was willing to allow a civil court registrar move up from the Four Courts.  Again in respect of additional staff, I have appointed a new registrar to the Central Criminal Court in order that it will be supported.  The additional judge started in October and the President already has indicated the additional judge will remain in respect of the Central Criminal Court, where there will be five judges during 2016.  This should really eat into the waiting times in the Central Criminal Court.  The waiting time for the Special Criminal Court at present is approximately 19 months but as the Senator is aware, the Oireachtas has approved a second Special Criminal Court.  A meeting was held in this regard last Friday and we anticipate the second Special Criminal Court will start sitting early in the new year.  I anticipate this also will have a positive impact on the waiting times there.</p></speech>

The Court of Appeal has done some excellent and welcome work and waiting times on the criminal side have been reduced to between four months and six months whereas, as the Senator is aware, waiting times were well in excess of that.  Some extraordinary work has been done by the court since its establishment last November.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.469" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1148" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015112500002#C00700"><p>On another matter, Mr. Ryan referred a lot to information and communications technology, ICT, its importance and in particular, to digital audio recording.  It is some years since I was in practice but does Mr. Ryan mean digital audio recording now has been rolled out for all court proceedings at all levels?  Has it reached that stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.470" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Ryan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015112500002#C00800"><p>Every court venue, that is everywhere a court sits in Ireland, has digital audio recording.  All venues in Dublin have permanent settings and each major provincial court venue has a permanent digital audio recording, DAR, computer system in the courtroom.  In the case of court venues in which sittings only take place once per month over 11 months of the year, we have a portable unit.  Consequently, all court sittings are now subject to digital audio recording.  I might add that for indictable criminal matters, we have a backup recorder.  There is a computer in every courthouse but for indictable trials, we have a secondary computer backup system just in case the first system fails because as members are aware, one must have a transcript for indictable trials for any appeals.  It is all working very well, albeit at a huge cost to the Courts Service, but it is much required.  In addition, it is appropriate that on the hoped-for establishment of the judicial council next year, if issues are raised in respect of conduct and ethics with regard to the Judiciary, the Judiciary will have an access to a recording of what went on in the court.</p></speech>

Can Mr. Ryan indicate whether this has improved or is improving?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Ryan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015112500002#C01200"><p>Yes, it is improving.  When the Courts Service was established in 1999, courts were sitting in 230 venues outside Dublin.  This now has been reduced to 83 or 85 venues, which has allowed us to optimise the use of our resources.  It also has allowed us to put what limited funding we have, I assure the joint committee it has been extremely limited since 2008, into those court venues that still exist.  The process is not finished and we still are considering further venues.  Funding always is an issue but the combining of court offices and the optimisation of new processes within court offices definitely has resulted in a better service to the Judiciary in those remote locations.</p></speech>

I recently received correspondence regarding wards of court and the moneys the Courts Service manages on their behalf.  Can Mr. Ryan provide the joint committee with an overview of how the moneys the Courts Service is managing for these people are performing?  Concerns were raised at the height of the recession that the values of the various funds took a dip, which is understandable given the turmoil in the world markets.  I seek an overview in this regard first.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.476" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Ryan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015112500002#C01400"><p>By way of background, if the Deputy does not mind, I will introduce the subject and then Mr. Quigley, who is on the investment committee of the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice, can provide further details.  When a person is taken into wardship, the President of the High Court appoints a committee, usually one person, to deal with the ward's property and in certain cases to make recommendations for the ward's personal welfare.  In approximately 75% of cases, the ward's committee is a family member.  If there is no suitable or willing private person, the President can appoint a general solicitor for minors and wards of court to act as the committee.</p> <p>  As for the investment, if the Chairman will bear with me, it is important to appreciate the court funds are held in trust by the courts.  The Courts Service, in accordance with the Courts Service Act 1998, is responsible for the management and administration of the courts and provides support services for judges.  It is in this capacity that the Courts Service has a role in the management and investments of court funds.  The Courts Service operates a prudent investment policy and this has ensured the capital sum is protected, especially in the case of minors, and where necessary, an appropriate balance is struck between income generation and capital preservation.  This approach has worked really well over the past 12 years, where good returns have been generated while protecting court funds from the worst effects of the credit crisis.  A significant element, approximately 65%, of funds are held in cash-based assets and bonds and then there is approximately 35% exposure to equities and corporate bonds.  In making a decision to invest court funds on behalf of a ward or a minor, a key factor in deciding in which funds to invest is the time period during which the funds will be held by the courts.</p><p>Shorter funds are invested in cash-based assets while funds that are held for longer periods are invested in the most appropriate funds.  The performance of longer-term funds cannot be assessed properly by taking one year in isolation.  One must look at the cumulative investment performance over a longer period.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.478" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Quigley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015112500002#D00200"><p>A total of &euro;1.5 billion in funds is managed by the accountant's office on behalf of 19,500 beneficiaries.  Of those 19,500 beneficiaries, 2,700 are wards of court and that is the area that has attracted most attention.  We have six investment strategies in place.  The main strategy for wards of court is the growth fund, which is a long-term investment fund.  Anything over five years for a ward of court would go into the growth fund and we retain a cash holding as well.</p> <p>  When the Courts Service was established 16 years ago, we looked at this area and completely revamped the governance and management structures.  We put in place investment strategies, independent investment advisers and a fund manager and applied external audit for the first time.  As this committee or perhaps the Committee of Public Accounts will know, the Comptroller and Auditor General is precluded by legislation from looking at this area but we have our own independent auditors in place and we publish annual financial statements relating to these funds.</p> <p>  Specifically on the issue of investment performance, in one period, namely, the year ending September 2008, a number of funds showed a negative performance, but that was consistent with what was happening across the industry at that time.  In the past two years, we tweaked our strategies for our growth fund and have seen a return of 19.4%.  That is despite the fact the most recent year was quite volatile.  If one looks at the funds over the period from December 2003, when we put all the arrangements in place, the growth fund has generated a total yield of 72%, which is an average of 6% per annum.  I know the issue has been raised about people who claimed that their funds took a hit in 2008, and while that is true, it was on paper only.  Unless people were exiting and selling their assets at that point, they were not realising a loss.  All those funds have recovered way beyond any of the paper loss that was triggered in 2008.  Indeed, we know from our own independent advisers that major pension funds in Ireland suffered considerably bigger hits.  This is testament to the prudent approach we take.  We only have exposure to equities where it is necessary and even then, it is less than 50%.  Our exposure is in the region of 50%, even in the growth fund, which is not by any means an aggressive approach.</p> <p>  We are aware of the difficulties and concerns around funds that may run out over the period of a person's life.  That issue is being examined for the future in terms of periodic payments.  However, in the context of the environment in which we operate, we can say that the funds are managed to good effect in the best interests of the beneficiaries.  Where funds may ultimately run out, it is not as a result of poor investment performance.</p></speech>

We had a review in 2012 and 2013 which identified 41 venues for further consideration.  We are going through them slowly, as I indicated to Senator Bacik.  There is a resource issue at play here.  It is a very intensive project to bring a report to the board on any venue because wide consultation takes place.  Since 2012 we have brought 18 proposals to the building committee and on to the board.  The board agreed to the closure of 12 venues but determined that a further six should not close.  Based on that, there are approximately 15 further venues to be decided on, but there is nothing going on in that area at the moment because we simply do not have the time.</p></speech>

We must consider people who do not have access to private transport or who lack financial resources, particularly those in receipt of social welfare payments.  If we keep shutting venues throughout the country, that will impede such people's access to justice.</p></speech>

This applies in terms of costs as well as physical and geographic location.  This is one of the key cornerstones of any decision we make.  We always take such issues into account and apply very strict criteria in our analysis of venues.  We always take cognisance of issues like the availability of local public transport, for example.  We also try to ensure there is a court venue within 40 kilometres or 24 miles of an area.  That said, it must be recognised that appearing before a court is for many people a once in a lifetime experience.  Indeed, most people never appear before the courts.  I know the courts are very busy but a lot would have what one could call regular customers.  Most people do not appear before the courts in Ireland.  If they do, it is often a once in a lifetime experience as a witness or some such.  We are very conscious of the issue of accessibility.</p> <p>  On the other hand, we must accept that we have limited funds and must achieve value for money.  By and large, the venues we closed would have sat for only an average of 11 times a year.  They were stand-alone court buildings.  During those 11 sittings, in many cases they would have been finished their business well before lunch time.  In some instances, we had buildings which were used for only 22 or 24 hours per year and we had to question whether public funds should be expended on them when there were other areas within the Courts Service and the wider public service that needed funding.  These are the issues that arise.  That said, we do bear in mind the issues of accessibility and access to justice.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Ryan clarify an issue for me?  I am aware of a number of cases where digital audio recordings had to be reverted to because there was a conflict around the ruling by the judge.  The recordings were very important and had they not been available, justice would not have been served.  Is it the practice of registrars to revert to the digital audio recording system before they register a decision?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.490" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Ryan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015112500002#D01400"><p>It is critical that court decisions are recorded accurately to ensure orders, warrants and so forth drafted by the court registrar are correct.  The court registrar normally makes a record in court of the judge's decision.  Since 2008, all registrars have had access to digital audio recordings.  Most of our more senior, competent and experienced registrars are used to drafting orders, warrants and so forth, but if they have any doubt at all, they can go back to their office and listen back to the court proceedings.  Indeed, they can listen back in the courtroom itself.  They can access the sound files from a court sitting at a particular time and listen back to what the judge said.  In that way, they can avoid any issues arising with regard to the accuracy of a warrant or court order.</p></speech>

If the registrar has a digital audio recording, which is unquestionably the account of what actually happened and what the judge ruled on, why would a registrar, rather than relying on the digital audio recording, rely on the opinion of the solicitors acting on behalf of the parties?  Is it Mr. Ryan's opinion that a registrar should rely on the digital audio recording before recording a decision or should he or she rely on the opinion of the solicitors?  It strikes me, as an ordinary person with a degree of intelligence, that the digital audio recording is what one should revert to before recording a decision.</p></speech>

If there is any issue in doubt, the digital audio recording is the factual recording of what was said in the court.</p></speech>

Our committee produced a report on the issue of policing and touched on the administration of justice.  One of the practices in the North of Ireland is a criminal justice inspectorate that oversees a range of aspects of the criminal justice system and has a big picture or a helicopter view of the system as it works.  The opinion of our committee is that is what is required in this State.  Such a body would oversee the Courts Service in addition to policing and other criminal justice services.  In the absence of that, what are the oversight mechanisms of the Courts Service?  Who is it accountable to for the provision of its services, apart from this committee?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.494" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Ryan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015112500002#E00400"><p>The management of the Courts Service is accountable to the Courts Service board under the 1998 Act and, through that, to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Comptroller and Auditor General also has oversight of the courts.  We also report to the Minister for Justice and Equality on critical matters.  We would have no problem with an overview of the criminal justice agencies because the Courts Service would prove to be a very efficient and effective organisation.  There is significant oversight in place throughout the organisation.  We have an audit committee chaired by an outside prominent individual who takes very keen interest in everything we do.  There is significant oversight.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has access to us all of the time.  We would have no fear of anybody else coming in and having oversight.  As I keep saying, I think it is a very successful organisation.  I am not saying that is because of me.  The Chairman mentioned earlier how successful the Courts Service has been.  That is because of the staff of the Courts Service and their commitment, enthusiasm and professionalism.  I sit on the top floor of Phoenix House making decisions every now and then but they do all the work.</p></speech>

The development in Dublin is very welcome.  The Government confirmed yesterday that there is no constitutional bar to rolling out a family court system and it was reported in the media today.  Hopefully, in the next Government term, there will be a roll-out of dedicated family courts.  I am sure Mr. Ryan is concerned, as all of us are, about the fact family cases are listed along with civil cases.  Mr. Ryan cannot comment on Government policy but practically, in terms of the impact on families, what is his analysis of the current experience of families in the State in our court system that have to engage in family law sittings?  What is Mr. Ryan's opinion of how that operates and what needs to change?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.498" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Ryan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015112500002#E00900"><p>We support the Government's commitment on family law courts.  My concern about any additional services provided is that they are appropriately resourced.  If there are dedicated family law courts, they cannot be tacked onto existing structures.  If it is to be taken seriously and to be professional, a new structure must be put in place.  At present in Dublin, there is no issue of family law matters being dealt with at the same time as other cases, either criminal or civil.  In the High Court, the courtrooms are on the fourth floor of &Aacute;ras U&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh and in the Circuit Court, they are heard in Phoenix House, where my office is.  In the District Court, they are heard in Dolphin House.  Around the country, there are 35 Circuit Court offices and 33 District Court areas where family law cases are held.  In the District Court, every district has a separate family law day.  During those family law days, particularly when the court sits in the smaller venues in which there is only one courtroom, only family law is dealt with.  If it is in a provincial town where there are two or three courtrooms, the scheduled sitting of the District Court on family law might tag into a Circuit Court dealing with civil or criminal matters.  Similarly, the Circuit Court has scheduled family law sittings but every now and then, particularly when it sits in the bigger venues with three or four courtrooms, the District Court might sit there on the same day and might deal with other matters.  This issue will always exist with regard to family law courts sitting at the same time as other courts.  It does not happen that often around the country and it does not happen in Dublin.  The only way around that is to build separate venues with a huge cost to the Exchequer.  It is a matter of management, the Judiciary and practitioners getting together to ensure that where it happens, they are kept apart.  We spent about &euro;250 million up to 2008-2009 on our building programme.  Those 52 venues and the seven new court buildings all have excellent family law facilities.  As we roll out our building programme, we will ensure that these facilities are enhanced.  We do our best to ensure that family law is kept separate from other court business.  At times, we cannot do that but we will continue to try to do so.</p> <p>  To return to the Deputy's point, the Government needs to fund the family law structure.  Not everything should end up in the courts.  To fund this properly, money should be made available to the Legal Aid Board, the Probation Service and family mediation services.  The more people out of the courtroom environment, the better.  There is a view that a mediated settlement is a much more sustainable settlement compared to one decided by a judge.  By and large, judges would prefer if settlements were mediated.  That requires investment and support of those bodies and extra funding for bodies, such as the Probation Service, to provide reports on child care issues.  That is funding the Courts Service does not have.</p></speech>

It is a work in progress because issues come up on a regular basis.  It was designed by the architects in the Office of Public Works in consultation with legal practitioners and various groups.  When we go out to build courtrooms at court venues, the design brief specifies segregation, including segregated walkways around the courthouse.  It is really well thought out and designed but it is not fixed in stone.  If an issue arises at any stage that we believe requires further adjustments, we will make those.  It is not a family law venue but the Criminal Courts of Justice was opened in 2009 and is one of the best court venues in the world in terms of segregation.  The Judiciary comes in its own entrance.</p><p>The juries are automatically segregated.  They have their own circulation path.  Those in custody come into the basement, where there is accommodation for up to 100.  There are lifts and staircases to all 22 courts.  Outside the courtroom there is a holding area.  Those in custody appear in the courtroom whereas in the old days they were marched along the corridors in handcuffs.  Everybody appears in the court room at the last minute.  The judge comes from his direction, the jury from another, those in custody from another and the public and practitioners come in the main door.  That is the concept we use for all court venues and is part of our building brief.</p></speech>

I know it is not involved directly in the cases.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, says someone must go to court and the Courts Service structures the court day for that hearing, is there a central database recording that process, from when the case is initiated to its result?  How is that process recorded?  Could anomalies appear in the system, for example, if a dangerous criminal did not get a custodial sentence and was back on the streets a couple of weeks later?</p></speech>

Since 2000 we have used an internally designed and developed computer system, which records all details of criminal cases, including road traffic offences, from initiation.  A criminal case is generally initiated in the District Court by way of summons or charge sheet.  The charge sheet comes in from the Garda.  The details of the charges etc. are entered in the system, scheduled for court, each order made by the court is recorded there as well as the final order, dismissed or prison sentence.</p> <p>  Most summons applications received from the Garda are received electronically on an interface between the Garda police using leading systems effectively, PULSE, system and the criminal case tracking system, CCTS.  Applications for summons come in electronically.  We do not have to enter the data within the courts system.  It is automatically updated to our CCTS.  The summonses are printed, issued and scheduled for court.  The process is then basically the same as for charge sheets.  The cases come before the court.  The order is recorded.  It may be adjourned or dealt with on the first day.  There is a deficiency in that we would like to receive the charge sheets electronically from the Garda because that would save our staff inputting them.  An enhancement to the system for summonses is on the agenda.</p> <p>  A separate system manages crime in the Circuit Court.  It operates on the same principle, recording it from the time it comes into the Circuit, Central or Special Criminal Courts until it is disposed of in the courts.  </p> <p>  On the civil side, we have a plethora of systems.  There is a system for each office around the country.  This is one of the casualties of the reduction in funding for the development of new systems.  We have commenced the development of a cross-jurisdictional information system to cater for civil and family law business and components of that system are up and running, for example, in the Court of Appeal and in the Supreme Court.  The challenge for us is to further enhance and develop that system to incorporate the transaction of ordinary civil business across all court jurisdictions.  We require funding and additional resources for that.  We are working on two further components of that system.  One is debt collection on line, DCOL.  A solicitor or lay litigant who wants to issue a civil summons can do it online.  It is scheduled.  That is approximately 75% developed and we await legislation to give legal effect to electronic filing and to replace the requirement for swearing affidavits by a statement of truth.  We are looking forward to that legislation coming in because then we can proceed with the first component of our cross civil system.</p> <p>  We are also working on a new licensing system for the District and Circuit Courts.  That is well advanced.  It does not have the same legislative problems and we aim to implement it on a pilot basis with effect from next April.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.515" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan Ryan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015112500002#G00300"><p>Back in 2008, the Courts Service had a budget of &euro;9.7 million for IT.  It is now &euro;4.8 million and has been so for the past five years.  That figure does not keep our systems ticking over.  We need a minimum of &euro;6.7 million to maintain our existing system.  That is not even to enhance our system.  While I am pleased we got moneys for staff in the 2016 budget, we also applied for an extra &euro;2 million for IT to bring it up to the minimum level of &euro;6.7 million.  Unfortunately, we have not got a single penny of additional funding for IT.</p> <p>  This is a significant area of concern to me and I will be reporting on it to the board at its December meeting.  To bridge the gap between the allocated &euro;4.6 million and the minimum level required of &euro;6.7 million, we have to take moneys from the capital building programme, which was reduced significantly as well.  We have &euro;4 million a year for capital projects, which does not allow us undertake any major projects.  For the past several years, we have been using that money to support the IT system.  This cannot continue.</p> <p>  We have not maintained our court venues for the past six years, which is another concern.  During the week, to my disquiet, I was informed the roof in the Naas courthouse will have to be replaced next year.  This is an urgent matter but it involves &euro;300,000 for which we have not budgeted.  These are the issues affecting courthouse maintenance.  We cannot continue taking money from a capital building project to support our IT.  While we will have staffing to support all court sittings, I am concerned there will be some problems with pre-court or post-court work.  Mr. John Coyle has referred to systems in the District and Circuit Courts.  I am not saying they will crash but they are not being kept up to date.</p> <p>  We are still working off Windows XP because we cannot afford to upgrade.  Windows has progressed with five different versions since then and Windows XP is not supported anymore.  Mr. Quigley, the accountant of the courts of justice, is working off an Agresso system which is three generations behind and is not supported anymore.  Although we only looked for &euro;2 million, unfortunately, under the capital investment programme, that money was not available.  It will be 2017 again before that is reviewed.  We have two years of scraping around looking for money to make sure the system does not collapse.  As chief executive of the Courts Service, my main concern is the lack of investment in ICT and, not because of our commitment, something will go wrong with our infrastructure which will impede the courts.</p></speech>

We are looking at a whole new Estimates process for the Oireachtas which it is hoped will kick in whereby committees will have far more input at an earlier stage in how moneys are allocated by the Department and the Exchequer.  This is why we are anxious to engage with agencies such as the Courts Service.  It does amazing work, which we have learned today.  Perhaps the service has been a bit invisible up until now.  That is something we need to change.</p></speech>

Will Mr. Ryan bring me up to date on that?  Legislation was passed to allowed people to pay their fines through instalments, even through their social welfare payments, rather than having to go to court, which is more expensive for the State.  The last I heard was we were waiting for an IT system to put that into operation.  Has that IT system been put in place?  It would save the State money.</p></speech>

The Department provided the Courts Service with &euro;2 million in 2011, but this has been going on for some time.  Our IT system will be ready in January to implement the Fines Act.  There is no instalments payment system yet but that is part of the Fines Act.  That will be at the discretion of the judge.</p></speech>

Again, that has taken significant resources from everywhere else within the system.  We got funding of &euro;2 million in one year, around four budgets ago.  The legislation was amended when the new Government came in and we have been putting money, resources, time and effort into this.</p> <p>  Swords courthouse is not fit for purpose.  It is one of the poorest courthouses we have.  We have been borrowing from Peter to pay Paul.  Any money we have in the capital programme is not being used in it but to deal with IT infrastructure such as implementing the Fines Act.  We need to do something about Swords courthouse as it is a priority matter and accessibility is an issue.  Aside from that, the building is not fit for purpose</p></speech>

It makes sense and I am delighted it is up and running.  The committee takes Mr. Ryan&rsquo;s point that the Courts Service has worked hard to get there and it has impacted on other areas.</p> <p>  The committee did a report on the community court system, similar to the one in New York.  While we are not saying one can import another system from another jurisdiction and hope it will work, it must be amended.  Accordingly, some work has been done on this.

This would cover those committing relatively minor offences in specific offence categories, including theft, public order, minor assault, obstruction and so forth.  However, our view is that while the court might be at the centre of this initiative, the success of any community court, as has been proved worldwide, is highly dependent on the level of resources assigned to it from outside the criminal justice system.  I am sorry to keep coming back to resources.  Those community court systems deemed successful in addressing quality-of-life issues associated with offending are characterised by a high level of dedicated resources available across several supporting departments and agencies.</p><p> I would also mention that while noting the Oireachtas joint committee's suggestion that the implementation group should be chaired by a nominee of the Courts Service, we would respectfully suggest that the Courts Service may not be the best place to fulfil this role.  The reason being is that a cross-departmental agency approach is required.  We are unlikely to have the influence or muscle to ensure the level of commitment required from other Departments or agencies to bring this proposal to implementation stage.  A feature of many community courts which have been deemed successful, for example, in Melbourne and Vancouver, has been the fact the initiative has been sponsored, led and promoted by a central government department.  We have some experience of this in the drug treatment court and the commitment of other agencies is needed.  The Courts Service and the court will provide a judge and a court registrar, but for this to be successful it requires the involvement of the other support services such as the Garda, the health service, the local authority and the local community as business will have to have an input in this.  A very wide spectrum of people have to get involved in this.  We only provide a judge who will make a decision and a registrar who will draw up that order, but the work is really done by other people, not by the Courts Service.  However, we are supportive of it and there should be a report on this in a few weeks.</p></speech>

Unfortunately, I was unavoidably delayed in getting here and I did not hear the response to it.  I would appreciate if the Chairman would indulge me in allowing me to ask a question that has already been answered.  My question relates to the bricks and mortar of the Courts Service, most especially Swords and Balbriggan District Courts, which are in my constituency.  There was a time when there were questions over their viability and whether they would be sustained by the Courts Service.  I understand that has now been reviewed.  Mr. Ryan might comment on their sustainability and also the suitability of the buildings.</p></speech>

If we had the funding, we would provide an alternative court venue in north Dublin, probably in the Swords area, but we do not have the required funding.  In regard to Balbriggan District Court, it was on our venue review list to consider further, but we have not approached that subject because there is no alternative.  If a decision were made to close Balbriggan District Court, there is not an alternative venue anywhere else.  I am a northsider, I live in Portmarnock, although I am originally from Cork.</p></speech>

Most of the building programmes we have on hand are being delivered by public private partnerships and they are very much welcome.  We have the Criminal Courts of Justice, which has been a great project.  We will have seven new courthouses, and Deputy Stanton will be aware that one of those will be in Cork.  The contract for them will be signed in the next two weeks and they will be completed within two years.  They will provide 31 extra appropriate courtrooms.  The Hammond Lane site to provide for the family and child care courts in Dublin will be delivered by public private partnership.  Smaller venues like Swords District Court and other venues throughout the country require public investment of &euro;1 million, &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million.  They are capital projects.  They do not come into the public private partnership model.</p> <p>  At one stage back in 2008 we had a capital building programme of &euro;29 million.  For the past four years it has been about &euro;4.5 million and most of that goes to support our ICT.  We have to vire it across to support our IT which is totally underfunded.  If we could ring-fence money for IT and allow the &euro;4-&euro;5 million or even an increased &euro;6 million on the capital side, we could undertake projects such as the Swords District Court which are much needed, but in the short term I do not see any solution and that venue is not really fit for purpose.</p> <p>  As the Deputy will be aware, there was a proposal last year to move the business back into the city centre, which was vigorously opposed by various groups.  We did not pursue that, but our difficulty is that our hands are tied.  We have no money to improve the facilities.  Our proposal to move it into appropriate facilities in the city centre is not acceptable, so I do not know what we are going to do in the short term.</p></speech>

The building is Victorian and clearly not fit for purpose.  I would draw Mr. Ryan's attention to a proposal by Fingal County Council for the provision of a civic centre for Swords which is currently at public consultation stage.  The proposal would involve developing the car park located behind the court building, which might offer an opportunity to address the issues involved in conjunction with the council.  A civic arts facility might lend itself to some facilities being provided to the Courts Service in conjunction with the council.  I would encourage Mr. Ryan to investigate that with Mr. Reid, the council's chief executive officer.  In terms of the longevity of that building, clearly, in its current condition it has a finite existence.  Balbriggan District Court is most likely the same.  It is of similar vintage.  The two facilities are only 20 years apart in their construction dates, but Balbriggan is in a bit better condition than Swords.  I have been in both not that long ago.  I would have been one of the people who vigorously opposed the proposal to close Swords District Court in particular because of the issue of discommoding people, particularly families, and their having to go into the city centre.</p> <p>  That brings me on to my next question in regard Dolphin House.  I understand it comes within Mr. Ryan's remit.</p></speech>

It is more fit for purpose than the Swords venue.  However, it is not the solution.  I indicated that part of the Government investment strategy for the next seven years lies in the public private partnership funding which has been allocated to us to provide a purpose-built family law child care court venue with 22 courts in Hammond Lane, which is between the Four Courts and Phoenix House and is on the Luas line.  It is a big empty site in State ownership.  Funding has been provided for that.  In the meantime, as I mentioned, we intend to transfer business over the next several months to the Bridewell courts, which are located behind the Four Courts and next to Bridewell Garda station.  All the child care courts sitting in Dolphin House, which can be two or three depending on the week, will transfer over to the Bridewell.  I have allocated staffing for that and funding to develop it.  Dolphin House will then revert to being a family law centre.  This will allow us to enhance the facilities.  It will never be ideal but it will solve a problem for the next several years until the Hammond Lane site is developed.  We are making progress in this area.  What we propose will resolve the family law issues.  As I mentioned to the Chairman and the members, it is not an ideal solution for the child care courts to move there but it is the best stopgap measure we can come up with in the short term.</p></speech>

It is a sign of the good times that the traffic is so bad.  I was 35 minutes later than I thought I would be and I am sorry about that.  I was anxious to get here in time to ask Mr. Ryan a question.  I also welcome the Government's capital infrastructure investment and the plan for the Courts Service.  What process is used by the Courts Service when it undertakes a reconfiguration of courthouses or arrangements?  Mr. Ryan might have dealt with this already.</p><p>I wanted to ask the question but had not intended to be parochial.  However, given that everybody else has been, so will I.  </p><p> Is there any consultation with service users, namely, barristers and solicitors?  I ask because in County Westmeath which forms part of my constituency there is a temporary courthouse in use in St. Loman's in Mullingar and we will, I hope soon, see work being done on the courthouse.  Although we have a perfectly fine courthouse in Athlone, it has been decided that family law cases will be moved to Mullingar, while the court in Athlone will concentrate only on repossession cases.  Anybody who uses the service in Mullingar for family law cases would regard it as not fit for purpose.  There is an adequate courtroom, a hallway and a very small waiting room, but no consultation rooms.  Family law is very sensitive and delicate and it is inappropriate to have people discuss their cases in a hallway, beside a football pitch or in the solicitor's car.  The Courts Service of Ireland is moving family law cases to Mullingar from Athlone where there are five good, well used consultation rooms, yet there was no consultation with service users.</p></speech>

It is a work in progress.  There has been much consultation on the design of courthouses and courtrooms regarding segregation, where people sit and accessibility and this consultation is ongoing.  We hope the contract for the excellent project in Mullingar will be signed within two weeks.  The project will follow our brief and which the legal practitioners were involved in designing.  The Courts Service of Ireland has a standing building committee and it is their remit to ensure the views of the Bar Council of Ireland and the Law Society of Ireland which are represented on the committee on the design of court buildings are taken into account as much as possible.  Sometimes their views cannot be taken on board, given that we must take the overall view on board.</p></speech>

I only heard about the proposal to move family law cases from Athlone to Mullingar yesterday evening.  This afternoon there will be a meeting of legal practitioners about it and, perhaps, other proposals for the transaction of court business in County Westmeath generally.  I raised the same concerns as the Deputy about the proposal.  While there is an excellent facility in Mullingar to deal with ordinary, day-to-day business, there are issues about the availability of consultation rooms.  My deputy is to attend the meeting and I have asked her to ask why it is necessary to move family law cases which have been heard in Athlone for some time to Mullingar.  It may be due to pressure on space in Athlone District Court.  As the Deputy said, repossession cases are being moved to Athlone District Court, given that we are providing additional support services for distressed borrowers such as having the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, and the Insolvency Service of Ireland on site to provide advice.  The same issues arose in using the service in Mullingar.  The issue is being examined.  I share the Deputy's concerns.</p></speech>

It was a most interesting, professional, comprehensive overview and interaction.  They can see the level of interest in what they do.  Their good work is done, perhaps, below the radar.  I support Deputy Alan Farrell&rsquo;s call that we write to the Minister to seek more resources for the Courts Service of Ireland as soon as possible.  It would represent a saving.</p> <p>  Many agencies with which we interact have a dedicated Oireachtas information line or an e-mail address in order that Members with a query such as Deputy Gabrielle McFadden&rsquo;s can e-mail somebody directly and receive a comprehensive response.  The Courts Service of Ireland might consider establishing such an information line, if it would not bee too expensive, and communicating the address to Oireachtas Members.  Establishing an e-mail contact should not be too expensive and would be helpful to everybody.</p> <p>  Earlier it was noted that many people appeared in court only once in their lives, if at all.  However, the rule of law and the administration of justice are vitally important to our democracy, civilisation and way of living.  We have discussed this issue with the Bar Council of Ireland, the Law Society of Ireland and others.  It is crucial that information be disseminated among the population on how the courts work and what the procedures and people's rights are.  We could have a module taught to transition year students in order that people would understand how the system worked.</p> <p>  I again thank the delegates for coming and wish them well.  They will probably not come before this particular group of members again.  However, I suggest future justice committees have a similar engagement more often, given that it is very valuable and impressive.  I ask the delegates to pass on our thanks to their staff who have obviously gone above and beyond the call of duty in recent years.  I hope things will ease from now on.</p></speech>

I draw their attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p></speech>

I will not say very much as I will leave most of the talking to my colleagues, Dr. Mary Rogan and Ms Mary Power from FLAC and the PILA.  I am very grateful to have the opportunity to address fellow committee members in a different capacity on the research project in which Dr. Rogan, Ms Power and I have been involved in the past year.  Dr. Rogan will describe the project in detail.  It is entitled, Changing Ireland, Changing Law, and looks at public interest litigation and the way in which legal cases have achieved social change in Ireland.  This is the final stage of the process.  </p> <p>  We were very privileged to have a range of speakers at the seminars we ran.  We heard from litigants who had taken cases and from lawyers and academic experts.  One of the litigants from whom we heard was Dr. Micheline Sheehy-Skeffington, who is in the Visitors Gallery.  She spoke to us earlier this year about her experience in suing NUI Galway over gender discrimination in promotion.  Professor Mark Bell from Trinity College Dublin is also in the Visitors Gallery.  He spoke to us about the use of public interest litigation in furthering LGBT rights.  I also acknowledge Ms Noeline Blackwell, director of FLAC, who is also present.  The PILA, the public interest law alliance of FLAC, was our lead partner in the research project which we considered would be of particular interest to Oireachtas Members, particularly to members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, because we were looking at the question of access to justice and how we could support and strengthen public interest litigation to ensure litigants in cases who were seeking to achieve social change would be supported.</p> <p>  Dr. Rogan is head of law at the Dublin Institute of Technology and will speak in a little more detail about the project.</p></speech>

We had three key objectives, the first of which was to explore the connections between the law and social change and to examine the ways in which the law had not kept up with the pace of social change in Ireland and where it had been used as a tool of social reform.  In that spirit, our second key objective was to examine a number of key public interest cases, cases which had been taken in the public interest or which were of major social importance, and to explore the stories behind them.  We wanted to hear the personal stories behind them from the litigants involved and the lawyers and academic commentators who gave us a broader perspective on the relationship between the law and social change.  As Senator Ivana Bacik said, access to justice was our key theme.  By exploring these stories we wanted to examine the barriers which people faced when trying to vindicate their rights by engaging with public bodies and decision-making processes and the barriers and hurdles they faced when they had to take legal action.  Our third key objective concerned NGOs, which have contributed so much to social and legal reform in Ireland.  We wanted to hear from them about the strategies and tactics they had employed to create and support legal reform and advocacy for change in Ireland and abroad.  We partnered with them to hear about their experiences of engaging in social and legal reform in Ireland. </p> <p>  I will say a little about the structure of the project.  We were funded primarily by the Irish Research Council, with additional contributions from Trinity College Dublin.  I commend the Irish Research Council for providing this funding stream, called "engaging civic society", which allows academics to partner with non-governmental organisations to carry out a piece of research or engage in public awareness work.  It is a valuable mechanism whereby academics, practitioners and policy makers can bring their work together to bring research to a policy-making audience.  It is in that spirit that we are before the committee.  We also partnered with the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, and the Immigrant Council of Ireland, as well as the National Women's Council of Ireland.  </p> <p>  We held four seminars which addressed the connections between the law and social change in these key areas.  A number of findings and themes have emerged from our work and we have provided a briefing paper which has been circulated.  I draw members' attention to a number of the key themes that have emerged thus far.  The first is the importance of NGOs to Irish society and our democracy.  This is a particularly pressing issue in the light of the ever-challenging funding environment for NGOs and the particularly challenging funding environment in which non-governmental and voluntary organisations find themselves with the planned and well flagged winding down of many philanthropic bodies.  The importance of the activity of NGOs in raising awareness of issues which require legal reform and social change cannot be underestimated.  Litigation may be a part of their activity, but they engage in many other strategies to support social reform and a well functioning society.  This focuses attention on the importance of adequate funding for the NGO and voluntary sector.  </p> <p>  The second key theme to emerge from our discussions is the question of how individuals navigate State bodies.  When an individual is faced with a decision of a public body or an administrative organisation, a lot of barriers can be placed in his or her way as he or she tries to challenge or address that decision.</p><p>I am sure all of those present are very familiar with these types of instances.</p><p> A key factor identified throughout the seminars was the lack of reasons given by public decision-making bodies for their decisions.  This can be very challenging for the individuals affected by the decision.  They do not know what must be amended in their behaviour to reapply.  They may not be aware of the precise basis of the difficulty which had been put forward.  They may be unsure of the way forward and unable to rectify the matters which gave rise to the negative decision.  Delay is often a difficulty in these administrative decision-making processes.</p><p> A strong theme in all of the seminars was the intimidating hurdles faced by people who choose to litigate or who are forced to litigate to vindicate their rights.  They are often vulnerable individuals because of the circumstances giving rise to the need to litigate, and they have very limited provision for civil legal aid.  Added to this is the very real prospect of being sued for costs.  The financial indications of a case can have a significant effect on preventing people from taking litigation to vindicate their rights.  Delay is often a factor, with many cases taking a very long time.  Other issues which can be a significant barrier to people seeking to vindicate their rights are the publicity which may be attracted by the case, the fact the process can be difficult to understand and the cumbersome nature of our legal process.  We felt it was important to recognise the courage of the litigants who told their stories at our seminars.</p><p> Another theme that emerged was the question of whether alternatives to litigation can be developed to vindicate rights.  The legal process is a high-stakes business, and the implications for the individual are severe.  The question of costs can be a huge factor influencing a person not to pursue something which is very important to him or her.  This means the legal process may not be the most appropriate mechanism for the vindication of rights in many instances.  We feel that rights-proofing policy and regulatory impact assessments are critical mechanisms at the preventative level for supporting the vindication of rights.  We also feel the country's appearances before international human rights bodies have an important role to play in learning and promoting best practice.  Other mechanisms, such as mediation and alternative legal processes, should be examined, particularly in the areas of administrative decision-making where bringing a matter to the High Court may not be the most efficient form of recourse nor the most effective.</p><p> A further key issue we identified was the lack of a class action procedure in Ireland, which gives rise to the difficulty of not having a legal process by which one can create systemic or systematic change.  Ms Power from the Public Interest Law Alliance, PILA, has a number of particular and precise recommendations we wish to bring to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.567" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rachel Power" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015112500002#BB00200"><p>I thank the committee for having us before it today.  Public interest law is not something that necessarily gets much attention in public discourse, but it is at the core of our work as we promote a healthy environment for public interest law to develop in Ireland.  When we speak about public interest law we are not specifically speaking about going to the courts as for us it is much broader than this; it is about allowing vulnerable groups input to various processes which affect their lives, such as the legislative process.  Sometimes litigation is the only way possible and the only course of action.  This is what happened for many of the litigants who spoke at the Changing Ireland, Changing Law seminar.  It was the last and only way to vindicate their rights.  Speaking to us at the seminar were seven litigants from six cases over 40 years, and the people who spoke were all very different types of litigants.  Some very much wished to highlight an issue and some were at crisis point, but none of them took the decision lightly.  For all of them it was last course of action upon which they wanted to embark.<br/><br/>For FLAC and PILA, the starkest reality was the delay in most of the cases.  One might think this is nothing new for the justice system, but the delays involved in these cases are quite striking.  Dr. Lydia Foy pursued her case for a new birth certificate for more than 20 years.  It took Senator David Norris 14 years to see the decriminalisation of homosexuality.  It took almost ten years for Gandhi Mallak to get his citizenship, and he has still not been given the reason he was refused naturalisation.  This is a very long and painful process for people who must put their lives on hold.<br/><br/>We have delays in our justice system but we also have new processes and new ways to dealing with these delays, such as the commercial court system, which has proved very effective and efficient in speeding up the determination of cases.  Why is this fast-track litigation only available when it comes to business?  The most resources are put into the commercial law list.  Why are similar resources not put into other lists, particularly lists that can contribute so much to the public interest jurisprudence of the State?<br/><br/>We spoke much of the Legal Services Regulation Bill, which was up for discussion this week and last week.  Nothing in the Bill deals with the latent inefficiencies of our system, and something which FLAC has raised over again is that the system across the board must put money and energy into coping with this day in day out.  FLAC has advocated on this issue, and at this point we suggest the review period in the Bill should be used to assess whether the new legislation actually assists and facilitates access to justice through the timely and efficient administration of justice.  If it does not, it is time that resources are put into making improvements in the system.<br/><br/>The court system itself is part of the delay.  Another part is the efficient and effective implementation of judgments.  The case of Dr. Lydia Foy was taken by FLAC and although Dr. Foy won her High Court case in 2007 it was not until this year, eight years later, that the relevant legislation was introduced in the country.  During these eight years Dr. Foy had to continue to campaign and use her energy to fight for her rights, FLAC had to resource the fight to bring the legislation into being and the rights of the trans community in Ireland continued to be undermined.  The European Convention on Human Rights Act, under which the case was brought, was also seriously undermined.  This is the mechanism which protects those rights not protected under the Irish Constitution.  These are not acceptable delays when comes to the vindication of rights and they are not acceptable frustrations to change.<br/><br/>As Dr. Rogan mentioned, costs are unquestionably the single biggest barrier to public interest litigation.  When we speak about costs in terms of public interest law we are not speaking about the costs of our litigant taking the case, because quite often these cases are taken <i>pro bono</i>or on a no foal no fee basis.  We are speaking about the financial roulette that arises should a case be lost and an adverse costs order is made against the client.  This can quite legitimately bankrupt somebody if it is of sufficient size.  The very nature of public interest litigation is that it is unpredictable because it occurs in areas where the law is uncertain and needs clarification.  This means we can be certain a case will win in very few circumstances, therefore, the chance and risk a public interest litigant takes in deciding to take a case is very huge.  When it comes to public interest litigation, the Government is usually on the other side as it is usually the defendant.  When one weighs the significant resources of the State with the resources of many of our public interest litigants it is frightening how easy it is to chill an individual out of taking a case.<br/><br/>There are various ways in which certainty as to costs is possible.  One of them is a protective costs order, which can be seen in other jurisdictions.  This is where an order as to costs is made at the outset of the litigation, providing certainty at the beginning so a plaintiff knows exactly what the risk is.  There is no provision for this so far in the Irish State.  FLAC advocated for its inclusion in the Legal Services Regulation Bill, but unfortunately this was another missed opportunity.</p><p>I will close on some thoughts that came from practitioners on taking public interest litigation cases.  Test cases and public interest litigation are specifically excluded from civil legal aid in this country, so a vast majority of cases are taken by very small firms and some are taken by independent law centres, such as FLAC.  What came across during the Changing Ireland, Changing Law series was the very real pressures in taking those cases because they are large cases that can be all-consuming for some small practices.  It is a very real issue that lawyers do not take cases simply because they have to earn a living elsewhere.  There are cases that lawyers want to take, as they want to challenge injustices that are present, but the cases are not being taken.  Much work must be done in civil legal aid across the board but if the ban on civil legal aid taking test cases was removed and the Legal Aid Board was allowed perhaps to contract out this kind of work to NGOs and to other firms, it would create a much more welcoming environment for those cases.</p></speech>

Reference was made to new ways of dealing with cases.  Mention was made of Dr. Lydia Foy, who happens to come from my home town originally.  My family know her well.  What other way could her case have been dealt with in terms of the new approaches?  I understand the point made about access to justice and a last course of action for many.  If someone takes a case, then he or she really feels very strongly that there has been an injustice against him or her.  He or she would not take such an approach lightly.  I agree that most money is pumped into commercial law, which is not right.  What other way could Dr. Foy&rsquo;s case have been dealt with to have avoided it taking eight years?</p></speech>

That continued for about two years or more while the State was pursuing an appeal because it did not take responsibility for the breach of the European Convention of Human Rights.  It took much lobbying and campaigning on behalf of FLAC for the State to drop the case.</p> <p>  I refer to the High Court judgment itself.  Judge McKechnie expressed much frustration in the 2007 judgment that nothing had been done by the State in the previous five years because there had been a European Court of Human Rights decision against the UK on the very same point, with almost identical legislation.  The State had five years to do something and it chose not to.  Again, Judge McKechnie was emphatic in his judgment in saying that he hoped the State would follow the UK in implementing the change quickly but that did not happen.  Successive Governments, right up to 2015, promised change but it did not happen.  There are many opinions as to what the issues were, namely, various conservative legal or medical opinions on the issues, bureaucracy or the fact the issue was not urgent for the Government of the day.  I do not know if that is a question we can necessarily answer because that was the decision of the State over those eight years.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked what the alternative might have been in the Foy case.  Perhaps when a case such as that one comes onto somebody&rsquo;s desk, it could be viewed as an opportunity for learning and looking at what other places are doing and seeing whether we could respond to it in a different way rather than throwing defensive legal resources at it.</p> <p>  In the case of rights proofing and regulatory impact analysis, that is really about when legislation is being proposed, that allied to that there would be some sort of analysis or assessment done where human rights might be impacted.  One can think of a whole variety of areas in which this would be relevant.  The Legal Services Bill might be one of them.  Other obvious areas could include prison conditions or penal reform, which is my area of interest.  If one makes a change to legislation, tied to that, one would have an assessment done, perhaps by the Department of Justice and Equality or elsewhere, which would set out the implications for human rights of the particular legislation.  The analysis would be quite specific, not just a broad based view of what human rights entails but now it would affect individual rights.  It would be done as part of a pre-legislative scrutiny kind of process.</p></speech>

Senator Bacik could have avoided being present because she is totally on top of her brief in this regard.</p> <p>  In the context of pre-legislative scrutiny of Bills in terms of human rights, I believe it should be proofed on a range of different angles.  The more it is proofed, the better the legislation is.  Could the witnesses point to international best practice in this area or does Parliament, as is the case in this country, end up proofing legislation from a human rights perspective or any other perspective?</p> <p>  Reference was made to the importance of NGOs.  I agree they play a critical role.  Is it the contention of the witnesses that the Government does not have the type of engagement with NGOs it should have in the pre-legislative scrutiny period or at any stage?  Do they believe NGOs need to streamline in the way organisations under the ambit of the public service have done, for example, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission coming together?  I think the two agencies were a perfect fit.  I contend that there are probably too many NGOs.  Should NGOs form synergies and come together in order to be much more influential and effective?</p></speech>

He has asked some really challenging questions.  In respect of the issue of human rights proofing and who might do that, I would not advocate any new elaborate structure by which that would have to be carried out.  It could very much be done at departmental level, with the assistance of academics, lawyers and NGO partners, to examine legislation rather than creating any new formalised structure.  Something we mentioned previously is the notion of a human rights committee within the Oireachtas, which I accept has the critical role for proofing pieces of legislation.  What is at issue is the capacity by which that can be done.  Perhaps that relates to the second point about engagement with NGOs.  The more there is engagement and consultation with the academic world and NGOs, the better as those are the kind of things which will provide the best approach to support human rights proofing of legislation.  That could be done on an informal level rather than having a big elaborate structure around it.</p> <p>  I will not say whether I think there should be fewer NGOs because I am sure many people will have very strong views on the matter.  As somebody who is involved in the NGO sector as well as in the academic world, it is critical the consultation processes are perhaps more formalised.  There are some really good examples where NGOs are brought into discussions at the earliest stages and that is when one airs the issues and prevents problems at a later point.</p> <p>  Senator Conway asked whether there are perhaps too many NGOs.  This is not quite the same point but what I would like to state is that the question of professionalised NGOs is really important, and that is about funding.  This is becoming a really critical issue in this country with the departure of many of the philanthropic bodies or a reduction in the level of funding which they can provide.  A professionalised NGO sector is essential.  I am not sure whether that is about a multiplicity of NGOs but the critical issue is that it is professionalised with full-time, salaried people who are working in NGOs who can support Government and policy reform.</p></speech>

In the disability sector, there are 400 or 500 advocacy organisations.  There was a value-for-money audit done on all of those by a gentleman whose name escapes me and it recommended a certain streamlining where organisations were doubling up.  Dr. Rogan's approach, in terms of professionalising, would force amalgamation and synergies.  Let us see what happens.</p></speech>

Over ten years ago the Law Reform Commission completed an extensive study on it, weighing up all of its various advantages and disadvantages and coming to the conclusion that it would be beneficial in Ireland and would very much benefit access to justice by permitting more people with fewer resources to vindicate their rights in various ways.</p> <p>  There is not an official line as to why we do not have class actions.  It is just not something that is built into the court rules at present.  FLAC advocated, in terms of the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, that there was potential to include this as a mechanism.</p> <p>  It is something that works in different ways around the world, be it as an opt-in or opt-out option.  There has been little movement on it and little appetite for it.</p> <p>  It would not involve much change to introduce and implement.  It would merely involve a change to the legislation.  It is not something that we have had much luck with people wanting to see a change in because people believe that it will open the floodgates in some way.  We say it would not open the floodgates in any way.  It would merely allow people who have rights who cannot exercise them to be given a position.</p></speech>

I am aware that a lot of them are under pressure to do so but we are grateful for the fact that they did because we made lots of changes to law, we had very good debates and it fed into the system, in particular, in the pre-legislative scrutiny.

The issue is topical.  I will try to be as open as I can, but we need to get through the Supplementary Estimate first.  It is largely a budgetary and technical measure and I will answer questions members may have.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to present for its consideration the 2015 Supplementary Estimate for Vote 35 - Army pensions.  In the 2015 Estimate a sum of &euro;215.6 million for Army pensions was provided.  However, the net outturn this year is expected to be &euro;222.1 million, leaving a shortfall of &euro;6.5 million.  The Supplementary Estimate will be met by an appropriate saving in the defence Vote and, as a result, there will be no extra demand on the Exchequer over what was initially voted for the overall defence Vote group in 2015.  The required savings can be met without a detrimental impact on defence programmes.</p> <p>  Expenditure under the Army pensions Vote is provided for under a single programme entitled, Provision for Defence Forces Pensions Benefits.  The Vote includes a provision for retired pay, pensions, allowances and gratuities payable to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces.  The number of Defence Forces pensioners has continued to increase in the past year and currently stands at some 12,100 across all categories which is significantly more than the number of personnel in the Defence Forces.</p> <p>  Subhead A2 is the largest subhead in the Vote and covers expenditure on all superannuation benefits for former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.  It accounts for more than 95% of all military pensions expenditure, including gratuities, and is essentially demand driven and non-discretionary.  The original provision of some &euro;211.4 million for the subhead will be inadequate to meet all requirements in the year.  The shortfall is estimated to be &euro;7.2 million.  The principal reasons for the shortfall are the continued underlying increase in the number of retirement pensioners being paid from the Vote and the ongoing impact on pension payments of the high number of retirements on pension in recent years.  In this regard, Defence Forces' pension requirements more than doubled annually in the five years to 2012, reflective of public service trends generally.  In addition, many retirees continue to be in the long service category and are, therefore, entitled to maximum retirement benefits, which contributes to the increased costs.  A further factor is increased longevity in the population generally.  At the end of 2014 there were 11,536 retired pensioners, that is, retired members and dependants of deceased members.  The current corresponding number is 11,612.  By the end of 2015 it is expected that some 300 military personnel will have retired on pension over the course of the year.</p> <p>  Overall, the provision in subhead A2 will not be sufficient to meet projected costs.  The overall supplementary requirement will be offset by expected savings of &euro;710,000 in the non-superannuation subheads A3 to A6, inclusive.  When all issues are taken into account, the shortfall in the Army pensions Vote is &euro;6.5 million.  Therefore, the intention of the Supplementary Estimate is to fund the shortfall of &euro;7.21 million in subhead A2 by seeking additional funding of &euro;6.5 million and reallocating savings of &euro;710,000 in subheads A3 to A6, inclusive, to subhead A2.</p> <p>  While recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force is not provided for in the Army pensions Vote, members may wish to be aware of what is being done to fill positions left vacant through retirements and discharges.  As I have told the committee previously, the Government will seek to maintain its existing policy of regular, ongoing recruitment within approved strength levels.  As indicated in the White Paper, this brings in the new blood that a dynamic, modern, professional military force needs if it is to meet its obligations.  This, in turn, helps to maintain the age profile of personnel as close as possible to the appropriate levels for all ranks.  The average age of serving Permanent Defence Force members is 36 years across all ranks, while almost 70% of personnel are under the age of 40 years.</p> <p>  I am pleased to say overall recruitment levels this year have kept pace with those of the previous two years and are in line with the Government's objective of maintaining the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, which was reaffirmed in the White Paper.  A targeted recruitment campaign this year has seen the enlistment of 239 recruits, 49 cadets, 25 aircraft apprentices, five Naval Service mechanics and 19 instrumentalists for the military band, making a total of 336.  It is envisaged that, with further general service recruitment, there will be an intake of more than 400 new personnel by the end of the year.  In terms of ongoing manpower planning, a fresh recruitment campaign for general service recruits for the Permanent Defence Force was launched in August.  The induction of successful candidates from this competition is expected to commence in early 2016.</p> <p>  I thank all retired military veterans for their valued public service during the years.  I also reiterate that, as indicated in the White Paper, the Department and the Defence Forces will continue to work together to develop further in coming years the various supports available to existing personnel and veterans.</p> <p>  I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the committee and will be pleased to take questions.  If members wish to sum up this measure, the amount in question represents 1% of the overall defence Vote and just under 3% of the pensions Vote which has been underestimated and needs to be corrected.  That is what we are trying to do.  The percentages are relatively small, but &euro;6.5 million is still a considerable amount of money and we need to go through the appropriate process to ensure it can be provided.</p></speech>

Equally I am sure everybody in the Houses will support the allocation of additional moneys to meet the pensions demand.  It is a statutory requirement, but, in addition, we want to see Defence Forces pensioners being properly looked after. </p><p> The fact that we engaged in a similar exercise in 2013 and 2014 raises questions about how the Department of Defence conducts its business in respect of its annual Estimate.  The Minister has indicated that for the third year in succession the number retiring from the Defence Forces has been underestimated.  Will the explain the reason for this to us?  We like to think the Estimates process has integrity and stands up to scrutiny.  Sadly, we have seen the Department of Health come forward with bogus Estimates for several years.  I am not suggesting that is happening in this instance, but there are questions about why it is happening again.  The moneys are not enormous in the context of overall Government spending and, as the Minister has pointed out, represent 1% of defence spending, but measured against the background of the country&rsquo;s spending far less on defence than many of our European colleagues the amount is quite significant.  I can read and understand what the Department is doing in reallocating expenditure in subheads A3 to A6, inclusive, but from where is the &euro;6.5 million in subhead A2 coming?  What are the initiatives that might have been undertaken that are not being undertaken?</p></speech>

One of the problems in calculating an accurate figure for pensions is that it has been very difficult to secure increases in the pension budget at all from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform because it holds a very tight rein and has needed to do so.  We have to try to estimate how many will leave the Defence Forces each year.  People can leave at a time of their choosing and it takes several months to replace them.  If somebody leaves in January, it will be at least June before he or she is replaced.  There are savings because if someone earning &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000 leaves the Defence Forces, the replacement will probably earn significantly less, but there is a pension cost for the person who leaves.  We could have one Vote to include pension and all other defence expenditure.  I do not think, however, that that would be a good idea because we should try to have pensions as a separate line of expenditure in a separate Estimate.  In most other Departments there would be a pay and pensions balance.  We have a correction.  Technically that is not happening because there is an Estimate, but the saving in one Vote can be used to cover slightly increased expenditure in another.</p> <p>  The management of staffing and numbers in the Defence Forces in the past few years has been quite difficult, particularly in the past 12 months where there were real opportunities for Defence Force personnel in the private sector and experts and specialists being headhunted.  They leave because they can earn more in the private sector.  We are reflecting on that issue to try to keep people who are valuable to the Defence Forces.  We need them.  The Deputy and others have raised some of these issues, but we had to calculate the likely Estimate figure.  There was a realisation that it would always be tight on the pensions side and we are doing this year what we did last year.  It is a similar sum of money, but in percentage terms, it is a relatively small adjustment.</p></speech>

It is very hard to plan defence expenditure on an annual basis because in terms of much of the equipment used multi-annual planning is involved.  We have just spent most of the &euro;199 million for a ship replacement programme which involves three vessels, the third of which will arrive next summer.  It is almost a five year plan.  At times there is a carryover from year to year.  In terms of savings in recruitment made because of the delay between retirements and recruitment, they can facilitate the provision of the extra money needed in the pensions Vote.  We are fully funded to continue recruitment to increase the number to 9,500.  The figure stands at just over 9,200.  The White Paper on Defence is quite clear that we want 9,500 to be the base figure, not a target figure.  We are fully funded to try to make that happen next year.  As I understand it, the 21 year rule will not make a huge difference to our numbers.  It has been factored in.</p></speech>

It is stating the last reorganisation of the Defence Forces in 2012 and 2013 continues to place very significant demands on association members.  Has the Minister engaged with it to discuss these concerns?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.607" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015112500002#B00800"><p>I attended the RACO conference in recent weeks.  Of course, we will listen to it, just as we listen to the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA.  My job is to make sure we have a clear funding and policy platform for the Defence Forces because they have a complex job to do, particularly now.  The nature of defence and threats to Irish interests and people has changed and continues to change.  The Defence Forces are the last line of defence on which we rely.  I do not want to over-emphasise it, but it is true.  Sometimes in Ireland there is a view that nobody has an issue with us as a neutral country and that we do not need to invest in defence, White Papers and planning, but nothing could be further from the truth.</p><p>That is not to say, however, that we face significant threats, but we do need to prepare, plan and design strategies to ensure we have capacity.  There are challenges in that regard and one of the big ones is that there is talent within the Defence Forces which many private sector companies would like to have and to whom they can offer higher pay packages than we can offer.  People join the Defence Forces for different reasons and it is not just about money.  I listened to what RACO had to state.  We have active recruitment and training programmes in some specialist areas such as ordnance, whereby we have a number in training to ensure we keep numbers at the level necessary for what we need.  I do not want to go into exact numbers because, for operational reasons, it would not be appropriate to do so, but in 2015 to date a total of 174 officers have been promoted.  There were some 1,148 serving at the end of October, 15% of whom have seen promotions, but personnel have also left the force.  I do not want to pretend, therefore, that it is a rosy scenario with no problems.  We need to ensure a career in the Defence Forces, as an officer or in the ranks, is exciting and attracts the right kind of people.  Part of the challenge in recruitment is attracting enough people of high enough quality .  Money is not the big problem.</p></speech>

We are not focusing on policy but following the money.  We are discussing where the money is being spent and why it is being moved from one area to another.  We will be following it every year from now on.  We can have a meeting about policy later, but for now I want to know how many fewer payments were made to achieve a saving of &euro;77,000 in subhead A4 - payments to the spouses of deceased members from the War of Independence.  Is it because the people concerned are no longer with us or is it because the amount was overestimated?</p></speech>

A total of 65 officers have left so far this year.  Last year the figure was 82; in 2013 it was 60; in 2012 it was 70, while nin 2011 it was 72.  A total of 414 enlisted personnel have left so far this year.  Last year the figure was 393; it was 400 the year before, 725 the year before that and 600 the year before that.  Members will see what the turnover is in terms of numbers.  We need to replace them as quickly as we can.  There is a gap between the two, but we need to get the right type of people who will have to reach the necessary benchmarks in fitness tests and so on.  Our recruitment campaign is quite successful and will continue to be.  We have 92 cadets in training, a very high figure relative to the numbers in recent years.  New leaders are being developed in the Defence Forces, as necessary.</p></speech>

A lot of personnel retired and we could go into all sorts of reason that was the case, but we now see a different motivation for retiring.  The private sector is really starting to take off which means that there is competition for talent and people are being headhunted.  It is not just about numbers, it is also about rank and longevity.  Depending on the numbers, the pension to which they are entitled or the package they will receive when they leave will be higher or lower.  We have got the Estimate figure wrong by 3% and need to try to correct it.  It is not as good as I would like it to be, but it is not 1 million miles out either.</p></speech>

As indicated previously to the committee, the ongoing funding of Vote 35 will remain a considerable challenge in future years.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is aware of the position, but there are particular difficulties unique to the Defence Forces in predicting retirement and turnover patterns which can contribute to greater than expected expenditure in a given year.  This is due, among other things, to the early payment of pension benefits immediately on retirement after relatively short periods of service, regardless of age, and the fact that the timing of a person's departure is largely of his or her own personal choice.  For example, in the run-up to 29 February 2012, for every one NCO or private who retired with a pension on age grounds, 22 left voluntarily with pension benefits.  The Defence Forces are quite different from other areas because when one retires, almost regardless of age, one accesses a pension.  There are a huge number who leave before they are due to retire, for whatever reason.  It is, therefore, more difficult to predict.  As a career in the Defence Forces is tough, one can understand why that happens.</p></speech>

However, as there has been a repeated overrun in the past few years, do other components of the Defence Forces lose out?  The Department seems to be able to find the money to close the gap, but will there be an underfunding of other areas?  Is it overextending budgets in other areas?  How does it make the sums add up every year and what is the impact on other areas of the Defence Forces?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.624" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015112500002#D00100"><p>As I outlined in my opening statement, even with additional expenditure on military pensions, the overall group allocation - that is, the two Votes taken together - will not be exceeded in 2015, as there have been savings under Vote 36.  The straight answer to the Deputy's question is "No."  Essentially, we are funding the extra that we need.  We could talk about the formalities of the Estimate where savings are made, but, essentially, nothing in terms of equipment and capital expenditure will be impacted by this.  This is really about funding a slight shortfall in pensions with the money that is saved as a result of the time differential in terms of recruiting to fill the positions of people who are leaving.  I would like to see our pension Vote increase slightly, but we need to negotiate that at budget time with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I would like our pension Vote to be slightly higher than it is, but I think we did very well in the budget process this year and I think we have to take our overall Vote in terms of both Estimates in the round, which is what we are trying to do.</p></speech>

We have a list here of the number of personnel that retired and the number recruited from 2008 to present.  The discrepancy between the two peaked in 2009 and 2010.  For example, in 2009, 499 retired and 47 were recruited; in 2010, 522 retired and 145 were recruited.  The peak of retirements was in 2012, when 793 retired, which was a very large number, and 632 were recruited.  From glancing at those figures, I estimate that there is a gap of approximately 1,000.  What are the Minister's plans to address the shortfall in the Defence Forces caused by that period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.626" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015112500002#D00300"><p>People will remember that period for all the wrong reasons because there was an effective recruitment ban right across the public sector in an effort to save money.  That was not applied to the Defence Forces as rigidly as it was applied elsewhere, because we were allowed to recruit essential staff in terms of skill sets and so on, but it was still a real limitation.  If one looks at more recent years, particularly 2013 and 2014, one will see significantly more people being recruited than in 2009 and 2010.  My ambition is to get numbers in the Defence Forces up to a minimum of 9,500, as opposed to making that a target to be reached.  We are at about 9,200 at the moment and there is a recruitment campaign which will push that figure up to close to 9,500.  Over the next year or so, I would like to get that figure up to 9,500, to go above it slightly and then come back down, but to hover on that figure.  That is difficult to manage, as people leave in numbers that are hard to predict.  We are more than justified in ensuring that we are funding, managing and recruiting to have a floating figure of 9,500, as opposed to having that as a target at the end of the year.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the work that the members of our Defence Forces do on behalf of the citizens of this country, particularly overseas.  The Minister has answered the question I was going to ask.  He said that a significant number of people have left or are leaving the Defence Forces.  Is there a mandatory retirement age?  How are the pensions calculated, for example, if somebody joined the Defence Forces at the age of 18 and then left ten or 15 years later?  The Minister mentioned that when somebody leaves the Defence Forces, they get their pension straight away and it does not matter what age they are, which I think is very unusual.  Will the Minister confirm whether the pension is paid as soon as they leave and that they do not have to wait until they are 60 or 65, as most people have to?  It is certainly an incentive for people to join the Defence Forces if they know they will get a pension as soon as they leave.  Is there a mandatory retirement age?</p></speech>

There are minimum service periods before one gets a pension, but they are quite complicated.  The mandatory retirement age also depends on rank and when one entered the Defence Forces.  If it would be helpful, we could send quite a detailed note to the committee on minimum service age, how one qualifies for a pension and what ranks qualify for what, because we could probably spend quite a long time talking about it now.  It is unique to the Defence Forces.  There was a new agreement in 2013 on that.  It might be helpful for us to send an information note on all of those issues.  I thank Deputy Ferris for her comments on the role of the Defence Forces abroad.  They are appreciated.</p></speech>

The committee will remember that we had a debate on the 21-year soldier issue.  That was an example of how complex the mandatory retirement age or period served is.  There are issues on fitness tests - when one moves into a certain category, the fitness level and test changes.  It is not as simple as saying it is the age of 50, 55, 60 or 65.  It is a much more complex set of rules on mandatory retirement, but I will send the detail on that.  I am not trying to evade the question.</p></speech>

Does the Minister have any idea of the average age?  He listed a number of people who have retired in the last year.  I know the people who retired held different ranks - they were officers and other members - but what was their average age?</p></speech>

I am being told that the average retirement age is between 40 and 60.  That is a pretty wide margin.  I do not want to give the committee an incorrect figure, so we will send the figure to the committee.</p></speech>

The big problem here is competition for talent.  The numbers leaving the Defence Forces are in one way a compliment to the standards in the Defence Forces in terms of levels of training.  Some people may try to spin that and say that people are leaving because they are unhappy in the Defence Forces.  One could also say that people are leaving because they are being offered very attractive terms, conditions and pay packets in the private sector, because they are highly sought after.  With all of these things, it is a mixture of lots of things.</p></speech>

Subhead A4 shows that there has been a decrease of &euro;77,000 in payments to spouses of deceased veterans of the War of Independence.  Can the Minister tell us how many of these payments were envisaged at the start of the year and how many we ended up with in order to make that saving?</p></speech>

I apologise to the Minister for being late.  I was speaking in the D&aacute;il.  He mentioned the numbers of people joining the Defence Forces.  My impression, which may be wrong, is that there is a huge waiting list of young men and women who want to join the Irish Army.</p></speech>

There may be lots of people who want to join but that does not mean that they meet the standards.</p><p>For example, we have a really active recruitment effort to recruit more women to the Defence Forces.  Only 6.2% of the Defence Forces are women.  That is not acceptable to me in a modern defence force infrastructure and with many of the things we want to do under the White Paper.  We need far more gender balance in the Defence Forces.  There are clear challenges.  It just so happens there have been real challenges in terms of fitness tests and so on for women who are looking to join the Defence Forces.  We need to look at how we deal with that without reducing standards and so on.  The current figure is 558 women in the Defence Forces but I want to see this figure doubled.  There are people who want to join the Defence Forces but the Deputy would be surprised in that something like one in three people who get called for interview do not even turn up.</p></speech>

Could the Minister give us a breakdown on where this came from?  He told us there were five fewer payouts at &euro;4,200 each, which does not equate to &euro;77,000.  Are some of them getting more than others?</p></speech>

The actual figure is about 90 from 97, so it is seven fewer, not five.  This is about widows of deceased military service pensioners.  It is also about widows of special allowance holders and widows of service medal holders, so depending on what category one is in, one gets a different payment.</p></speech>

I am pleased to report to the committee on Irish Defence Forces' participation in United Nations missions in 2014.  The report for 2014 was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 29 June 2015.  The following motion was been placed on the Order Paper for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann:</p><blockquote>That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the report by the Minister for Defence regarding service by the Defence Forces with the United Nations in 2014, copies of which were laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 29th June, 2015, in accordance with section 13 of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006.</blockquote> <p>In commending the motion, I will shortly outline some of the key aspects of Ireland's involvement with the UN over the past couple of years.  A central tenet of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations.  In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security.  Ireland reaffirmed this commitment in the Government's recent White Paper on Defence.  The White Paper on Defence, which was published in August 2015, sets out the policy framework for the defence organisation for the next ten years and beyond.</p><p>Ireland's commitment to the United Nations has found expression in its long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations.  Ireland has participated continuously in UN peacekeeping operations since 1958, a service which has comprised more than 64,000 individual tours of duty.  No other country in the world has had a longer service.  Participation in overseas peacekeeping missions is a key element of Ireland's foreign policy and has been an important dimension in meeting Ireland's international obligations as a member of the UN and the EU.  Irish foreign policy is directed at supporting co-operative arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, especially the UN.  This has included supporting effective international action in areas such as disarmament, peacekeeping, development and human rights.  This approach continues to define Irish priorities within the UN system.  Notwithstanding our current economic difficulties, Ireland continues to willingly play a full role in contributing to the security of Europe and the world, providing professional peacekeepers to a range of complex missions throughout the world.</p><p>During 2014, the Defence Forces continued to make a major contribution to international peacekeeping through their participation in UN-led and UN-authorised missions.  Personnel were deployed on 14 different missions throughout the world in Africa, Europe and the Middle East.As of 1 November 2015, Ireland is contributing 489 Defence Forces personnel to 12 missions throughout the world.  </p><p>In November 2014, in response to a request by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade under the emergency civilian assistance team, ECAT, initiative to assist in Ireland's response to the Ebola crisis in west Africa, a team of three members of the Permanent Defence Forces were deployed to the Embassy of Ireland in Sierra Leone to enhance the embassy's ability to respond to the crisis.  The Defence Forces team completed its service in the embassy in June 2015.  Five Defence Forces personnel were also deployed to Sierra Leone in January 2015 where they served as part of a UK-led joint inter-agency task force tackling Ebola in west Africa.  The Defence Forces completed their service with that mission on 15 September 2015.  </p><p>Ireland's main commitments during 2014 were to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights.  Last December, I had the honour of visiting the 47th infantry group, which was serving with UNIFIL at that time.  That visit afforded me the opportunity to see at first hand what the situation facing our troops was like in south Lebanon.  I may go out again in a few weeks' time.  The UNIFIL mission continues to represent Ireland's largest overseas deployment.  Throughout 2014, a contingent comprising approximately 199 Defence Forces personnel was deployed to the UNIFIL mission.  The Defence Forces serve as part of a joint Finnish-Irish battalion which is based in Sector West of UNIFIL's area of operations and is currently under Finnish command.  It will come under Irish command next year.</p><p> Partnership with other like-minded states has become an increasing element of our overseas peacekeeping operations.  The participation of both Finland and Ireland in the UNIFIL mission is but one example that demonstrates our joint contribution to international peace and security.  In the absence of partners such as Finland, the range and nature of overseas operations which Ireland could undertake in support of international peace and security would be notably curtailed.  Such joint deployments further support interoperability, build experience, significantly contribute to the range and nature of operations we can undertake in support of the United Nations and further deepen the excellent bilateral relationship between our countries.  The United Nations Security Council, when extending the mandate of UNIFIL on 24 August, reaffirmed its determination to ensure no acts of intimidation would prevent UNIFIL from performing its mandated tasks and recalled the need for all parties to ensure the mission was secure and its freedom of movement was fully respected and unimpeded. </p><p> There were two rotations of Irish personnel to UNIFIL in 2014.  The Defence Forces' contribution to UNIFIL in 2014 comprised the 42nd infantry group, with approximately 184 personnel, and the 45th infantry group, with approximately 186 personnel.  Also, a number of Defence Forces personnel served at UNIFIL sector west headquarters in Shama and at the force headquarters in Naqoura.  Brigadier General Patrick Phelan who was appointed by the United Nations as deputy force commander UNIFIL in April 2012 completed his assignment in April 2014.  I thank him for his outstanding contribution to the success of the mission and wish him every success in the future. </p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s second largest overseas deployment in 2014 was to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, on the Golan Heights in Syria.  There were two rotations in 2014.  The second, involving the 44th infantry group, was delayed by two weeks in response to a UN request to allow time for the mission to reconfigure following incidents in the UNDOF area of responsibility in August 2014.  I suspect members will recall the incidents in question.  The 46th infantry group completed its rotation in September 2014.  The Irish contingent, comprising approximately 130 personnel, is tasked primarily with serving as the force mobile reserve within the UNDOF area of responsibility.  In addition to the force reserve company, there are eight other Defence Forces personnel based in UNDOF headquarters in Camp Ziouani.</p><p> Fighting between Syrian Arab armed forces and anti-government armed elements escalated in the UNDOF area of responsibility during the reporting period.  In August 2014 and in response to the hostilities, the Irish contingent, in its capacity as the force reserve company, dealt with several incidents, as requested by the force commander UNDOF, including assisting with the safe extraction of members of the Philippine battalion.  There has since been a fundamental realignment of the UNDOF mission, with a view to minimising unacceptable risks to peacekeepers, while continuing to implement the mission&rsquo;s mandate.  In September 2014 the headquarters of the UNDOF mission, including the Irish contingent, was relocated from Camp Faouar on the Syrian side of the area of separation to Camp Ziouani on the Israeli side of the area of separation.  Movement in the area of separation has also been restricted since September 2014.  The United Nations continues to review the mission and provides regular updates on the mission for the Security Council in this regard.</p><p> Reflecting the high regard in which Irish peacekeepers were held, Brigadier General Anthony Hanlon was appointed by the United Nations as deputy force commander of UNDOF on 20 September 2014 for an initial one-year period.   At the request of the United Nations, his appointment has been extended until 31 March 2016.  UNDOF is assisted by military observers from the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation's observer group Golan which currently includes six Irish officers.</p><p> Ireland contributes military observers and staff to various United Nations missions such as the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, UNTSO.  Thirteen Irish personnel, including the head of mission and chief-of-staff of the UNTSO, Brigadier General Michael Finn, were deployed to the mission over the course of 2014.  Brigadier General Michael Finn, or Mick Finn as he is known to most people, was appointed head of mission of the UNTSO by the United Nations in July 2013 in the rank of major general and had his appointment extended for a further period until the end of July 2015 at the request of the United Nations.  I thank him for his outstanding contribution to the success of the mission and wish him well in his retirement.</p><p> I also had an opportunity to visit Irish troops serving with the European Union Training Mission in Mali, EUTM Mali, on 19 March.  Ten Defence Forces personnel are serving with this mission, six of whom are deployed to the joint UK-Irish infantry training team, with one lieutenant colonel serving as executive officer to the training task force based in Koulikoro and three remaining Irish personnel occupying staff appointments in mission headquarters in Bamako.  In this regard, I express my condolences and sympathy to the victims of the awful attack in Bamako in recent days. </p><p> During my visit to Mali I had the opportunity to meet the EUTM Mali mission commander, Brigadier General Garc&iacute;a-Vaquero Pradal, and the Irish troops serving with the mission.  The visit also afforded me an opportunity to see at first hand the dedication and professionalism of military personnel and the tremendous work done by them in training and mentoring the Malian armed forces to improve their military capacity.  I conveyed to the troops our deep appreciation of the outstanding manner in which they continued to perform their duties on overseas service. </p><p> Other missions in which Defence Forces personnel were deployed in 2014 were the EUFOR mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with seven personnel; the NATO-led international security presence or KFOR in Kosovo, with 12 personnel; and the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, in Afghanistan, with seven personnel.  On 31 December 2014 the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan ended and the seven Defence Forces personnel who had been serving with the mission transferred to the NATO-led training and advisory follow-on mission, known as Resolute Support, on 1 January 2015.  Fourteen Defence Forces personnel were deployed to the Nordic battlegroup headquarters in Sweden from July to December 2014 and a number of Defence Forces personnel staffed appointments at UN, EU and OSCE headquarters. </p><p> The Defence Forces completed their service with the EU Training Mission in Somalia, EUTM Somalia, on 14 April 2014.  The Defence Forces had been serving with the mission since April 2010.  Ireland also provided the mission commander during the period from August 2011 until February 2014.</p><p> Ireland continued its deployment of five members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the United Nations Mine Action Service, UNMAS, in South Sudan until September 2014 when Ireland completed its service with the mission.  The role of Irish personnel deployed to the mission was to provide a specialist training team on conventional munitions disposal, mine and specialist search awareness for South Sudanese police officers.</p><p> It is important for Ireland to continue to build on its long tradition of service to the founding principles of the United Nations by making practical commitments of personnel to peace support operations.  I assure the committee that, notwithstanding the economic challenges we are facing, the Government is committed to ensuring the Defence Forces will continue to contribute in a meaningful way to overseas operations.  Members will note that, notwithstanding Article 42.7 of the Lisbon treaty and the challenges faced by France and the European Union, Ireland had planned a significant increase in deployment next year, particularly with UNIFIL.  Relative to its size, available resources and capabilities, both financial and military, Ireland is proportionately a very large peacekeeping contributor within the international community.  Overseas service is a core activity of the Defence Forces and Ireland's record of service in UN authorised peace support operations is second to none.  The Defence Forces continue to make a significant contribution to such operations throughout the world.  The Government places high importance on the valuable work being done by members of the Defence Forces overseas.</p><p>I fully recognise the importance of operational experience in peace support operations for the ongoing development of the Defence Forces.  I had the honour to see at first hand the dedication and professionalism of our Defence Forces personnel serving overseas during my visits to UNDOF, UNIFIL, UNTSO, and EUTM in Mali.  Last month, I met the commander and crew of <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, and previously I met the crew of the <i>LE Eithne</i>.<br/><br/>The <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, which succeeded the<i>LE Eithne</i>and the <i>LE Niamh</i>, is deployed to the Mediterranean to assist the Italian authorities on a bilateral basis in the humanitarian search and rescue operation efforts to prevent further tragedy and loss of life at sea. The three naval vessels have rescued a combined total of 8,592 migrants to date.  As of today, this figure may have increased.  The <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>is scheduled to complete its deployment in early December 2015.  It is due back between 14 and 17 December, subject to ongoing assessment of the crisis and the operational need to continue to provide such assistance.  The need for a further deployment to the operation in the Mediterranean next year will be evaluated over the coming months and will be considered in the context of the ongoing situation in the Mediterranean and the overall EU response to it.  While I intend that we will have a presence in the Mediterranean next spring, it is subject to Government approval.  We must keep in close contact with our Italian colleagues to ensure our personnel are deployed where they are needed.  It has been a very successful and worthwhile mission.<br/><br/>The current contribution of some 489 personnel to 12 overseas missions is very significant in the context of the reduced resources available for defence over recent years.  It reflects the Government&rsquo;s continued commitment to our responsibilities in the area of international peace and security.  I acknowledge the significant demands placed on personnel who serve overseas and on their families when they are away.  Without their loyal and continuing support, Ireland&rsquo;s strong tradition of service overseas under the auspices of the United Nations would not be possible.  Their committed and dedicated service in overseas missions reflects well not alone on the Defence Forces but on the nation as a whole, and contributes to Ireland&rsquo;s excellent reputation among peacekeepers throughout the world.</p></speech>

We are all immensely proud of and grateful to them for what they have done for us in the international community.</p> <p>  Regarding the UNIFIL operation, there are increased tensions in Lebanon.  There was a recent bombing in Beirut by so-called Islamic State.  Are there any new security procedures for the infantry there to follow?  Does the Minister believe the escalation will reach the areas where they are serving?</p></speech>

A bomb, claimed by Daesh, exploded in southern Beirut with great tragedy.  It is some time since we have seen this level of bombing or violence in Beirut, and people would suspect it is very much linked with what is happening in Syria, given that it is a stronghold of Hezbollah, which is very active in fighting in Syria.  Our focus is on ensuring our troops are safe, and they are.  They are located far from the bombing site.  It will be kept under constant review.</p></speech>

It is a deadly war zone in the region, and shares a border with Syria.  Our troops acted with great bravery and skill in extracting the Filipino battalion, which was surrounded by hostile rebels.  Is the Minister concerned about the escalating tensions in the area and Russian aircraft being shot down?  What is the Minister&rsquo;s assessment of the threat to our peacekeeping forces?</p></speech>

There has been a fundamental reconfiguration of how and where it operates.  It was an observer mission.  For many years, the mission was observing in relatively stable and peaceful conditions.  The idea was to keep Syria and Israel apart.  It is one of the UN&rsquo;s oldest peacekeeping missions.  It all changed with a very violent and ongoing civil war involving multiple players in Syria.  The territory on the Syrian side of the "Alpha" line has become an unsafe place for peacekeepers to operate as observers.  They are not armed or equipped for the potential risk.  Irish troops behaved in a heroic manner in rescuing and supporting colleagues who were exposed in outposts.  The mission has been reconfigured following the lessons learned from the activity.</p> <p>  Our troops and the vast majority of the mission, with the exception of some outposts and a contingent on Mount Hermon, which is a little further away, is in its base camp or headquarters on the Israeli side of the Alpha line.  Much is still happening on the other side of the line, and rockets and gunfire can often been seen by night.  Many people, and a political party, have called for us to pull out of UNDOF.  I do not think we should.  The UN is adamant that it wants us to stay.  The mission is undoubtedly a stabilising factor, although it is not able to do all it was designed and is mandated to do.  We hope to be able to return to a position in which it can.  Strategically, having a UN mission there as a stabilising factor and observation force decreases the likelihood of Israel getting drawn into the conflict.  This is why we are very happy to stay and we think it is a very valuable contribution.</p></speech>

It would mean French troops would be pulled out of Mali to be deployed as their President and Government see fit.  Is the Minister considering deploying more Irish troops in Mali?  What assurances can he give the Irish people about their safety, given the ongoing serious concerns about the stability of Mali?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.676" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/991" speakername="Simon Coveney" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2015112500002#G00700"><p>Everybody would probably like to ask that question.  Mali has been a dangerous place for some time.  What happened in the Radisson Blu in Bamako last week was a tragedy for many people concerned.  Mali has had many challenges for some time.  Some 20 EU countries have peacekeeping, peace training or peace enforcement troops in Mali.  There is a major European effort to try to stabilise the country and have the Mali Government stabilise the country and protect its own people.  Ireland is playing a very important, practical and real role there in a training mission.  I have been there and have witnessed it.</p> <p>  Since the Paris attacks, France has said it has multiple peacekeeping responsibilities across north Africa, as a result of which it feels very stretched.</p><p>If it is decided to redeploy troops from peacekeeping missions to focus on national security issues, gaps will obviously emerge.  It is in terms of filling some of those gaps that Ireland is considering whether it can be of assistance to the United Nations.  Obviously, we have spoken to France about that.  It is an ongoing discussion.  We actually had a reconnaissance mission in Mali before the attacks in Paris to consider whether we could do more there given the success of the training mission there to date.  That is very helpful in terms of making an assessment.  I reassure everyone listening that we will not send Irish troops anywhere without an appropriate risk assessment, appropriate reconnaissance and the usual reports that a Government needs and demands from its military and Department of Defence before it can sanction the sending of Irish Defence Forces personnel anywhere.  There will be no knee-jerk reaction, but we obviously want to try to be helpful if we can.  The recent tragedies and terrorism in Europe are resulting in a changed debate on security.</p><p> The role Ireland can play is to do what it is good at without compromising its neutrality or any other settled foreign or defence policies that apply.  We are good at peacekeeping and have considerable capacity and experience in this area.  If we can contribute to helping in UN missions as a result of the redeployment of French resources, we will consider that.  It is a process that will be subject to the triple-lock system.  There will be further debate on it if I bring any recommendations to the Government.  We certainly will not rush anything on that score.</p></speech>

I am happy that the Minister has covered a number of the significant areas.  Perhaps future committees reviewing reports such as this should meet to discuss ongoing overseas service more frequently so current issues can be dealt with as they arise.</p> <p>  As the Minister and others have done, I pay tribute to all of those currently serving overseas and those who have done so over a number of decades.  While serving in an extraordinary number of theatres and in a variety of locations and facing diverse challenges, the troops have distinguished themselves always in terms of the service they have given.  When one speaks to the people on the street about the Defence Forces, they speak first and foremost about the role the troops play in peacekeeping and peace enforcement.  The troops cannot engage in this role without the support of their families back home who, in supporting them, suffer from considerable pressure and face many additional demands.  We should acknowledge that.</p> <p>  Having regard to the report on overseas service in 2014, could the Minister state what percentage of the personnel currently serving overseas are female?  The Minister alluded earlier to the problem with recruiting females to the service.  The proportion of females is 6% nationally.  What is the proportion serving overseas?</p></speech>

I understand that the last rotation that went to UNIFIL had the highest ever female representation on a rotation 20 mission.  I believe there were 30 women, which is quite significant.  Actually, I would rather not be quoted on that.  Let me get the Deputy the exact figure.  Thirty out of just under 200 sounds very high, come to think of it, but I know the number was significantly higher than previously.  I will send the Deputy the figures.  Some 6.2% of those serving in the Permanent Defence Force at present are women.  We want to double the figure in the next five to ten years.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I welcome the Deputy Garda Commissioner, Mr. John Twomey, Chief Superintendent Mark Curran, Superintendent Con O'Donoghue of the traffic bureau and Chief Superintendent Fergus Healy of the crime policy and administration unit.

While there have been significant changes in the drink driving culture in Ireland over the past decade, drink driving continues to be a major contributing factor to road deaths and injuries on our roads.</p><p>Just one drink impairs a person's ability to drive.  A recent survey of driver attitudes conducted on behalf of the RSA in which one in ten drivers admitted to consuming alcohol before driving in the preceding 12 months is a concern, as it shows there is still work to be done if we are to achieve a culture in which people never drive if they drink.<br/><br/>Since the introduction of penalty points in 2002 and other changes to road traffic legislation, such as mandatory alcohol testing and the reduction in blood alcohol limits, as well as the establishment of a dedicated Garda traffic corps in 2005, we have seen significant improvements in road safety.  In 2002, there were 376 road deaths.  In 2014, there were 195.  To date in 2015, there have been 144 fatalities on Irish roads, a decrease of 31 over the same period in 2014.<br/><br/>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na continually conducts enforcement and other campaigns aimed at improving compliance with road traffic legislation and thus reducing the number of road fatalities.  The objective of this Garda activity is to increase driver awareness, increase the number of detections for breaches of road traffic and road transport legislation, and promote an improved compliance culture among the public.  Campaigns with the objective of promoting voluntary compliance with road traffic legislation, particularly as regards drink driving, are conducted nationwide.  Operations to detect drink driving offences, seatbelt non-compliance and breaches of road traffic and transport legislation by heavy goods vehicle, HGV, drivers are also conducted.  Through these operations, the Garda and its counterparts within the European Traffic Police Network aim to assist the European Union in reducing the death rate on Europe's roads.<br/><br/>In 2014, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na arrested 7,519 drivers on suspicion of driving under the influence of an intoxicant, of whom 6,548 were over the legal limit.  Some 2,141 drivers who were over the legal limit received a fixed penalty notice, of whom 1,270 paid the fixed penalties.  Proceedings were instituted against drivers who did not qualify for receipt of a fixed penalty notice or who did not pay when served.  The Courts Service has indicated that, in 2014, a total of 4,123 drink driving offences were heard, finalised and decided upon by the country's District Courts.  This resulted in 3,488 convictions and 635 acquittals.  The conviction rate is therefore 85% and the acquittal rate is 15%.<br/><br/>By 30 October 2015, the Garda had arrested 5,951 drivers on suspicion of driving under the influence of an intoxicant this year, of whom 5,281 were over the legal limit.  Some 757 drivers who were over the legal limit received a fixed penalty notice, of whom 522 have paid those fixed penalties to date.  Proceedings have been or will be instituted against drivers who did not qualify for receipt of a fixed penalty notice or who did not pay after being served with a notice.  The Courts Service has also indicated that, for the first seven months of 2015, a total of 2,334 drink driving cases were heard in full and decided upon by the District Courts.  This resulted in 2,021 convictions, with 313 dismissed.  The conviction rate is 87% and the acquittal rate 13%.  Where proceedings are instituted, prosecution files are prepared by the local district officer and prosecuted in court by the district officer, local inspector, local State solicitor or a representative from the Chief Prosecution Solicitor's office.<br/><br/>Regarding the management and oversight of drink driving cases, the use of IT systems is key to effective and efficient management, and a PULSE incident management function, under PULSE release 6.8, became effective on 1 November 2015.  The introduction of the PULSE incident management function will allow investigating members, supervisors and district officers to monitor and have greater oversight of drink driving incidents.  This function is an aid for investigators, supervisors and management and facilitates accountability, governance and oversight at all levels.  Its aim is to provide a standardised, systematic and consistent approach to incident management throughout An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.<br/><br/>The Road Traffic Act 2014 saw the introduction of the status of novice driver, changes to the endorsement of penalty points and changes in respect of intoxicated driver offences, including impairment testing and the taking of blood from unconscious drivers.  Changes to the penalty points system were introduced on 1 August 2014 and again on 8 December.  On 1 August, the most notable changes involved an increase in penalty points for speeding, not wearing a seatbelt and using a mobile phone while driving.  A further significant change is that a person taking out a first learner permit after 1 August will be disqualified on reaching seven penalty points.  The same rule will apply to a person taking out a full licence for the first two years of that full licence.  This is the two-year period while someone is considered to be a novice driver.<br/><br/>On 8 December, changes were made to 25 penalty point offences.  Fourteen new offences were introduced, nine offences had the existing level of points increased and two offences had procedural changes in that points could be applied without a court conviction.  Among the most significant changes are that learner drivers driving unaccompanied or not displaying L plates or motorcyclists not wearing L tabards now receive penalty points.  Penalty points also apply to novice drivers who do not display N plates or motorcyclists not wearing N tabards.<br/><br/>We have supplied some data on the figures to date: in respect of using a vehicle without an NCT certificate, 7,700 notices have been issued; for non-display of L plates, 3,529 notices have been issued; for learner drivers unaccompanied by a qualified driver, 4,864 notices have been issued; for non-display of N plates, 165 notices have been issued; for non-display of a yellow fluorescent L tabard on a motorcycle, 83 notices have been issued; and for non-display of a yellow fluorescent N tabard on a motorcycle, two notices have been issued.<br/><br/>On 22 June 2015, the Garda was given new powers to arrest disqualified drivers on the spot if they are found driving any vehicle in a public place.  Up to that date, it was not possible to arrest a disqualified driver at the time of interception.  The only option available was to make that person amenable by summons or charge at a later date.  This new power enables garda&iacute; around the country to arrest these high-risk offenders immediately, convey them to the nearest Garda station, charge them with the specific offence of driving while disqualified and bring them to the earliest available court sitting.  By the end of October, 456 disqualified drivers had been intercepted, arrested and charged under these new powers.  Many vehicles had also been seized and impounded for being uninsured.  In addition, 725 drivers had been charged for failing to have a driving licence.<br/><br/>The principal measures in the new road traffic Bill will address driving under the influence of drugs, and include the following: a new offence of driving or being in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle with the presence of certain specified drugs in the blood; provision for preliminary drug testing at the roadside by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na; and empowerment of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety to test, select and procure devices for use by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in preliminary drug testing.<br/><br/>As members are aware, the road traffic legislation falls within the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and there is ongoing contact between the Garda and departmental officials, with monthly meetings taking place between the Garda national traffic bureau and officials from the Department's road safety division.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is committed to the enforcement of drink driving legislation, all other provisions of road traffic and transport legislation and regulation, and working in collaboration with our partners in road safety, both statutory and voluntary, with the aim of reducing road fatalities and serious injuries on our roads.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.694" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moyagh Murdock" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015112500002#F00300"><p>I thank the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications for extending its invitation to me to speak on conviction rates for drink driving offences.  I welcome the opportunity in the lead-up to Christmas to call on drivers not to drink and drive.  Drink driving is a serious road safety issue.  Those drinking and driving have killed and injured road users and, in the process, destroyed families and communities.  The relative risk of being involved in a fatal crash as a driver is up to ten times greater for drivers with a blood alcohol level, BAC, of between 0.05 g/dL and 0.07 g/dL compared with drivers with zero alcohol in their systems.</p> <p>  We know from a nationally representative survey of 1,000 motorists conducted in November 2014 that one in ten drivers, representing almost 300,000 drivers, admitted to drink driving in the preceding 12 months.  We also know that only 62% of drivers believe it is not safe to drive having taken any alcohol on board.  We can take from this that there is still ambivalence and, in some cases, contempt among some drivers about drinking and driving.  We also know that those who drink and drive are more likely to speed, which is another killer behaviour.  Taken together, these significantly multiply the chances of a collision and the risk of injury or death.</p><p>There has been press comment in recent times about the rate of conviction in our courts for drink driving offences.  This has led to unease about the effectiveness of law enforcement and concern that drink driving is being taken lightly.  I believe, and have said so in the media, that some of the data quoted appeared to be out of context and was misinterpreted.  I note that this position has now been clarified.  A recent statement by the Courts Service clarifies the position by stating:</p><blockquote>Recent reporting, and commentary on drink driving cases and conviction rates, has been inaccurate: simply due to the extrapolation of conviction rates from the wrong set of figures. This has distorted the actual outcomes in cases heard, and in no way reflects the conviction rates in the District Courts.  Conviction rates are actually over twice the 40% reported and commented upon recently.  In figures compiled over the past week by the Courts Service - it is clear that the average figure for convictions each year is between 85% and 88%.<br /><br /><i></i>The simple error people made in commenting on the recent figures, was made by comparing convictions to summonses requested, printed and issued - and then comparing them to the UK figures - which relate to cases actually heard and finalised - not the number of summonses in the system at one stage or another.</blockquote><p>There are two important aspects to take away from this finding.  First, our conviction rates compare favourably with UK rates.  Second, it gives those caught a clear message that if one  engages in drink driving and ends up in court, one has a nine out of ten chance of being convicted.<br/><br/>I shall give a brief update on the road safety situation in Ireland as of this month.  As the deputy commissioner, Mr. Twomey, has mentioned, there have been 138 fatal collisions on Irish roads this year, resulting in 144 deaths.  This is 26 fewer fatal collisions and 34 fewer deaths than the same period last year, which represents a decrease of almost 20%.  The average number of fatalities for 2015 to date stands at 13 deaths per month, compared with an average of 16 deaths per month in 2014.  Should the reducing trend of 13 deaths per month continue for November and December, of which we are hopeful, the year would end with 156 fatalities, thus representing the safest year on record.  It will bring Ireland back into line with the longer-term trend of decline observed since 2005.  The death toll for 2014 was 193 deaths, compared with 188 deaths in 2013.  The safest year was 2012, when we had 162 deaths.<br/><br/>As per the Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020, the target is to reduce deaths to 124 or fewer by 2020, which is equivalent to 25 deaths per million population.  The lowest fatality rate, equating to 35 deaths per million, was achieved in 2012.  Unfortunately, that figure rose 42 deaths per million for 2013 and 2014.  In order to meet the target set for 2020, a 36% decline in fatalities is required between 2014 and 2020.<br/><br/>Reviewing the number of fatalities per month in 2015 to date, April was the safest month of the year, with eight deaths, which is a commendable figure, although unfortunate for the families who lost a loved one.  April was the safest month since November 2012.  Compared with 2014, most months had a lower number of fatalities and were safer in 2015.  The only exception was July, which had 20 deaths compared with 18 deaths in July 2014, and September 2015, which had 15 deaths compared with 11 deaths last year.  The summer of 2014 was a particularly dangerous period on our roads, but this danger period has not materialised to the same extent in 2015.<br/><br/>To date in 2015, 65 drivers and 24 passengers have lost their lives on Irish roads, compared with 75 drivers and 35 passengers over the same period in 2014.  Overall, this represents 21 fewer vehicle occupant deaths compared with the same period last year.  Sixteen of the 65 drivers, or 25% of those killed, and eight of the 24 passengers, or 33%, were confirmed not to have been wearing a seatbelt at the time of the collision.  That finding is hard to believe.<br/><br/>Deaths among vulnerable road users, which include pedestrians, motorcyclists and pedal cyclists, represent almost half of all deaths on our roads so far this year.  There has been an overall decline in deaths among vulnerable road users since last year.  However, it is important to note that motorcyclists and pedal cyclists remain as high risk as last year, particularly around this time of year.  The decline noted among pedestrians must be viewed in the context of the move to this time of year.  Pedestrians walking during the hours of darkness must be careful and pay heed to the risk involved.  To date in 2015, there has also been a significant decline in the number of deaths among children under 15 years, which is welcome.  <br/><br/>I shall list the interventions that I believe have contributed to the overall decline observed to date in 2015.  The RSA held its international conference on child safety earlier this year following a bad year last year.  The transfer of the Go Slow campaign, carried out by the RSA and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, to the high-risk period of summer proved particularly effective.  We  also had a high-profile launch of the RSA's fatality review in July.  As Mr. Twomey mentioned, there were a number of legal interventions and increases in penalty points for specific offences in August 2014, which has had an impact.  Road safety has featured heavily in media reporting in second half of 2015.  Regardless of what the story is, we need to keep road safety front and centre in the public's awareness.  We have had a number of very high-profile RSA public awareness campaigns and advertisements.  <br/><br/>An analysis of the profile of road users killed shows that the following areas of intervention remain critical if the reduction in fatalities is to be sustained in 2016.  We must highlight the role of alcohol as a contributory factor in serious and fatal collisions; highlight motorcyclist safety, especially in summer months and with reference to speed control; promote the wearing of high-visibility clothing by pedestrians; promote safe behaviours by young and older drivers, particularly young male drivers; convey the importance of wearing seatbelts, because there has been an incredibly high rate of deaths among vehicle occupants caused by not wearing a seatbelt, in some cases in relatively minor collisions; and continue to reduce the incidence of unaccompanied driving by learner drivers.  RSA figures show that unaccompanied learner drivers are involved in five times more fatal collisions than accompanied learner drivers.  <br/><br/>Finally, I must ask drivers, as we approach this festive season, not to drink and drive and wreak havoc on families and communities this Christmas.  We have seen that happen so often in recent times with the Treacy family and Christina Donnelly also.  I also appeal to passengers in cars to step up and take responsibility to ensure that their friends, partners or spouses do not drive when they have taken a drink.  There is a collective responsibility when it comes to drink driving.</p></speech>

Ms Murdock was correct when she said that there had been misinterpretations.  It was as a result of that that we discussed the matter here and decided to invite the witnesses to come before the committee.  It is good to give them an opportunity to clarify matters.  It is great to see that the trend in fatalities is going in the right direction again.  We were all worried because the number seemed to be moving upwards for the past couple of years.  I say "Well done" to all of the witnesses on the part that they play in this work.  A couple of years ago the committee visited the headquarters of the RSA in Ballina, County Mayo.  On that occasion we saw in detail what the RSA does and the way it analysis statistics, which is important.  Another important aspect mentioned by both witnesses was the ambivalence that people have towards drinking and driving.  There is a still a long way to go in tackling such a mindset, and nobody can be complacent.  It is a lesson to us all, from the point of view of media reports and the way figures are sometimes interpreted, that it is important to get the correct facts, and we have them today.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.697" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015112500002#G00300"><p>I welcome both delegations and thank them for their helpful presentations.  I wish to put this debate into context.</p><p>I was one of the people who initially proposed that the witnesses come before us.  The statistics that were presented were really shocking to all of us and to society at large.  I accept that the Courts Service has subsequently clarified the matter.  Any time the Garda gets an opportunity to come before this committee it makes it into the media.  It has been shown over a considerable period that greater media focus on drink driving, death and injury on the road, or any new legislation that is brought forward, has a knock-on effect on the conscious minds of all drivers.  It is helpful in that regard.</p><p> A lot of the issues and concerns have been clarified in the intervening period or in the witnesses' presentations.  My understanding is that there is a conviction rate of about 97% in the UK.  We have a little way to go.  I think we are at 85% to 87% this year.  We are well on our way, but we have to try to get the next piece.  It is the old story: the last 10% is always the hardest.</p><p> I was taken by what the deputy commissioner said about the new tool that was rolled out in November of this year.  It will provide the Garda with much better data, and once that data is in place, maybe we can enact the legislation to go with it.  Is there any general idea or breakdown of why cases are dismissed?  Perhaps Mr. Twomey could come back to us if he does not have that information.  We have all heard anecdotally that summonses are poorly prepared or there is some other issue and the cases fall between the cracks.  If the reasons can be identified more clearly, we have a better chance of pushing the conviction rate higher.</p><p> I compliment Ms Murdock on her continued efforts.  We try to operate in a bipartisan way in this House, as we all share the same desire to surpass the RSA's targets as set out in its strategy.  However, there is always a desire to try to do more than we can, faster than we can.</p><p> I do not want to get into the GoSafe issues, as we have covered them with the Garda before.  Apart from those issues, there is a whole series of cases caught in a quagmire.  It was reported in today's paper that individuals have been able to avoid conviction as a result of documents not being produced in Irish.  Has Ms Murdock any comments?  Is her organisation in a position to go through the statute with a fine toothcomb in order to flag any future potential loopholes that might emerge?  Without doubt, when stuff like this happens, as politicians we have to accept our responsibility too.  There are things that we all clearly missed in the drafting of the legislation or at the back end in its implementation.</p></speech>

It will also help us look at management.  There are many steps along the way from the time of interception on the side of the road to the final conviction in court.  The new process will enable us to monitor and address those issues.  We will probably be able to provide more detailed facts in due course.</p></speech>

The average citizen finds it virtually impossible to comprehend how, when the Garda has a sample that is clearly above the prescribed limit and an individual from whom the sample was taken, that individual could walk out of court, sit into his or her car and drive home.  That is most difficult for those who have suffered at the hands or wheel of a drunk driver.  We all have that shared responsibility.  The Garda's information will be helpful to us in providing the laws that will stand the test of the courts.</p></speech>

There may be other opportunities available at different stages.</p> <p>  While we are talking about compliance and enforcement, I would like to take the opportunity to say that those who drink and drive put everybody on the road at risk.  It is an important message.  Forums such as this committee allow us to raise the profile of this issue by highlighting the risks and increasing awareness, which is very important.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.702" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moyagh Murdock" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015112500002#H00500"><p>Going back to the Deputy's first point about the anomalies or gaps in the legislation, as the Deputy Commissioner mentioned, that case is under appeal with the Supreme Court.  We would welcome that.  It has been said multiple times that the road traffic legislation and offences under it are among the most challenged in the legal system.  It is a citizen's right to make such a challenge.  The length of time it takes for a case to go from detection right through to conviction can be very frustrating, with the number of adjournments and the like on each individual case.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has mentioned recently that the whole corpus of traffic Acts, which go back to 1961, will be reviewed and consolidated.  It is very important that we do that.  There is a new road traffic Bill practically every year and that leads to opportunities for people to challenge legislation when a new situation arises.</p> <p>  Where the Road Safety Authority comes into the prevention of road deaths is in raising awareness and undertaking promotional activity.  We would rather not see anybody in court.  We want to stop it before it gets to a court case.  Unfortunately, too many of those who are appearing in court for drink driving offences are not doing so for the first time.  They have probably been able to get away with certain behaviours and continue to drive when disqualified.  They continue to engage in risky behaviour.  We would like to prevent that.  We want to see a societal and cultural change in people's attitudes.  It is unacceptable now to drink and drive, but there still seems to be a societal acceptability with regard to driving when disqualified.</p> <p>  One of the initiatives we are hoping to introduce early next year is publication of the names of drivers who have been disqualified in a court of law.  This should act as a deterrent to anyone who is contemplating doing something that will result in disqualification.  Communities, society and employers will then put the pressure on individuals, which means we will not have to depend on wide-scale enforcement at every corner.  It is a cultural thing which we need to change.  When people are disqualified, that is it, and they need to stay off the road.  The Road Safety Authority is looking at ways in which it can create that public awareness and knowledge for the future.  That would act as a major deterrent to risky activity.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.703" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015112500002#H00600"><p>I thank the Garda and the RSA for their presentations.  It is worrying that one person in ten has admitted to drink driving in the surveys that have been done.  That is a massive number.   I thought we had moved on as society.  The attitude of the 62% who seem to think there is nothing wrong with drink driving is also shocking.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.704" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Moyagh Murdock" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015112500002#H00700"><p>Only 62% think there is something wrong.  It is actually 38% that think there is nothing wrong with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.705" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015112500002#H00800"><p>Sorry; that is what I meant.  It is very worrying.</p><p>However, I am glad the conviction rate has been clarified, because everybody nearly had a heart attack when we heard it.  It is approximately 80%, which is below the European average so we must increase that.  We have been conveying the message as much as we can, but obviously it must be done more extensively.  We must look at every angle.  Undoubtedly, we have come a long way from the earlier years.</p><p> The witness did an analysis of what interventions would be critical, but there was no mention of the amount of drug driving and what statistics there are in that regard.  I believe its incidence is probably greater than we realise in terms of accidents.  We do not have figures for accidents, and it remains one of the issues on which it is very difficult to get figures.  The testing has started, but are there any figures on that or is there any type of pattern in terms of how much that is affecting the figures?</p><p> The other issue is vehicle failure.  The witness mentioned the NCT.  Recent laws have introduced new rules and regulations in that regard.  However, I have always been worried about vehicle failure and how it affects these figures.  Some of the advertisements have been very good and graphic.  The more graphic ones have a big impact.  They are put on at the right time in spite of many children viewing, so some of them have had a very good impact.</p><p> With regard to school interventions both by the Garda and the RSA, is greater consideration being given to that and trying to get through to people at a younger age?  If we do not do that, it will be difficult to achieve a change in these figures.  That is the key to trying to get the figures down.</p><p> Finally, what resources are needed?  From the Garda point of view, are there enough resources such as van and road checks?  Has that led to a static situation, if the witnesses understand me?  If there were more resources, would we get the figures down or the number of people caught and convicted increased?  Is that a big issue?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.707" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Twomey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015112500002#J00200"><p>Regarding drug driving, we have an impairment testing facility available to us and that is being used at present.  I do not have exact figures with me today.  The new legislation proposes the introduction of screening devices, which will be testing equipment that we can use at the road side.  That will come in with the new legislation and it certainly will streamline the process and enable more effective and efficient enforcement of the drug driving legislation.  After the implementation of that legislation we will be able to give more information to the committee.</p> <p>  In the context of schools, we conduct a variety of schools programmes where we talk about public safety in general, and road safety is a key part of that.  We accept and agree with the Deputy's suggestion that the earlier one gets to these younger people, the greater is the opportunity to influence their behaviour on the roads.  Children are great at influencing parents and telling adults and parents what to do regarding seat belts.  Certainly, we see that as a real opportunity and we do a huge amount of work on it.  We also do much work with the Road Safety Authority in terms of ensuring there is a consistent message from all of the agencies involved.  There is a close working relationship.  There is plenty of communication and media being used to ensure we are talking at every opportunity about improving personal responsibility on the roads.  Enforcement is one element of the approach to road safety but personal responsibility and ensuring people are aware of the risks and dangers in that regard are equally important.  We put a great deal of time and effort into that, both through our schools programme directly and also working in partnership and collaboration with the Road Safety Authority.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about resources.  Our resources are currently approximately 738 but that is being reviewed in light of the ongoing recruitment.  Every opportunity will be used to examine where we can improve.  On the deployment and use of our resources. we conduct much detailed temporal analysis which gives us very good information in terms of the times of the day, the days of the week and the profile of the drivers and we use targeted interventions specifically focused on that information.  That has contributed to the reduction in road fatalities this year and the fact that over the past few years, since the introduction of the Garda National Traffic Bureau in 2005, there has been a considerable reduction in the number of road fatalities.  We continue to work in partnership and to attempt to avail of every opportunity possible, from both an enforcement and an educational perspective, and we will continue to do that.</p></speech>

The findings were that of the fatal collisions involving alcohol, 50% of those involved also had drugs in their system.  It is a significant portion.  Other than that, we do not have more detailed information at this point.  However, we believe it is a major factor.  Where somebody is drinking there is also a strong possibility that drugs are on the scene too.</p> <p>  I welcome the Deputy's comments on our advertisements.  Our behaviour and attitudes surveys indicate that it is one of the most effective means of getting the message across.  Our two most recent advertisements, "Don't look back", dealing with parents who get distracted by children in the back seat, and the one dealing with the anatomy of a split second, with the most recent one demonstrating the dangers of using one's mobile telephone, have been very successful.</p> <p>  Regarding school interventions and education, we fully agree that it is important to reach children early.  We start in the maternity wards with our packs, so it is quite early.  We also have our "Check it Fits" campaign throughout the country.  That deals with a big issue, the importance of proper child restraints.  Tragically, yesterday we heard the outcome of an inquest where a child restraint was inadequate.  We cannot get the message across that four out of five child seats are not fitted correctly.</p> <p>  We have ten road safety educational officers who travel around all the schools in the country, both primary and secondary, to get the road safety message across.  We have situational role play and different activities.  We also conduct a major back-to-school campaign every year in which we distribute 80,000 high visibility vests in primary and secondary schools.  We have a large amount of educational material available.  In fact, we have just finished developing a new syllabus for a junior certificate course that we hope will be introduced, subject to the teachers and the educational boards adopting it.  The syllabus is ready and it is an optional subject on road safety for the junior certificate.  It is comprehensive and we believe that it will prove very effective in making young people aware of the importance of road safety.  It deals not just with road safety but also with the physics and mathematics of road collisions.</p> <p>  My colleague, Ms Denise Barry, can comment on the importance of vehicle testing and the NCT.</p></speech>

They are conducted once every four years or two years, or once a year for a commercial vehicle.  As the assistant commissioner said, the owners, users and drivers of these vehicles have responsibility to ensure they are in good condition for the rest of the time.</p> <p>  As regards the national car test, the Minister introduced fixed penalties in August 2014 and there was a great deal of pressure on the NCT as a result.  It mainly came from people whose tests were overdue and who were seeking a test very quickly.</p><p>As a result, the number of people who are overdue a test has decreased from 330,000 late last year to 130,000 this year.</p><p> In regard to commercial vehicles, we have reformed the commercial vehicle testing system and the number of tests being conducted since 2012 has increased by 28%.  We expect 600,000 commercial vehicle tests to be conducted this year.  We have also introduced maintenance obligations and our enforcement officers now go out to inspect premises to ensure commercial vehicle operators and owners implement proper maintenance regulations, do walk-around checks on vehicles and have defect rectification systems in place.  In regard to the NCT, it is the responsibility of every private vehicle owner to ensure his or her vehicle is in good condition.  Checking vehicles is very important for both private and commercial vehicles, particularly in regard to tyres.</p><p> It is important tyres are of a good standard as they are the main part of the car in contact with roads.  There is a concern in respect of tyres and we are considering doing work to ensure car owners are aware of the condition of their vehicles and tyres so that they know when having their cars serviced or buying tyres that they meet the minimum requirements.  They should also be sure they are getting value for money when buying part worn tyres because these might only have a certain thread left and may not last as long.  The Department is also working on putting in place fixed penalties for vehicle defects because while owners have responsibility for maintenance, we need to be able to support the Garda in enforcing this.  Fixed penalties have proved to be effective and we are seeking these.</p></speech>

I wish to comment on the issue of tyres.  I know from recent debate in the D&aacute;il that there has been significant discussion with independent retailers and wholesalers.  I am sure I am not the only person who would not have a clue about the quality of tyres.  Instead, I trust implicitly the person from whom I buy my tyres.  This trust has built up over years of dealing with the same person and, touch wood, nothing bad has happened.  There is a major issue in regard to buying second-hand tyres.  I was not aware that there is a difference between winter tyres and warm weather tyres.  Perhaps some people would find that startling but I am sure I am representative of many drivers who feel that when they go to buy tyres, the person fitting the tyres will look after them.  However, there is work to be done in that regard.</p> <p>  I feel strongly also about the other issue raised.  As a recent and first-time parent, I have become aware that anybody who has to go and buy a child car seat is absolutely bamboozled by the variety of such seats available.  I know from speaking to many young parents that cost is one of the main factors in determining what car seat they buy.  I would encourage the RSA to do something on this issue, because each variety of seat is fitted differently and it is unlikely that a seat from one car will fit the base of the seat in another car.  We talk about the European Parliament introducing a directive to provide for a universal adaptor for a mobile phone but we do not have similar provisions in respect of car seats.</p> <p>  I have a question for both the Garda and the RSA on the issue of speed detection and the number of summonses not being served on people in regard to penalty points.  In the first three months of the year, approximately 5,000 fixed notices were not being served for one reason or another.  Can we have an update on the position now?  Another issue I have raised previously concerns the location of speed detection vans and I have been approached by members of the public regarding these being located on private property, in gateways and on private property off the sides of roads,  like some sort of attempt to shoot fish in a barrel.  I have come across an example of this on the route to Kerry.  As one enters Abbeyfeale on the N21, a wide stretch of road with a 60 km/h speed limit, the speed van is there morning, noon and night.  To be honest, it is there purely as a revenue-generating exercise.  This sort of practice annoys people, that they see speed detection vans in locations that are not synonymous with fatalities but in locations where revenue can be generated.  What is the Garda and RSA response to that?</p> <p>  Another issue I have raised previously is that of ludicrous speed limits.  There are parts of the road from Abbeyfeale to Killarney and on to the Ring of Kerry that are too narrow for cars to overtake and in places it is barely wide enough for one car, yet the speed limit is 100 km.  This is bonkers.  Some of our speed limits are not in keeping with safety.  On the flip side, some dual carriageways across the country have 80 km/h limits and speed detection vans on them raking in revenue.  I understand there is a road safety issue in regard to speed, but there is frustration among the public that the measures introduced to save lives in regard to speed are now seen as just a revenue-generating exercise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.712" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Twomey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015112500002#K00300"><p>I will begin with the final question regarding speed vans and their locations.  The GoSafe vans are deployed solely in areas where road fatalities have occurred.  These locations are based on an analysis of five years of fatal and serious accident data.  A review has been conducted and some of the locations have been changed.  This process is ongoing and because of increased compliance, improvements in road safety and a reduction in fatalities and serious injuries in certain areas, locations have changed.  These particular areas were responsible for approximately 30% of all of our fatalities, but as a consequence of the introduction of the GoSafe vans, additional enforcement hours and the additional capacity this provided to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, this percentage has now reduced to 16%.  Therefore, there has been a considerable decrease in the number of road fatalities and serious injuries in these areas.</p> <p>  This is an ongoing process and we continue to monitor the zones to ensure that the original basis for deciding on the locations is valid.  We will take on board the observations made by Deputy O'Donovan in regard to the road he mentioned and perhaps we will come back to the committee on that issue.  I assure the committee that the GoSafe vans and deployment of speed detection equipment is decided upon on the basis of road fatalities and serious injuries and on the analysis of five years of data and there has been a considerable reduction in fatalities and serious injuries in these areas.</p> <p>  In regard to the speed limits, a new group has been set up to review limits around the country.  This work is ongoing and areas such as the one mentioned by the Deputy will be considered as part of that review.</p> <p>  On the issue of the summonses, this is a challenging and complex issue.  The matter is ongoing and the Garda Commissioner has spoken to this and other committees on the issue.  A working group is examining the issue and it has introduced a number of recommendations for both the medium and longer term to try to address the issue.  We deal with in excess of 300,000 summonses every year and the issue of serving these is a challenge that is being considered in detail.  There has been an increase in the number of summonses served over the past 12 months, which was a target set out by us.  The issue is ongoing and we monitor it closely and are addressing it.  We continue to work to improve our figures in that regard.</p></speech>

I appreciate that the Deputy said he does not know anything about tyres but this is a subject that is beginning to become more prominent for consumers.</p><p>Let me give an example, a new tyre has 8 mm of tyre thread, whereas we see part worn or second hand tyres being sold with 3 mm of tyre thread.  The minimum standard is 1.6 mm.  The average tyre costs &euro;80, which equates to &euro;12.50 per mm of tyre thread.  One will pay &euro;30 for a second hand tyre, which seems like good value but the cost is &euro;21 per mm.  One will change that part worn tyre three times before one need to change a new tyre.  In simple maths, one is paying a lower price but not getting the value.  It is highly suspect where such tyres come from and they are a serious road risk.</p><p> We have very good information pamphlets on the tyres, which the standards enforcement section of RSA have developed.  We are working very closely with the tyre industry to get that message out.  The Society of the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, will work with us to try to raise awareness about the risks associated with the depth of tyre threads not to mention the environmental issues in regard to them.  We have a concern about where the tyres come from and where they will be disposed of and we will be focusing on that in the future.</p><p> In regard to the setting of speed limits, we have seen the introduction of the new road signs on rural roads.  That obviously only covers 2,000 km of roads.  We cannot keep emphasising enough that speed signs are not a target but a limit and people need to drive at the appropriate speed.  The Road Safety Authority does not set the speed limits.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has issued a very comprehensive guidelines book to all local authorities in tandem with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, formerly the National Roads Authority, setting out the guidelines on how to set speed limits.  We work with the Department and are on the speed limit review committee to feed back information on the role the Road Safety Authority plays in communicating and promoting awareness of new speed limits and driving at the appropriate speed.  I would like to reiterate Deputy Twomey's comments on the benefit of the speed vans and by the Road Safety Authority's estimate on the number of lives saved.  Approximately 27 lives would have been saved since their introduction.  Even if it is only one or two lives, it makes a difference.  It has been proven to be beneficial.</p></speech>

We go through a very comprehensive demonstration on how to fit the car seat and to bring to the attention of parents, that it is not just a matter of switching a car seat from one vehicle to the other vehicle.  We are also working with the suppliers of all the car seats and to the best of my knowledge 100% of the retailers who supply car seats provide a fitting service for parents.  Obviously one would want to buy from reputable outlets because they are very committed to doing that for us.  We have a booklet and CDs on it as well.  We have it on our website and we can provide information for anybody who needs it.  We just cannot get that message out to the public.</p></speech>

Like Deputy O'Donovan, I too was otherwise engaged earlier.</p> <p>  Previously, when the then Minister Deputy Varadkar appeared before the joint committee, we discussed the issue of carrying the driving licence when driving.  The advice was that a constitutional right would be infringed if there was a requirement to carry a driving licence when driving.  That escapes me, as the driving licence is the size of a credit card.  There is no requirement also to bring the driving licence to court, which is a handy way out of having penalty points attached to the licence.  Has there been progress on either of those fronts?  Should we as legislators look for it the next time we bring forward legislation on road safety?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.721" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Declan Naughton" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015112500002#L00800"><p>On the driving licence, there is a requirement to carry the driving licence when one is in one's vehicle.  More broadly, and we said this earlier, the Minister has said that he wants to look at the generality of road safety legislation, because the large corpus of the legislation goes back to 1961, and it needs to be looked at in the round in terms of its efficiency in keeping people safe on our roads.</p> <p>  On the question of the need to bring the driving licence to court, there is an obligation to bring the licence to court.  There were some high profile cases and challenges to it of late.  I understand that following those cases a review of the process is being undertaken.  The Garda, the Department and the Courts Service are all involved to see what had happened in those cases and consider how we can ensure the legislation is honoured in reality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-25a.722" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015112500002#L00900"><p>There is a mixture of despair and cynicism as a result of a driving offence case being dropped because the person had not been informed in the Irish language, even though one might not be an Irish speaker.  We must tighten the law because as has been said earlier one of the major sources of income for the Irish legal profession is looking at the rights of people to behave in that way, ignoring the rights of 160 or 180 people who have been killed and thousands injured.  It is a very strange view of human rights, but it seems to be a view in the Irish legal profession.  We must tackle it with stricter laws.  I will certainly support any such legislation to deal with it in the Seanad.</p> <p>  On the question of road design, some of the ramps to the M50 have speed limits as low as 30 km/h which then join a stream of traffic with a speed limit of 120 km/h.  Where one joins the M50 from the M4, one is travelling uphill, so trying to increase speed from 30 km/h to join a traffic stream doing up to 120 km/h is a safety hazard.  I think that presents significant problems.  Does the RSA have ideas on what road engineers will do? </p></speech>

A major consideration when they set out the initial road design is how the integrate this traffic into mainstream traffic.  I trust they have done their homework in that regard.  Obviously the Road Safety Authority compiles information on any serious or fatal collision and minor collisions and digitises it on its own system.  That information is all fed back as part of the review exercise of speed limits in the future.  That is an issue for the TII and local authorities.</p></speech>

That brings the issue of speed limits into discredit because motorists cannot understand a speed limit of 80 km/h on small roads when the speed limit on a dual carriageways, almost built to motorway standard, was recently reduced to 60 km/h with no explanation.  Perhaps the TII could issue a press release saying that it might seem safe to the driver, but for the factors outlined the speed limit is being reduced.  I understand the committee on speed limits has been sitting for years but has it accomplished anything?  Certainly the broadcaster, Pat Kenny has things to say about some of the examples of speed limits he has found.  Could the procedure be more open?  It is very difficult to enforce limits for which there does not seem to be any reason or where the reasons have not been explained to people.</p></speech>

Certainly we will reflect that back to the TII, the former NRA, in terms of the way people face them on the ground.</p></speech>

Some people do not get to one a year and they could do two the next year, but they have to write in letters and give excuses as to why they could not do it.  We need to be more flexible on it.</p> <p>  A major problem I have is where people who are seeking the likes of trailer licences have not attended school for years and may have little received education.  They are often petrified of driving a van through towns.  There are people who will go to college and there are those who will be good with their hands.  Why have we not looked at a system, such as Mondello Park, where questions can be asked as to what particular signs are for and what they will be more comfortable undertaking, such as an apprenticeship or going to college?</p> <p>  There is a raft of legislation to be introduced in the new year dealing with trailers and machinery but there has been insufficient consultation.  At the moment, from what I understand, a tractor that goes to a mart more than 30 miles away is supposed to have a tachograph on it.  There is a bit of lunacy in some of the rules that are coming in.  From my place to Tuam is 34 miles and I am supposed to put in a tachograph to bring my cattle to the mart.  The group that represents the contractors has brought this to my notice.  We need to have a bit of common sense about what we are doing.</p> <p>  On the question of speeding, there are people who make a living as sales reps or whatever and are on the road every day.  They will get caught.  There is no point in saying someone is one or two miles or kilometres over the speed limit.  If a person is on the road day in, day out, they are at much greater risk.  Could there not be a system for people who are only a few kilometres over the limit so that they could pay some sort of a fine-----</p></speech>

I apologise for rushing at the end.  It has been a very informative meeting and it has clarified many issues and facts where different ideas were in circulation with the media.  I thank both of you for the work you are doing to reduce fatalities on the road and increase convictions.  As members, we join with you in that and wish you well on it.  The best Christmas present that every family in Ireland could have is a safe Christmas.  Hopefully that will happen, with the public and all of you working for it.</p></speech>
