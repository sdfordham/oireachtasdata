We hope that at the end of the presentation, when members have had a chance to ask questions, they will have a good understanding of why we believe it is vitally important that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine give serious consideration to the introduction of a mandatory electronic identification programme for bovines.  Mr. Doyle will take us through some slides that will give an overview of the issues that would impact on the implementation of such a system.  We hope to answer as best we can the questions that will arise following the slide presentation.  We will elaborate on the points raised as we proceed with the presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Doyle" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111000002#G00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and committee members for listening to our presentation on bovine EID.  One could ask why this country, in particular, needs a bovine EID programme to account for cattle movements.  One could also ask why the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, which represents the marts is making this presentation on the reasons it would be in the national interest to have a bovine EID programme.  We have a national herd of 6.14 million.  Our nearest trading partner, the United Kingdom, has a similar herd profile.  We have a large number of animals.  As a result, Ireland is the fourth largest beef exporter in the world.  Members have heard us make presentations previously and will be aware that we export almost 90% of the beef we produce.  It is vitally important for us, therefore, from the point of view of beef exports, to have a traceability system to ensure all of our meat can be traced back to where the animals were born.  That is what we have with the Department's animal identification and movement, AIM, system.</p><p>The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has one of the best in class traceability systems in Europe, if not the world.  To get the full benefit from that we believe bovine EID is the best add-on to enhance it.  Every year, 1.7 million animals are traded through livestock marts, 1.6 million are slaughtered in meat plants and almost 1 million are traded privately.  There are a significant number of animals moving around in Ireland on any given day, week or year.  Cattle movements in Ireland are much higher than anywhere else in Europe.  In Europe, cattle tend not to move.  If they do, they tend to move once, perhaps to a feed lot.  In Ireland, we have a history going back hundreds of years of animals being produced, for example, in the south and east, migrating to the west and ending up in the midlands for finishing before slaughter.  That level of movement is much higher than that of our continental neighbours.</p><p> The AIM system developed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the best in Europe for tracking these movements.  Bovine EID could not work without the AIM system.  If one was to try to introduce bovine EID in some of our neighbours, for example in the UK, it could not be done in the way that we are proposing today because it needs the type of database and level of checks contained in the Department's AIM system.  To put it in context, there are approximately 4 million animal movements in Ireland annually.  In Europe, 5 million cattle cross borders every year for exporting - that is 5 million just moving across borders.  There are also internal movements so that figure could be multiplied by two to get the total movement of animals.  This is vital for us because live exports are something that Ireland needs to enhance and have every year to keep beef processors honest in that regard.  That illustrates that cattle movement is not unique to Ireland and is very important for Europe.</p><p> Bovine EID is a radio frequency identification technology.  It is not new technology.  It is used extensively in the identification of dogs and sheep and is required in all breeding sheep born since 1 January 2010.  That is now the case in Ireland.  Sheep EID is in place but for a very limited number because only breeding sheep have EIDs.  The rest of the sheep flock does not.  Perhaps it is a missed opportunity that sheep EID has not been implemented in full.  That is for another day.  That has been in place since 1 January 2010.</p><p> EID is required in all dogs born since 1 June 2015.  From 31 March 2016, all dogs must have an EID system in place.  It is not a new technology or a new idea.  It is in place for sheep and dogs and we believe that it has a place for bovines.  It is currently used in Ireland on a voluntary basis.  Some larger dairy units have adopted EID on a voluntary basis because it is used in the management of feeders, yield monitors and robotic milkers.  </p><p> All types of bovine EID, and EID in general, have a unique code embedded into transponders.  These transponders can be bolus type, subcutaneous vials, as in dog identification, or a tag or button-based, standard, readable tags, which is what we propose for the bovine EID.  These transponders can be low frequency or ultra high frequency.  Low frequency is a tried and tested old technology and is preferred by the commission because it is an old technology.  It was there when the original legislation, which gave rise to EID, was written back in the early 2000s.  This low frequency is ideal for close range single readings but for a livestock mart or even a busy processing plant, because of the speed at which one needs to read these tags, we contend that UHF is better because it offers increased range and larger data storage possibilities.  Not only is it able to identify the code more quickly and easily, there is also much bigger data storage available for people to record antiemetics or prescription medicines, for example.  These can all be stored on the tags.</p><p> There is an obvious health and safety risk to farmers, mart and meat factory staff.  Currently, we have to physically read tags on animals.  These tags can often be covered by muck and filth and have to be cleaned and read.  Farmers or mart and meat factory staff have to lean in over the animal to try to read them.  There is an obvious health and safety risk there.  If bovine EID is in place, one can simply have a race reader over the animals and all animals will be read instantly from several meters away with no health and safety risk to anybody.</p><p>Cattle-related deaths in Ireland account for almost 12% of all farm fatalities so I do not lightly say that it is a health and safety concern for all.  Increased speed of cattle movement data would be a positive advantage from bovine EID because with EID we can have real-time movement data.  If a farmer decided to sell an animal through a mart it could be instantly read on intake into the mart and the AIM database would be instantly updated, rather than at the end of the sale day as is currently the case.</p><p> There would also be increased accuracy.  Currently we rely on a visual inspection of tags but the primary cause of amendments to be made by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for mistakes is the misreading of tags.  People have to read a tag and correlate it with a blue passport in the database.  Human error exists, people can make mistakes and it is only the last four digits that are highly visible to the operative, whether that is the mart operative, a factory operative or the farmer him- or herself.  If bovine EID was in place mistakes could not happen because the EID tags are either read or they are not.  There is a 1% failure rate but a failure in this context means it cannot be read.  The physical number of the tag is then inputted into the AIM system, giving as close as one can get to 100% readability.  A tag will not read incorrectly and this will represent greatly enhanced accuracy.  </p><p> The number of inputs required by human errors is greatly reduced.  Cattle theft possibility is also greatly reduced.  Given that each individual EID is a unique code one cannot tamper with them or create a different code.  A bolus or a subcutaneous vial would almost eliminate cattle rustling in its current form.  This would make paperless traceability available to the entire food chain.  If we had bovine EID in place we would have the possibility that we would no longer require passports, which are a cumbersome and old-school traceability system.  Passports cause their own problems because while mart managers are content, farmers sell passports, not animals.  They could arrive with an incorrect passport, or the correct passport but with an incorrectly input tag number so the possibility of errors is doubled by having passports and animals in separate transactions.  With bovine EID we do not require a passport and EU legislation allows for this because an animal's passport is its EID tag.   The physical issuing of passports costs the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine several million euro per year so it would give rise to an instant saving. </p><p> Feeding systems, fertility, health and welfare monitoring are all possible with EID and EID on cattle would make them more attractive to some potential buyers, both at home and abroad.  The major purchasers of our live exports are big feed lots, whether they be in Spain, the Netherlands or Italy, and they have embraced EID technology.  If it was a mandatory system Irish cattle would be even more attractive as a result.</p><p> Food chain information can be integrated on EID tags.  Currently, farmers must sign a food chain information declaration when they present animals for slaughter to make sure they do not have any residues of anthelmintics or antibiotics.  With the EID tag, and especially the UHF technology, one can update the tag and the food chain information as one administers these drugs to the animals and this remains for everybody at the end of the food chain to see.</p><p> Scotland has field-tested dual EID tags which are tested encompassing LF, the technology currently approved of by the Commission, and UHF, the new technology.  Both technologies can easily be put into the same tag.  The farmer out west with a handful of cattle will have a tag which looks exactly the same as the tags today but embedded in it will be the LF and EUF chips.  The Scots have estimated the cost at approximately &euro;1 per tag.  They also predict that costs can only come down further because if Ireland embraced this and issued 2.2 million tags every year, the cost of implementing both technologies into the chip would be less than &euro;1 per tag.</p><p>If we take it that the average animal being presented for slaughter, or a high quality weanling for live export, is well in excess of &euro;1,000, &euro;1 per animal is not a significant cost for the advantages to us that I have outlined.</p><p> In 2013, the Scots spent a significant amount of money on the EID project.  In 2013, Dingwall mart show-cased the advantages of EID in terms of farmers marts and processors.  In 2013, ICOS brought over the Scottish team and demonstrated the obvious benefits to bovine EID in Enniscorthy, Roscommon and Fermoy.</p><p> No European country has yet adopted EID as a compulsory measure; it is voluntary for any member state to do so.  Australia and New Zealand, however, have adopted it in a full mandatory manner and their method of implementation is very user-friendly.  Every animal is EID tagged once it leaves the holding.  In principle, we could have the same situation here if we EID tagged every calf born on X date and then implemented a process whereby once the animal moves, it has to be upgraded to EID.  One would have full implementation with lower costs because the initial cost would be held just over the approximately 2 million tags issued every year.  Australia and New Zealand have adopted the EID model in full and they have increased animal welfare, animal health and safety and traceability as a result.</p><p> Scotland is planning a three year trial for the complete supply chain to demonstrate the benefits of EID.  It is hoped that will start early in 2016.</p><p> The European Commission approved the bovine EID regulation in 2014 which allowed it to be voluntarily adopted at member state level but that legislation stated that EID capturing and an agreed tagging system must be in place by 2019.  It is for the member states to take care of that in terms of legislation but it is available to any member state to adopt EID voluntarily.  The reason we are here today is that we believe member states should voluntarily adopt it for their national herd and we contend that it would be to our benefit to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Spellman" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111000002#K00200"><p>I would like to elaborate on some of the points Mr. Doyle made in his presentation because they are important.  Speaking to the members as legislators, I would say that with the introduction of a full compulsory EID programme we could have the immediate phasing out of passports.  We had a meeting with the Department officials some time ago and between &euro;7 million and &euro;8.5 million per year would be saved if we got rid of the passports.  That may seem to be an insignificant amount of money but when we consider the scarce resources available for other programmes within agriculture and so on, it could be better spent in some of the areas we need to have improved as we go from one year to the next.</p> <p>  Another important point as far as farmers and stockholders are concerned is that there would be no issue with cross-compliance checks that cause so much anguish for farmers.  Many problems arise with cross-compliance checks because there are difficulties with the tagging of stock but all that would be eliminated.  There would be no need to maintain an accurate, up to date register because all the information would be available.</p> <p>  As Mr. Doyle stated, with regard to the selling of stock, going through the marts and so on, all the information contained in the electronic tag would be transferred real time to the national animal identification and movement, AIM, system.  That is a huge advantage.  We should consider the benefits that would accrue to the State.   Our members, our Minister, processors and exporters are constantly trying to find new markets.  The production of beef is an important industry for this country and we pride ourselves in producing some of the best beef in the world.  When customers who want to buy our beef come to this country, they find we are operating a system that is foolproof as far as the traceability of the beef is concerned from the birth of the calf to the time of slaughter.  As Mr. Doyle outlined, as a result of the chip in the tag, the customer will have a foolproof record of all the medicines that were administered throughout the life of the beast.</p><p>For somebody who puts a good deal of emphasis on public health issues and the importance of the food chain, that must enhance our capacity to sell beef in a wider market because the people who will come to buy it will be impressed by the measures we are taking to ensure that what we sell is the best in the world.  That is what we should strive to do.</p><p> It was stated that where the programme is already in place - for example, Australia and New Zealand - tags are only applied as the stock leaves the farms.  If there is concern on the part of anyone, be it farm organisations or individual stockholders, that this measure will incur extra cost on their enterprise, with the greatest respect, that is nonsense.</p><p> In terms of this being implemented, we should decide on a start date - for example, 1 January 2017 or whatever date the Minister chooses - and say that from then on, all newborn calves will have their electronic tag applied and that only the stock being readied to leave the farm will have the additional tags applied.  Even allowing for the length of time breeding stock may remain on the farm, within five or six years we would have a full herd of stock that is electronically tagged.  Everybody would be used to the system then and there would be no issues around it.</p><p> In terms of people having concerns that there would be additional expense on the part of the stockholder in that they would have to buy readers or whatever, we represent the livestock marts and because of the benefits that would accrue to the marts - the same benefits will accrue to the abattoirs, the factories and the export assembly points - we will be prepared to install the readers.  There will be readers around the sales ring, at the point of entry for the stock, in the chutes they go through where they are scanned and as they leave the mart.  That will bring a greater degree of security around the stock while they are in the sales yard or wherever else.  From the point of view of the people working in the mart, there is a far greater degree of safety.  As Mr. Doyle outlined, they will not have to catch the beast by the head and try to clean a tag that has been soiled or damaged and cannot be read effectively.  All that will be a thing of the past.  Similarly, if a farmer has a not-too-expensive hand-held reader, he can walk out into his yard - particularly in the winter when he would have animals in for feeding or whatever - and scan the cattle to determine the status of their testing or their withdrawal periods, which is critical.  People selling stock have to maintain their animals and be aware of the withdrawal period in regard to any medicines they may have administered in the previous month or two.  All that will be available and it will be foolproof.</p><p> I rarely use the term "no-brainer" but this is exactly that.  Based on what the Scottish people have outlined - this comes from the manufacturers of the tags - it would only cost approximately &euro;1 more per set than the conventional tag.  When we get into scale, and if we were to enter into some sort of purchasing arrangement with out nearest neighbour, that price will decrease.  That is as much as I have to say.  We will be happy to answer any questions members may wish to ask.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111000002#L00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for attending.  As presented, this is the greatest no-brainer ever.  When somebody presents me with a no-brainer, however, I always ask if there is something I do not understand.  I take it the witnesses are not here to present on something that was going to happen in any event and about which there was no need to come before us to discuss.  I also take it that contrary arguments have been put forward by someone somewhere because otherwise I would have expected the Minister to introduce this and we would not be here.  Are those issues relating to price, difficulty applying the tags or something else?</p><p>I was hoping the last page would include disadvantages or arguments against.  Unfortunately, we do not have the arguments against.  I presume the witnesses are not here because it is such a no-brainer that it will happen anyway.</p><p> Is applying these tags a similar operation to putting on conventional tags?  If all the data are on the tag and not written down and one loses the tag, does one lose the data?  I presume the number of lost tags would be proportionate to the number of lost tags we get at the moment and that the physical shape of the tag is fairly similar.  I am not in any way taking away from all the good arguments the witnesses put forward about easy reading, fatalities and safety but I wish to ask about the statement that there would be no need for passports.  My understanding is that a printout from the AIM system gives the herd number of the animal and when it moves to another herd, it immediately makes this clear.  Presumably, the new tag will only give the tag number of the animal, so one would still have to get the herd number of the seller and the purchaser and key it in.  Is that correct?  I can understand that this system records that an animal is whatever it is but how exactly does one record, on the central computer system, that it has a changed from the herd number relating to farmer No. 1 to that of the purchaser, whether that be a farmer, a dealer or whoever?  Is this information inputted manually?</p><p> If the Minister said this would be compulsory for all new calves on 1 January 2017 and for all farm movements after that, would it be possible to introduce the tags on a voluntary basis immediately?  I ask that for two reasons.  Most people resist change, no matter what it is or how beneficial it might be.  Many people still do things in the old-fashioned way when there are more convenient ways of doing them.  When we got rid of the manual telephones, many people thought they would never get used to the push-button varieties but two days after getting them, they decided they would never go back.  Change requires advocates and the best advocate is the person on the ground showing the neighbour how to do it.  </p><p> What would the witnesses think of a voluntary period of, say, a year, to be followed by a mandatory period?  We know from the suckler herd statistics that 48% of suckler herds have ten cows or less - virtually half the herds in the country, so handreaders are no big advantage.  There is no differentiation between the east or the west coast in this regard, so I am not just making a west coast point.  Not all the small herds are between Donegal and Kerry; there are a lot of small farms all around the country.  For example, some 45% of herds in Kilkenny are of ten cows or fewer.  For smaller farmers, the present system is not quite as cumbersome because of the number of cattle they sell but the big guys will obviously move fast.  I am a great believer in the dual system as it is like pushing the sheep into the pen.</p><p>The hill farmer gathers the sheep on the mountain and brings them down to the pen.  If he does it in a hurry and tells the dogs to bark, the sheep will run off and it will take another week to gather them.  If something is done nice and gently and people are eased into a new situation then, given time, and if there are advocates among their neighbours who will show them how to do something, it is much more likely that there will be buy-in.  I presume that issues have been raised about this, either by farming organisations or individuals but I think in the longer term it is a no-brainer.  I am a great believer in technology but I also see how resistant people are to using even very basic technology because they feel uncomfortable with it.  </p><p> I have one more question as there are representatives from the marts here.  I understand the intention is that the star rating of animals will be recorded on the mart boards.  I have seen some publicity about this and it seems to me to be a good idea.  How quickly will this happen and what will the cost be for the marts?  Has the Minister given any assistance to upgrade the boards, in particular to the smaller marts?  All of the old boards will have to be thrown out and new boards and new systems will be needed to do this.  Will the witnesses give us some indication of the cost of upgrading?  Presumably with this system, everything from the tag can be read on the board.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that, on the face of it, it is very attractive.  I know one person who would be delighted with it and that is my brother.  He is albino and it breaks my heart as he cannot read because of his poor sight.  He would be very happy with it.</p> <p>  The first thing that we will hear about is the overall cost and how it will affect the producer.  Mr. Spellman mentioned that between &euro;7 million and &euro;8 million would be saved by this method.  Could he elaborate on how that can be saved?  I think &euro;1 per tag was mentioned in the presentation.  Is that the cost to the farmer himself?</p> <p>  How does a tag work?  Is it an insert inside the skin or is it a tag in the ear?  The reason I ask that is that it was mentioned that it would help to prevent cattle rustling and stealing.  If it is only on the ear, it is only a matter of clipping it off and moving away with the cattle to wherever they want to take it.  Has there been any discussion with Michelle O'Neill and her department about introducing tagging on an all-island basis?  That would be helpful.   </p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  It seems like a no-brainer, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said.  Anything that would make things easier in terms of health and safety and efficiency is to be welcomed.</p></speech>

The system seems very good and feasible.  This has been in place for sheep since 2010, therefore any of the problems that are likely to arise have probably arisen with sheep anyway.  There is concern about increased infections because of the tags but I imagine that there is the same likelihood of infection with an ordinary tag.  Is there something particularly different about the EID tags that would result in a greater likelihood of infection?  There is also concern about tags coming off during normal farm activity.  That would be the same for ordinary tagging too.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have any details on how it has worked in sheep farming?  What has the response of sheep farmers been to its operation?  Some of the advocates that have been mentioned could be the people who already tag sheep using this system.  What response has there been from the Department?  Is it actively looking at it or is it resistant to it?  Is it something that it wants to look at, given that it has been in place for sheep since 2010?</p><p>It seems logical so it could be rolled out if there is no practical problem with using it for the sheep as well.</p></speech>

There appears to be a significant number of advantages to supporting the introduction of EID technology to monitor stock movements and to eliminate human error and the strain and stress of work in terms of the level of input.  There are a significant number of positives.  The witnesses said ICOS carried out trials a couple of years ago in Enniscorthy, Roscommon and Fermoy.  They might elaborate on those and give us an idea of how they were accepted.  Since we have EID technology for breeding sheep for the past few years, will the witnesses elaborate on how that is working, whether it can be improved and what suggestions they might have in that regard?</p> <p>  ICOS represents the livestock marts.  One of the issues raised is how the introduction of bovine EID helps the operation of its marts, given this is ICOS' end of the industry.  It was said that the European Commission already allows for a voluntary system to be put in place, if that is what the member state wishes to do.  What is the ICOS view of that proposal?  Has the introduction of this been explored with the Department, even on a trial basis for 12 months, in order to see how it would operate and become effective?  The ICOS presentation, which is very succinct and for which I thank the witnesses, also indicates there would no longer be any need for animal passports if an EID system was in place.</p> <p>  The witnesses indicated that &euro;7 million to &euro;8 million would be saved.  Apart from that saving, what are the other advantages of operating without passports?  How advanced is this technology?  Is it continuing to advance and is the system continually subject to research throughout Europe?</p> <p>  What will the likely additional cost be to the herdowner?  As the witnesses know, farmers want to get down to the nitty-gritty.  They kicked up holy hell over the beef data and genomics scheme and various other issues, although I thought what was coming from some quarters was a bit irrational.  If this was to be introduced on a compulsory basis and farmers did not have any choice, what would be the additional cost to a farmer of having the system in place?</p> <p>  The &euro;52 million allocated to the beef data and genomics scheme is very important in terms of upgrading the beef herd going forward.  I listened to what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said.  In the course of its sales business, I would exhort ICOS to take steps, given the more than 1 million transactions that take place across the country, to display the star ratings of the animals presented for sale on illuminated boards or in whatever way that could be done.  Knowledge is power for all stakeholders in this regard.  The witnesses might indicate if that would be a costly exercise for ICOS and whether ICOS will be requesting that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine provide some assistance in enabling it to do that.  This could be the key to the operation and applicability of the beef data and genomics scheme and contribute significantly to improvement at the sales end as well as the purchase end.  I believe that would be a very integrated way of doing it.</p> <p>  To be honest, I think the Department should make the appropriate contribution to the marts.  It would then be playing a big role in helping the farmer, the marts and the industry in general.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1124" speakername="Michael Comiskey" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111000002#O00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation, which is very interesting.  There has not been too much talk until now about the electronic tagging of cattle.  It seems a very good idea but it is important we thrash out all of the nitty-gritty and get as much information from the witnesses as we can.  This is a time when we can all get a lot of information, even on our phones, and we can go onto the Internet at home on a computer or laptop to get the details of a herd.  We all remember going to the mart, and I often hauled cattle for people who would go around with blue cards stuck in their pockets.</p><p>After a wet morning or wet day, it was very difficult to read them.  When an animal had passed through the mart a number of times the card had been folded in many ways and after a time, it was nearly impossible to read it.  There was the added problem that if there was an inspection, the farmer might lose the card.  It will take time for the older farmers, in particular, to get used to this but I believe it is a good idea.  We have the best traceability system in Europe for livestock.  That is very important given that we export 90% of our livestock.  We must be certain that we can trace the cattle back to where they came from.  Regardless of where the animal is sent in Europe, it can be traced back to the farm on which it was born.</p><p> Regarding the other point, one can check online whether drugs have been administered.  One does not have to refer to a book where, again, the information might have been entered on a damp or wet day and it cannot be read after a month or two.  There is no difficulty in that regard.  We see it working with sheep and it does not present a problem in the breeding ewe population.  Certainly, an odd one might lose a tag but it is easy enough to replace that.  There does not appear to be a problem with it.</p><p> The cost is a big thing.  That must be clarified.  A euro does not appear to be out of the question.  People could live with that.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned introducing it on a voluntary basis for a year or two.  We did that with the bovine viral diarrhoea, BVD, scheme.  A number of farmers got involved in that scheme a year earlier than others and it worked quite well.  In addition, it would be a big asset in the case of stolen animals.  We could possibly move to a situation where a traceable device could be included so animals could be traced.  We would be able to track them.  However, that is down the road.</p><p> All in all, it looks quite positive.  I look forward to hearing the response from the witnesses later.</p></speech>

That is the disadvantage of being last.  It appears to be a no-brainer, as was said already.  The advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.  Have the witnesses had any engagement with the farm organisations?  Generally, there is a process to be gone through and that could be very helpful.  What type of reaction has been received from the three marts that were mentioned, including Enniscorthy and Roscommon?  What was the reaction and feedback from both the farmers and the marts?</p> <p>  It was mentioned that this would do away with not only the passports but also the paper chase.  A number of years ago, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v will remember, the e-voting system that was to be introduced was going to do away with the paper chase as well.  We all know what happened to that.  Personally, I believe there must be some element of a paper chase along the way.  Doing away with it completely might not be the most appropriate way to go.  Everybody needs to be able to see a printout or the like.  That might be required.</p> <p>  The witness referred in the presentation to the type of tag, and I noted he nodded positively on this to some of the questions.  It will be similar to the type of tag we have already.  Tags can be lost from time to time.  What happens in the event that a tag is lost?  Is it easily replaced?  What happens after that?</p> <p>  My final question is about access to the system.  A little over a year and a half ago, representatives of a number of farm organisations and beef processors appeared before the committee to discuss the beef crisis.  There were allegations at the time about who had access to the system.  It was asserted that if some processors had access to a system, they would be able to determine and adjust the market to suit themselves.  The allegation was that they would know exactly how many cattle were potentially coming into the system in the following spring, summer or whenever.  Would it have an effect in that regard?</p></speech>

It relates to security and follows on from what Deputy Deering said.</p><p>If I have animals at home and if my registered vet or I input data on drug treatment, dosing or whatever and somebody else walks into the yard with a reader, how can I be sure that I can protect the data from being manipulated?  Likewise, when I go to the mart, could anyone interfere with the integrity of the information on the system?  Each device has to be registered to the owner and the vet in order that until the change of ownership takes place, nobody can corrupt the information on it.  There were many questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Spellman" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111000002#Q00200"><p>Many of the questions were repeated as we went around the various members but I will address a number of them and Mr. Doyle will address the others.  On the cost issue, we outlined what we have been told by the manufacturers.  In Scotland, in particular, ScotEID carried out the best research available.  That is being passed on to the Commission, which has brought in a voluntary system.  The people who manufacture are saying that as of now it looks as if the additional cost will relate to the EID implant in the tag itself.  The tags will look no different from the existing tags.  They will not cause ears to fester and so on, as is the case with young baby lambs.  That was a criticism of the introduction of the EID tagging for sheep.  If the heavy tags were put into young lambs, they had a tendency to cause difficulties from a welfare point of view.  It is likely that ear tags will be used for the electronic implant and the tags will be the same, except that the implant will be inside the tag.  One would not know looking at the tag from the outside that it is any different from a conventional tag.  The additional cost results from putting the EID in the tag.</p> <p>  We would have no objection to introducing a voluntary programme for one year - perhaps two years at most - but there is no point in introducing a half-baked programme because it will offer no advantages in respect of the export of stock, traceability and so on.  If, for example, cattle which had the benefit of full traceability because they were electronically tagged from birth were slaughtered in a plant today and if the carcasses of animals with a weaker system of traceability attaching were included in the same batch, then it would be of no advantage to us.  I am well aware that no change comes without pain.  Some people will see this as an enormous change from what they have been used to and they will find it difficult to take it on board.  The option is there for people to adopt the voluntary system today if they want and many are doing so but if a voluntary system was brought in with a definitive timeframe for when it will become mandatory, then there is no question that would be the best route to go.</p> <p>  There was a question about the programme introduced for sheep a number of years ago.  When farm organisations considered the electronic tagging of bovines, many of them made a totally understandable comment.</p><p>If the bovine programme had been introduced before the sheep programme, there would have been far fewer difficulties with it.  There have been more than teething problems with the sheep programme since it has been introduced.  Now that breeding sheep must be compulsorily tagged, we are gradually getting over these difficulties.  We believe it will be fully in place as a full mandatory programme shortly.</p><p> This programme is important in dealing with sheep theft.  The only way the theft issue can be dealt with fully is if the tag used was a type of bolus or an under-the-skin implant.  As has been said, the ordinary tag can be cut out, as rustlers do now.  A bolus tag in the stomach of the beast or an implant under the skin, like one has with dogs, would cut out the issue of theft.  With advances in technology, a full tracking device could be incorporated into this, allowing one to know where the animals are at any given time.  That is one significant advantage that would come from this.</p><p> We have been in talks with the Department over the past while on this issue and it clearly identifies significant advantages from the scheme, particularly with traceability.  As mart operators, this will eliminate much of the danger associated with staff manually reading tags.  A farmer putting stock into a crush will often get a finger or arm broken as stock do not want their ears interfered with too much.  All of this hazard would be eliminated by this proposal.  It will not cost too much for an individual farmer to have a hand-held device for tagging purposes.  If it were very expensive, it could be shared between neighbours.  As for the insertion of the tag in question, the same applicator will be used.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Doyle" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111000002#R00200"><p>The issue of cross-compliance and how the bovine EID sits into this was raised.  Mistakes are made on the animal identification and movement system, AIMS, database because animals are recorded incorrectly and amendments have to take place through the database.  This has triggered cross-compliance inspection for some farmers when animals are not in herd because of these mistakes with the current manual reading system.  From a farmer&rsquo;s point of view, if bovine EID was introduced and there was a cross-compliance inspection which found a mistake, who is at fault?</p> <p>  The marts and factories, under EU legislation, can become critical control points for recording bovine EID.  This leads into the cross-compliance and paper trail issue.  The point was made that we need a bit of paper.  It will always be there.  A small average suckler farmer with ten animals can get a printout, the paper, from a mart or a factory with the full herd history of his animals.  The mart can give him a physical printout, irrespective of whether it is bovine EID.  The visual look of the animals under bovine EID will be no different than it is today.  The paper trail can still be there for those who want it.</p> <p>  Like all Internet-based applications, this technology takes off at a pace out-thinking us all.  There is a little plug-in device for one&rsquo;s iPhone that will allow one scan a bovine EID without buying any hand-held expensive equipment.  From the marts&rsquo; point of view, roughly &euro;1,000 per intake shoot would gear up a mart to read EID correctly.</p><p>With this plug-in for the app for the iPhone, which I believe retails on eBay for about &euro;300 and which will only come down, an individual small or large farmer could read them himself and get the full benefit of this now without investing significant amounts of money.</p><p> The issue of cross-compliance will always be there but it is greatly minimised as a result of bovine EID because tags either read or they do not.  If a tag does not read and somebody does not put that tag into the database and an animal is missing from it, then there is still a cross-compliance issue.  It will still ultimately be bounced down to the herd owner.  The herd owner is supposed to ensure the records are correct but they will be correct if they are done through a critical control recording point such as the mar,t etc., because they will be updating the AIM system for us.  They can still get a printout from the mart if they wish to have a paper trail.</p><p> On lost tags, if it is an extra euro for a tag, as the Chairman suggests - in other words there is no visual difference - and we do not use the bolus or the phial and they lose a tag, that is completely doable within the technology.  For example, on these electronic tags their full title is, "What you see is what you get".  There is an individual code embedded in the tag.  If that tag is lost, a new tag can be issued which will have a different code but will be correlated to that animal through the AIM database.  So it is possible to completely reorder a tag.</p><p> On the issue of the records, if someone wanted to use the available space on the tag to hold medicine records as well, there would be also a double saving in that because to encode the chip - this leads into the Chairman's question - with the medicine data requires not only a reader but also a writer.  There will be a backup in the reader of what was written in the tag and there would, therefore, be an automatic backup of what is in the tag.</p><p> The issue of a security breach has been handled by the Scots through their research.  The legislative data are completely encrypted and can only be read by the competent authority or a reader.  It cannot be changed.  On the issue of medicine records and antiemetic drugs, of course there could potentially be a bogus update of tagging information but that could happen in any event through the food chain information declarations that are merely signed where a farmer might decide not to declare it has got IVOMEC only last week and it should not have.  That again is merely replacing the paper with an electronic version.  That portion of the tag will be updatable by the farmer or by whoever buys it, but the legislative piece will not as it will be completely encrypted.</p><p> The smaller herds are taken care of.  I may leave the star ratings of the boards until last.  On the traceability and tracking of animals, the Scots did research on the use of UHF chip.  A farmer can in real time via satellite pick out his cattle sitting on the side of a mountain in Connemara.  In real time they can be tracked through GPs.  That is again an extra cost.  It is there to prevent rustling.  The increased security value of this would be through a subcutaneous phial or a rumen bolus.  Those are the only ones that could really prevent theft.</p><p> We have had a couple of examples of unintentional cross-Border co-operation on theft.  A number of pedigree animals had the bolus ID but they had a tag number from the North.  They were rustled down south and were unintentionally picked up by the vet through his hand-held device.  Unintentionally he picked up a GB number as he was testing them even though they had Irish tags in.  If we had cross-Border co-operation on EID, that would be greatly minimised because again we would have that throughout the island of Ireland with animals having IDs.  That would be a bolus situation to really get tightness in that.  There is an extra cost to that.  What we have proposed here is the simple tags and putting the IDs in that.</p><p> I have touched on no paper with critical control points.  Under EU legislation we are empowered to do that.  Access to the AIM system was mentioned and we touched upon it in the beef crisis as well.  At present, anybody can request a breakdown of the births and age profiles of animals across the island of Ireland.  It could be looked at from a national point of view, a beef processor point of view or even a mart point of view.  It would show that we had X number of animals in this age category and they may be coming on finished or be finished or whatever.  We can take a guess at it.</p><p>Perhaps what the Chairman is hinting at, or what was insinuated, was that they could look into my individual herd profile and see whether Ray Doyle has ten cattle coming here to finish.  From our perspective and that of the marts, and we are an animal identification and movement, AIM, interface user as well, we cannot do it.  The meat factories are well able to defend themselves but I contend that they cannot see that level of detail but that is for them to defend.  From an AIM interface user point of view, we cannot see that detail.  Only the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has access to the number of animals I have and their full tag numbers.</p><p> In respect of the beef data and genomics scheme, this is an add-on.  We have touched on using bovine EID as an enhancement to technology to make our lives easier and the national herd more traceable and user-friendly.  The beef data and genomics scheme is another example of using technology and increases in genomics to increase the national herd and its growth potential.  The original concept of the beef data and genomics programme was to reduce our carbon input by increasing the productivity of the national herd.  We in the marts fully support the idea of the beef data and genomics programme.  We are seeking grant aid from the Minister in this regard because if we do not get uniform and reasonably immediate implementation, whereby mart boards can take the data and display all the relevant extra data farmers need to fully adhere to the beef data and genomics scheme, we will dilute it and perhaps slow down the progress of the programme.  We will meet the Minister next week in respect of a grant aid programme to speed up introduction because unless we have the same presentation of data on mart boards in Cahirciveen or Raphoe in Donegal in a fairly speedy manner, it will dilute and lessen the implementation of it.  We would greatly value the assistance of the committee in lobbying the Minister to put a grant aid programme in place.</p><p> One of questions concerned cost.  It will cost anywhere from &euro;8,000 to &euro;10,000 per ring to put up the screens to display this data.  At the moment, the data are reasonably simple but this will only increase.  That is the way life is anyway.  When people buy animals now, the decision to buy is based almost as much on what is on the screen as on the look of the animal.  This will only increase because more and more farmers will buy from a genetic profile, particularly in respect of dairy stock, rather than the look of the animal.  Some dairy farmers are more concerned with whether the animal has an economic breeding index, EBI, in excess of &euro;200 or &euro;300 rather than whether the animal is throwing out a leg or all-white socks.  This will only increase as the years go by.  It is very important that the visual aspect is still there for the suckler herd.  With the beef data and genomics programme, we have introduced an extra genetic or technological addition to purchasing criteria.  Again, we need the marts to be upgraded very speedily to enhance that.  </p></speech>

I attended all three demonstrations when they took place in 2014 and the people who attended were extremely impressed with what was shown.  It was a practical, physical demonstration of how electronic identification would work in the mart context.  There were people there from other farming organisations who were as impressed as we were with what this had to offer.  We have been discussing it for more than two years.  We attend meetings in Brussels and it has been on the agenda in Europe for some time.  I have not yet heard anyone put forward a good argument as to why we should not go that route.  That is the purpose of us coming in today.</p> <p>  Will the committee use whatever opportunity it gets to encourage the Minister to implement a full mandatory programme of bovine EID even if the programme must be voluntary for a short while?  There is no point in going for a half measure on this issue because we will be more respected if we have a full programme and we will be the first country in Europe to come up with it, and why not?  The AIM system is the envy of many other European countries.</p><p>They have nothing like it.  Currently they are trying to develop a system of their own in Scotland but they are envious of what we have here.  If that has been the way our system has been looked at, why not be out there in the front with a good, fully mandatory programme of bovine EID?</p></speech>

I would like to stress one point.  It would be possible to decide on a date of 1 January 2017, and have it so that from 1 January 2016 it would be the preferred and encouraged choice, but would not yet be absolutely mandatory.  The 2% who might not go for it fast could seriously disrupt it in the short term.  By the time the initial year is up and everyone else is in the system, the rest are going to tell that 2% that it is working and there is no hassle, because they will have done it.  By doing it with an initial, voluntary year and then making it compulsory on 2 January 2017 it can be done without a row.  I do not think that in three, four, or five years' time anyone would regret the one year of having it as a preferred solution rather than making it absolutely mandatory for every last animal.  It would be a big price to pay for getting it there and getting it accepted.  Once the vast majority are doing it the rest will fall in line, we all know that in politics.  I have found one thing all the time - rushing it is the slowest way to proceed.  Give me a clever and sensible plan to get people there over a fixed time.  That normally gets it to endgame faster and with less difficulty.  I suspect we would find after a few months that we already had virtually full compliance.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. Spellman and Mr. Doyle.

As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has just said, make haste slowly but make haste at the same time.</p> <p>  We will put this on the agenda for next week's meeting with a view to drafting a letter to the Minister agreeing to the general principles along the lines picked up on.  We should bear in mind that the cost is &euro;1 for the standard tag.  More secure measures are optional for people.  Insurance companies and others may be interested in getting involved; there is a whole dimension to this that spreads out from there.  Treatment of animals for various different issues, whether it is a disease or an incident, can be done this way so that many cross-compliance issues can be dealt with.  There is huge potential here if it is done right.  I gather from the members here that they are keen to be of assistance in setting this up properly.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses.

I welcome from the Irish Harness Racing Association Mr. Mark Flanagan, chairman, Mr. James O'Sullivan, treasurer, Mr. Arthur Cooper, consultant, Mr. Ryan Ferris, assistant, and Dr. Peadar &Oacute; Scanaill, veterinary consultant.  I thank them for being here to brief the committee on the harness racing industry in Ireland.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I draw to their attention the matter of privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any members or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members were reminded earlier of privilege as it relates to them.  I understand Mr. Arthur Cooper will make an opening statement.</p></speech>

We have introduced some packages which give a profile of the association and include photographs of harness racing in Ireland from years gone by.  I will come to those photographs a little later.  Our aim this afternoon is to introduce ourselves, discuss the sport and the size of the industry, how we can assist in terms of the social issues and what significant economic benefits we can bring to Ireland.</p> <p>  Trotting is a globally recognised sport.  It is to be found across 31 countries and is an industry valued at &euro;13 billion.  It is a horserace run at recognised racetracks and has a horse pulling a sulky with a driver.  France is the largest country for trotting and other sizable trotting territories include North America, Sweden and Australia.  France and Australia, in particular, look at the sport from a community-rural aspect.</p><p>Trotting is the largest horse racing sport in mainland Europe and is bigger than thoroughbred racing.  The Irish Harness Racing Association, IHRA, is the globally recognised governing body representing Ireland and an active member of the world federation of trotting.  The European Trotting Union, UET, is a collective group, with 20 member states.  Ireland has observer status, and this past summer underwent an audit to be elevated to full member status.  We will learn of the UET's decision later this year.  For an organisation such as ours, the equivalent is a country joining the EU.</p><p> The IHRA does not deal with road or sulky racing.  Our race meetings are conducted at recognised racetracks and officiated under the full governance of international trotting rules and standards.  We believe we might be able to assist with the road racing social issues.  </p><p> The sport in France has developed, with more than 230 individual tracks spread throughout the country, mostly in rural towns.  In the information provided to committee members I have included a map of France which indicates the large number of tracks throughout the country.  For the French, this is a sport based in the rural community and, unlike thoroughbred racing, it is the district farmer and his wife who has a horse or two to race.  There are big owners and stables, which is natural, but it is important to remember the smaller participants, primarily from rural communities, are in many ways the important grassroots level for the French trotting community.  The industry in France is worth more than &euro;6 billion in direct economic benefits and generates more than 60,000 direct jobs.  Thoroughbred racing and trotting can and do stand side by side to help to grow an economy.</p><p> Thoroughbred racing and trotting share racecourse facilities in most countries and they hold meetings on the same day and, frequently, on the same race card.  This is a global phenomenon.  The use of Irish thoroughbred racetracks is being prevented at present by Horse Racing Ireland on the basis of welfare, track and competition reasons.  All of these are hollow and flawed arguments.  At the end of September, the IHRA was able to conduct a meeting on the all-weather surface at the thoroughbred track in Dundalk.  It was highly successful and only added to the standing of Irish trotting, with international guests in attendance.  We had a meeting with Horse Racing Ireland this morning at which we received a 100% clean bill of health with regard to welfare issues and the track.  A number of people from Horse Racing Ireland were present at the meeting in Dundalk, and those in attendance this morning stated it was very professionally run.  The Turf Club, as an independent group, examined all of our horses and they all passed.  There was not one issue with regard to welfare, which is one of the main arguments Horse Racing Ireland has put forward.  A report has been prepared, which we went through this morning.  Unfortunately, for a number of internal administrative reasons Horse Racing Ireland has not yet forwarded the report to the Department or the Minister, Deputy Coveney, but it will happen very shortly.  It is a very positive report.  Horse Racing Ireland and the IHRA will conduct stable inspections of our trotting horses and trainers.</p><p> This morning, we also discussed with Horse Racing Ireland the importance of ongoing access to Dundalk.  Both parties agreed, and it was stressed, that Dundalk can potentially be an interim location for us to hold meetings and be able to export our product, which I will discuss in a moment.  Horse Racing Ireland insisted that from a longer-term perspective Dundalk is not the home for harness racing.  We will seek a track, or a number of tracks, throughout the country.  Dundalk was highly successful and can act as a stopgap solution from an international export perspective, but on a long-term basis we need to find an alternative solution.</p><p> The IHRA has entered a mentoring programme with the French governing body, LeTROT, whereby horses will be purchased at a subsidised rate, prize money contributions amounting to &euro;150,000 or more are paid directly to us and educational opportunities are offered.</p><p>Importantly, there is scope for Irish trotting to be exported to France where commissions payable will amount to a minimum of &euro;50,000 per race meeting we would export to France.  Thoroughbreds do not receive anywhere near that amount of export money from markets outside the United Kingdom, and it is not just to France.  There are other potential export markets.  We are in discussion with countries around the world for Irish harness racing to be exported, and we will receive commission.<br/><br/>Additionally, apart from this opportunity, we have an Irish horse which is in Australia for the richest series in the southern hemisphere, the Inter Dominion.  In 1993, the Irish thoroughbred, Vintage Crop, was the first international horse to travel to Australia to participate in and win the Melbourne Cup.  Another Irish horse, Meadowbranch DJ, now has the opportunity to achieve similar success.  There is a lot of interest in him, being the first international harness horse to race in the series.  The three heats and final will take place later this month and also into December.<br/><br/>Currently, both France and Australia are making financial contributions towards the development of harness racing here in Ireland.  As noted, the Irish Harness Racing Industry, IHRA, has no association whatsoever with road racing.  Europe does not have this problem.  One reason for that is the strength of the European trotting industry.  The sport is offered in many rural towns and is presented under the governance of trotting rules, with prize money and betting opportunities.<br/><br/>Members will notice that we have provided a number of photographs within the pack to illustrate the sport in Ireland in the past.  One of the photographs shows trotting being held in Jones Road, on the site of what is now Croke Park.  That was in 1900.  Another photograph shows trotting being held at the RDS show in 1922, and another is of trotting being held in Raheny, with huge crowds, in 1945.  Trotting is not unfamiliar here in Ireland.<br/><br/>By supporting the IHRA, road races can be integrated, as they have been in Europe over many years.  They have access to races at tracks, with prize money under the rules of racing governance, and with betting opportunities.  In France, for example, the last race of each meeting at Bordeaux today is dedicated to amateur drivers.  That is where the local community can race against themselves, and they receive full <i>pari mutuel urbain</i>, PMU, coverage in France.<br/><br/>On Tuesday, 14 October, the budget was handed down.  The thoroughbred and greyhound racing industry saw a combined increase of 9%, or &euro;6 million.  In addition, the Traveller community received an increase of 27% to &euro;2.7 million for advancing horse projects for urban and Traveller horse owners.  The IHRA submitted and requested a total of just &euro;375,000 for development and veterinary issues.  The IHRA was allocated zero.<br/><br/>As noted, other countries assisting financially include France and Australia.  The IHRA is on the verge of becoming a key component within the global trotting industry.  This will occur through developing export markets for Ireland and creating other industries and jobs in Ireland, including in breeding, where we now have our own stud book.  Breeding of horses in Ireland is an integral part of the economy, and that is where we have a terrific opportunity to develop Trotteur Francais horses for export to Europe, and into Sweden and France in particular.<br/><br/>There are also the opportunities from an international tote trotting hub.  From a tote perspective, revenue is key to any form of gambling industry.  That is an area we are trying to develop.  We are in discussions, and we have a meeting with the Department of Justice and Equality tomorrow regarding the Gambling Control Bill currently being drafted yet not one euro has been found to assist us in the development of this industry for Ireland where we can rapidly produce real, direct economic benefits.<br/><br/>The IHRA is seeking funding for ongoing business development, veterinary needs and longer term funding to develop dedicated tracks for trotting.</p><p>We are hopeful that our positive and self-generated progress will be noted and acted upon.</p><p> I thank the committee for its time.  Our chairman, Mr. Mark Flanagan, treasurer, Mr. James O'Sullivan, and our veterinary consultant, Mr. Peadar &Oacute; Scanaill, can add their remarks if they wish.</p></speech>

Each of the countries support the development and funding of harness racing.  It is a rural programme.  There are 230 tracks in France and the tracks are probably within half an hour of each other.  All the rural people can attend.  As has been said, the husband and wife can train their horse and race it in the amateur programme.  In addition, there is &euro;230 million in prize money on offer in France-----</p></speech>

The thoroughbred industry employs 17,000 in Ireland.  In France, 60,000 people are employed in trotting.  It is a huge sport.  The president and general secretary of the UET, European Trotting Union, and the chief executive officer of Le Trot came to Dundalk.  There was Group 1 racing on in Vincennes in Paris and they left that to come to Dundalk to support us in the development of the sport.</p></speech>

We believe that we have a part to play in solving some of that social problem.  It does not exist anywhere else in mainland Europe.  It exists in Great Britain but that country is in the same position as this country.  It has the same problems.  It has an unfunded trotting organisation, just as Ireland has.  We believe there is a solution in that regard.  The social problem exists as a result of not having a properly funded structure for trotting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peadar &Oacute; Scanaill" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111000002#Y00600"><p>Peadar &Oacute; Scanaill is my name.  I am a veterinarian in north County Dublin.  In my locality, trotting has been taking place in Portmarnock since the 1960s and 1970s.  My father was a veterinarian agus bh&iacute; s&eacute; ag obair ann chomh maith.  He always used to do the work there.  They never had money.  This sport must be supported.  The sport tries to do things correctly.  It differentiates itself completely from what takes place on the road.  What happens on the road must stop.  It is a welfare issue and a problem.  It is a shame to our nation that people can see some of the things that occur.  Trotting is the opposite end of the spectrum, with no funding whatsoever.  It is all from the pockets of the people involved.</p> <p>  In Dundalk we had a fantastic day out on the veterinary side.  The Turf Club came in attendance.  We were quite confident from the veterinary point of view.  I had other professionals with me.  There were four veterinary assistants as well as my two veterinary practitioners.  The Turf Club came along and we were quite delighted to see it come with us.  Obviously our work mainly covers the thoroughbred world, and then we do sidelines such as what the men with me are doing as well as eventing and so forth.  We mimicked exactly what takes place on the racecourses in Fairyhouse, Leopardstown and so forth.</p> <p>  These people are as high, if not higher, in their standard of welfare and care of their horses.  They are welcoming to any suggestions we in the veterinary profession make to them to ensure that they do the job properly.  It is difficult for us as veterinary practitioners to continue giving this service because, in fairness, it is out of their pocket and they cannot possibly pay us current or correct rates.  That is the reason I am here this afternoon.  As independently as possible, although I have been working with them nearly all of my life, I wish to state that they are doing their best to promote the sport in the way it should be conducted.  It might also be a help, as was suggested by Arthur, towards a solution to another problem they tend to get tagged with even though it has nothing to do with them.</p></speech>

I call Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111000002#Y00800"><p>Cuirim f&aacute;ilte roimh na finn&eacute;ithe tr&aacute;thn&oacute;na inniu.  Is deas go raibh an deis acu cur i l&aacute;thair a dh&eacute;anamh.</p><p>I welcome the witnesses.  I was very interested in their submission.  I do not get the logic of where the problems are coming from.  In other words, as far as I am concerned, this is just another sport and another way for people to enjoy themselves, and it is legitimate.  The witnesses have outlined that it is common right across Europe - it is certainly common in America - and that there are no welfare issues, etc.</p><p> We can discuss this at a private meeting next week, but I would be fascinated to hear the HRI side of the story, which would be one way of progressing this.  I believe the best way forward in any situation, if there are counterarguments, is to hear both sides.  One can then make a judgement but one should never make a judgement by hearing one side only.  However, I am intrigued as to what are the HRI's problems.  I could have foreseen two issues, one of which is the organisation of the people organising the harness races and that is something that would be addressed by proper codes of conduct and behaviour.  I wonder whether the HRI would argue that the vehicles themselves would damage the race courses.  Again, it does not seem to do any damage in other countries, although there might be an argument that the going is sometimes a bit softer in Ireland than in other places, so let us hear that out.</p><p> As of now, however, I do not know of any good reason for this problem.  Nonetheless, we know there is a problem there and, therefore, the HRI must have some counterargument.  To be honest with the witnesses, if we want to progress this, we will have to try to find out what the real argument is.  Sometimes people give us arguments but is not really what is worrying them; rather, it is one they think is presentable.  We will just have to find out what the logjam is and try to deal with that.  This concerns the issue of access to courses, particularly where private people are willing to give the IHRA the courses but it is not able to get them because the HRI is overruling this.</p><p> The second issue is that of Government appropriations.  I believe that, as an equine activity, harness racing should have access to funding.  The committee has a study ongoing in regard to horses in general and the whole horse industry, literally from the thoroughbreds through the sport horses and every other kind of horse right down to horses in urban communities, in trying to take a holistic view and see how it could all be properly regulated, properly done and properly funded.  Therefore, there is no reason I can see that we would not suggest to the Minister that the IHRA, subject to the normal checks and balances, would be funded either directly or indirectly, but that funding would be made available.  I believe the IHRA request is quite modest and amounts to a few hundred thousand euro.  It is not exactly the biggest such request we have ever received.</p><p> I would like to address the issue of road and sulky racing.  It is interesting that there are two sports in Ireland which take place on the road.  One is sulky racing, and we heard much talk about that, and the other is the favourite Cork sport of bowling, where they close all the roads in the evening and throw bowls along the road.  The great and the good of south Cork or west Cork are into this activity in a big way.  I do not know if it has got over the border into Kerry yet.</p></speech>

At the same time, we have to regularise the position and that can only be done by providing the facilities to allow it to be done in a structured fashion.  I think it would be great for their own safety as well as for the public good if we could provide them with the places to train and run the horses.</p> <p>  We have discussed this publicly at the committee with the representatives of the county managers association and the county chief executives association, so I see that as a big upside here.  We tend to go solving problems in a negative rather than a positive way but we should try to solve this one in a constructive way.</p><p>Those involved in harness racing have put a distance between themselves and those involved in sulky racing and said, "We are not them".  I accept they are not them but I think they should embrace them, as long as they comply.  This would be hugely positive because there has been enough exclusion in this country.  If we could encourage them to get involved, so long as they abided by all the rules, all the better.  It is a win-win situation and I believe it would be hugely beneficial.</p><p> In that regard, I know the IHRA thought there was &euro;5 million which was not spent.  Unfortunately, that money was for Traveller housing.  That money has certainly been put back in the pot.  Anyone dealing with Traveller housing will know there are no houses for Travellers.  It is not that there was no use for the money as ten times that money could have been used usefully.  This was about the total inability of certain authorities in this country to come forward with plans to deal with that.  I ask the IHRA not to go after that &euro;5 million and to leave it for what it was meant for.</p><p> The money should come out of the funds already going to horses.  We should be absolutely clear that this is where the money has to come from.  There is no reason the industry or the recreation, call it what we want, the IHRA wants to promote would not get its fair share of funding.  However, I also have to say I have been passionate in advocating that horse projects for young people from urban backgrounds would get some slice of the action from the moneys we give to horses, and that would include those involved in sulky racing because there is an overlap between the two things.  Any investment we have made in horse projects, particularly around Dublin, has been hugely beneficial in terms of giving a legitimate outlet to young children in urban areas to love animals, get to know them, treat them in a fair way and not abuse them.</p></speech>

I was not present at the Dundalk meeting but some close friends of mine were and they spoke of how well everything went off and how it was handled, as well as the benefit to the area and the local economy.  Everyone I know who was there was very happy with the event.</p> <p>  Despite the amount of money allocated to the horse and greyhound sector every year - there are Supplementary Estimates every year in that regard - the IHRA asked for just &euro;375,000 and did not get one cent.  I believe that is very wrong and even disgraceful, given the potential to develop the industry.  As the witnesses said in their presentation, the IHRA would hope to have a number of venues around the country where it could advance the industry.  More and more people want to be involved in harness racing but are denied access to racetracks and do not have the facilities, which is inhibiting the growth of the industry.</p> <p>  I suspect Horse Racing Ireland sees the association as competing against it and for that reason, it is deliberately - I use the word "deliberately" - preventing the development of harness racing.  I hope HRI will prove me wrong.  Elitism in any part of life, whether in sport or elsewhere, is wrong.  When people see themselves as above somebody else, or better than somebody else, or keep people down, I see that as wrong.  The enjoyment of harness racing or any other sport which is there for young people and spectators to enjoy should be encouraged, once it is legitimate and, in this case, once it meets the welfare standards, which it has.  Therefore, it needs to be encouraged and supported.</p> <p>  We, as decision-makers, although the Government is the decision-maker which we try to influence to make decisions, should do all in our power to ensure the IHRA gets equal treatment and is treated fairly, as it should be.</p><p>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned there could be damage to tracks and so forth.  My understanding is that all-weather facilities are essential for harness racing and Dundalk is an all-weather race track.  All-weather tracks are well able to cater for it.</p><p> When one considers the support to the economy, the amount of money generated and the benefit provided by harness racing in France and other countries, I cannot see how an organisation or a Government in this country would try to prevent it proceeding.  There is no reason to do that.  I tabled a priority question on this for the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in the recent past and he indicated that he would consider the matter in a favourable way.  I hope that will be the outcome.</p><p> The witnesses said they met with representatives of Horse Racing Ireland.  I hope it has changed its position.  I am aware from written reports that it had difficulties initially, and certainly in the recent past, as it saw harness racing as competing against its industry.  If that is its current position and if a proposal is brought to the committee for the allocation of money to Horse Racing Ireland, I will certainly not vote for it in that case.</p></speech>

When one considers that France and Australia support the development of harness racing in Ireland but the Irish Government does not, it conveys a damning picture regarding the powers-that-be in this country and what appears to be the potential for a vibrant and well-followed sport.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have direct contact with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine or is everything directed through Horse Racing Ireland?  If they have contact with the Department, what type of response are they getting on this matter?  Horse Racing Ireland has the remit to develop the entire horse industry across the country, so it should treat everybody equally and seek to foster and grow all horse-related activities.  That is vital.</p> <p>  The tracks must be all-weather tracks and Dundalk is one such track.  How many of the tracks in the country would be suitable for harness racing at present?  If the development of new tracks would be required to develop the sport, the witnesses would be on a loser from the start due to the financial constraints.</p> <p>  Also, with regard to the road racing that has been mentioned by other members, does the IHRA have any contacts with the road racing community or has it spoken to its members about how it could assist or, perhaps, bring them on board, or is it too early in its development for that to happen?  I believe it would be worthwhile and would make sense, given that a witness spoke about the final race on the card being for amateurs and open to people to enter and test themselves.</p> <p>  Overall, the industry appears to be positive and is one that should be supported.  I look forward to the responses to our questions.</p></speech>

I never thought of trotting happening on grass tracks.  Does it only take place on dirt tracks or can it take place on grass tracks?  With regard to it taking place on grass tracks, I was the marketing manager of a racecourse for ten years and I ran a grass track and protecting the turf for all our meetings was a full-time occupation.  If I was running a race track and the witnesses approached me, it would be different because there are wheels involved.  The weather here means there is a great deal of rain and there is soft ground, going to good ground, as a result.  Perhaps the witnesses will comment on that.</p><p> I was appalled to see in the presentation that HRI had the power to come between the IHRA and a private race track.  If Deputy Eamon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v owns the race track in Galway, for example, the delegates cannot ask him if they can pay him to use it.  He said, "I wish they did."  I have been involved in different parts of the horse industry.  My daughter is a showjumper, but we do not hang out or have anything to do with the showing or eventing people, even though we are all involved in the horse industry.  They are different bodies.  In the case of thoroughbreds, flat racing and national hunt racing are two different worlds.  Tillage farming is different from dairy farming and beef production is different from sheep production.  It is, therefore, not simple.  Horses have four legs, but we all live in different worlds that are worlds apart.</p><p> Does the industry have a business plan for the Government?  I would love to see it.  Representatives of the thoroughbred industry appear before the committee and have an amazing record.  The industry is ranked as one of the best in the world.  We have the best breeders, export many amazing thoroughbreds and the industry employs an amazing number of people in rural areas.  Do the delegates have a projected plan for who the industry might employ?  I am also anxious to hear a projection for betting and tax revenue and what the delegates think could happen.  Then, to be honest, it would be a no-brainer and we would have to put a case, if people want to have this sport in this country.</p><p> What will we do?  The track in Dundalk was a great success, but what other tracks are there?  It cannot all be based in Dundalk.  The rest of Ireland must be considered.</p><p> Let us say I wished to become involved in trotting.  How would I get my horses fit?  Obviously, if I intended to train them, I would wish to train them in a trotting fashion with a harness.  Would I have to work them on the road or would I need a track?</p><p> I echo the sentiments of other committee members.  I, too, am interested to hear how we could help with sulky racing and bring in those involved in order that we can stop the obvious cruelty that has been occurring.  It would be wonderful to get the veterinarian and welfare side right in order that sulky racing could be brought under control.  I am interested in hearing any further commentary on that issue the experts may have to make.</p></speech>

It seems ridiculous that the two cannot be married to deal with the problem.  However, there are infrastructural issues which have been highlighted.</p></speech>

Mr. Cooper said in his presentation that throughout Europe there was a proper, functioning trotting industry that was well supported and integrated into the community.  We do not have that here.  While we race horses and have the tracks in Portmarnock, we do not have the support of the Government or funds.  There is no road racing in France, Sweden or elsewhere.  That is because these countries have properly structured harness racing that is supported by the government and well integrated.  That is missing in this country.</p> <p>  There are members of the Traveller community involved in harness racing.  We do not prevent anybody from participating.  As long as one fits the criteria to apply for a licence, one can own a horse.  Billy Roche is our leading driver this year.  He will represent Ireland in Vincennes in France in the first week of December in an international race.  He will wear the Irish colours in Vincennes which has one of the biggest race tracks in the world.  It holds 60,000 people and is spectacular.  Billy Roche is a settled Traveller and a tangible success story.  There was a background where he might have been on the road five or six years ago, but he integrated and saw the potential of the sport.  He enjoys his racing.</p><p>He is now the leading driver in Portmarnock and has represented this country in Vincennes in France.  We also have eight drivers competing at Argentan in France at the end of November, where they will race against eight of the top drivers in France.  We are competing on an international level and Dr. &Oacute; Scanaill will confirm that the association is doing everything with regard to veterinary controls and testing procedures.  We are doing all of this but we are not funded.  We tested at every single race in Dundalk for 1,000 different products and all the tests were negative.  We have a sport trying to do its best on a professional level but not getting the support or the funding.</p></speech>

The facilities at the Dundalk track are outstanding.  The head of the European Trotting Union, UET, and the general secretary and the CEO of French racing visited the facilities at Dundalk.  They were amazed by the Dundalk track which is one of the best tracks in Europe for thoroughbreds and for harness racing.  They were impressed that the track was floodlit.  Premium harness racing meetings could be held at that venue and we could get &euro;50,000 upwards in revenue per meeting.  Projected figures from French meetings would show &euro;75,000 per meeting.  The thoroughbred industry gets &euro;40,000 per race meeting.  The French betting agency, PMU, has given us clearance for 2016 and all we are waiting for is clearance from HRI.  Legislation allows HRI to dictate to privately owned racetracks what events they can and cannot hold.</p></speech>

We have been looking at this issue for the past couple of years and we have brought it to the attention of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission on the basis of a number of issues, including the reference to authorised racetracks in that is it anti-competitive.  Dundalk is a privately owned racetrack and its board is very much in favour of having us there.  However, up until the end of September, HRI had the ability, which it exercised, to say it was an authorised racetrack and, therefore, it would not be permit this to happen.</p></speech>

We race on grass.  Many of the tracks in France are grass and are shared facilities where a thoroughbred would race on them and a trotting race would also race on them.  The wheel does not make any difference; it is the hoof prints and our hoof prints are the same as a thoroughbred hoof prints.  As long as it is not soft-going then we are more akin to what the flat horse needs where we need fast-going, but we can also go on soft ground.  In the UK there is an annual two day race meeting at the Musselburgh racecourse and there are no problems there, but we seem to have a problem with allowing both types of racing in Ireland.</p> <p>  We would like to put a plan in place around Ireland to have race meetings in Sligo, Limerick, Kerry, Wexford and Waterford.  This gives everybody a chance to participate.  This sport is known as a working man's sport all over Europe.  It is accessible for the working man or a husband and wife.  I have attended races in France over the last number of years and it is amazing to see couples coming to the races in their sulky and the husband racing the horse in the evening where the prize money on offer can be &euro;14,000; the minimum prize money in France is &euro;10,000.  The programme they have is unreal.</p> <p>  The French agencies are supporting us by giving us some prize money - they provide a third of the prize money for French trotting racing at the moment - but they also provide us with an arrangement where we subsidise the buying of race horses.  We signed an agreement with the French two years ago which allows for the breeding of a horse in Ireland which is then permitted to go back and race in France.  In France international races only account for 10% of the calendar and 90% of races are for French owned horses.  However, if a horse is bred in Ireland through the Trotteur Fran&ccedil;ais programme it is allowed to enter races in France with a prize fund totalling nearly &euro;230 million.  There is also a huge breeder streaming programme which generates &euro;29 million in breeder's fees.  If a horse is bred in Ireland but races in France a breeder would receive a breeding premium because of the signed agreement with France which allows us to breed horses in Ireland.  This is a huge opportunity for the industry in Ireland.</p></speech>

They are frequently used for PMU meetings and as a commentator I could call a trotting meeting on a grass track at Dieppe or other tracks around the country.  Therefore, a number of those meetings do go on a normal racetrack particularly in summer.</p></speech>

It is similar to training an event horse or a single horse.  Trotting is akin to eventing and show jumping where the trainer has just one or two horses.  It is not like being Willie Mullins or Tony Martin where a large space is required.  Trotters use small tracks in their own fields and it is a summertime sport.  It is a little like eventing where one will also go out onto the road to trot the horse, or when one gets a hunt horse ready one will use the road somewhat.  But broadly it is in fields and in the same way they build a <i>menage</i>they will also build a track.  There are plenty of tracks around where neighbours share the facility.<br/><br/>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v and Senator O'Brien made reference to the matter of welfare.  When any child or any young person minds a horse it usually brings out the good in that person and anything that encourages that is good.  When some people look at the road racing they say it is all bad but it is not.  There are many very good children involved who have nothing else to do but they do have an interest in keeping horses.  It is educating those children and bringing them in to a fold.  This is a huge step forward.</p></speech>

They will provide a week of education about trotting in France.  They are supporting us to send young people there annually to learn more about that aspect of the sport.</p><p>Deputy Ferris mentioned the competition issue.  It was interesting that at Horse Racing Ireland this morning we were talking about the Dundalk meeting.  One of the bookmakers who was there that day elected to offer betting on the Curragh.  He was also racing that afternoon.  The problem was he did not take a bet.  He actually said the bookmakers supervised it.  They said he did not take a bet.  It is totally separate, from a competition perspective, it is horses and gambling but it is a totally different coach and a totally different set of people who are involved, with the result that bookmakers could say they want to bet on it, as in the Curragh, but there is no interest from the said group of people.</p></speech>

We have the tracks.  For now we can use Dundalk.  We have a five year plan but when we can demonstrate that we can create revenue then the race tracks will come.  We can use tracks around the country and we can use Dundalk.  Dundalk is an interim solution.  In five years time I see us as having our own dedicated harness racing tracks.</p></speech>

We have had our eyes wide opened by much of what they have said.  I suggest they submit to the secretariat the five year plan and also the observations on the Horse Racing Ireland Bill 2015 for the members as it is coming before the House this evening and will be discussed tomorrow and probably next week again on Second Stage.  Committee Stage it is scheduled to come before this committee in December.  All the proceedings today are on the public record so people will have an opportunity to observe them which, no doubt, they will.  The representatives have heard the flavour of the response - it is not patronising or anything else.  People have given their genuine objective observations of what they see.  It would seem fair that at least some financial token of acknowledgment would have been forthcoming.  I think the Minister did undertake to engage positively with them.  As a committee we have put it on our agenda to discuss privately, next week, how we can be supportive, if that is the will of the members of the committee.  We will keep the representatives informed of what we do in that vein.</p> <p>  Again I thank the representatives for appearing before the committee and giving us that insight into the sector.  Thinking about it, I hitched around a good part of Australia a long time ago.  The only problem I had was that none of those fellows with the horse floats and a sulky on the back would stop to give one a lift.  Other than that I did go to the races in Melbourne when I was over there, it was like going to the dogs.  It was a completely different experience but very exciting.</p></speech>

There are three schedule B proposals for decision.  COM (2015) 322 is a proposal for a Council decision establishing the position to be taken by the European Union within the General Council of the World Trade Organization on the accession of the Republic of Kazakhstan to the WTO.  COM (2015) 464 is a proposal for a Council decision establishing the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the General Council of the World Trade Organization on the United States' request for a WTO waiver to extend the AGOA programme.  COM (2015) 483 is a proposal for a Council decision establishing the position to be taken by the European Union within the ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization as regards an extension of the moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions and the moratorium on non-violation and situation complaints.  COM (2015) 501 is a proposal for a Council decision establishing the position to be taken on behalf of the European Union within the Council for Trade in Services of the World Trade Organization to seek approval for preferential treatment going beyond market access to be unilaterally offered by the European Union to services and services suppliers of least developed countries on the basis of the LDC Services Waiver.  It is proposed that the proposals listed in schedule B do not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  I propose the suspension of the meeting for a few minutes to allow witnesses to take their seats.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

In addition to the report, I have given the secretariat a copy of the Department of Finance Red C six-monthly surveys.  These show an improvement in SMEs trends from the low point of the downturn in Q1 2013.  My report also welcomes the improvement my reviewers see in the trading figures of SMEs and farms which used the Credit Review Office during this period.  Profits have returned and businesses are now beginning to rebuild their capital &ndash; sometimes from a very low base.<br/><br/>The main finding in the survey, and from feedback from the banks and the SME trade bodies, is the lack of demand for credit.  I hope this will start to improve as confidence returns to the market.  The survey results show that banks are lending, at least to those applicants who make a formal request for credit.  In my view the banks are playing their part in assisting the recovery and are helping the majority of SMEs and farms which request credit.  Banks have returned to being prudent cash-flow lenders but security is also required.  The SME or farmer needs to show a credible plan as to how the cash is to be generated to repay the borrowing and then will need to pledge some tangible assets to ensure that the debt can be covered.  Much work has been done - a lot more work needs to be done - on raising the financial management capabilities in smaller SMEs and farms to meet the information demands of the &quot;new normal&quot; in banking today.  This should not be viewed as onerous, as the information the banks request is largely the basics of what is required to run a business.<br/><br/>The 2014 report of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation<font color="#545454"> </font>on access to finance for small and medium enterprises recommended that mentoring and coaching in the SME sector should take place.  The SME-related State bodies such as the Credit Review Office, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, Microfinance Ireland and the Supporting SMEs team have been working with each other and with the three SME trade organisations.  They have undertaken extensive seminars with their members.  In addition, each of the banks has been conducting extensive mentoring for their SME customers.<br/><br/>All of the cases with which the Credit Review Office deals involve some degree of financial challenge.  We in the Credit Review Office receive good co-operation from the banks in trying to find a solution to these challenges where such a solution can be identified.<br/><br/>My report also identifies that the supply side has stabilised with the announcement that Ulster Bank will remain in Ireland, with Permanent TSB entering the SME market, and the arrival of a number of new small asset finance and creditor finance suppliers, and the developing presence of SBCI.  The 2014 report also recommended the establishment of non-banking funding alternatives, and a trade body has now been established and can be accessed at <i>, </i>which has brought all of these alternative providers together for the first time.<br/><br/>Ireland has a strong story to tell in its support of the SME sector and, as per the recommendation contained in this committee's report in 2014, we continue to work closely with colleagues from SBCI, Microfinance Ireland, the credit guarantee scheme, Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices, LEOs, in addition to assisting the development of the Supporting SMEs online tool <i></i>and the communications campaign relating to it.</p><p> I will now speak about some of the challenges SMEs and farms continue to face.  Some SMEs and farms remain in a weakened state and find it difficult to meet the banks' criteria and risk appetites in areas such as the capital stake they are required to put into a transaction.  Banks will not take 100% of the risk in a lending deal.  Lack of capital or equity remains the biggest challenge to the SME sector in Ireland.  Also, recent improvements in SMEs' cashflows may not satisfy a lender looking for three years' sustained performance.  There is often the overhang of failed non-core or buy to let investment debt, although the committee's 2014 recommendation that legacy debt should not be allowed to bring down a viable business is being generally respected by the banks.  Given the turmoil many of the businesses and farms have been through, they may have a blemished credit bureau record, which can affect a bank&rsquo;s willingness to lend in some circumstances, particularly regarding asset finance.</p><p> Some SMEs, which were in default of their repayments or which had a high level of property-related debt, have had their loans sold on to new lenders such as hedge funds.  These loans were purchased at a discount and the likelihood is the new owners will take their profits at some point in the near or medium term by requiring a higher settlement figure or will take the value of the business through a receivership.  These businesses will need to access finance from one of the remaining players in the SME and farm market to repay this settlement figure.  While many of these businesses will be successful in obtaining refinance, some will still face some form of financing challenge.  The Credit Review Office will be required at least until these two challenges, namely, the recovery of weakened SMEs and SMEs which have had their debts sold on to other lenders are resolved.</p><p> The number of cases reviewed by the Credit Review Office remains low.  However, the number of cases being overturned by the banks in their own internal appeals process has increased and an increasing number of applicants are withdrawing from the Credit Review Office process to successfully renegotiate with the bank.  The nature of the cases being reviewed has changed considerably.  Since its inception in 2010, the average size of the credit facility being reviewed has increased from &euro;86,000 to &euro;341,000.  In addition to increased scale, we also see a large increase in complexity of the cases, with solutions for business and personal debt being sought.  In 2015, almost 30% of cases reviewed involved refinance of exiting banks or final restructuring by pillar banks.</p><p> Cases, while tracked as overturning bank decisions, more typically resemble a mediation or negotiation to find a solution satisfactory to the business and the bank rather than a straight black and white overturn.  This requires more comprehensive engagement by the reviewer with the borrower and bank.  Both banks have been co-operating well with this expanded model of engagement.</p></speech>

It is great to see some light at the end of the tunnel finally, and I commend the witnesses on their role over the past five years in trying to get there.  The potential expansion of the credit guarantee scheme to deal with the issues of legacy debt and debt which has been sold on is being considered.  What is the level of such cases coming to the Credit Review Office?  Has it dealt with any case where the new owner of a loan has moved to sell it on, or call it in, in unfair or unreasonable circumstances?</p><p> The Irish Credit Bureau will be a big issue and Mr. Trethowan has highlighted it on a number of occasions recently.  Does he have proposals to make in respect of it given the extent of the crisis in recent years?  Many people who once did so no longer have strong credit records and this may be as a result of circumstances outside their control.  Should we consider reforming the Irish Credit Bureau to account for the depth of the crisis in banking and its impact on businesses and individuals?</p><p> We have spoken briefly about it before but Mr. Trethowan's input into the Central Bank review of the code of conduct for business lending to SMEs was to the effect that the matter of personal guarantees needed to be addressed.  The submission from his office stated, "This is a major issue for SMEs and the almost universal requirement for SME credit facilities to be personally guaranteed is stymieing enterprise".  Will Mr. Trethowan expand on that view?  It is one with which I agree and which has been discussed by the small business review group.  Given his banking experience, what alternative would he offer?</p><p> In his submission, Mr. Trethowan stated, "An increasing number of applicants are withdrawing from the Credit Review Office process to successfully renegotiate with the bank."  Why were they not able to negotiate with the bank before they became involved in the process?  How many are involved?</p></speech>

The credit review process begins with a fact-finding process.  We spend a bit of time with the banks and ask them for their views on why the loan application was rejected but we spend a lot more time with the borrower, be it a small business person or a farmer, to get his or her view on life and to understand his or her business better.  As the process continues, sometimes we find that the reason for the decline of the loan application is not that well understood by the borrower.  Once he or she understands it, the borrower can provide answers or we see answers in the work we do with the borrower.  When the bank is made aware of these answers, the bank is prepared to lend.</p> <p>  Our objective is to ensure viable or potentially viable businesses have access to credit.  I do not mind if it goes through as a credit appeal or the bank decides it has enough information to make the loan of its own volition.  It does not appear in the figures and slightly distorts some of the work we do but the borrower has benefited from the process and has obtained credit.  I am not too worried if people withdraw and get credit as long as they do not withdraw and are lost, which is the concern.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Trethowan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015111000002#G00400"><p>That is a bank loan.  It was not done in the Credit Review Office.  The number of cases that would have got credit is slightly higher than appears in our figures.  However, my objective is not to have scores but, rather, people who are creditworthy accessing credit.  It is just that sometimes we have more time to understand the borrower's affairs and strengths and what is on offer than the bank has had in its first pass through.</p> <p>  On legacy debt, we are starting to see some of the refinancing requested being granted.  I must stress that the banks are stepping up to the mark and providing finance to get people out of these situations.  They are doing their bit.  However, as with applications for credit first time round, some businesses provide challenges to the banks' policies on how they do it.  We have to try to find a way forward in that regard.</p> <p>  I will give an example of a transaction to make the point.  At the height of the boom, someone may have bought property for &euro;4 million.  It was worth &euro;4 million and the borrower was lent 100% of the cost.  That property could have fallen in value by 50% to &euro;2 million.</p><p>The hedge fund may have purchased that loan for &euro;1.5 million and will want to take its profit.  It will examine the value of the asset today, which might be &euro;2.2 million.  The hedge fund people will say that is what they want to take them out of the debt and the person has to find that amount, which means finding a bank that is going to lend &euro;2.2 million against an asset of &euro;2.2 million.  To a bank, that is 100% gearing; it is taking the whole risk.  If the borrower has no other assets or security he or she can pledge, the bank is then stuck with that.  Banks are generally happy to lend up to approximately 70% of a loan.  They would be looking for somewhere in the region of &euro;1.5 million to lend, and it would be up to the borrower to find the other 30%.  That is where much of the challenge arises.  The Government credit guarantee scheme and the adjustments that are being made to it can be helpful.  Where we can see it is viable but the gearing is wrong, the adjusted credit guarantee scheme will be able to help cover the shortfall if the bank is minded to do it.  It helps to close the gap.</p><p> On the credit bureau reform question, I will hand over to Ms Collins because she knows a lot more about it than I.  There are some reforms under way.  The Central Bank is working on a project which, I think, will deliver a new system in a year or two.  Ms Collins will be able to give the committee a bit more of a feel for how credit bureau information is being used.</p></speech>

The banks give very quick answers on those decisions.  They look at the credit bureau information and if there is a chequered history, the answer will generally be "No" and will come very promptly in the form of a same-day response.  An SME loan is more complex.  The banks will look in more depth at the business and its ability to generate cash.  They will take into account what has happened with the credit bureau.</p> <p>  There is no way for the credit bureau to assess whether a borrower is co-operating or not.  The bank may have agreed a different repayment schedule during the hard times but that will be seen as a black mark on the credit bureau record.  Sometimes one has to dig down through that and explain it.  That is the work some of our reviewers would do when we are taking on a case.  It is one issue for the borrowers to understand.</p> <p>  Very few people are aware of what is on their credit bureau record.  The new credit register, which, I understand, is going to be available in 2016 for consumers and at the end of 2017 for incorporated entities, will give one free report each year to each individual or entity.  That will be good as people will become more aware of it.  We found the lack of awareness to exist even on a personal basis.  People who may have had problems with their mortgages, for example, might go to Harvey Norman to buy a washing machine and find they cannot get it on tick because they have a bad credit bureau record, and that is the first they know about it.</p> <p>  There is an education piece for businesses to learn how important it is to keep the record clean and to work with it.  This is just in respect of the credit register and the credit bureau; we are not even talking about credit scoring, which is another kettle of fish.  There is a whole body of advice on how to make sure one's credit score is kept in the right way.  We will have to get into that when the credit register comes on stream.</p></speech>

The more one misses, the more it can be seen in the outputs of these things.  It is not just about defaulting on a loan and not paying it back.  If payments are missed, people can see that.  I have attended some events in Europe in respect of credit registers and credit bureaus.  Some 30% of people know what their credit score or credit bureau record looks like.  It is very important for businesses to understand what they do and how it can affect their credit bureau record going forward as well.</p></speech>

When the Central Bank code was being reviewed, we made the comment that it was almost universal to be asked for a personal guarantee as well as everything else.</p><p>A banker lending a reasonable amount money would want some sort of security.  A personal guarantee is only worth the assets one has to back it up.  I could give a guarantee for &euro;5 billion but it would not be worth a penny.  If a small business or limited company has challenges or a lack of equity but there are some personal assets held by the promoter of the business, a guarantee can help get this across the line.  I would be against a <i>de facto</i>or blanket request for personal guarantees.  This is what was reflected in the response to the Central Bank and in that press article.  <br/><br/>I am not seeing as many requests at the moment for appeals because personal guarantees have been asked for, although in the Red C survey, it is something like-----</p></speech>

For a long time, my view has been that the banking market in Ireland has been an oligopoly.  It is a very limited supply side and, therefore, it is a suppliers' market with regard to the entire banking system.  I think Mr. Trethowan alluded to how tight it is when he said that it was obviously useful that Ulster Bank had not left the SME sector.  Usually the competitive behaviour of firms is improved when there is more competition.  Does Mr. Trethowan think it would be a good idea, on a policy basis, for a Government to increase the number of players within the supply side of a banking sector?  Allied to that is the fact that SCBI funds and credit guarantee funds seem to be pushed through those banks and this again limits access to those funds.  Would it not be better for those funds to be delivered outside that sector in some way?</p> <p>  Why has the credit guarantee scheme been so disastrous with regard to outputs?  I know a business person who sought to cut a deal with his bank and offered the bank 50% of the value of the loan.  The bank refused it and the businessman is of the view that the bank then sold the loan for 30%.  This is a disaster for the business person and the bank is not necessarily realising the maximum amount for that fund.  There should be a mechanism where businesses can have a better opportunity to cut a deal and negotiate with a bank.</p> <p>  Mr. Trethowan's figures are very interesting.  It is good to see that some sectors are improving but does he have a sectoral analysis of the health of enterprise?  It seems that SMEs in the construction sector had a fierce amount of legacy debt - the great majority of it - and yet we still hear they are finding it difficult to get the necessary finance to construct properties.  What is the problem here?  </p> <p>  It seems amazing that the balance sheets of the banks are still contracting.  Are they contracting as a result of Government policy?  I know that, initially, the objective was that they would contract significantly.  Do they still have to contract to meet that policy objective or it is outside of that?</p></speech>

Had it not chosen to do so we would have had only two banks supplying the market.  PTSB will enter the market, but as it is coming from a low base, it will take a while for it to establish a market share.  Ulster Bank is different in that it already has a fair chunk of the market.  The two dominant Irish banks, probably, command, at least, 80% of the market at this time.</p><p> Policy wise, the Government has set up the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the venture capital arm Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF.  We deal mostly with the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  The Deputy is correct that it provides cheap funding via the banks and that the loans that are SBCI-funded remain on the banks' balance sheets, such that they are involved in the credit decision and carry the risk if something goes wrong.  The Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland has only been operational for over a year.  Its first offering was cheaper funding, which funding is channelled from the European Union to the Irish banks.  It now proposes to provide that funding through other providers also.  In this regard, I know that Mr. Nick Ashmore is in discussions with lenders outside of the two main Irish banks, but they will need to be given time to become established and get moving.  There will be other SBCI offerings, as well as funding, with a start already having been made.  </p><p> The Deputy asked about the reason the credit guarantee scheme "mark one", as I call it, failed.  It did not fail completely because we had used it a few times to help to get deals across the line with the banks.  There were some issues around what could be covered.  For example, re-financing was not covered under the initial scheme.  There was an issue for the banks in how the risk was divided up, an issue which was quite complex, but it has been dealt with.  It is hoped the revisions provided for in the follow-on scheme will make it less risky for the banks to provide lending through it.  It is also hoped this matter will progress through the Houses reasonably soon in order that we can get it in place quickly because we will need it when re-financing really gets going on hedge funds also.</p><p> On the settlement of debt, while blocks of debt have been sold off by all of the banks, there have been many personal debt settlements during the years.  Bank of Scotland Ireland, through Certus, has been settling debts with people and has even done deals which have involved discounts.  Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks have also been dealing with debt settlements.  It peaked in 2014 when the majority of debts in AIB, for instance, were settled, but there remains a tail lag of cases to be processed.  What is key in this regard is that the bank made the first and final offer and it was only when that offer was not accepted, that difficulties arose.  </p><p> On block sales, they were strategic sales made by the banks to correct their capital ratios.  The banks needed to unload debts from their balance sheets and I do not think they could have done this by providing for personal debt settlements only.  They had to do something to correct the ratios.  </p><p> The Deputy also asked about construction.  In 2012, in terms of the business of the Credit Review Office, we were focused on trying to ensure as many people as possible survived.  We dealt with many cases that were construction-related but which related in the main to subcontractors rather than contractors.  Many subcontractors had one or two big debtors on their balance sheets and when the debtors went bust, the subcontractors were left high and dry and there was not much that could have been done to help them.  We saw many good businesses wiped out, although we did try to get some forbearance and leeway for them.</p><p>It is very difficult for subcontractors to recover when they have lost 50%, 60% or 70% of their debtor book, especially when they have men who need to be paid on a Friday.</p><p> The banks are now starting to look at financing building developments and matters of that nature but they are not doing the huge ones they would have done in 2007 or 2008.  People have been burnt badly.  It is now done on a more phased basis.  A number of units will be financed and sold.  The proceeds will start to flow and the next phase gets financed as well.  That is the sort of model we are starting to see come through in the appeals we see.</p><p> The Deputy is right about balance sheet contracting.  Based on the surveys carried on the demand side, demand is still subdued.  The banks have been completing their restructuring, which included writing down debt either through sales to these hedge fund-type operators or to individuals.  Between the amount of repayments being made by businesses just deleveraging themselves - those that can afford to do so - and the debt that is being written down or sold off, it is far exceeding the demand for new credit.</p><p> As part of what we do when tracking the numbers of the two banks every month, we receive a funds-flow statement from them at the end of each calendar quarter and this shows where they started the year and quarter, how much interest they have been paid, how much lending they have put out and how much has been written off or repaid.  That covers the time from the start of the year to the end of the particular accounting period.  So we can see what is happening and how it is being deleveraged on the way through.  Until lending demand improves above 30%, the balance will always be tipped to contraction.</p></speech>

On the initiative from last year regarding the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland supported by the German state bank, KfW, I understand it will lend to Bank of Ireland and AIB.  Are those figures included in the report or has there been any analysis of the position in this regard?  If, through the normal processes, these banks refuse a loan, I understand they are obliged to mention it to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  I am obliged to ask whether this is being monitored because I understand that in certain cases that to which I refer has not happened.</p> <p>  Mr. Trethowan stated that this is the most positive report since the inception of the Credit Review Office and that we continue to see improving trends in turnover and profitability in the majority of businesses.  He also pointed to an increase in the number of loans being approved by internal bank processes.  Is that down to a relaxation on behalf of the banks, or an improvement in the business cases, profitability, turnover or whatever?</p> <p>  Does Mr. Trethowan believe some of the easier cases are being dealt with internally and that the Credit Review Office is still getting the ones that are more difficult and more outlandish by lenders that have less by way of reserves?  Mr. Trethowan mentioned that Ulster Bank and the PTSB voluntarily joined the Credit Review Office's processes.  When did that happen?  Does he have any early data on that, particularly on Ulster Bank?</p> <p>  The two previous speakers referred to selling on loans.  Yesterday, I spoke to someone whose loan has been sold on.  We have heard that some loans have been sold on for 20 cent in the euro.  Is there an obligation for information to be disclosed in this regard or is such information viewed as being commercially sensitive and case specific?  Does Mr. Trethowan think those involved in the sale should be obliged to pass on that information to the original borrower?</p></speech>

As I said before, the bank holds the risk.  The SBCI provides cheaper funding.  Typically, it is around 4.5% and banks will charge perhaps around 6.5% or 7%, so it is a cheaper form of funding.  The credit risk still remains with the bank.  If the loan goes wrong, it is a bad debt for the bank not for SBCI, so it is held on its balance sheet.  Some of the SBCI money will now start to be put out through alternative lenders.  I have some information on a slide from the presentation relating to purchase of stock right through to customer payment.  One can see there are a number of players at each stage of the business cycle.  Some of those companies will now start to get some of the funding through SBCI.  They will have to be approved by SBCI but there is more than just the four banks that are making SME lending.</p></speech>

SBCI approves people who have to go through a vetting process.  It will not be solely the two main banks that will be the channel for SBCI money.  It will largely go through them but there will be other alternatives as well.</p> <p>  I will speak about how some of that money can help.  If one has a deal which requires a credit guarantee scheme, it has an insurance premium which the borrower has to pay.  It is typically around 2% of the loan value, so there is a cost to the borrower to have his or her loan guaranteed by the Government but if one can get it with SBCI funding then it takes that cost back out again for the borrower.  We will be using all of those tools to try to help borrowers get across the line.</p></speech>

Last week it announced two additional lenders, one a leasing company, Merrion Fleet, and Finance Ireland.  There has been an announcement and it is in discussion with Bibby Ireland.  That was in the newspapers last June.  SBCI is looking at non-banking lenders.  That is step 2.  Step 1 was to get the money out into the market at a cheaper rate.  Step 2 is very much to encourage new entrants to the market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.136" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Trethowan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2015111000002#M00800"><p>The next question relates to improved sanctioning levels.  I can answer the question but I cannot be specific with numbers because they are commercially sensitive, not just for each bank on the market but between each bank because they are competing with each other as well.  The sanctioned amounts have come back slightly this year because of the level of restructuring which went on last year was included in those.  The amounts have decreased this year but the key thing is the amount of new money which the banks are making within those sanctioned figures has increased.  Last year it was slightly less than 40% and now it is in the mid-40s as a composite number so the new money that has gone out there, which is very positive, is increasing as well, as are the number of sales or loans both banks are making.</p> <p>  In terms of the challenge to lending, I will reiterate that the key challenge for SMEs and firms is a lack of capital.  We are seeing balance sheets with negative capital on them far too often.  It is a case now of trying to get those to make some profit, keep it in the business and to restructure the capital accounts of those businesses.  The other thing we see a lot of is directors' loans.  Balance sheets may have a challenge on them, including huge directors' loans.  These are salaries that the owners of the business did not take out for a number of years.</p><p>We always have to ask the business owner to subordinate that to the bank lending because if they take that out of the business, the balance sheet falls over.  That is another condition which has to be met.  The bank needs to come first, if it lent the money.</p><p> Ulster Bank and Permanent TSB joined the process voluntarily during the summer.  I do not believe we have yet had any cases from Ulster Bank.  It does have a reference to the office on its decline letters.</p></speech>

One point about the Credit Review Office is that no matter how many or how few cases we have, it must be remembered that just being here puts a discipline on the banks.  They do not know who is going to come to us and what we will find.  Over the course of the past five years, it has improved the behaviour of the banks, especially in the first few years.  Being here is enough of a safeguard.</p> <p>  On the sold-on percentages, as there are so many deals done at so many rates and it would be commercially sensitive to each bank, I do not know the answer to that.</p></speech>

We have all heard the radio adverts and so forth.  Is there any analysis of where people would have heard of the service?</p> <p>  He made reference to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and welcomed its establishment.  Are there any ways of making its offerings more attractive or is it too early to comment on that?  I understand Mr. Trethowan meets quarterly with the Department of Finance on the progress made in loan sanctioning by the pillar banks.  Is risk assessment part of that review?  He has welcomed the banks&rsquo; lending performance, but, like many people, there is a fear of going back to the boom-and-bust cycle of the past.  Is he satisfied with the lending performance of the banks?</p> <p>  Mr. Trethowan highlighted the need for improved awareness among small and medium-sized enterprises and their advisers of the advantages of checking that their credit information is accurate.  Is there anything this committee can do to assist the Credit Review Office in raising awareness in this area?</p></speech>

It is, unfortunately, very expensive to do a lot of such advertising.  Interestingly, most of the calls we get tell us that they heard it on the radio.  What we have found is that if people are looking for finance, they tend to hear the advertisement.  If they are not actually in the market for finance, however, the radio advertisement is white noise in the background and they do not take it in.  It is quite hard to get that message across.  We drill down beyond that and try and work with the various trade bodies.</p> <p>  We also advertise online and in the trade magazines.  We work closely with the three trade bodies, as well as the other SME initiatives the Government has put in place.  A gang of four of us provide a roadshow, talking to local chambers of commerce and the local enterprise offices.  Our key focus is the accountancy bodies and the advisers to get information out to them because they can then tell their clients about it too.  A comprehensive amount of work is being done in this area.  We will go out with Microfinance Ireland and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to talk about the credit guarantee scheme and the supporting SME&rsquo;s online tool.  We will do an hour-long presentation to SMEs to show how all these tools can be used together to provide a more powerful access to finance.  That is what we are doing on the communications front to get the message out.  However, it is a hard message to get across.</p> <p>  Many of those who call the helpline tell us the banks did not tell them about the Credit Review Office.  They tend to read the first line in the rejection letter that they did not get the facility.  They may not necessarily drill down to the end to see the reference to the Credit Review Office or see our green brochure enclosed.</p><p>Sometimes things get lost in translation.</p></speech>

There is much work to be done on raising capability, especially for smaller businesses, and much hard work has been done by the three main small business trade bodies already and that will continue.  As I said in my presentation, the banks do a lot of mentoring and provide a lot of self-help advice on their web pages.  I know from experience that those who seek that help are probably not the people who need it the most.  It is the people who do not go to trade shows or read the advice available on the websites of banks that need the most help.  Many farmers who have come to us have not used the Teagasc advisory service but if they had done so, they probably would not have had to come to us in the first place.  The issue is trying to reach the people who do not engage because they are probably the ones who need the most help.</p> <p>  The SBCI offerings were mentioned.  That is a question for the SBCI because it is a different organisation which works in this area.  We work closely with it but it will decide what it is going to do next on the offering side.  There will be more offerings.  One must start somewhere and the funding line was the first product that it issued.  It will develop other offerings as time goes on.  </p> <p>  The Senator asked about policy.  If there are policy gaps, perhaps that is where the SBCI can start to think about funding lines.</p> <p>  I will return to my old hobby horse.  The main challenge for many small businesses and farms is a lack of capital.  However, capital of more than &euro;3 million is available for larger businesses but most of the businesses that we see - this applies to the vast majority of SMEs in Ireland - need capital of between &euro;50,000 and &euro;1 million.  It becomes very difficult to assess a business for venture capital when there are not big numbers behind it.  We need a product to try to help bridge the capital deficit and at the moment, the loan guarantee scheme is a sort of pseudo instrument to do so.  Perhaps the SBCI can provide such a product somewhere down the line.</p> <p>  The Senator is right that we meet the banks every quarter.  I will meet the Bank of Ireland tomorrow and AIB next week, along with the Department of Finance.  We will go through their figures for the quarter.  We will also discuss how the banks see the market and what challenges they see because they are on the front line.  That will provide us with interesting information which will be reflected in the reports the committees will see.</p> <p>  I do not think we will have a boom to bust landing because lessons have been learned.  Bankers are contrite at this point in time and until such time as someone encourages them to increase their return on equity, increase their dividends or whatever, then I cannot see things moving forward.  Certainly, the Central Bank now has hawk eyes on the lending quality as well.  In fact, some of the things we do and suggest to the banks would probably lean against the far edge of what their risk tolerance would be for lending but we still think the deals are doable.</p> <p>  The last time I was here there had been a bit of a spat on the loan defaults and appeals of the Credit Review Office but we pushed back a bit.  We have worked with the banks in a more mature fashion since then.  In terms of the deals we suggest and which the banks do, some of them will be stressed from time to time.  All of the cases that come to us are challenged before we get them.  In most parts, the lending is still there and the banks are not taking huge losses on what we suggest that they do and it is reasonably safe.  I think I have answered all of the Senator's questions.</p></speech>

The United Kingdom has a different procedure and does much more credit scoring and there are companies that provide credit scores and train others how to achieve a better credit score.  One will hear advertising campaigns on the radio and see campaigns on the television for that service.</p> <p>  The Credit Bureau comprises members who come together and put the information on lenders or regulated entities up and they can run their reports on what has been happening.  As I understand it, the credit register will be a slightly bigger animal as it will also include information on credit union lending.</p> <p>  The banks are telling us is that they will take a certain amount of that into account.  When the bureau gets a report from that, it gives the lending history of the customer in the past five years, stating whether the customer is in arrears, has defaulted, reached a settlement, and whether the legals were involved.  An individual can sign on and download his or her own credit report, which I think costs &euro;6. There is a very low awareness of this service and people do not realise that this may be the sticking point, when they are looking for credit.   </p> <p>  The credit register is coming down the track and it will provide a service for individuals in late 2016-17, but it will be late 2017 to early 2018 before incorporated entities are included.  There will be one free report every year which will be a big plus, because people will be able to see that report without even having to pay a small fee for it.  I hope some awareness raising will happen at that time and people will know a little bit more about it.</p> <p>  Credit scoring is all about trying to assess the risk of the loan going into default.  Information such as the number of credit applications that have been made will have an impact.  A person making a significant number of credit applications apparently gives that person a bad credit score.  In the United Kingdom it depends on a person's postal code and if one has the correct postal code, one has a much better credit score and if one has the wrong postal code one has a very poor credit score.  I am not sure how that will work in this country.  We are a much smaller country and we do not have the same scale.  I am not sure statistically how that would work if one tried to replicate that model here.  What the banks in Ireland tend to do is to look at the actual performance, how one has performed in terms of repayments of the lending and so on, rather than actual scores..</p></speech>

These countries are probably the most advanced in this field.  A lender can see whatever he or she needs to see about a business.  Across Europe, with credit bureaus and credit registers, it is a bit of a mishmash.  I do not think that we are that far behind.  The work being done by the Central Bank, which Ms Collins described, will bring us back up.  If the Senator is interested, the French and the Dutch are the two countries that have really cracked it.

No. 156 of 2007)) the form specified in the <i>Schedule</i>.(2) Regulation 7 of, and the Fifth Schedule to, the Electoral Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 156 of 2006) are revoked.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>I will address the error to which the Vice Chairman has referred in my speaking notes.  Government amendment No. 1 provides for a revised form of ballot paper to be used at D&aacute;il elections.  This amendment will have the effect of replacing the current format of the ballot paper for D&aacute;il elections that is specified in the Electoral Regulations 2007.  Regulation 5 and the Fifth Schedule to those regulations will be revoked.  Part 2 of the Fourth Schedule to the Electoral Act 1992 will be replaced by the Schedule to this Bill.  I take this opportunity to inform the committee that the reference to the Electoral Regulations 2007 in section 4(2) in the amendment, as published, is incorrect.  It should read &quot;S.I. No 156 of 2007&quot;, not 2006.  This will be corrected in the next publication of the Bill.</p><p>Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are technical in nature to facilitate the insertion of the new section 4 in the Bill.  As I said during the debate on Second Stage, the Minister committed last April to a review of the ballot paper for D&aacute;il elections.  At that time Deputy Stanton raised concerns about voters misplacing their marks on the ballot paper.</p><p>At present, political party emblems are placed along the left-hand side of the ballot paper.  In the case of non-party candidates the space for the emblem is required to be left blank.  It is reported that some voters express their voting preferences by placing their marks in these boxes in the left-hand column.  While it is understood that such marks may not necessarily make a ballot paper invalid we are of the view that any potential confusion should be eliminated where possible.</p><p>In the review of the D&aacute;il election ballot paper officials in the Department also consulted with the National Adult Literacy Association and with the National Council for the Blind.  Both of these organisations assisted my Department in producing a revised form of ballot paper for use at the referendums last May.  The revised form of the ballot paper should help voters to avoid misplacing voting preferences and it should be more user-friendly for voters with visual and literacy difficulties.</p><p>The main change proposed is to move the space for including the emblem of a political party from the left-hand side of the ballot paper to a new location to the left-hand side of the photograph, and that can be seen on the ballot paper.  There will therefore be no boxes along the left-hand side of the ballot paper.  The boxes for marking will remain on the right-hand side of the ballot paper.  This should help voters avoid misplacing voting preferences as there is only one box that can be marked for each candidate after voters have read across, from left to right, all of the information on each candidate.  </p><p>The National Adult Literacy Association has confirmed the view that people read and work naturally from left to right so voters should start on the left reading the candidate details, then see the emblem and photograph, if provided, and then mark their preferences all on the right.  The boxes in which voters indicate their preferences will be &quot;floating boxes&quot; in order to draw the eye of the voter to the correct place for marking the ballot paper.  As members can note from the Schedule set out in amendment No. 4, these boxes will be emphasised with bold print on the borders. </p><p>With respect to other changes, the new format provides for two more small changes in the format.  On the recommendation of the National Council for the Blind, the use of italics in the instructions on the front of the ballot paper will cease and the parentheses around the name and occupation of the candidate will be removed.  The opportunity is also being taken to provide for both Irish and English to be used on the back of the ballot paper and the back of the counterfoil.</p></speech>

There is some confusion surrounding the ballot paper where political party emblems currently appear on the left-hand side of it.  Anything that improves the integrity of the electoral system is well worthwhile.  Is it the intention that this revised format would apply in all elections, namely, in general elections and local authority elections, in other words, in elections to the D&aacute;il, Seanad and local authorities?</p> <p>  A major issue related to electoral reform is emerging.  Some 60,000 plus people came on to the register in the run-up to the marriage equality referendum.  That indicates that 60,000 people, mainly young people we would assume, were not registered.  It is estimated there could be a further 300,000 people who are not registered and only three months or so remain before we will have a general election.  The only means for  many people to get their names on the register will be by way of a supplemental register and there is a confined period within so many days of an election that this can be done.  There is a cut-off point within 18 days of the election. There is a short window of opportunity for people register to vote in that way.  I ask the Minister of State to consider bringing forward enabling legislation to allow people to have their names added to the register of electors, and thereby retain the integrity of it.</p><p>At present, people must go to a Garda station in order to have a form for inclusion on the supplementary register completed.  The form is a bit more detailed and complicated than the ordinary registration form.  Local authorities could be allowed to accept forms once the applicants produce photographic identification, such as a driver's licence, an ID card, a passport or social welfare card.  It is probably a safer system than any other system.  If we could allow this to happen, it would help register some of those people who are not going to be on the register of electors for the general election.  I make that suggestion to the Minister of State today.  The change to the ballot paper is a move in the right direction.</p></speech>

There is a local hiatus in respect of this.  Promotional posters were circulated to registration authorities, Members of the Oireachtas, student unions and 48 organisations affiliated to the National Youth Council of Ireland.  Up-to-date information is published on <i>checktheregister.ie</i>.  The Department has daily communication with the registration authorities.  An advertisement is published in the national newspapers encouraging people to register.  The advertisement is similar to the poster.  The Department's website and Twitter account highlight the issue.  Online advertisements are published throughout the month of November on <i>herald.ie</i>, <i>myhome.ie</i>, Facebook and <i>rte.ie</i>.  The objective of the campaign is to encourage people to check the draft register of electors to ensure they are correctly registered and to inform the appropriate registration authority, namely, the local authority, of any errors or omissions.  This can be done on <i>checktheregister.ie</i>or directly with the local authorities.</p><p>In respect of the Garda, I know that it does cause difficulties.  Where the applicant establishes in writing that he or she is unable to progress the application in this way, the form can be signed by the applicant in the presence of an official of the registration authority who is satisfied as to his or her identity.  If they can bring identification, they can sign it in front of the registration authority.</p></speech>

It is at their discretion and a day earlier than the ballot in the rest of the country.  In Donegal in recent times, the ballot has been held two days earlier and one day earlier in Galway and Mayo.  Amazingly, it has been held on the same day as the rest of the country for a long time on the Cork islands.  The disadvantage of holding it a day earlier, particularly on islands, is that we normally hold elections on Friday.  Holding elections on Fridays is quite sensible.  The idea is that by holding an election on a Friday, people are given the maximum opportunity to get home to vote because there are many who work or study away from home who do not bother to get a postal vote and who want to cast their ballot at their local polling stations.  They return home at the weekend and vote.  The advantage for rural people who may be studying in Dublin and who are returning home of elections being held on Fridays is doubled in an island context.  This is because more individuals from the islands tend to work on the mainland.  It is not so easy to travel the 30 or 40 miles back home in the evening to vote - the person might only be working in Galway, so the distance involved would not be great - and return to the mainland the following morning.  There are 2,575 people registered to vote on the islands.  As of the most recent election, 1,155 people were registered to vote in Galway West, 760 people were registered to vote in Donegal, 194 people were registered to vote in Mayo and 466 people were registered to vote in Cork South West.  In other words, that is the position outlined by the electoral register at the most recent election and it would not have changed that dramatically since then.</p><p>The argument has been put forward that there would be a problem in getting ballot boxes to polling booths.  The first thing is that there is a discretion under the Act if one wishes to have a short polling day.  That is the situation on Inishfree and Gola.  They have three or four hours of polling as a result of the very small number of people who vote.  A total of 67 people are registered to vote on Inishbofin, nine are registered to vote on Inishfree and 25 people are registered to vote on Gola.  My understanding is that there have been short polling days on these islands and that there is no problem getting the boxes back as a result.</p><p>I approached the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht for data relating to the regularity of boat sailings.  It is very instructive to discover how things on the islands have improved dramatically.  Arranmore in Donegal has an average of seven return sailings per day and 2,464 return sailings per year.  The total number of non-sailings is 78.  These are return sailings that do not occur for one reason or another.  When I take out December and January, I suddenly find that the figure drops to 16.  In order to have an election in January, one would need to call it literally in the first week of that month.  If it was called at the end of January, the election would be in February.  It is unlikely that this Government or any other would call an election in the run-up to Christmas.  Therefore, when one looks at non-sailings, one can exclude the possibility of the two months of January and December.  One could probably exclude the early weeks of February as well.  What one will find is that the few non-sailings that happen take place in those days.  Since there are seven sailings per day, and this is the information I was a bit disappointed not to get even though I specifically asked for it, I reckon that in the 16 days during which there was a missed sailing - unless there were two days during which the entire seven did not occur - there were probably six sailings during those days so the boats actually sailed on all the days.  It just did not do all the sailings.  It might have missed an early or late sailing.  I think one could say there is never a day during which the boat does not get in from Arranmore.</p><p>When we consider the position in respect of Tory Island, which is probably the least accessible island, we find that there are 991 return sailings.  That is approximately three sailings per day.  The figure for non-sailings is 228, which is higher than any other island.  Again, when one excludes December and January, one finds that this drops to 130.  There is one difference in Donegal, which is that there is also an arrangement to have a helicopter service to the island so it would be very easy to make an arrangement for one extra helicopter trip to that island because there is a contract between the HSE and the Department to provide for helicopter services.  In the case of Tory Island - as already stated, this is probably one of the more difficult islands to reach - when one actually strips it down, allowing for three sailings per day, there will be very few days during which there is no sailing.  When one then takes the helicopter service into account, the problem is eliminated.</p><p>In the context of Inishbiggle, we find that in the period 2013 to 2014, out of 670 sailings, there were two sailings missing and there were none missing in the period 2014 to 2015.  Again, one sees double sailings per day so it is not a challenge.</p><p>I am sorry to go on at length but it is important that we put this on the record.  There are 626 sailings to Inishturk a year.  Again, there is a double sailing every day.  Of those, 89 sailings did not take place.  Two sailings did not necessarily take place on the one day; it might have been one sailing.  A total of 38 of the 89 non-sailings were in December and January, giving 53 non-sailings in the rest of the year.  In most cases, the boat would have sailed at least once in the day, either in the morning or in the evening.</p><p> There were 792 sailings to Clare Island.  A total of 58 return sailings did not happen but when I take out December and January, the number is down to 26.  If I took out the non-sailings for the first half of February, the figures would be a lot less.</p><p> I will deal first with the air service for the Aran Islands.  In 2013, the air service did not fly on only nine days.  The results I got were broken down day by day so I could extrapolate the information accurately.  If I take December and January out, there were only four days on which the air service did not fly.  They were probably foggy days.  The year of the big storms was 2014.  In that year, the air service did not fly on 19 days but 11 of those were again in December and January, which brought the number of days on which there was no air service to eight days.  This year, to date, there have been 12 days with no service and four of those days were in December and January.  On the days it is foggy between the mainland and the Aran Islands, which is one of the main reasons the planes cannot fly, that is the best day for the boat because the sea is as calm as glass.</p><p> The same pattern arises when we look at sailings to the Aran Islands.  There was a total of 744 sailings to Inis Me&aacute;in and Inis O&iacute;rr and 42 return sailings did not take place, but 28 of those were in December and January and 14 were in the rest of the year.  Unfortunately, there is not a contracted service to Inis M&oacute;r so I do not have figures, but I assure the Minister of State that the number of non-sailing days to Inis M&oacute;r are much less, if any, because there is a fantastic pier built there and it can take any weather, including a one in a 1,000 year storm.</p><p> The situation gets interesting when I look at the Cork islands.  The inshore islands in Cork have thousands of sailings with virtually a 100% record.  The number of non-sailings are very small.  For example, in Inis Arcain, Sherkin Island, there are 5, 616 sailings and there are 3,264 to Whiddy.  When I take the one island in Cork that is a little bit offshore, namely, Cape Clear or Oile&aacute;n Chl&eacute;ire, there are 900 sailings a year or three sailings a day, and again I get the same pattern.  A total of 31 non-sailings were recorded.  It is unlikely that no sailing took place on any given day.  It is more likely that one out of the three sailings was missed.  The same pattern emerges in that 14 of those days were in December and January, leaving 17 non-sailings out of a total of 988 sailings.  If one takes it that there were no sailings on Sundays, that means it is only a third of that, namely, six days in the year, or much more likely that one of the three sailings did not take place, either an early sailing or a late sailing.</p><p> The other interesting point is that in Cork the election has been held on the same day as in the rest of the country even though its rate of non-sailings is more or less comparable with the other islands.  I put it to the Minister of State that if it has worked for Cork, it will work for anywhere else.  In the event that an election is called on a day on which we have the greatest storm ever, as we had with Storm Debbie, it would not only be a problem on the islands, it would be a problem on the mainland, and an extremely serious problem too if we had a storm such as Hurricane Debbie in the 1960s or a major storm.  That would disrupt the voting much more than a bit of delay in getting back a ballot box.  If, by some rare chance, on the day of the election one could not get to the islands that are further out by boat, one could use a helicopter service.  There is no problem with them flying in the stormiest of weather because the Coast Guard helicopters can fly in virtually any weather.  Therefore, the situation that existed in the past before we put in all the piers and services is overruled by the statistics we now have that show the reliability of the transport services to the islands is tremendous.</p><p> I am curious to know what would be the statistical chance of having a very bad frost or snow storm in Wicklow, for example, that might prevent a ballot box being returned or might even prevent people from voting.  What would be done in that case?  We do not have a provision in the legislation to provide for any contingency.  There is no problem in getting the ballot boxes back in due course, so the worst case scenario is that one cannot get the boxes out.  If that happens, then one would not hold the final count until all the ballot boxes have been distributed.  One could ask what is the big deal.  In Galway West, it always takes two days and at the last election it took five days to count the votes.  One could ask if we are putting the expediency of the count ahead of the basic, fundamental right to vote.  We must ask ourselves that serious question.</p><p> Why should islanders be treated differently when there is such a small statistical chance of a problem arising?  Therefore, I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment and to ensure same-day voting on the islands as we have on the mainland.  It is important to recognise that we live in a vastly changed world with highly reliable services to the islands and that we have the backup of helicopters if we need them if there is an extreme weather event.</p></speech>

I appreciate his interest to facilitate voting by our island communities.  However, it is important that we keep sight of the key objective of ensuring that ballot boxes from island polling stations are at the count centre at 9 a.m. in the morning on the day of the count.  That is the No. 1 consideration.  It is not desirable that the count for any constituency should be unduly delayed because all the ballot boxes are not at the count centre.  The provisions in the electoral Acts are there to cater for that.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that cancellations of island ferry services are few and far between.  He has provided the statistics in that regard.  However, we must err on the side of caution and the fact is that cancellations happen and we must provide for such situations.  The returning officer in the constituency is best placed to decide on whether the poll should be taken on an island on an earlier date.  It would not, therefore, make sense to repeal section 85 of the Electoral Act 1992.  Notwithstanding the statistics and taking climate change into account, there are unpredictable climate change patterns and we must be aware of that.  We have, on occasion, checked the situation with the island ferry companies.  Ferries have been cancelled in Donegal, Mayo and Galway in extreme weather conditions.</p></speech>

These are inconvenient realities and we need to be in a position to prepare and react to them proportionately.</p><p>We have spoken to returning officers about these arrangements and their clear preference is to retain flexibility.  Such a provision allows them to make decisions on the occasion of every election and referendum having regard to weather conditions and transport availability.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has campaigned about this matter for a very long time.  Regrettably, I cannot accept his amendment but I will undertake to write to the returning officers on this matter when the general election is called to seek their advice on weather conditions and to clarify what they wish to do.  I hope my undertaking will satisfy the Deputy.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Minister of State will consider the matter before the Bill is brought back to the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  For clarity, I would like somebody to explain a particular matter for me.  In constituencies with islands, is it a decision entirely for the returning officer as to whether a poll is held on the same day or on a different day?  It might be useful to have the returning officer in Cork West or Cork South-West to have a word with the relevant returning officers in Donegal, Mayo and Galway West.  I do not wish to push the matter any more than that.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has a real point and I ask that the matter be considered between now and Report Stage.</p></speech>

He is one of the people who knows the situation better than most because he lives in one of these communities.  I did not time the speech that he gave on his constituency.  I say this as a joke.  I note that he has the largest number of voters and in terms of all of the islands, the one he mentioned seems to have the largest population.  Voting is a serious issue.  I will ask - or perhaps the Minister of State might ask - the returning officers for their views of what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v has said before we reach Report and Final Stages.  If they agree with him, then I do not think there is any reason not to implement his proposal, particularly if alternative sailings are provided.</p></speech>

It is important that people can vote and my preference would be for elections to be held at weekends.  If people cannot be facilitated on Saturdays, then at the very least they should be able to vote on Friday evenings.  A hell of a lot of people from rural areas and the islands - where the situation is even more pronounced - work elsewhere and travel home at weekends.  As a result, we should do everything possible to ensure that the maximum number of people can vote in elections while at the same time maintaining the integrity of the voting process.  We should not wait until the day an election is called to write to returning officers.  I would like to hear the view of the respective returning officers from the relevant counties.  It would be interesting to hear what they have to say about the matter and it would be nice to hear their views now.</p></speech>

Inishbiggle Island in County Mayo has virtually never had a failed sailing.  One could not have a failed sailing if one knew where Inishbiggle Island is located and the way boats sail to it from Ballycroy on the mainland.  The distance is very short.  In fact, one can walk to the island when the tide is out.  People on the island vote two days earlier than their counterparts on the mainland.  I do not know why a returning officer might be of the view that it would not be possible to transport a ballot box back to the mainland across a few hundred yards of seawater.</p> <p>  In the context of what the Minister of State said about talking to returning officers, I was Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for the four weeks immediately prior to the most recent general election.</p></speech>

None of them was prepared to change and, in law, returning officers have absolute discretion when deciding on this issue.  I hope that the Minister of State is more persuasive than I was.  I have a funny feeling that she will not be because that is why we need to change the law.</p> <p>  I noted in the Minister of State's reply, which was deftly prepared for her, the reference to non-sailings in south-west Donegal, Mayo and west Galway but there was nary a mention of Cork.  As I said, it seems to work in Cork.  When I examined the position regarding non-sailings, the pattern is no different from anywhere else.  To be quite honest, if one excludes December, January and the first two weeks of February - I do not think anybody will call an election in those periods - the number of non-sailing days is virtually unknown.  If the weather was so bad that one could not get the boxes in, then one would not be able to do much else on the mainland either.  There is an idea that only islands are disrupted by bad weather.  One of the major considerations with regard to climate change - a matter about which the Minister of State has indicated her concern - is that if a massive windstorm struck on polling day, there could be a massively low turnout because older people and other individuals might be afraid of trees being blown down or whatever.  We will have to put up with that situation if it happens, the Government will proceed with the election and it will be valid.  The people who get to the polling station will vote, those who fail to do so will not and that will be the way of it.  That would be a much more massive disruption to the whole election than the possibility that, in some freakish circumstances, there might be some delay with the boxes.</p> <p>  I presume the amendment will be defeated if I press it to a vote.  However, I shall resubmit it on Report Stage.  I hope that between now and then the Minister of State will reflect on the human issue involved and the human right to vote in a polling booth.  Inishmore has 629 voters, many of whom are fishermen who return home at the weekends.  Not all members of the electorate on the island have postal votes.  The Minister of State will know from her own constituency that people tend to forget to opt for a postal vote.  Many individuals do not like the postal vote and would rather cast their ballot in a polling booth.  I refer here to those who are studying and working in Galway, not to mention places further afield, who do not avail of the postal vote.  It is a terrible thing to put convenience ahead of a right.  I cannot foresee a situation whereby it would not be possible, using aeroplanes or boats, to get ballot boxes to their destinations on time.  It would be just as easy for certain returning officers to manage this as it is for their counterpart in Cork to do so.</p> <p>  This is a simple matter with which to deal.  I am aware, from experience, that if the law is not changed, then the position will not change in practice.  There is huge disgruntlement on the islands about this issue and people feel very badly wronged.  Nobody has yet explained to me how what is right for Cork is not right for the remainder of the country.</p> <p>  Bheadh s&uacute;il agam go nglacfa&iacute; leis an leas&uacute; seo inniu.

The people on the offshore islands of counties Donegal and Mayo cast their vote two days before those on the mainland and miss the final debates.  As members know the rules changed in the last election and one can broadcast election material up to midday of the day before the election.  This is a major change.  Again, the islanders are missing out of being part of all this.  To be quiet honest, the only people this particular arrangement suits, aside from returning officers, are the politicians.  It was handy enough to cover the islands a day or two before the election and focus on the mainland on the day of the election.  However, that was not fair on the islanders.  Surely the right to vote is important in 2016, given that the government...."elected by the suffrages of all her men and women, " is enshrined in the 1916 Proclamation.  Surely it is important to put the right "of all her men and women," to vote ahead of minor inconvenience that might in some very odd case arise or possible logistical difficulty that one can conceive of.  At this stage the logistical difficulties are more in the mind than in the reality, with all the facilities we have.  </p></speech>

However, if directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  It is proposed that opening statements and any other documents witnesses have submitted to the committee may be published by it on its website after this meeting.  Is this agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>I call Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh to make his opening statement and to introduce the witnesses in his company.</p></speech>

D&eacute;anann an comhairle obair s&aacute;r-th&aacute;bhachtach ar son muintir na t&iacute;re.  I thank the members of the committee for the invitation to discuss the findings of the recently published value for money and policy review of the Arts Council.  I am assistant secretary at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and I have overall responsibility for the arts division within the Department.</p> <p>  I would like to begin by introducing my colleagues.  Ms Orlaith McBride is director of the Arts Council.  Professor John O&rsquo;Hagan is professor of economics at Trinity College, Dublin and he supervised the review.  Ms Deirdre Mahony was lead evaluator and she is also from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.  </p> <p>  The Arts Council represents a significant proportion of the Department&rsquo;s overall Vote.  The proportion was 21.5% in 2015.  It is for this reason that the Department was anxious to ensure a robust examination of the outputs and outcomes of the annual investment in the Arts Council.  The main objectives of the review were to examine how the Arts Council operated over the period 2009 to 2012 and, more important, what it achieved for the taxpayers' investment in the arts.  The Department is pleased to note that the review found that the Arts Council has performed well over a challenging period and, in particular, managed to do more with less.  While that is somewhat a clich&eacute;, I say it in particular in relation to its own administrative practices, while also noting that there has been a significant reduction in overall funding available for supports to artists and other cultural activity since the beginning of the economic crisis.</p><p> The review was undertaken in compliance with the Department's requirements under the Government's three year evaluation programme and followed the standard methodology for such reviews.  It focuses on a challenging period for the public finances, from 2009 to 2012.  The value for money review was overseen by a steering committee, chaired by Dr. O'Hagan, involving representatives from the Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Arts Council and an independent member from outside of the arts sector.  Dr. O'Hagan is well known as a commentator on, and advocate for, the arts and his involvement was critical in ensuring the methodology for the report was robust and rigorously applied.  Dr. O'Hagan also brought his considerable experience to bear on the examination of the societal value of the arts, which forms a critical part of both the report and the recommendations for the Arts Council.</p><p> I will now speak on the findings of the report.  The review found that the Arts Council operates efficiently, administering its grant schemes in a manner that ensures the maximum funding available goes to artists and arts organisations.  It has achieved this by reducing its administration costs and reorganising its work to better support artists and arts organisations and it has done so during a time of constrained funding and decreases in staff numbers.</p><p> The review also identifies areas where the Arts Council can improve.  It recommends that the Arts Council should find a better balance between supporting its existing portfolio of organisations and providing support for new organisations.  It makes recommendations about improving the transparency of its grant application and award process, building on the Arts Council's own good initiatives in this area.  It recommends that the Arts Council examine the outputs of its annual investment programme to ensure there is a balanced distribution of arts opportunities across the country.  The Arts Council has already moved to improve transparency with its recently relaunched website, where each allocation decision is shown along with the reasons for the award of funding on a user-friendly map of Ireland.</p><p> The review also makes recommendations about how we can better track the outputs and outcomes of the Arts Council's annual investment programme.  In the short term, it recommends the introduction of a set of 11 performance indicators so, into the future, both the Arts Council and the Department will be able to answer questions about how it performs and, more importantly, what it achieves for the public's investment.  For the longer term, and the more challenging question of understanding the societal value of public investment in the arts, the report makes a range of recommendations about how data can be better gathered, examined and reported.</p><p> The Minister is committed to ensuring that the findings of the report are used to improve access to, and support for, the arts in Ireland.  She had a very productive discussion last month with the chairperson and director of the Arts Council on how this can be achieved.  The Department will build on the positive engagement with the Arts Council in the preparation of the review to ensure that the recommendations are delivered.  We will do this in close consultation with the Arts Council using the normal governance arrangements, including regular liaison meetings and the annual service level agreement.</p><p> The Arts Council has recently launched its new ten year strategy, which has incorporated many of the principles highlighted in the report.  To clarify, the value for money review and the preparation of the arts strategy by the Arts Council happened in tandem, so there were lessons and learning from both processes which informed the outcome of both.  Orlaith McBride, director of the Arts Council, will be happy to answer questions on how the value for money review will influence the implementation of the new strategy.</p><p> For my part, I wish to note how a number of our recommendations have already been applied to the Arts Council's investment strategy.  For example, the council has undertaken to make clear the criteria used to make funding decisions, thereby improving the transparency of its operation.  It intends to build sustainable relationships with organisations by supporting them to develop sustainable fundraising strategies and programmes and it has committed to better measuring and monitoring of the outcomes of its investment strategy, which will inform future investment decisions, including in terms of ensuring balanced regional distribution of arts opportunities.  This ten year strategy will be followed by a series of three year implementation plans in which the Arts Council has committed to incorporating many of the detailed recommendations of the value for money review.</p><p> To conclude, the Department considers that this review is unique in terms of the scope of the analysis involved and it is a testament to the Arts Council that its work has stood up to this rigorous examination.  The council has been proactive in changing its structures and working arrangements to better serve the arts community and the public.  It has also maintained the integrity of its programme in a difficult financial climate, in part through significant cuts to its costs.  The Department is confident that the Arts Council will build on this positive finding and, indeed, the momentum of its strategy development process to continue to improve its offering to the arts sector and the return on the investment to the taxpayer.</p></speech>

Ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os, ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a ghabh&aacute;il le chuile dhuine a bh&iacute; p&aacute;irteach san athchomharc seo.

It is important that it has been done.  It is even more important against a background in which we are campaigning continuously for greater expenditure on the arts and on the national cultural institutions at a time when there continues to be major restraint and pressure on the public finances.  However, we conduct those campaigns in the context of an understanding of the importance of the arts to society and, indeed, the economic benefits that flow from having a vibrant, active and successful arts community.</p> <p>  One of the first questions that arises from this analysis is about data, the collection of data and the evaluation of the success of the various initiatives.  Perhaps Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh would expand a little on what is contained in the paper on the area of data collection.  There are areas of the arts that are intrinsically somewhat nebulous and while they are terribly valuable, how does one collect data on or quantify in a real way the type of benefits that flow, as distinct from perhaps looking at what the pharmaceutical or farming sectors do and so forth?  I wish to hear more about that.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh also says that substantial work was done in the area of administrative costs.  He mentioned a figure of 16%.  How does that compare with administrative costs savings in other sectors?  Does it compare favourably or otherwise?</p> <p>  Another matter mentioned in the report is the issue of transparency and the type of relationships that exist between the Arts Council and other bodies.  The report mentions the need to build more sustainable relationships.  What bodies are being referred to in that regard?  Reference was also made to the relationship between the Arts Council and local authorities.  Local authorities fulfil a vital role in bringing the arts to the people, particularly in rural areas.  In so far as they play that role, they also facilitate the numbers of audiences, participants and people engaged in the arts in general to be grown, and grown exponentially if everything works effectively.  However, there can be a conflict between what the Arts Council and the local authorities wish to do.  One often finds a situation in which the local authority will argue that the funding should come from the Arts Council, while the Arts Council will argue conversely that the local authority should provide more.  How can that be dealt with?</p> <p>  My final question is about introducing multi-annual service level agreements.  What are the types of groups, bodies or agencies with which the witness would envisage such agreements being put in place and how does he envisage them working?  Finally, with regard to the cnuas, can the witness give us an indication of the overall annual value of the payments included there?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.217" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015111000002#D00200"><p>I will make a general response and we can ask Professor John O'Hagan and Ms Orlaith McBride to contribute on specific points.  The issue of data is challenging for us all.  It is worth pointing out that the Department itself is currently looking at developing an overall national cultural policy, Culture 2025.  We have been going through a significant public consultation process with all the cultural institutions around the country, and many other stakeholders.  Issues of data arise in terms of how we measure outcomes.  We all know that investment in the arts and culture is good for society and personal well-being.  It has mental health benefits through integration and reaching out to areas of deprivation.  There are many benefits but it is terribly difficult to quantify them.  The nut has not yet been cracked but Professor O&rsquo;Hagan will have views on that.</p> <p>  In terms of administrative costs, the report shows that the Arts Council compares favourably with other organisations such as F&aacute;ilte Ireland and the Irish Film Board.  It is difficult, as it depends on the quantum of money one has to give out.  The Department has made similar levels of savings in terms of administrative costs, but on a very reduced budget in terms of where the total quantum of administration versus output rests.  Ms Orlaith McBride will probably speak about the specific bodies but the Arts Council has ongoing relationships with key institutions such as Senator Mac Conghail&rsquo;s Abbey Theatre, the Gate Theatre, the Wexford opera festival and many of the festivals we see every year.</p> <p>  The relationship with local authorities is very interesting.  The need for greater recognition of the role of local community, and the role of local government in the provision of arts and cultural services is an issue that has come up frequently in the Culture 2025 consultation process.  Local authorities are an important actor on the ground.  They do not need to be directed from the top, but they do need support.  The Arts Council has done some very good work with local authorities, as Ms McBride will probably explain to the committee.</p> <p>  Expenditure on the cnuas is &euro;2.6 million.  Perhaps Professor O&rsquo;Hagan could speak on issues concerning the cnuas.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor John O'Hagan" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015111000002#D00300"><p>I thank Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l for his searching questions.  I am pleased he has welcomed value for money studies because it is vital that they are continued.  In the public arena at the moment people are talking about small increases in the budget and where they will be allocated but there is a huge existing expenditure in the public sector that should be constantly under review, not just in the Arts Council.  Value for money studies have been very useful.</p> <p>  In terms of the benefits of the arts, one must distinguish between personal benefits and benefits to the taxpayer.  Someone might like going to the Abbey Theatre, or to a concert or they might like gardening or hill walking.  There is a personal benefit to them from such activities.  The issue here is what is the benefit to the taxpayer and society at large.  That is what we have to pin down.  People often confuse the issues.  There is a wonderful opera festival in Wexford which should be funded because people enjoyed it so much, but people should pay for their personal enjoyment.  The report tried to point out that there is a benefit for broader society that could be justifiably funded out of taxpayers&rsquo; money.  What one needs to do is provide evidence for that.  Two reports have been done.  The Arts Council is just a small part of the arts sector.  Personally, I think it is inappropriate that it is burdened with collecting data and evidence on the sector.  It should be done by the Department, like it is done in Britain, because the Department has an overarching brief.</p> <p>  There is a need for a much bigger survey and survey data.  As the Deputy correctly said, what is required is not just quantitative data, it is qualitative data and narrative.  Others have heard this story, but I remember meeting Compton Mackenzie who is an impresario in the West End and I asked him about the subsidised theatre sector in London.  I thought he would be totally against it but he said, on the contrary, the subsidised sector is where they test talent and plays.  He said if there was not a subsidised sector in London there would be no West End, but that needs to be tracked.  If some people are very successful on TV now, they start their training in the subsidised sector and evidence seems to be built up for that.  The Deputy is quite right but the evidence must go much wider than quantitative data, it should be qualitative and narrative, telling a story like that.  I thank members for their questions.</p></speech>

The Deputy is absolutely correct in that in the past 30 years since we developed our first partnership with local government back in 1985 it has probably been truly the most transformative thing in terms of the arts reaching people right across the country.  The value for money report recognises that and our new strategy, Making Great Art Work, also recognises that.  One of the key pillars underpinning the new strategy is that we will recommit to our relationship with local government.  This month we will launch a new memorandum of understanding, MOU, between the Arts Council and the County and City Management Association and then we will sit down with every local authority over the next three years and agree a new funding agreement and service level agreement with them, which will very clearly outline how we will proceed.  The reality is that there are particular concerns that may be only of local significance and then there are particular concerns that the Arts Council also wants to support and fund.  Therefore, the new memorandum of understanding with each local authority will identify those particular initiatives that are of interest exclusively to the local authority, those particular initiatives that are of interest exclusively to the Arts Council and those that are joint concerns.  There will be no ambiguity in terms of the Arts Council&rsquo;s role and responsibility at national level and then at local level.  We recognise that our relationship with local government is the most important relationship in terms of identifying other bodies with which we can partner in the coming years.</p></speech>

First, on a potential conflict of interest, I run the Abbey Theatre and it gets funded through the Arts Council and the Department.  I always need to put that on the record just in case I have any enemies out there, but I not have any enemies.  Second, I am one of the founding members of the National Campaign for the Arts and before I became a Senator we advocated a lot of policy initiatives that are suggested by Professor O&rsquo;Hagan as chairperson of the steering group.</p> <p>  I congratulate the Arts Council.  It is great to note its clean bill of health in terms of managing its resources through what I would consider traumatic change and cuts.  It must be difficult to manage that in terms of staffing, restructuring and having to take tougher decisions.  We all felt that in the arts world and we all got cut.  It would be fair to say there are findings and recommendations but ultimately it is a good news story in terms of how the board, the chairperson and director have managed the Arts Council&rsquo;s role.</p> <p>  I have several questions in no particular order.  The first is directed at Ms McBride.  I am picking up on Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l&rsquo;s line of questioning.  There seems to be a constant theme in Professor O&rsquo;Hagan&rsquo;s authored report around data collection and measurement.  I do not wish to put words in his mouth but it appears to be consistent that there is very little evidence.  Although we might have data I get confused myself as to where all the data is, where it is centrally located and until that is clear, in my view it leads to potential for poor policy decisions.  I know there are recommendations in the report regarding diversifying more funding towards various regions but in order to build confidence around policy I would like to hear what is being done in terms of data collection and how the information is disseminated and if there is a specific role within the council in that regard.</p> <p>  Professor O&rsquo;Hagan correctly mentioned that the value for money report is about the benefit to the taxpayer.</p><p>Ultimately, the Arts Council needs to look at how to illustrate the benefit to the citizen and how that can be measured, qualitatively or quantitatively, to leverage additional growth and income.  I would like to hear its views on that.  Is any research planned?  How will that be linked with data collection?  <br/><br/>I understand from the latest strategy, and I noticed it in the O'Rourke report published over a year ago, that the arts community called for an advocacy role for the Arts Council.  What is its role?  Is the role to act behind the scenes or is it to be more public in terms of advocating value and calling for increased funding for the arts?  Those are questions for Ms McBride.<br/><br/>My next comments are to directed to Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh.  The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure, DCAL, in Northern Ireland and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in England have a full-time economist, or policy unit.  Again, I am linking in with Professor O'Hagan's comments.  I understand Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh has only recently been appointed but I would like know his view of the recommendations in the value for money report.  I think Professor O'Hagan just mentioned it but is there a greater role for the Department in monitoring data and looking at other research in the medium to long term and in linking policy.  The Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is working on Culture 2025 but in a way that is kind of a culture policy.  How does the Department monitor and back up such a policy?  Has it discovered national or international examples of policy and surveys?  I am thinking of the Department of Health's survey called TILDA, The Irish Longitudinal study on Ageing.  For many years, there has been a campaign advocating the annual harvesting of data, biannual surveys and cultural participation.  Is there scope for the Department and the Arts Council to do more in partnership with the Irish Research Council?  I have been a Senator for almost five years and I am concerned that there is a lot more collaboration between Departments and NGOs in other areas, such as social justice.  I would like to hear Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh view on that.  <br/><br/>My final questions are for Professor O'Hagan and Ms Mahony.  Professor O'Hagan wrote an interesting and provocative article in <i>The Irish Times</i>recently.  Deputy &Oacute; Feargha&iacute;l spoke quite eloquently about the matter but we are always defining the value of the arts in terms of absence.  What if the Abbey was not there?  What if Yeats was not there?  What if Beckett was not there?  However, people have grown tired of that argument as it is a less sophisticated one.<br/><br/>I have read the report and found it to be very strong, particularly the final chapter.  It has looked to the arts council in England in terms of what it considers to be the best or the latest best ways to measure or evaluate.  This is always difficult.  The arts should not attach itself to economic benefit alone.  We have tried that argument but it becomes so instrumental that we lose and become less sophisticated.  I include myself in this that we are less sophisticated in arguing the benefit of the arts in a way that is confident and based on data or measurement.  It does not have to be based on actual economic indicators.  The biggest crisis facing our argument for arts funding is that we - I include myself in this - have not come up with a sophisticated argument where we can go to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and say not to cut our funding because the arts are good for people.  How do Professor O'Hagan, as an economist, and Ms Mahony approach that?  I refer to research and development and the commercial world.  We would all argue that &quot;Love/Hate&quot; would not have succeeded without the extraordinarily talented actors and writers, a lot of whom started off in a theatre.  How would one argue that?  That is a question for Ms McBride in terms of advocacy.  The final line in Professor O'Hagan's article states:  &quot;Such evidence can be and has to be found, be it qualitative, quantitative or by way of convincing narrative.  It is the only way to secure the future growth.&quot;  What is the solution?</p></speech>

There were three questions for Ms McBride.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.224" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orlaith McBride" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015111000002#E00300"><p>Two of the questions are inter-related because the question on data collection and illustrating the benefit to the taxpayer are linked into our advocacy.  I will deal with the advocacy piece first.  Over the past number of years, the Arts Council has been in crisis management.  There has been a significant collapse in funding, so we have not been as active in the area of promotion or advocacy as we should have been.  As our money was reduced, we wanted to ensure that as much money as possible was leaving the building.  What the report clearly identified and what our strategy identified,  in terms of objective 20, was that the Arts Council needed to become much more active in the area of promotion and advocacy.  I have just come from a session at the Royal Hibernian Academy where there was a call from the sector that the Arts Council needed to lead that public discourse in terms of the value of the arts, making a case for the arts and demonstrating the impact of the arts.  We do not currently have the resources to do such work, and I am not just talking just about financial resources.  We do not have the inhouse expertise to do that.  In the past two years, we have established a strategic development department.  The Government would not have been able to conduct a review of the Arts Council prior to the establishment of the strategic development department because we did not have the capacity to generate the evidence that Professor O'Hagan and Ms Mahony required to even begin a value for money review.  The Arts Council has been deficient in terms of its internal capacity to look at the whole area of promotion and advocacy and measurement of the impact of the public investment in the Arts Council and the investment and return in terms of arts organisations and artists.  We have committed to this in the strategy.  The sector is very conscious that for us to invest in advocacy and promotion, we will need to divert resources in the short-term so that in the long-term, it will, hopefully, release additional public resources into the Arts Council.  We are playing the long game but we need to upskill ourselves.  I do not believe we have the internal capacity currently to attend to this area.  We have strategic partnerships with the Irish Research Council.  We already work with the ESRI and are looking at the Growing Up in Ireland survey.  We are developing a partnership where we will take the evidence from this longitudinal survey to see how we can use that to better effect in terms of the impact of arts and culture on the lives of children and young people.  We have started this work but we are playing the long game.</p> <p>  In terms of other arts councils, there is evidence that there is an absence of any international set of indicators.  Next week I will meet my colleagues in the International Federation of Arts Councils and Cultural Agencies, IFACCA, to look at how best we can, as arts councils around the world, begin to develop a set of indicators that are arts led rather than rely on other aspects of public policy-making.</p> <p>  On the question on partnerships with bodies that have the skills, we are the Arts Council and not a research council.  Therefore, we need to look at how we can employ research methodologies through people who have expertise in this area and bring those skills into the Arts Council.  We must do better in advocacy and promotion but in order to do better in the long term, we need to invest more resources in the short term.  Over the past number of years, we have not wanted to spend as much money internally on ourselves because we wanted to protect as much as we could in terms of the external environment for artists and arts organisations.  I will hand over to Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh to respond to the other questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.225" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Feargal &Oacute; Coigligh" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015111000002#E00400"><p>I thank the Senator for his questions.  A very important point to make, and to pick up on what Ms McBride said, is that while the report is directed at the Arts Council, much of it is applicable to the Department.  It is just a level up.  Many of the issues apply completely to the Department in terms of the arts.  There is greater room for more research.</p><p>The national campaign for the arts was acknowledged in the report as making a positive contribution, but there is greater room to work more closely with the Arts Council on much of the work it is doing.  For example, with regard to the geographical and spatial spread of resources, we have been criticised in the past for the fact that our capital funding schemes have not been sufficiently policy or strategically-led.  Rather than recreate the work Ms McBride has done, we need to work more closely with the Arts Council and other partners to bolster that aspect of our business.</p><p> As a caveat, I met my counterparts from the UK jurisdictions last Friday and they are in a different economic place.  A different economic approach is taken in the United Kingdom.  During the recession they kept the economy primed, but, now that the economy is recovering, they have decided to cut and burn.  They are looking at the levels of cuts we had to take in the past few years.  My colleagues in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport said they had put together good arguments showing that personal well being arose from investment in the arts and culture, but they did not know whether they would get any purchase when it came to finding the money.  It is often stated we have the lowest level of spending on the arts of any jurisdiction in the European Union, but we cannot say that because we do not have the research.  The information does not come only from the Department or the Arts Council and we will not be in a position to argue that case until we carry out the research required.  There is much for the Department to learn from this report, too.</p></speech>

I used to teach him, but he is now getting his own back.  The first point he made was very important.  The report is generally very favourable about the operation of the Arts Council in terms of governance, transparency and the information provided on inputs and outputs.  It is a positive report on the council's operation at a time when there were significant cuts in expenditure.  It is not just the data that tell us the organisation is changing and adapting.  We need more data and a strategy unit, but it should be centralised in the Department.  As Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh said, there are implications for the Department, as well as for the Arts Council.  <br/><br/>The Senator asked what would happen if we had no Abbey Theatre or no Joyce.  We asked students about the role of the European Parliament, but as we could not get them interested, we rephrased the question and asked if they thought there should be no European Parliament.  All of a sudden that engaged them; therefore, it can be useful to ask the same question in a different way.  <br/><br/>The report went way beyond economic benefits and there was quite a bit on societal outcomes.  Economic benefits were only third on the list.  <br/><br/>The Senator asked how we provided the evidence.  I started in this area by producing a study of the economic and social benefits of the Wexford Opera Festival, 27 years ago.  One of the things on which we focused was what did the festival do for the community in Wexford in the sense of cohesion.  I went there this year to get a sense of the feeling in the town, although I never go to the opera.  We interviewed a lot of people and documented the findings.  They said it was beneficial, even though they also never went to the opera.  The Wexford Opera Festival is a niche offering as it just includes rare operas and specialises in new design.  The innovation argument can be tracked, however, as it is possible to interview a lot of people.  We can find people on &quot;Fair City&quot; and track their careers back to where they began.  Did they begin in the public, subsidised sector and was that the test bed for them?  In West End theatres they say new works of art would dry up without the subsidised sector.  We need to ask if the commercial sector could survive without the subsidised sector.  A lot of evidence can be provided in that regard.<br/><br/>We also looked at the economic benefits to Wexford.  These are not just to bed and breakfast establishments, although almost half of the people who come to Wexford for the festival are from outside Ireland.  We also tracked the reputational effects, which astonished me.  We went through <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>Financial Times</i>and other newspapers and the reviews were astonishing.  That is qualitative evidence.  It might be a tale, but the sector needs to make some attempt to provide these data.  Rather than just saying there are no data or that they have an argument in principle, they should provide a convincing narrative.</p></speech>

As public representatives, we tend to think that anything that involves spending taxpayers' money should never be divorced from the reality that, whether it is for the arts or anything else, somebody is paying for it.  If one asks the ordinary person in a rural area where or how he or she had experienced the arts, he or she would probably answer that it was probably through the local authority.  We have an excellent authority in County Mayo, from where I come, which delivers arts programming and events.  Arts centres and venues have grown in recent years and that is what is real to people on the ground.  It is probably their best opportunity to experience what the arts have to offer.</p> <p>  I am a board member of Ballina Arts Centre and Theatre and have been involved for perhaps 17 years.  Arts venues are under an awful lot of pressure.  Thankfully, we got a new theatre a few years ago, but most arts organisations are lurching from one year to the next and budgets and finance dominate discourse as people try to get the best value for money.  The arts centres, venues and local authorities are experts on getting value for money.  Of all the cuts to Arts Council funding in the past few years a disproportionate amount have fallen on arts organisations and local authorities around the country, compared to the big arts institutions centrally based in Dublin.  I am not saying communities set the standard for the arts, but in their delivery there is an economic as well as a commercial and tourism side and we must think outside the box.  </p> <p>  One of the greatest joys I have is to see communities enriched by the arts.  It often takes people by surprise because we battle with the words "the arts" and many people who have no experience of them ask how they are relevant to them.  It is almost that the arts are seen as an indulgence instead of something very important, a part of creating the rich tapestry of our society.  As we will call these things our "heritage", there are many reasons we should invest.  I would like to see a further outreach from our national institutions.  They have the benefit of the focus they can bring and can uplift the activities already happening in communities.</p> <p>  A number of questions arise from the review of policy and the value for money analysis.  More detail will come as we have these important debates.  Who decides what is a balanced distribution of arts opportunities across the country?</p><p>I do not believe it exists at present.  Is the Arts Council best placed to do this?  Is there not a conflict of interests?  If it is the Arts Council, why is that the case?  There is another body in the arts office that should have an equal say in that.  I would also like to see a democratic quotient included in the equation of how we decide on the balanced distribution of arts opportunities across the country.  For whom do these arts opportunities exist?  The litmus test for a good arts policy is how well it is reaching people.  How do we counter the idea that the arts are for the elite or a privileged few who can access them?</p><p> Regarding the Arts Council supporting organisations to develop sustainable fund-raising strategies and programmes, is this realistic given that arts infrastructure in the country is relatively new?  Most of these arts venues and organisations are struggling because of the disproportionate cuts they have experienced in the past five years.  Some of them have had their entire funding eradicated.  In light of the way the Arts Council was going in the past, I had a sense that there would be one venue or a centralisation of funding and that the local authority would be obliged to come up with funding.  That is not on in my area because the council can barely get by with the funding it has for the arts notwithstanding that Mayo County Council supports the arts extremely well in very strategic ways.</p><p> These venues did not come about without input from the Arts Council in the first instance.  Much of the delivery of arts venues has been organic in the sense that the need was identified within communities.  Some communities might have had a great passion in a certain area of the arts, much of it from an amateur perspective.  They engaged with professional artists and this is how these venues came into being.  They should not be abandoned, they should be supported.  They should be a key plank of how the Arts Council rolls out these balanced arts opportunities.</p><p> Is this the right time to be offloading and asking local authorities to come up with funding, if that is the Arts Council's intention?  I suggest this should be a longer-term goal.  Many of these organisations are on their knees and barely getting by.  I am talking about arts venues throughout the country.</p></speech>

We all admit it has been a very difficult period and both national organisations and local groups have had insufficient resources.  That is a difficult space.  The report refers to issues of participation.  We will never have X amount of money per person per county; it does not work like that.  For example, in the south east, Wexford might skew it because a significant amount of money goes to the Wexford Opera Festival.</p> <p> The issue of local government is very important and has been one of the most exciting developments in arts policy in the past 20 or 30 years through the role of the arts officer and the local groups that have been supported by the Arts Council and where the facilities have been supported by the Department.  We recognise that those facilities need to be supported and the Minister has put in place a new scheme starting next year to help reinvest in those centres.  That is very important.  We cannot necessarily say that local authority members have to prioritise in terms of how funding operates and their policies in funding.  We know that some of the difference in provision is not necessarily an issue regarding Arts Council provision but rather that it relates to the emphasis individual local authorities place on the provision of arts.  That may be acceptable because local democracy and prioritisation is part of the decision-making process.  There is a complex issue of how national support and local priority fit together.</p></speech>

I am familiar with some of these.  It is not in proportion; it is not fair to compare them in the same vein.</p></speech>

We have withdrawn funding to more than 100 organisations since 2008.  As we lost one third of our funding, we ceased to fund approximately one third of the organisations we were funding in 2008.  That was an inevitable consequence of our reduction in funding.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about balanced distribution across the country and the perception of disproportionate cuts to venues and local authorities.  We apportion the same reduction across all art forms and all areas of practice.  So it is not true to say that venues across the country have been disproportionately cut in terms of their funding.  It would have taken the same proportionate cut as every other area of our expenditure.  I accept there have been cuts and we have had to make tough decisions.  Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis as opposed to comparing one organisation with another in a particular county.</p> <p>  Mr. &Oacute; Coigligh spoke about arts venues and spatial planning.  Many venues throughout the country were built without any conversation with the Arts Council.  So they were not part of a planned policy of the Arts Council working in partnership with local authorities.  Our new strategy document clearly states that there needs to be a much more strategic partnership between the national government spend on capital investment and the Arts Council's spend.  For the past 30 years, national government has made decisions on capital expenditure and then the Arts Council has been asked to step up to the plate in terms of the day-to-day running costs.  We need to have greater alignment between national and local investment in infrastructure in coming years.</p> <p>  I did not understand what was implied about a conflict of interests and that the Arts Council should not be making-----</p></speech>

Those local conversations are taking place between the Arts Council and each local authority.  That is where the local flavour will come into the conversation but the local authority will bring that to the table.</p></speech>

I am intrigued by the value-for-money audit principle.  I can understand how Departments want to have value-for-money audits in the arts.  However, I have concerns about that type of language.  It is very good that the value-for-money audit has shown that the Arts Council offers value for money and operates very efficiently.  As someone who worked in an area where one had to account for the State moneys being spent, I get a sense that it is possible to over-commodify the arts.</p><p>The value for money audit suits the good administrators in the organisations, it does not necessarily suit those who are doing the best art.  That is one of my concerns in this area.  I do not know whether the witnesses have any views on that.  I am also interested in hearing a little more about how one maximises the socio-economic value of the arts.  There is a sense, in particular in the arts community, that the funding regime in the past has always favoured the big arts organisations and the institutional arts.  It has almost led to a corporatisation of the arts.  That is felt very much among artists on the ground.  The question is whether in a value for money audit one is favouring those organisations again.  Many people find that what one gets from the arts then is a kind of middle of the road, bums on seats mentality to filling the theatres or exhibition spaces that plays to the common ground but turns the arts more into entertainment than arts.  One is clocking up the numbers.  It is like on television when one has certain soap operas that appeal to more people so one gets bigger numbers watching them but one could ask if they compare from an arts perspective.  Would the Arts Council have commissioned Samuel Beckett, W. B. Yeats or others to write some of the plays or poetry they wrote?  They were not mainstream or middle of the road.  They were a little bit left or right of centre.  I would welcome the thoughts of the witnesses in that regard.</p><p> We have a lot of quantitative evidence.  I did a degree in commerce, followed by marketing.  One has the quantitative and the qualitative evidence.  How are we measuring the qualitative value of the arts to communities and how are we getting into communities in rural areas, to which Deputy Mulherin referred?</p><p> I commend the Arts Council on its collaboration with Eala&iacute;n na Gaeltachta.  As someone who comes from a Gaeltacht area and is an Irish speaker, I think the value for money that is got from that collaboration with &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta is fantastic.  The level of arts that has been experienced in Gaeltacht areas from very small levels of funding has been incredible and it has increased the vibrancy of the arts in the Gaeltacht areas and that is important.  On the other hand, I am very disappointed that most of the national institutions have relinquished their obligation to do anything in the Irish language.  A number of national institutions would say they do not see any value for money in doing Irish language productions, for example.  I do not agree with that.  I heard an interesting radio debate recently in which the point was made that the Abbey Theatre, for example, has not done any Irish language production in recent years.  Senator Mac Conghail will have views on the matter.  That is disappointing </p></speech>

Which does one give priority to?  If one is programming something, can the Irish language be given a greater priority among those institutions?  Can the Arts Council say in its policy that an institution is a national one but it also wants to ensure that Irish language is close to the top of its agenda?</p> <p>  In terms of the value for money of artists in the community, many individual artists say to me that they struggle on a very meagre income.  How do we support artists who are creating art in the community if they are not connected with an institution, as such, or an organisation that is getting funding?  I concur with all that has been said about funding through local authorities.</p> <p>  When the previous Minister, Deputy Deenihan, was Minister he made many trips around the country, including to Galway.  It was said there that we undervalue the role of the artist in opening up minds and thoughts in other institutions of the State.  The suggestion was made that an artist should be appointed to every State board, if only to include critical thinking and creative thinking in the decisions made at corporate level.  In one sense we are corporatising the arts or measuring the arts using a corporate stick so perhaps we could influence the corporations as well and the semi-State bodies that think very corporately with the arts.  It might bring a little bit of creative thinking by appointing artists to State boards.  I am not sure if that is within the remit of the group before us but I welcome their contributions.</p></speech>

Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh raised many philosophical and even higher level issues above what can be contained in a value for money study.

We are grappling with some of those issues in the national cultural policy we are dealing with, which will be high level document.

There is a very clear process in place.  It is the same in Trinity College when we allocate money; some people will be disappointed but what matters is that the process is transparent and based on fair criteria and I think it is.</p> <p>  The Senator is quite right, but I think chapter 8 in the report went way beyond commodifying the arts.  That is always a danger.  That is why we put a lot of emphasis on information other than the quantitative data because then it becomes about bums on seats, as the Senator said.  We have moved on to other societal benefits that are very hard to measure.  Bums on seats or the economic benefit is only third on our list.  I will give one example.  If, let us say, the Abbey Theatre is going to have far more innovative plays, especially in the Peacock part of it, normally for that type of play there will be very few people but that is the nature of experimental work, so there is this conflict between having lots of people attending or whether one wants the theatre to be a test bed for new works and new actors.  The Senator is quite right but I feel the report did not over-commodify the arts by adding that last chapter.</p></speech>

I noted what was said in the value for money report.  I was chairperson of the arts facility in South Dublin County Council and I wish to put on record that, as Deputy Mulherin said, local authorities have done as much for the arts in counties as the Arts Council and Ms McBride was the first to recognise that herself.  She did say she had to cut back on funding.  I urge her to put funding for local authorities at the top of her funding priorities as I can see best value for money coming from the meagre budgets councils now have.  I say that from the perspective of more than 23 years on the council.  Local authorities put a lot of their own money into capital provision for the arts but the ongoing day to day funding and support from the Arts Council is very welcome.  Such funding should be a top priority as it brings the arts to the people.  Another speaker asked about the social value of funding for the arts.  That would be evident if one did an audit of social value in local areas.  People are now engaged in the arts who were not involved heretofore and access has been greatly improved.</p> <p>  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh spoke about funding for traditional arts and culture.  I was always strongly of the view that a separate allocation should be apportioned to traditional arts versus the modern, if one likes.  I do not know how it could be done but if traditional arts are not funded, they fall by the wayside.  Senator Labhr&aacute;s &Oacute; Murch&uacute; always promotes traditional music and Irish language facilities and plays for people who are not traditionally involved in the arts who were great artists such as Travellers or others.  It is important for them to have plays in their own language on occasion.  Funding for such minority groups and women is important to ensure they are given an opportunity.</p> <p>  The internal audit has the responsibility for audit on expenditure but in practice, because expenditure only involves 10% of the overall budget of the Arts Council there was a recommendation in the report and a circular was sent by the Department as well, Circular 13/14, that the internal audit on expenditure should encapsulate programming and expenditure.</p> <p>  I could not see the performance indicators in the report.  Have they been drawn up or who will draw them up?  In local authorities one can look at the 40 or 50 performance indicators.</p><p>Where can I find the 11 performance indicators?  That is why an artist is very valuable.  There is left brain and right brain thinking and drawing up performance indicators but what is important to one person might not be important to another.  Therefore, whose responsibility is it to draw up the performance indicators?</p><p> I also note from the report that it takes two months after the meeting when an organisation is granted funding for the minutes of that meeting to appear online.  It should be possible to reduce that timeline.  As the report says, there is very little redaction in the minutes.  If that is the case, one could almost put them online in the following three days.  Instead of two months, the timeline should be reduced to one.  That would be a huge help for the general public.  If one is seeking transparency, the kite has flown after two months and it is too late to do anything about anything then.</p><p> I congratulate the witnesses on the report.  The overall synopsis of the report is that there is good value for money from the Arts Council.  I congratulate the council on that performance.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.253" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Orlaith McBride" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015111000002#J00200"><p>I will reply to the questions about the traditional arts and the minutes.  It takes up to two months because the minutes of one meeting go to the next meeting to be formally approved by the council.  The meetings are held every month to six weeks so that is the reason it is usually approximately two months before the minutes are published on the website.  They must be formally approved at the next council meeting.  It is procedural but in terms of good governance that must be the case.  We cannot put the minutes of a State agency on the website without the formal approval of the council.</p> <p>  Regarding the traditional arts, there is a separate budget line for those.  A total of &euro;3.2 million is going to the traditional arts.  The traditional arts were named in the Arts Act 2003 for the first time.  Following that Act a special committee examined how the Arts Council might engage with the traditional arts.  Until then, it had not done so in a real way.  One of the recommendations from that committee was that a separate budget line which would attend to the particularities of the traditional arts - recognising that they are different, that there is a huge amount of amateur contribution to the traditional arts and that they happen in spaces and places outside of traditional arts venues and so forth - had to be established.  As a result, there is a separate allocation for the traditional arts.  There has been a huge growth in the traditional arts in Ireland and in the recognition of their value and how they contribute to enhancing our creativity as a people because of the State recognising in 2003 that the traditional arts had to be named in legislation.  That happened in 2003 and we will continue to ensure that there is a separate budget line.</p></speech>

They are largely quantitative in nature.  They are about evaluating the ongoing effectiveness of the Arts Council's investment programme.  They count items such as the number of artists and arts organisations supported and the number of new and original works performed and made.  They look at detail on audiences, such as where audiences are and whom they comprise.</p> <p>  They will take some time to introduce because not all of the data collection methods are in place, but we have had good engagement with the Arts Council and a commitment to move in that direction.  They are quantitative and different from the longer-term piece of work we have spoken about in terms of the societal outcomes of the investment in the Arts Council, which are more qualitative.  However, I believe that in the future engagements such as this will be easier because we will have a nice set of indicators to which we can speak.</p> <p>  There was a question earlier on the administrative costs and the good work of the Arts Council in reducing those costs.  In fact, of a number of international jurisdictions, the Arts Council had the lowest percentage administration costs of the five jurisdictions examined.</p></speech>

They are an integral part of rolling out the arts to the people.  I maintain my position that there have been disproportionate cuts.  Ms McBride cited the fact that 100 organisations have had their funding withdrawn since 2008.  That is hardly proportionate.  I am aware of cases in my county where that has happened.  It has not been proportionate.  I am saying that we must be given a break.  Real meaningful work is taking place in the arts.  I believe it should be a central piece of arts programming, the delivery of the arts being the objective of the Arts Council.</p></speech>

The review recommends that the Arts Council should give greater feedback to unsuccessful applicants for funding.  There is always huge demand on funding.  It would be a big help if those who apply for funding were given a detailed explanation of why they were unsuccessful.  The review also recommends that a portion of the money be set aside or ring-fenced for new organisations or groups.  Do our guests intend to address that suggestion?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, however, making such decisions means there will be casualties, to talk to the Deputy's point.  If we are to ensure there are new opportunities available to new and emerging artists and to new organisations, we will have to reduce the funding to existing clients.  We have not received an increase in our funding so we are still dealing with the same amount of money.  We will have to make tough decisions in terms of reductions to recurring clients to ensure there is money available for new and emerging clients to come through as well.  That is the difficulty we face all the time, to ensure new voices are coming through as well as those that are historically funded.</p></speech>

May I introduce Ms Sarah Glennie, the director of the Irish Museum of Modern Art?  I gather that the statement is taken as read but, perhaps, I could mention some of its highlights.</p> <p>  I am delighted and honoured to be asked to become chairman of a national cultural institution.  I had the privilege before.  It is really very exciting to be involved in something as dynamic as the Irish Museum of Modern Art, IMMA.  I have some significant board experience particularly in the cultural tourism sector.  I was chairman of the National Library of Ireland up to recently.  Prior to that I was also chairman of the St. Patrick's Festival and under its auspices the Dublin Contemporary 2011 exhibition.  Currently, I am chairman of the People in Need Trust which, as the committee may be aware, is responsible for the RTE telethon on a periodic basis, raising funds for charities nationwide.  I have also been chairman of the Institute of Art, Design and Technology.  Across that sector I got some experience of not just dealing with boards made up of members from disparate groups and experiences but also dealing directly with Government and State Departments.  I think that brings some valuable experience to this particular role.  In the past I have had an opportunity to have an input into strategies, particularly in places such as the National Library of Ireland and the Institute of Art, Design and Technology in areas such as corporate governance, human resource management, financial planning, risk management and all of those things which, I think, a well structured board which is properly governed should have. </p> <p>  The cultural sector has gone through a very difficult time in recent years but most of these organisations have learned to adapt and most, if not all, are thriving.  As I have said, I was very honoured to part of one in the National Library of Ireland where we had cuts in our funding and various pressures on the organisation but managed to make it through.  That organisation is now thriving.  Some of the areas I was involved in, which I mentioned in my statement, include the Heaney collection, which will be on public view in two years time in conjunction with the space at the Bank of Ireland.  I was involved in the digitisation of the Catholic parish registers which has been a major change for the National Library of Ireland and various other things, including philanthropy.  I can bring all of those skills to the Irish Museum of Modern Art.  A very disparate and experienced board has been convened by the Minister.  I look forward to working with it and the director and her staff.  The director has been involved in a very substantial transformation programme in the organisation.  It is on the verge of completion and will make a great difference to the way in which that organisation operates.</p> <p>  In summary, I am delighted to be involved.  Some of the experiences I have had in the past, particularly in this sector, will benefit the organisation.  I look forward to taking on that role.</p></speech>

I hope it goes well for him.  At times the IMMA has been in the public sphere for different and awkward reasons, particularly relating to corporate governance, legislation and board composition.  With regard to legislation and amalgamations, I presume the IMMA has received reassurance that there will be no updating of legislation and no amalgamation with the National Gallery of Ireland?  Will Mr. Harvey update the committee on what formal communication the IMMA has received from the Department or the Minister in that regard?</p></speech>

I gather that the concept of amalgamation with the National Gallery of Ireland is now off the agenda, although I have not been formally informed of this.

I hope I have already answered the first question.  </p> <p>  I believe the composition of the board is excellent.  Some members will change in January and some in February.  There appears to be a diverse grouping.  Several members are from the arts world, which is always important, but we can also draw on legal, organisational, facilities management and philanthropy skills.  It is a well balanced board which reflects very well on the system and how it is now structured.  Every member had to apply to be on the board.  I have served on boards where there have been some surprises.  One wondered where some people had come from and after a little analysis, it did not take too long to find out exactly why they were on the board.  One wondered why valuable board places were sometimes given to people who had to be carried along.  The IMMA board is, however, well balanced and it will be very workable.</p> <p>  Senator Fiach Mac Conghail spoke about legislation and asked about my priorities.  I am surprised that the IMMA is not in the same statutory framework as other cultural institutions and this is something about which I would have concerns.  The IMMA probably needs a very quick governance review to look at how it might operate a little better.  There have been structural changes in the area of human resources in the past couple of years, with which management needs some assistance.  The organisation had its budget halved in the past six or seven years and, looking at the numbers, one wonders how it is existing.  Great credit is due to the organisation not just for continuing its programmatic work but also for expanding it without the budget required.  Clearly, the IMMA is not just working better, it has also set down a marker for how it wants to work in the future, but that does not mean that it should state, "Listen, we are grand, we have enough dough."  I do not think that is ever going to work.  The organisation needs to make a case to the Government and the Minister and bring forward business cases.  The National Library of Ireland became successful at showing clearly through business cases how the taxpayer would clearly benefit.  The taxpayer is the ultimate beneficiary.  That is often the best way to approach the matter.  The IMMA has shown that it can programme using resources from philanthropy and partnerships and that will probably be part of the strategy on which I would like to assist.</p> <p>  There is also a significant business and brand imperative; the organisation probably needs to look at how it can create more value from what it already has.  From speaking to the director and knowing what the recruitment plans are, that business and brand imperative is primarily on the commercial side to see how the organisation can leverage its very fine facility and unique position in the arts sector.  However, like every institution, one steps back a little and asks, "What is its role?"  Going on my most recent experiences in the National Library of Ireland which found that it was not just a library or a repository but that it also had educational, outreach, storage, digitisation and other functions, when one gets under the lid at the IMMA, one realises it also has curatorial, developmental, educational and incubation roles.  There is a lot more going on than running just a commercial operation.  It is important to find out how all of these things might sit together to create a more effective and enlarged strategic plan.  That is what the board should focus on in the next five years.</p></speech>

I note that it is stated in his submission that he was a member of and has very relevant experience in boards such as the National Library of Ireland, especially of fundraising for the People in Need Trust, which demonstrates a person's philanthropic make-up.  I hope he will bring some of it to the IMMA.  We have spoken about bringing the arts into the community.  In that regard, a philanthropic outlook on the part of the IMMA board would help to ensure works could be brought to those who cannot come to view them.  Mr. Harvey's experience of serving on the board of the National Library of Ireland is invaluable.  In this committee's opinion, when judging suitability, that is definitely one role that will benefit the IMMA board.  </p> <p>  I had a query about change management, but Mr. Harvey has answered that question.  As we have all read about him and seen him on television, we think we know him.</p></speech>

This committee is here today to deal with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill.  I put it to the Minister, Deputy Howlin, that Ireland is not in a financial emergency now, although it might have been in the past.  It might have been in an emergency when we brought in the FEMPI legislation in 2009 and 2010 and amending legislation in 2013.  During those years Ireland had a severe budget deficit, exceptionally high interest payments on our very high national debt, a very high level of unemployment and many other economic difficulties.  Emigration was rife and there was a general acceptance that there was a financial emergency.</p> <p>  However, I remind the Minister of the Government's recent actions.  Some 13 months ago, the week before the budget, and in the spring statement last year, everybody was told there was going be a negative adjustment of about &euro;2 billion.  When we came to budget day, we had a positive adjustment of &euro;1 billion.  That was a turnaround of &euro;3 billion.  Then immediately after that budget, the Government announced Supplementary Estimates of approximately &euro;1.2 billion.  In advance of the 2015 budget, the Government announced somewhere in the region of &euro;1.6 billion for Supplementary Estimates.  The adjustment in this year's budget was &euro;1.5 billion.  I estimate that over the past 13 months, the Government has been able to find additional room for extra expenditure to the order of &euro;7.3 billion over and above what was projected.  How does the Minister reconcile the Government's position over a period of 13 months from September of 2014 to October 2015, of having an extra &euro;7.3 billion by way of tax cuts and an increase in expenditure with saying to this committee that he wants to pass a financial emergency Bill?  The two positions are irreconcilable.  We were in a financial emergency but we are not in an emergency now.  </p> <p>  The T&aacute;naiste said in the D&aacute;il recently that within the next year or so, the level of Ireland's debt will be at the same level as Germany's, relative to GNP and to the European average.  If the Minister, Deputy Howlin, believes that Ireland needs new financial emergency legislation as we head into 2016, will somebody in the Government please pick up the phone and tell Angela Merkel that it is our belief, based on what we think is a financial emergency, Germany is also in a financial emergency?  </p> <p>  The Taoiseach tells us that this is the best little country to do business in.  Every week we have announcements of improvements in the economy and there is extra money available for health and social welfare, all of which I welcome.  However, I do not see how that tallies with the Minister saying that Ireland going forward is in a financial emergency.  I believe the emergency is over and that no emergency currently exists.  I tabled amendments to repeal the FEMPI legislation, with effective from 1 January 2016.  </p> <p>  I understand people will put the frighteners on the public by saying the FEMPI legislation achieved savings of &euro;3 billion or &euro;2 billion and that if it was all unplugged, it would all have to be repaid tomorrow morning with knobs on in terms of interest, etc.</p><p>Nobody believes that.  I have outlined the &euro;1.5 billion adjustment made in the budget, the &euro;1.6 billion in Supplementary Estimates, the details of which we do not yet know, as they will be brought before the House in the coming weeks, a &euro;1.2 billion Supplementary Estimate last December and the &euro;3 billion adjustment announced on budget day last year, about which we were informed a fortnight previously.  That amounts to a figure of &euro;7.3 billion, which is welcome, but that proves to any reasonable observer that there is no financial emergency.  That tells me that the legislation we have on the Statute Book is a mere fig leaf.  I am satisfied that if anyone challenged any provision of that legislation or this legislation in the courts today or tomorrow, it would not last a moment.  No judge could stand over that figure of &euro;7.3 billion as being consistent with a financial emergency.  We should catch up with the reality of the economy and recognise, "thankfully" - I use the word all the time - that the financial emergency is over.  </p><p> The Minister says this measure is necessary to facilitate the Lansdowne Road agreement, the principle of which I supported prior to, and following, its finalisation; my party has always supported social dialogue and agreement.  I also support the increase in the minimum wage that will happen in tandem with it in the new year.  None of these measures is consistent with a financial emergency.  While it is right to facilitate the Lansdowne Road agreement, this legislation is not necessary.  Effectively, the Minister is saying: "We have a little less of an emergency that we had, so we can remove some provisions of the FEMPI legislation."  The arbiter of what was a financial emergency is not subject to discussion in the Lansdowne Road agreement and should not be the yardstick we use.  If the agreement required a recognition that the FEMPI legislation was not needed to its fullest extent, I would agree with that, but I do not agree that we should pass new financial emergency measures.  I ask the Minister, in the context of the Title of the Bill, to reconcile the strength of the economy, about which he keeps telling us, with the need for financial emergency legislation.  I could produce a list of what all Ministers have said in the past month, in boasting about the strength of economic growth.  That is fine, as that is party politics, but underlying economic facts back it up.</p></speech>

In fact, the only emergency is in the areas of housing and health.  One could argue there is also an emergency in terms of poverty and deprivation, given that these conditions have increased exponentially.  Any of the crises that has developed is linked, at least, to income cuts, of which the FEMPI legislation was a significant element in its imposition of reduced incomes on low and middle income earners and the knock-on effects on the economy and society.  I did not agree with that income slashing, even during the crisis; I believed it was counterproductive and made a bad situation worse.  Whatever about the justifications for it at the time, it seems that there is absolutely no justification for continuing emergency legislation that preserves many of the cuts and the deterioration in pay and conditions imposed under a heading, "Emergency Measures".  It keeps them in place.  It only partially gives back to people what they lost and still withholds a great deal in terms of pay and conditions.  People lost vast amounts.  I do not see how the Government can justify doing this.  If anything, now is the time to give back what was taken in full because of the enormous sacrifices people made in the context of an emergency.  The Government's attitude and response will determine how people will view what the recession meant because the Government narrative is, "We did not really like doing this, but we had to do it because it was an emergency".  </p> <p>  Another widely believed narrative, to which I subscribe, is that the Government and the European elites generally pursued a strategy of "Never waste a good crisis" to get through measures they would unable to if they did not declare an emergency or if there was not an emergency atmosphere and will keep as much of it in place for as long as they can-----</p></speech>

IMPACT D&uacute;n Laoghaire branch produced a leaflet with a table showing how much public sector workers at different pay levels had lost during the emergency years annually and overall.  A worker on &euro;30,000 lost &euro;16,000; a worker on &euro;40,000 lost &euro;27,000; and a worker on &euro;50,000 lost &euro;38,000.  Under the Lansdowne Road proposals provided for in the legislation &euro;4,000 would be given back against the figures of &euro;16,000, &euro;27,000 and &euro;38,000.  That is pathetic if there is not an emergency which the Government claims is the case</p> <p>  Does the Minister recognise the increasing consensus among a cohort of analysts, economists and so on who consider income inequality to be the major contributory factor to economic instability and crisis?  He may be familiar with a brilliant paper by Paul Sweeney entitled, Wage Drift, which I read recently.  It outlines the reduction in the share of total national income, GDP, represented by labour and wages, as opposed to capital, and shows that Ireland is one of the worst countries in this regard.  We have had one of the greatest reductions in the OECD in wages' share of the national economic cake since the 1970s.  Surely that is another reason the Government should radically reverse the cuts in income.  This should be done not only because it is unfair to people who have made such sacrifices during the so-called emergency.</p><p>It is also sound economic policy to give something back to workers, to narrow the income inequality gap that has grown and to rebalance wage share in terms of the wider economic cake.  Does the Minister not agree that needs to be done as a matter of urgency?  It is not what has been done in this budget and this legislation does not do it in anything other than a tokenistic way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.303" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22015111000002#C00200"><p>Of 22 amendments tabled, 14 have been ruled out of order as, I presume, they might constitute a charge on the Exchequer.  It is hugely problematic for Deputies when their amendment is ruled out on that basis.  It neuters the debate, especially when one is discussing legislation such as this which is all about pay rates and the restoration of pay and which, by definition, cannot be fully debated or thrashed out without arguing the toss as to the level of the charge on the Exchequer and where Exchequer moneys should go and be best targeted.</p> <p>  My view may be somewhat different from the standard view but I believe there is still a financial emergency and it is felt not least in many of the households of public servants on lower pay who were pickpocketed in the course of the recession.  Whatever about the grand rhetoric about recovery, the recovery has not yet come to those households.  It is welcome that there is partial pay restoration for those workers but I do not think it goes far enough.  The aspect of the legislation that troubles me most is the fact that the Minister is carrying out a sleight of hand.  All of the rhetoric has been about restoration for people on lower pay, namely, those earning up to &euro;65,000 but, while there is partial restoration of pay for those earning under the &euro;65,000 benchmark, once one goes over that figure a full restoration of pay is envisaged on a tranche-by-tranche basis.  I have an issue with that as it is demonstrably unfair.  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  He cannot argue that he is looking after lower paid workers by giving them something which, while welcome, does not nearly undo the damage to their take-home pay or living standards while, at the same time, legislating for full pay restoration for those with pay in excess of &euro;110,000.  I grant that only a very small proportion of people in the public service earn such a salary but many of those people are overpaid and overpensioned.  </p> <p>  Despite the Minister's argument of fairness there is a glaring lack of fairness at the heart of this legislation.  I am happy that at least some of my amendments made it through the process and we will get to debate those in more detail.  The Minister cannot pretend that his concern is to look after lower paid public servants by giving them some crumbs from the rich man's table while fully restoring higher incomes, which are the only levels of income that have been fully restored.  That is wrong and I have tabled amendments to remedy that in this legislation. </p></speech>

I believe this legislation is unconstitutional and that we should have the opportunity through those amendments to bring it into line with the Constitution.  The Government wants it both ways.  It is bringing in emergency legislation but everything the Government states on a daily basis is to the effect that there is no emergency and the emergency is over.  The T&aacute;naiste said that very recently in an opinion piece in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Numerous Ministers have said very similar things. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said that next year, the debt to GDP ratio will be below the European average.  The syndrome of having it both ways is highlighted by the fact that the top 5% of income earners in this country were given &euro;100 million in the recent budget.</p><p>This legislation is particularly unconstitutional in the area of pensions.  Pensions are held by the courts to be the private property of the pensioner and the Minister has told us that private property or pensions can only be interfered with in an emergency.  Various Ministers, including the T&aacute;naiste, tell us there is no emergency and that is why I believe the provisions relating to pensions are unconstitutional.  I will address this during the course of the debates on the various sections.</p><p>I also object strongly to the penalty provisions on unions, particularly in section 4 of the legislation, whereby public servants who simply wish to abide by the agreements they already have are being forced to break them.  That has already created significant difficulties in policing and education and throughout the public service.  We will not have the opportunity to bring this legislation into line with the Constitution because the amendments have been ruled out of order but the legislation will create significant difficulties if it is passed in this form.</p></speech>

In 2011, when the Government of which I am honoured to be a member came into office, we inherited a broken country and a broken economy.  We had lost 250,000 jobs and unemployment was heading towards 500,000.  Our debt as a country peaked at 123% of GDP.  All our efforts for the past five years have been to rebuild the economic foundations of the State and I thank the Deputies opposite for recognising the job of work that has been done, with the forbearance of the Irish people, in getting us to this place.  Three of the four Deputies who have spoken acknowledged that we are out of recession and have no need for any emergency legislation again.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, that is not the full story.  Although we have made enormous progress as a country, we still have real challenges.  We have 9.3% unemployment, which is still unconscionably high.  We need to ensure that everybody is provided with the opportunity to work and that will continue to be the focus of Government policy.</p><p>I am very glad we have reopened the recruiting process in the public sector, which means we are recruiting garda&iacute; and nurses again.  Since the beginning of January last, we have 700 net new nurses and there have been more than 1,100 trainee garda&iacute; in the Garda training college in Templemore since it reopened.  Some 5,500 additional people have been employed in the health services generally since 1 January last year.  It is because we have a recovering economy that we can do these things.<br/><br/>I fully appreciate the points of the Deputies opposite in regard to the imposition on public servants.  However, the people who suffered most grievously in the economic crash were those who lost their jobs.  There are 250,000 people who have no work at all and many tens of thousands were required to leave the country to find work.  It is our objective to provide jobs for all those people and also to allow those who wish to do so to come home again.  I hope there will be net migration into the country next year of Irish people, with more coming back than are leaving.  This is because we have worked so hard to fix the economic mess we inherited.<br/><br/>This is a debate about the Title of the Bill.  It is financial emergency legislation because it is amending the suite of financial emergency Acts that are on the Statute Book.  We are now beginning the walk-back of the impositions that were put on public servants in asking them to make their contributions.  I did not impose this upon them when I came into office.  I sat down and negotiated with dozens of unions and their representatives, and we got agreement.  The Haddington Road agreement was voted upon.  I know there are Deputies opposite who dismissed it before it was even published but it was voted upon by public sector workers who understood they had to make a contribution to fixing our broken economy.  As I said 12 months ago, I now want to begin the restoration of that imposition, starting with the lowest paid.  The Lansdowne Road agreement focuses entirely on the low paid.  Of course, there are measures in the original Haddington Road agreement that will restore pay to all categories of workers who have been cut.  Ultimately, and I say this while particularly referencing the points made by Deputy McDonald, any pay that was cut could only be cut on the basis of it being a temporary measure required by an emergency, and it all has to be restored over time.<br/><br/>The timing is set out in the Bill.  It is not quick enough for Deputy Fleming, who wants the entire FEMPI edifice pulled down immediately.  The additional cost in the FEMPI deal that I had negotiated and that has now been agreed by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions public sector committee, and formally endorsed by workers, is &euro;300 million next year.  If I was to pull the whole edifice down, as recommended in the amendments tabled by Deputy Fleming and in his presentation here, I would have to find an additional &euro;1.9 billion because the total cost of FEMPI is &euro;2.2 billion.  I am giving back &euro;300 million, &euro;300 million the year after that and &euro;300 million the year after that.  As the economy recovers incrementally, that will be done in a phased, orderly way, as I said we would do from the beginning.<br/><br/>There is a notion we can find an additional &euro;1.9 billion - almost &euro;2 billion - immediately.  Where would we get that money?  We certainly do not have the fiscal space additional to what we have spent.  We would have to make an additional &euro;2 billion of cuts or find an additional &euro;2 billion of taxes.  The reason that we cannot, under the rules of the House rather than the rules of any Department or Government, simply impose a cost of &euro;1.9 billion is that, if we are going to do that, there is a moral responsibility to say where we are going to make the cuts and find the wherewithal to do that.<br/><br/>Deputy Boyd Barrett said he opposed FEMPI but welcomed the position the country is now in.  The problem with Deputy Boyd Barrett is that he opposed everything the Government did for the last four years, so he welcomes the end but denies the means.  It is fairyland - get to the right place but do not take any hard decisions <i>en route</i>.  Most people understand that is fanciful, not the real world and not the way things can be done.  If the Deputy wants a practical example to prove it, he need look no further than Greece, where promises were made to people that could not be delivered.  The great irony is that the same government, or a slightly different government but the same main party, has now been re-elected and is doing the very things it railed against when first elected in January of this year.<br/><br/>Deputy Boyd Barrett also mentioned the issue of poverty.  We are the only country that went through a programme where inequality reduced - that is the simple fact of it.  That was because we maintained the equalisation measures available to any government, which are taxation and social welfare, in a way that was certainly not maintained in any of the other programme countries.  I am very proud of that.  Very difficult impositions were made on everybody in society as we made our journey of recovery.<br/><br/>The issue of low pay was mentioned.  As I said, the focus of the pay restoration in the agreement I put to the unions and that they negotiated with me is almost exclusively focused on low and middle income earners.  Of course, there will be pay restitution for everybody over time because that is required.  Once the emergency ends, the basis for reducing anybody's pay will end, and that is a simple matter of fact.  Again, however, if we look at the most recent statistics, a comparison between public sector and private sector pay shows that the imbalance is at the lower end, where public sector workers are actually paid more than private sector workers.  It is <i>vice versa</i>at the top end, where private sector workers are paid more than public workers.  That is an interesting fact that is not often instanced.<br/><br/>Deputy Healy focused almost exclusively on pensioners and said they should get everything back immediately.  Bluntly, we are trying to do this in a balanced way.  There are relatively low paid workers who, for a full 39-hour week, earn less than people who are pensioned at the top.  I do not believe it is the right approach that full restoration of pensions should take priority over full restoration of pay.  It has to be done in a proportionate and balanced way, as I have set out to do.</p></speech>

Two or three observations come to mind.  I am concerned that the Minister is essentially saying that, if we do not have the suite of old FEMPI legislation in place, the Lansdowne Road agreement will be torn up.  That is the import of what he said.  We have just come through the Lansdowne Road agreement, which I believe was a fairly negotiated agreement that was accepted by both sides-----</p></speech>

Where was the honour on both sides in that agreement if it is felt that a change to this legislation means the agreement did not happen?  The Minister referred to the agreement and the changes that were introduced.  I take the view that the people who negotiated the Lansdowne Road agreement for the next three years, regardless of what happens in the wider economy, have an agreement that those on both sides will honour.  I do not believe an elimination of FEMPI in any way tears up the agreement.  I make the point that the agreement was legislated for.</p><p>I find interesting the new remark made by the Minister on the timescale for striking out the FEMPI legislation from the Statute Book.  I hope I am wrong but my interpretation of what the Minister has stated is that the Lansdowne Road agreement will bring a saving of &euro;300 million next year.</p></speech>

The Minister also said that the total savings under the FEMPI legislation would be &euro;2.2 billion.  I still do not believe the FEMPI  legislation would hold in court today.  The Minister might think it would but I would call it fig-leaf legislation.  There is no longer any substance behind it but that is a moot point.</p> <p>  Is the Minister making the point that if the FEMPI legislation no longer exists, the &euro;2.2 billion reduction in public service pay will have to be reversed?</p></speech>

In effect what the Minister is saying is that in the course of the three year period, if we get to &euro;900 million, a sum of &euro;1.3 billion still remains to be met beyond 2018.  If we are lucky enough to be able to return that to the public sector in another three or four years, it means paying a sum of between &euro;300 million or &euro;400 million per annum.  The Minister is saying the FEMPI legislation must remain on the Statute Book for a further four years after the end of the Lansdowne Road agreement.  When the members of the Government go canvassing next spring, will they be telling the country there is a financial emergency which will continue for another six to eight years?</p></speech>

I repeatedly said, in parliamentary replies to both Deputies Fleming and McDonald across the floor, that I wanted to make an orderly, structured and agreed unwinding process and put it into place in legislation.  That is why I opened negotiations very early in regard to this.  What we have set out is the first unwinding agreement.  I have no doubt that as the economy improves there will be further negotiations.</p> <p>  I have set out the horizon, which will last for the next three years.  Depending on a number of factors, as members know because we have reached a deficit of less than 3% of GDP, we are exiting the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact in 2015.  Next year we enter into a different economic paradigm, which is the preventative arm of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The budget was cast on the basis that we would have to meet this new criteria, which was setting our medium term objective, setting our path towards achieving our medium term objective and also looking at and calculating the allowable budgetary expenditure for 2016.  I believe the economy will continue, if there is no jolt to the system, to make the significant improvements and grow at the rate we have set out in the budget plan.  The OECD, as well as our own projections, are for growth of the order of 6% for 2015.  We will have growth hopefully of the order of 4.5% to 5% next year and at least 3.5% to 4% for the two years following that.  The more capacity we have, the quicker we can unwind all the impositions, not only in public sector pay but other impositions that were put on expenditure, recruitment and so on, that characterised a collapsed economy.</p> <p>  As of now, this is the horizon I have negotiated with the public sector unions.  The public sector unions have agreed to this new collective agreement.  Of course, unions will look at the progress Ireland Inc. makes over the next few years and if they believe that the progress continues to be as sturdy as we project, they may well want a quicker restoration of pay.  That will be for whatever government is in place into the future to sit down in the same open-minded way with the public sector unions to negotiate that.  It should be done in a balanced and fair way, taking all matter into account, including the capacity of the State to continue to provide quality public services.</p> <p>  One of the discussions I had with public sector unions during the original Haddington Road agreement negotiations was on the alternative if those earning over &euro;65,000 who were asked to take a pay cut and others on lower salaries to work longer would not agree to it.  The alternative would have been to cut public services.  Public servants know full well the value of the services they provide and embraced that request and agreed to this imposition.  We now need to begin the unwinding of that in an orderly way.  The fiscal space on the expenditure side for next year is of the order of &euro;750 million and we devoted &euro;300 million of that total to public sector pay.  I was criticised for that but I think it was a fair determination to make at the time.  How we proceed as the years pass and as, I hope, the economy stays on track will be a matter to be determined into the future.  I hope it will be through collective agreement again with public sector unions.</p></speech>

I know the Minister cannot determine the number of years, in the way I did, but is he saying that the Lansdowne Road agreement, which the Government has agreed with the unions, brings costs of &euro;900 million at the end of the period in question?  Is that &euro;900 million per annum at the end of it?</p></speech>

Is the Minister essentially saying that at the end of the period of the Lansdowne Road agreement, based on the projections that he has entered into the agreement, that the Government will be 40% of the way towards restoring pay cuts, paying &euro;900 million out of &euro;2.2 billion, and that when we get to the end of 2018, we will see how long more it will take and let us hope it is very short?  Is the Minister telling the country that for a minimum of three years and a period beyond, we are in a financial emergency?</p> <p>  Is it correct that the Lansdowne Road agreement is based on the FEMPI legislation continuing to the end of the agreement?</p></speech>

With the permission of the Chair, I will elaborate lest there be any misunderstanding.</p> <p>  The Lansdowne Road agreement is meaningless if one collapses the entire architecture of the FEMPI legislation.  There is no point in negotiating a restoration of pay if all pay is immediately restored.  That is self-evident.  It is a process of unwinding as opposed to collapsing, which I think would be a shock to the public finances which could not be endured.  I do not see how one could find an additional &euro;1.9 billion to pay public servants, for no extra productivity, in the course of 2016.</p></speech>

My take is that it made things worse.  The reason Greece is worse is not because the Greeks did not do that but because they did.  They had even more extreme emergency income and wage gouging and that is why their economy collapsed.  The IMF acknowledged that it got its multipliers wrong in this regard.  It admitted the extent of the adverse impact on economies as a result of slashing the incomes of low and middle-income people was much bigger than it anticipated using its multipliers.  The logic of admitting that is that cutting pay for low and middle-income people was the wrong thing to do.</p></speech>

To cut a very long story short, at the end of the period envisaged in this legislation covered by the Lansdowne Road agreement between now and 2018, someone who was earning &euro;30,000 in 2009 will still be earning less than they earned in 2009.  It is the same for those on &euro;40,000 or &euro;50,000.  At the end of this so-called restoration of pay they will be earning less than they were in 2009.  Nine years after the crisis they will not have had their pay restored, which represents a massive gouging of income at a time of growth in the economy.  When those two things are put together, it means that the benefits of the economic growth are not going to low and middle-income people but are going elsewhere.  We have considerable evidence of where they are going which is that the wealth of the richest in Irish society has grown exponentially during the period of the so-called emergency and is continuing to grow.  The millionaires and billionaires have got richer during this period.</p> <p>  I agree that we should collapse the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.  It would be very good to have to give a &euro;2.2 billion injection to low and middle-income earners and would be good for the economy, not bad for the economy.  I accept it would have to be taken from elsewhere and the place to get it is from those at the very top who have massively increased their wealth and assets during the crisis.  That would be fair and it would also be a good economic move because it would address the issue I raised with the Minister of wage drift - the reducing share of the national economic cake that is going to wages.  The Minister did not respond to that point, but it is a fact.  Is that something the Minister wants to do?  Paul Sweeney, among others, has said that that reduced share of national income that is going to wages is a very bad thing and needs to be reversed.  Does the Minister recognise that?  If he does, the Government would need to take radical emergency measures in the opposite direction. </p></speech>

When the Minister compares the pay of low-paid public servants with pay in the private sector he will be aware that we now rank second only to the United States for low pay.  He will be aware that people in the private sector work on zero-hours contracts and what amounts to poverty wages.  He should not take any succour from this and should not brag about benchmarking public sector workers against that kind of scenario that is faced by so many.  The legislation may be well named because it will undoubtedly confirm to lower-paid public servants that whatever about the macroeconomic picture - we could debate that and would probably not get consensus across the floor on it - certainly the emergency regime is still very real in their households.</p> <p>  As I said in my opening comments, my fundamental issue is that the only place in which full unwinding is envisaged and set out in black and white in this legislation refers to income not at &euro;65,000 and lower but for &euro;65,000 and higher, for &euro;110,000, if one does not mind, and higher in two tranches and three tranches respectively.  That can be contrasted with what is afforded to those earning less than &euro;65,000.  That is by any definition partial.  I can understand from the perspective of public sector workers who have been repeatedly hammered that any relief is relief.  I acknowledge that is how people will see it, but it is not lost on people that there is a direct contrast between those on less than &euro;65,000 and those earning over &euro;65,000.</p> <p>  I have no issue with pay moderation in the public sector and I have argued that with the Minister previously in terms of reining in some of the excessive pay and pensions of a small minority within the service.  That needs to happen.  However, the fundamental inequity here is partial unwinding for some and for lowered portions of income as against full unwinding for those on higher incomes and in some cases excessive levels of income in the public sector.  There is a real issue about that.</p> <p>  The Minister bragged that he had negotiated out these agreements eyeball to eyeball with trade unions.  He did that with the explicit threat that they had to agree or else there would be legislation.  He should bear that in mind.</p><p>The turning point for industrial relations and collective agreements within the public sector, in terms of the employer, namely, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the State, now being about to step in and legislate in the absence of agreement, was a retrograde step.  I am sure we will not agree on that either.  I would also like to reference a point made by Deputy Healy on section 4, the amendments to which have been ruled out of order.  Section 4 amends the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2013 to extend by a further two years the suspension of the operation of incremental pay scales with respect to any public servants not encompassed by registered collective agreements, which in my opinion means those who will not play ball with the Minister - specifically, the TUI and the teachers.</p></speech>

Apparently our recovery is due to the ups and downs of the global economy.

That is the sort of economic analysis that would have destroyed us in 2011 had we not began the process of getting things back on track.</p> <p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett also believes that we should restore pay to everybody immediately.  He posits the way to do that is to increase taxation by &euro;1.9 billion.  Obviously, an additional &euro;300 million would also have to be found, which means we would have to increase taxes by &euro;2.2 billion.

We did that during the worst part of recession.  We also set up the Low Pay Commission to examine the issue of low pay.  The Low Pay Commission is an independent body that will report on this issue.  The Government has accepted its first report such that by 1 January next we will have increased the minimum wage by 20% even in the thick of recession.</p> <p>  I do not know if Deputy McDonald is confused or is misrepresenting the fact but senior public servants in receipt of incomes in excess of &euro;65,000 per annum were impacted by a third pay cut when all others were impacted by only two cuts.  The restoration about which the Deputy speaks will not be full restoration for the most senior public servants, rather it is the restoration of the third pay cut.  It will be some time before there is restoration of the other two pay cuts.  Following implementation of the provisions of this Bill, the lowest paid will have had all pay cuts restored.  Subsection 6A(7) provides that where the application of subsections (3), (4) and (5) results in pay restoration of in excess of what was lost that increase will be retained.  This means that the lowest paid will, in some instances, be better off than they were prior to any cut.  This is provided for in the section.</p></speech>

Every nurse, teacher and member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the mid point of their pay scale will gain an additional &euro;2,000 per annum as a result of this Bill.  Those at the new entrance grade, including new entrants to nursing and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, will gain that amount plus another &euro;200.  I think that is the right thing to do.  I have used this legislation to address another issue also, namely, the anomaly in terms of the reduction of entrance grade, which has been addressed on a sector by sector basis in different ways, including by way of amalgamation of grades, a reduction in points of increment and so on.  The Bill is structured in a manner which ensures fairness and a focus on low and middle income earners in the first instance, while remaining mindful that everybody is entitled to pay restoration.  This is emergency legislation that ultimately will have to be unwound.  I wanted to do this in a way that is affordable and does not result in another catastrophic impact on the Irish economy.</p></speech>

I am setting out what the legislation provides for.  It would have been a better day out had the Minister provided for the full and orderly unwinding and restoration of all pay cuts to earnings below the &euro;65,000 benchmark.  That would have been a more orderly and fair way of going about this.</p> <p>  In terms of the higher earnings, there is, as I have stated previously to the Minister, a debate to be had about higher earnings within the public sector, whether merited or not.</p><p>He could have tackled those issues and dealt with that afterwards but that is not how the Minister has gone about it.  Amendment No. 3 proposes the deletion of lines 3 to 29 on page 6.  It deals with the matter of the restoration, in full, of the higher portion of earnings for higher earners.<br/><br/>Amendment No. 6 is also in my name and proposes that the phrase &quot;Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, nothing in this section shall provide for increases in the salaries of members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or Ministers of the Government.&quot; be inserted into the Bill.  If there is an emergency, it is incumbent on those who govern and on those who introduced all of these cuts to lead from the front.  Amendment No. 7, which is also in my name, proposes the inclusion of the phrase &quot;Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, nothing in this section shall provide for increases in the salaries of public servants in receipt of salaries in excess of &euro;100,000 before the coming into effect of this section&quot; in section 3.<br/><br/>Amendments Nos.10 and 16 are in a similar vein.  Amendment No. 10 proposes to insert the following into the Bill:</p><blockquote>(7) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, nothing in this section shall provide for decreases in the pensions related deduction of members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or Ministers of the Government.</blockquote><p>Amendment No. 16 proposes that the following be inserted into section 3:</p><blockquote>(8) Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, nothing in this section shall provide for a reduction in Public Service Pension Reduction of former members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or Ministers of the Government.</blockquote><p>This emergency legislation should not prove to be a Trojan horse or a mechanism for the restoration of the excessively high salaries or pensions of Members of the Oireachtas and, in particular, members of the Government.  God knows there has been acres of coverage and comment - and legitimately so - on the truly scandalous pensions with which people walked away.  Some of the individuals in question were party to, or instrumental in, bringing about the financial emergency in the first instance.</p></speech>

I will give the committee some background to this.  The whole Haddington Road agreement architecture meant pay cuts were progressive and ranged from 5.5% to 10% over increasing remuneration bands.  It was constructed so that the biggest cuts were taken by those on the highest pay.  When we negotiated the Haddington Road agreement in 2013, we built in - as set out in the Bill before the committee - proposals for the restoration of pay.  That was part of the agreement and was voted upon by public sector unions.  I intend to respect the agreement, as I have said I would do for every part of it.</p> <p>  For those on salaries in excess of &euro;65,000 but under &euro;110,000, there should be two annualised payments as provided for in the agreement.  For those earning in excess of that, for the portion of their pay that was reduced by the third cut, it would happen in three payments and be extended out to 2019.  That was a bone of contention in the negotiations because people felt it should have been restored within the two tranches.  However, I felt it would be better if it took longer for those on higher pay to have that portion of their remuneration restored.</p> <p>  Many public servants - they are not enormous in number but they are very important public servants - are paid in excess of &euro;65,000 or in excess of &euro;100,000.  These people are mostly working within the HSE and if I accepted Deputy's proposal - that consultant doctors should be excluded from the provisions of this Bill - it would not be conducive to ensuring a functioning health service.  That would be a mistake.  There are middle-ranking and senior garda&iacute;, senior administrators and others who would be impacted upon by the Deputy's proposals and I do not think that would be appropriate.  Ultimately, all the pay cuts that were imposed are subject to-----</p></speech>

The Deputy particularly focused on not giving any restoration above &euro;100,000.  Just under 5,000 public servants earn more than &euro;100,000, which is less than 2% of the total.  More than half of those are doctors in the health system.  They make up more than half of the people who would be deprived of any pay restoration.  We have had this debate previously.  It is already proving difficult to recruit doctors and retain them in this country.  The Minister for Health is under pressure to provide incentives to get consultants to apply for positions and there are many vacant positions.</p> <p>  I met SIPTU nursing representatives during the week.  There are many nursing vacancies because we have created so many posts and they are difficult to fill.  So I would certainly not cut or freeze their incomes as the Deputy is suggesting.  In order to ensure we have a functioning public health system, we need to pay competitive rates.  More than half of the people affected by the Deputy's amendment are people we need in our hospitals.  That would not be an outcome that anyone in this House would welcome, as they would be forced out of the public sector.  The public health service would come under enormous strain and be even more dependent on the private health sector as doctors migrated to it.</p> <p>  Regarding members of the Government, etc., on the day we announced the Lansdowne Road agreement, we made it clear that Ministers, officeholders and special advisers would not avail of the restoration and the reduction in the pay-related deduction, PRD, provided for in the Bill.</p></speech>

The Minister claims he seeks to achieve an orderly, equitable and fair unwinding of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation.</p><p>The fair thing to do would be to start with workers with an income below the &euro;65,000 threshold.  In fact, before the legislation was published, the Minister went out of his way to give the impression that this was what he was minded to do.  It is only when the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreements are taken together, in the round and in the whole, that one can see what is actually happening in public sector pay. </p><p> As a matter of interest, does the Minister have and can he produce a table of income brackets, starting from the lowest paid and up to people with an income in excess of &euro;110,000, and set out for us, year on year, in euro and cents, what the different categories of workers will receive, outside the figures of &euro;2,000 and &euro;200 that have been clearly set out?</p></speech>

It is almost exclusively about low and middle income earners.  Of course, from the time we negotiated the Haddington Road agreement, it was in black and white that there would be pay restoration.  That is implicit in the agreement.  That is the agreement we put to the unions, that we negotiated and endorsed, that we voted on in the House and that we asked the trade unions to vote on.  As it provided for pay restoration, of course I was going to implement, in full, everything to which I was a party.  It was the next phase over and above what had been agreed in the agreement,as well as in the Lansdowne Road agreement which was focused on low and middle income earners.  At end of the day, as I have said - this is the net point at which the Deputy is getting - she does not want those at the very top to see any pay restoration.  If that is her point of view, it is a fair point to make.  I am saying the majority of those high earners are medics and that unless we restore their pay, we will be unable to have a functioning public health system which would not be in anybody's interests.</p></speech>

What I know is that the Minister has not provided, in line with the announcement he made, for the exclusion of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and, more particularly, members of the Government, from the restoration outlined in the legislation.  I imagine, given his declaration, that he will be happy to support amendments Nos. 10 and 16 in my name.</p></speech>

I am saying that, on a voluntary basis, members of the Government have determined that they should be, with their advisers and other officeholders.  Bluntly, I do not think we should isolate any category of worker, although I know that there is a school of thought that this would be popular.  As the pay rate for Senators is &euro;65,000, I do not think they are overpaid.  I do not think Deputies are currently overpaid, but that is my personal view.  They should benefit from pay restoration with every other analogous worker, no more, no less.  As a clear signal, members of the Government will exclude themselves from the restoration in its entirety.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-10a.426" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="17:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22015111000002#L02300"><p>I support the thrust of the amendments.  It is important to say that in proposing such amendments, or supporting them in my case, although they are in line with my party's broad policy on these matters, there is no vendetta against politicians, Ministers or those earning over &euro;100,000.  It is about saying a person who earned &euro;30,000 in 2009 will at the end of this deal still earn less than &euro;30,000.  At the end of it he or she will earn &euro;29,500.  Similarly, on restoration, a person earning &euro;40,000 will receive &euro;2,000 out of the more than &euro;4,000 that was taken from his or her annual income.  A person earning &euro;50,000 will see a restoration of &euro;2,000 of the total of &euro;5,825 taken from him or her.  These figures have been provided by the IMPACT trade union.  The people on these incomes are the very ones who cannot afford to pay their rent or bills or who are suffering mortgage distress.  They are the victims of the housing crisis and their need is greater.  Faced with the options available, should it not be a priority for the Government to give back as much as possible to the people in question who lhave difficulty in paying their rent and bills.  I do not exaggerate when I say I am dealing with low paid public servants who have been made homeless.  That is what is happening.  It is against that background that I say the following without hostility or vitriol towards a politician earning &euro;89,000, or a Minister who has voluntarily but not statutorily been excluded.  The same applies to a consultant earning over &euro;100,000 a year.</p><p>Given the choice of giving pay restoration to those who, let us be honest can manage reasonably comfortably, as against people who cannot pay the bills or the rent, I know where our priorities should be.  I am convinced our priority has to be to put people back in a position where they can simply make ends meet.  That should also be the Minister's priority.</p><p> I accept there is a difficulty with consultants but when one listens to what they are saying, the majority say the problem is the disaster in the health service.  It is stress that they cannot bear.  They do not know what to do, or which way to turn because things are such a mess.</p></speech>

When one is at that level of pay it is not only about the pay levels because they are adequate to keep a roof over your head.

Much of it has to do with the complete mess in the health service.  The other side of the coin in the health service is the nurses.  We have a huge deficit in nurses.  They are on the low to middle end of the pay scale.  Getting them to return to Ireland has to do with both the crisis in the health service and what they are dealing with and also pay, for very good reason.</p> <p>  This is a basic consideration.  If one were a nurse in England or elsewhere, one would look at what is on offer in Ireland and ask whether the salary would cover accommodation costs.  That is the key point to consider.  Can the rent be paid and the answer is "No" for people on low and middle incomes.  That is what the Minister needs to address.</p></speech>

There are a few basic principles of trade unionism.  One is the rate for the job.  The Deputy has a different view.  Craft workers were always paid more than manual workers and there was pay for skills that were acquired.  I believe Deputy Healy, who has some trade union background, will understand that additional skills were paid for.  In a society in which people have choice about where they work there is the rate for the job.  If one does not pay the rate for the job, one will not get the skilled worker.  That is the general rule.</p> <p>  We are having difficulties now in recruiting consultants in particular.  The majority of people who would be impacted on by Deputy McDonald's amendment - more than half - are medics in our health system.  Let me say to the Deputies opposite that if they talk to the health unions they will make it crystal clear that pay is an issue and the notion that they would allow for no pay restoration at all is something that would not be accepted in reality.  here will be difficulties in the continuation of recruiting people as we try to expand our health system.</p> <p>  I will now deal with the nursing issue.  We have recruited in net terms an additional 700 nurses since the beginning of last year.  We have looked, at the request of the Minister for Health, at incentivising people to come back from England, by giving them relocating fees to help in making that decision, which has helped.  I spoke to a trade union official on the nursing side during the week.  He told me about a health facility - it was not a unique hospital but a health facility - which was looking to recruit nine nurses.  They interviewed, short-listed and then appointed nine people, down to Garda vetting.  On the appointed day one person turned up because the other eight had been on a number of panels as every part of the health service is now recruiting nurses.  That is what I hear when I talk to people about the issue.</p> <p>  Senior nurses at the top end will earn more than &euro;65,000.  We have tried to assist.  I know the staff nurse starting off, like the Garda starting off, is relatively low paid.  Increments will be restored in the way we have set out in the Bill.  Ultimately, the FEMPI legislative architecture will have to be eventually dismantled altogether, and this may be done by me or whoever is in my office next year and the years beyond.  That will mean everybody getting total pay restoration over time.  As I said, the cuts are predicated on there being an emergency.  That has to be certified annually - each July - by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  People will be looking at the orderly unwinding of this to see if it is going fast enough, whether it is in step with the economic progress the nation is making and to see if there is a case stateable to the courts in terms of the existence of an emergency.  That will be a call that the future Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will have to make next summer.  He or she will have to justify his or her decision in terms of a presentation to the D&aacute;il in the summer of next year.</p></speech>

Is it not a fact that for vast numbers of public servants who are on low and middle incomes, none will move into the plus territory by the end of 2018, which is the end of the Lansdowne Road agreement?  My reference for this point is the table produced by IMPACT.  I know it is different across the public sector but clearly this table shows that in 2018, people on incomes of &euro;30,000, &euro;40,000 and &euro;50,000, which are the examples given, will still be earning less than they were earning in 2009.

In a response to me earlier the Minister said I was trying to ensure pensioners would be given priority over low paid workers.  That is not the position.  There is no question of wanting pensioners to have priority over anybody else.  The issue is pensioners receiving their entitlements.  Pensions are owned by pensioners and are, in fact, private property.</p></speech>

We negotiate collective agreements with public sector unions.  That is the way it has always been done.  Most public servants are members of trade unions which negotiate on their behalf.  Once a deal is cut, members are expected to take it in its totality if they want to avail of the benefits.  The notion that any public sector worker should expect to receive the benefits of the deal without taking it in its totality collapses the basis of collective bargaining and negotiations.  It is the fundamental basis on which trade unions operate in industrial relations.</p></speech>

I want to restore that to them incrementally in a way that is affordable and does not put at risk the progress that we have made.</p> <p>  To answer the Deputy's question directly, it is aimed at no one.  In any negotiation, one cannot opt out of everything one must do under the deal yet retain all of the benefits and expect the deal to be sustained.  That is not how the world lives.  If any set of negotiators brought something to the table, asked what the other side brought and cut a deal but someone decided at the end that he or she only wanted the good bits and none of the bad bits, there would be no negotiation.  I am happy for my officials to sit down with trade unions as they have done and go through this provision in detail if anyone has concerns about it.  That is what we did through the Haddington Road and Lansdowne Road agreement processes and what we will keep doing as our economy, please God, continues to recover.</p></speech>

Where agreement could not be reached, he would swoop in to legislate.  He has given us a tutorial in his perspective of industrial relations, how they work and their basic tenets.  One of the fundamentals of the relationship between the State and its workforce is that it is voluntarist and has not traditionally utilised legislation in this way.  That was a significant shift.  We have debated this point 100 times, but that is what this discussion is about.  The Minister could not get the unions to agree, so he will get them to agree through this.</p></speech>

I am looking at paragraph 5.4 of that agreement.  I am sure that the officials beside the Minister have it.  That paragraph was voted on and accepted by the majority.  Does it facilitate this or is this provision something that the Minister has included despite it not being a part of the agreement?

If there was no Landsdowne Road agreement, this provision would expire and the Minister's capacity under this legislation to withhold increments would not exist.  That was the basis under which certain trade unions took the view that the road to the restoration of pay and conditions was not to sign up to a deal which would extend or continue those constraints.  They were right to adopt that position and the Minister is wrong to continue with them.  We have already dealt with the issue of pay but on the issue of increments, what is the justification for the Minister having the power to withhold them from anybody?  That is my question because I do not believe there is any justification for that.</p> <p>  The Minister has put his argument as to why he cannot give full pay restoration.  I do not accept his argument but we have already had that debate.  Will he explain why, in addition to not giving full pay restoration, he also believes it is acceptable and legitimate to withhold increments if workers do not agree with him and to hold that over them, effectively, as a threat?</p></speech>

It is all money.  I have allocated &euro;300 million for additional pay next year, to begin this process.  That goes into the base and a further &euro;300 million is expected in each of the following two years, incrementally building up, as Deputy Fleming pointed out, to &euro;900 million over the three years.  Next year that amounts to &euro;300 million out of a fiscal space of &euro;750 million.  I was very significantly criticised for embarking on that in advance of the budget, for trying to have a settled public sector pay agreement before I presented the budget.  The Deputy cannot have it every way.</p> <p>  Bluntly, in order to meet fiscal rules under which we live, there is a finite amount of money that can be afforded.  I have set out to the trade unions representing public sector workers what I think is a fair deal.  I have listened to their arguments and have amended the proposals on foot of negotiations.  The public sector committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions balloted its members and accepted what is here.  What is before us today is, in legislative form, the collective agreement negotiated and agreed with the public sector unions.  It is as simple as that.  This section aims to ensure that we have normal discipline in the way the public sector operates.  We cannot simply have anybody, be it an individual union or an individual worker, saying, "I only want the good bits.  I want full pay restoration, I want my increments and everything else but I am not bound by other bits of it".  The collective agreement is collective in its totality.  That is the way it has always been, that unions negotiate and sign off.  The majority voted in favour within all of the unions that voted, with some voting against.  That is the position as of now.  </p> <p>  If we stay the course, our economy will continue to improve and we can make further improvements in this area, hopefully before the expiry of the Landsdowne Road agreement.  Certainly, if I am in a position to do so, I will try to do that but we will have to see how the economic landscape looks in one year and two year's time.</p></speech>

He has made a general argument and wheeled out the usual talk about fantasy economics.  We can both trade insults forever but I am asking a question about increments.  We have already dealt with the argument about pay and now we are talking about increments.  This is about the Minister continuing to give to himself the power to withhold increments and I do not believe that is justified.  I do not believe it was justified back then but we can set that aside.  What justification is there now for the Minister giving himself the power to withhold increments if people do not come to a particular agreement with him?  It is interesting that the Minister used the word "discipline", particularly given that he mentioned earlier that he comes from a trade union family.  He is now talking about disciplining trade unionists and workers.</p></speech>

I think the Committee of Public Accounts had a look at increments as well.  I went through a year of being beaten up by many in this House saying that I was giving allowances and increments and pay increases when people were suffering grievously.  I did not hear Deputy Boyd Barrett lend his support at the time.  Obviously, increments are part of pay.  I have to deal with pay in the totality of money I have available.  Bluntly, when I mention the word discipline, I mean discipline in the way we negotiate.  I must have discipline in delivering the trade union agreement that I negotiate and the unions have to deliver their side of the bargain.  Some people may say they are opting out of any collective agreement because it does not affect them; they want all the pay restoration elements and the good parts of it yet will not do anything they do not like.  Wherever that applies we need to have a structure in place that ensures a collective agreement can apply so that people who negotiate in good faith get what they negotiated.</p></speech>

It prevents the anomaly which would otherwise arise for a relatively small number of pensioners, 1,500 to 1,800.  The anomaly is that certain pensions, following the Bills public service pension reduction, PSPR, adjustments, could become lower in pay value than certain other pensions which were previously higher than them.  The relevant pensions which could be impacted by the anomaly are in respect of persons who retired before March 2012, have a PSPR value above the threshold figure of &euro;34,132 and, more specifically, are in the narrow band of pre-PSPR range of &euro;34,132 to &euro;34,750.

No retired public servants were represented at the talks and they feel that has been a major disadvantage.  I understand there are up 140,000 retired public servants and that the changes over the three years of this agreement will take many of them out of it.  However, quite a number will still come under it.  I have no interest in people who are on very high salaries being accommodated under this legislation.  Section 6, Table C, provides that those in receipt of up to &euro;34,132 will be exempt from the public service pension reduction.</p></speech>

That would take a very large number of retired public servants out of the public service pension reduction.  It would leave those who were on very high salaries in the first place, who would be on a pension over that amount, not exempt.  That is fair enough.  We are not here to look after the people who had exceptionally large salaries.  The Minister could have gone a little further than &euro;34,132.  Their argument is that because of their age they have limited time left and feel that the three-year wait is harder on them because of their age and many of them may not be around to get the benefit of the three years.  Even those who are, when they get to the end of the three years they do not know where they stand at that stage as it will be subject to a future agreement.  It creates uncertainty for older people.</p> <p>  They highlight the fact that the USC deduction applies to all public service pensions, so they have to pay USC on their public service pension but there is an exclusion for people on the State pension, which is only right.  Given that they are on a public service pension in lieu of the State contributory pension it is unfair they should have to pay the USC, whereas those on the State pension may be in receipt of a similar or greater amount, depending on the number of years service.  They stress that some of this has a disproportionate effect on female pensioners because many were on lower incomes from the start and, by definition, are on lower pensions and may be caught for USC, based on their pensions which would not happen if they were on the State contributory pension.  Those are some of the points I would like addressed and, in particular, the fact that they felt excluded from the whole process, even though the Minister said previously they did not have an association represented at the talks.  Some members of Government parties would have told them that it would be illegal for them to be at the talks.  That was actually stated to these people when we met them in Buswells a couple of weeks ago.  I said that was nonsense and that we would move on from that.  The reason given to them was that the Lansdowne Road agreement was about pay talks not pension talks so that they had no business there.  Any agreement can be what one wants it to be and it could have included pensions.  It is a very fine argument.  I think the Minister can understand the difficulty pensioners are in; they were not allowed participate.  There are quite a number of them.  We talked about retired garda&iacute; and some of those who might be marginally over the &euro;34,000.  They feel that a little more would have meant they would be exempt and would preserve the principle of not reversing the public service pension reduction for people on very high pensions.  None of us is in the mood to have that debate here at this stage.  I would like to get a response to the points made.</p></speech>

However, I said I would ensure they were fully briefed on the progress of talks and that they would not be left out in respect of pay restoration.</p> <p>  The Lansdowne Road agreement was predicated on pay restoration being focused in the first instance on people below &euro;65,000.

A person on &euro;68,000 yields a pension of &euro;34,000.  That represents a significant proportion of all pensioners.  Many would not have retired with a salary in excess of &euro;68,000.  Under these provisions, they will be exempted entirely from any impact through the three incremental payments over the coming three years, starting on 1 January next year.

This is something we will see as the economy improves.  I am mindful of the other point Deputy Fleming made which I did not reference.  There is uniqueness about people who retired in terms of longevity.  That is something I will look at again, or whoever is in my position next year will look at it, I presume, in terms of the continuing recovery of the economy, to see if we can truncate the time lag.  Anyway, that is a matter for debate in the context of next year's Estimates.</p></speech>

Basically, I want to make the point that pensions are effectively private property.  That has been decided by the courts.  It is effectively withheld pay over the lifetime of the pensioner.</p> <p>  I believe the question of not restoring the pension in full from 1 January is unconstitutional.  The Minister has told us previously that pensions can only be interfered with in a national emergency.  Various Ministers, including the T&aacute;naiste, have told us there is no emergency any more.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, tells us that the debt to GDP ratio is going to be less than the European average next year.  As I said earlier, the last budget gave &euro;100 million to the top 5% in the country, the highest earners.  It gave &euro;10 million to the 10,000 people who have &euro;595,000 per annum or more in income.</p> <p>  The provisions amount to the State withholding &euro;95 million of the &euro;125 million.  That amount is effectively being confiscated by the State.  That is a constitutional question.  I believe the various amendments put down should have been allowed to ensure an opportunity to bring this legislation into line with the Constitution.</p> <p>  Various points have been made by Deputy Fleming.  They are perfectly correct in respect of the non-involvement of pensioners in the process.  There is another key point.  Pensioners are of a particular age.  Many of them are effectively at a stage in life where they will pass on and will be at a loss in respect of their pensions, which are then withheld forevermore.  This affects their families as well.  I believe these pension provisions should be withdrawn by the Minister and full restoration should be effected.</p></speech>

Deputy Healy may not have noticed that we went through the worst economic crisis in our history.  I asked workers to make a contribution.  They made that contribution.  I asked pensioners to make a contribution as well.  I met them.  Obviously, no one wants to forego money.  We should remember that many pensioners retired on a pension without any pay cut.  Many workers have had up to three pay cuts in the course of this crisis.  This legislation is restoring income to any pensioner who was on a pension below &euro;34,000 per year.  Not too many people in the country are on pensions of that nature.  There are decent pensions in the public sector.  Anyway, it would have meant those affected retired on an income of &euro;68,000.  Those people will have full restoration following the enactment of this Bill.  There will be a longer lead-in to those on pensions greater than &euro;34,000.</p><p>They will make an incrementally smaller contribution, less than 2% if one is on &euro;35,000 going up to 10.5% if one is on &euro;100,000.  Deputy Healy is arguing there should be no cut at all in pensions.  I daresay that if there were a debate about politicians&rsquo; pensions, he would have something different to say.</p><p> The bottom line is I agree with the thrust of what Deputy Healy said about pensions being a preserved property right.  That has been determined by the courts.  That is why we have taken very careful advices from the Attorney General, of which some have already been tested in the courts.  The criteria required, as I have put on the record before, are that to sustain pension contribution, there needs to be an emergency which needs to be certified.  The contribution must be one towards addressing that emergency.  It needs to be proportionate in terms of the person&rsquo;s income and it needs to be non-discriminatory.  In other words, one cannot say that category of people should be deprived of a pension and that category should not.  It has to have general application.</p><p> I believe those criteria are met with this.  I have listened carefully to the pension representatives and the well-made points by Deputy Sean Fleming about accelerating this process.  I agree with that.  This was negotiated during the course of 2015 and we will start the restoration in January.  If I am in a position, I would like to accelerate that.  Please God, the financial circumstances of the State will be such that we can accelerate the restoration, for pensioners in particular, earlier than is set out in this legislation.</p></speech>

He said when they had all these heads in the room from all these sides, there were a whole lot of niggly things that had been bubbling away for the past few years.  He said they dealt with them all on a one-to-one basis and several agreements were struck but were not part of the Lansdowne Road agreement itself or the formal process.  In reality, however, they are an additional cost on public sector pay which, in truth, was not included in the Minister&rsquo;s budget day figures.  In his budget day announcement, the Minister said he had &euro;300 million allocated for the Lansdowne Road agreement.  How complete is that figure relating to the increase in pay and other agreements concluded around that agreement?</p></speech>

There is one Lansdowne Road agreement.  It is the document the Deputy has in front of him, a document promulgated by the then Labour Relations Commission, now the Workplace Relations Commission.  It is its document that it presented to both sides who have formally endorsed and agreed it.</p><p>This is not fanciful but, over days, when one has all the key trade union officials and the sectoral negotiators, such as health, local government, as well as departmental, in the same building, they are often waiting around because of bilateral discussions between one sector or another.  Of course, they will then avail of the opportunity to have side-chats and discussions.  What has happened in a few of those is what is known as a chairman&rsquo;s note.  In other words, after discussions between the sectoral trade union and the employer, they will tell the chairman they have an agreement on a matter and would he note it.  It has nothing to do with the agreement formally but, <i>en passant</i>, it would be given, if one likes, the <i>imprimatur</i>of the Labour Relations Commission.  However, I do not see them.  They are negotiations done bilaterally.  Sometimes, they are brought to my attention because there might be cost implications but other times there might be no cost implications.</p><p>Sometimes long-standing issues are put into a new negotiating formula, for example, to be brought forward into the future.  To answer the Deputy's net question, the Lansdowne Road agreement is the document signed off on, and promulgated by, the Labour Relations Commission and presented to both sides as their agreement, as their recommendation.</p></speech>

They would see it as the power to withhold things they understood they would get under the Haddington Road agreement.  The example given is of teachers who received an annual payment of &euro;1,592 for supervision and substitution that was withdrawn under the Haddington Road agreement with the understanding that it would be reinstated after three years.  This Bill now gives the Minister the power not to give it back to them unless they sign up to one of the sectoral agreements.  How would the Minister respond to that?</p></speech>

When I started teaching, there was no such allowance for supervision.  It was part of normal duties but was subsequently introduced as an allowance.  There was much controversy surrounding the complete review of allowances conducted by both my own Department and by the Committee of Public Accounts.  It was determined that we should suspend theses allowances for the duration of this crisis and over time fold them back into core pay.  That is what I hope will be done but obviously, it is contingent upon the totality of the agreement being agreed by everybody, because one cannot pick and choose bits of it.  We have had that discussion for the last hour or two hours.</p></speech>
