    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.5" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016110300002#B00100"><p>Apologies have been received from Deputies Barrett and Grealish.  At today's meeting, we will discuss with members of the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, the union's campaign to highlight the threat to media freedom in Turkey and the work of the International Federation of Journalists, IFJ, in tackling global abuse of media freedom.  I welcome the following: Mr. Gerry Carson, who is the cathaoirleach of the NUJ's Irish executive council; Mr. Barry White of the UK division of the NUJ; and Mr. Ronan Brady, who is an Irish delegate to the IFJ.  The format of the meeting is that we will hear an opening statement from the witnesses before we go into a question-and-answer session with the members of the committee.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference, even in silent mode, with the recording and broadcast equipment in this room.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I ask Mr. Carson to make his opening remarks.  I understand that Mr. White and Mr. Brady will make brief contributions at this point as well.</p></speech>

I chair the Belfast and district branch of the NUJ.  I thank the committee for the invitation, which relates primarily to the violation of media freedom in Turkey.  Worldwide, journalists face dangers each day merely for doing their jobs.  Sadly, the killers of journalists are getting away with murder throughout the world.  The global impunity index, which is published by the Committee to Protect Journalists, which is a not-for-profit organisation based in New York, documents the top countries where the killers of journalists go unpunished and cases of journalists being killed remain unsolved.  Somalia, Iraq and Syria are at the top of the list, which highlights countries where journalists are murdered and their killers go free.  Extremist organisations like the Islamic State group and Al-Shabaab have repeatedly targeted journalists for murder.  Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria and Pakistan also feature on the index.  Our focus today is on Turkey.<br/><br/>The NUJ is gravely concerned about the actions of the Turkish Government in restricting freedom of the press.  There can be no justification for the sustained and systematic attack on journalists and media organisations.  Democracy cannot be protected by attacking the very values one is supposed to be protecting.  On 24 August last, the NUJ in Ireland made a presentation to the Turkish <i>charge d'affaires</i>here in Dublin.  We were received with courtesy, but we were disturbed by the strong insistence that national security considerations provide justification for the ongoing repression of human rights.  On 15 July last, we wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan.  We were disappointed by the apparent lack of urgency in addressing our concerns, although we did receive a reply from the Minister on 10 October.  The Minister raised the issue of threats to media freedom at a meeting of foreign affairs Ministers of the Council of Europe on 7 September.  That meeting was attended by the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We welcome that intervention.<br/><br/>The NUJ has been working with the IFJ to monitor this situation.  We have received detailed reports from our four sister unions in Turkey.  My NUJ colleague from the UK, Mr. Barry White, and Mr. Ronan Brady, who is a member of the Irish executive council and a delegate to the IFJ's World Congress, are in attendance to give the committee an informed overview of the situation in Turkey.  I invite Mr. White, who has served on the steering committee of the European Federation of Journalists, EFJ, to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.7" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Barry White" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016110300002#B00300"><p>I first visited Turkey in 2002 as part of a mission from the IFJ and the EFJ to that country.  The purpose of the mission was to examine the professional conditions, including limitations to press freedom, and social conditions of journalists in Turkey.  This led to further discussions with our affiliate in Turkey, which at that time was the Journalist&rsquo;s Union of Turkey, known as the TGS.  This eventually led to the establishment in 2010 of the Setting Journalism Free in Turkey project.  Since that time, I have visited Turkey on 11 occasions as an observer for the IFJ and the EFJ at a number of trials of journalists and in support of the development of trade union organisation in the media sector.</p> <p>  On 15 and 16 July last, Turkey experienced a bloody coup attempt which killed more than 250 people and targeted democratic institutions like the Grand National Assembly of Turkey, which is the Parliament in Ankara.  The coup attempt was unreservedly condemned by the IFJ and the EFJ.  Mustafa Cambaz, who was a photojournalist with a Turkish daily newspaper, was killed during the failed coup.  According to his newspaper, he died of a gunshot to the head when soldiers opened fire on crowds in a neighbourhood of Istanbul in the early hours of Saturday, 16 July.  The coup attempt was followed by a state of emergency and, in our view, excessive and indiscriminate measures to purge all individuals believed to be connected to it.</p> <p>  The Turkish authorities have been and are continuing to arrest and jail journalists, shut down radio and TV channels and censor the Internet in an attempt to silence criticism.  According to the IFJ, as of 21 October last, a total of 90 journalists were in jail and more than 130 media outlets had been banned since the failed coup.  Approximately 2,500 journalists have lost their jobs and arrest warrants have been issued for dozens of journalists and media workers.  Some families of journalists who are in hiding or have fled the country have been arrested in an attempt to force them to return and give themselves up to the authorities.  In response, media workers, journalists and press freedom campaigners throughout the world have joined protests calling for the release of jailed journalists in Turkey.  Our slogan is "press freedom is essential for democracy".  We demand that Turkey sets the journalists free because journalism is not a crime.</p> <p>  The EFJ and the IFJ have been monitoring the situation regarding detained and arrested journalists and press freedom violations since 15 July.  We are continuing to work with the Council of Europe platform to promote the protection of journalism and safety of journalists.  As part of our campaign, we have provided support to our affiliates in Turkey who are fighting to maintain their rights and freedoms every day.  We have assisted with solidarity missions, provided financial support for those facing poverty or oppression and have sent observers to trials.  The briefing material we have furnished to the committee contains a reference to a page on the IFJ website which provides further details in this regard.</p><p>We continue to lobby national and international institutions to demand the release of all journalists and the re-opening of media.  IFJ-affiliated unions have lobbied Turkish embassies in their countries and raised the issue with government Ministers.  Such visits have taken place in Dublin and London this summer, organised by the National Union of Journalists, where issues of serious concern were raised.  More activities are being planned, some together with like-minded organisations including the European Trade Union Confederation, Reporters without Borders, Index on Censorship, the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom, the Committee to Protect Journalists and others.</p><p> The IFJ and all its affiliated members remain committed to delivering professional and trade union solidarity to all journalists.  Mr. Ronan Brady will outline to the committee the organisation's wider work in highlighting and countering threats to media freedom worldwide.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Brady" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016110300002#C00200"><p>I join my colleagues in thanking members of the joint committee for the concern they have shown regarding this issue.  It is very dear to us and we are grateful for their interest.<br/><br/>There have been suggestions by those connected with the Turkish Government that the International Federation of Journalists is picking unfairly on Turkey.  The IFJ approach to Turkey, supported by the National Union of Journalists, of which we are a part, is consistent with our approach to global attacks on media freedom.  In the past week, the IFJ raised similar issues to those we have raised with Ankara.  For example, our organisation protested against the nakedly repressive media policies of the Orb&aacute;n government in Hungary, involving the closure of an opposition newspaper, and protested against a foreign travel ban imposed by the Malaysian Government on Zulkiflee Anwar Ulhaque, a notable political cartoonist to whom I apologise for mispronouncing his name.  The organisation also presented our proposed declaration on media freedom in the Arab world to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Zeid Ra&rsquo;ad al-Hussein.  This was in defence of the principles infringed by governments such as that of President <font color="#2F2F2F">Erdo</font><font color="#2F2F2F">an</font>.  This is part of the wider work of the organisation.  Last week also saw our Brussels office defending public broadcasting in Romania, trade union rights in Tunisia and fighting for journalists on many other fronts.<br/><br/>The IFJ mission statement includes the following principles:</p><blockquote>The IFJ promotes international action to defend press freedom and social justice through strong, free and independent trade unions of journalists.  The IFJ does not subscribe to any given political viewpoint, but promotes human rights, democracy and pluralism.  The IFJ is opposed to discrimination of all kinds and condemns the use of media as propaganda or to promote intolerance and conflict.  The IFJ believes in freedom of political and cultural expression and defends trade union and other basic human rights.</blockquote> <p>The IFJ does not have anything against Turkey.  On the contrary, we have the greatest possible admiration for Turkish culture, in particular, Turkish journalism.  We are here in solidarity with the Turkish people, as well as Turkish journalists. </p></speech>

I ask members to bear that in mind in order that we can have some interaction.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1228" speakername="Darragh O'Brien" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016110300002#C00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their attendance.  I was gravely concerned by the correspondence the joint committee received from the National Union of Journalists.  We invited journalists before the committee to find out what we can do to address this issue.  Members are fully aware of the circumstances prevailing in Turkey.  The Turkish Government has closed 16 television stations, 23 radio stations, 45 newspapers, 15 journals, 29 publishing houses etc.  Has the Government issued a statement on the restriction of press freedoms in Turkey?</p><p>I note the International Federation of Journalists wrote to the Minister on the issue on 15 July last and I am a little perplexed that a response did not issue until 10 October.  The delay does not indicate the matter was given the priority it is due.  If something is being done now, that is fine but other than raising the issue at a meeting of Council of Europe foreign affairs Ministers, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade did recently, has the Government issued a specific statement regarding the journalists who remain in detention in Turkey and the closure of newspapers and television and radio stations? </p><p>It has been reported that President <font color="#2F2F2F">Erdo</font><font color="#2F2F2F">an</font>is seeking the reintroduction of the death penalty in Turkey.  The possibility has been mooted, including by the president.  I agree with the view that the coup was an attack on democracy in Turkey.  We roundly condemned it and the International Federation of Journalists has taken a clear position on it.  In many respects, it is being used as a reason or vehicle for strengthening the Turkish Government and President <font color="#2F2F2F">Erdo</font><font color="#2F2F2F">an</font>'s position through the introduction of new laws, including the reinstatement of the death penalty.  </p><p>How are the journalists who are in detention being treated?  Do they have access to family members and legal teams?  I am gravely concerned by a report that one journalist has reported being tortured for three days in prison. </p><p>What action can the joint committee take on this issue?  What does the IFJ want us to do to ensure this issue remains on the agenda at the highest level?  Press freedom is paramount in all democracies and any attack on it needs to be condemned at every opportunity.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1402" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016110300002#C00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for their comprehensive presentation.  I agree with Deputy Darragh O'Brien that all members unreservedly condemn the appalling incursions on press freedom we have seen in Turkey since the failed coup.  We also join the witnesses in condemning the coup.  It is clear, however, that the response has been disproportionate.  If one examines the list of media outlets that have been banned, it becomes clear that there has been an attempt, as one journalist put it, to eviscerate the Kurdish minority in particular and any media outlets connected with it.  I understand the media outlets closed include a children's channel.  It is also appalling to note that 2,500 journalists have lost their jobs, others remain in detention and basic due process rights such as lawyer-client privilege are being encroached.  I am also deeply concerned by the allegations of torture.</p><p>On practical steps that can be taken, the European Parliament passed a resolution on 25 October.  Is the International Federation of Journalists asking the joint committee to seek to have similar motions passed by the Oireachtas?  I note the European Parliament resolution calls on member states to continue to monitor the practical implications of the Turkish state of emergency to ensure trials of journalists are monitored and instructed the President of the European Parliament to put forward the resolution to the Council, the European Commission and so forth.  I note also that it calls on the European Union, through Commissioner Mogherini and Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, to engage directly in talks with Ankara about the position as regards the rule of law in Turkey.  Should we also call for these steps to be taken?  Clearly, the Government must express Ireland's strong concerns about this matter.  On a related question, what can be done specifically with regard to the protection of the rights of the Kurdish minority, which appears to have been specifically targeted in the Turkish Government's crackdown?</p><p>I have also read the Turkish Government's response to the European Parliament's motion.  Reports published on 1 November indicate the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr. Binaldi Yildirim, told members of the ruling AK party in a parliamentary speech that he did not care about the EU's red line and his government had drawn a red line on top of it.  This does not show much respect for the actions of the European Parliament or the rule of law in Turkey, which is a grave concern.  Clearly, the actions of the European Parliament have not yet had any effect.  What can the joint committee do to put pressure on the Government to ensure some protection for journalists who are still in detention in Turkey and facing appalling treatment, including online abuse?  <i>The Guardian</i>reported this week, for example, that women journalists and others in Turkey have been subject to orchestrated online abuse. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1309" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016110300002#C00600"><p>Is it the case that all those present at this meeting probably would be arrested if this discussion were taking place in Turkey?</p><p>It is a candidate country for EU accession.  We are discussing the arrest and treatment of journalists in Turkey and that is a reflection of what is happening in society there.  Following the coup, the Turkish Government has been able to put forward excuses for what has been happening.  Approximately 32,000 people have been arrested, 1,500 people are still in police custody and 70,000 to 110,000 people have been dismissed from their jobs.  Recently, the government decreed that 10,000 civil servants be dismissed from their jobs.  Two elected mayors were arrested last week in the city of Diyarbakir, the Kurdish capital.  Twenty-two elected mayors are currently in prison in Turkey and 33 more have been removed.  That gives us a sense of what is happening in society there.  Sixty party members of the Kurdish leftist pro-opposition HDP have been arrested and members of its sister party have also been arrested.  The excuse given for those arrests was the attempted coup.<br/><br/>Am I right in saying that many of the people who have been arrested, including many of the journalists, are people who spoke out against the coup?  There is a view that this is all about President Erdogan going for a one-party state and wiping out all the opposition.  That seems to be pattern.  Would the witness agree that, following the coup, the government is trying to achieve a long-term goal of quelling and silencing any independent or critical voices in the country?<br/><br/>The <i>Cumhuriyet</i>newspaper, which was the last remaining source of independent news and information, was the latest one to be closed on 31 October.  It was a very liberal newspaper and was nothing similar to the politics of Mr. Gulen and his boss, Alaattin &Ccedil;akc.  It was the newspaper that published news of the Turkish Government supplying arms and ammunition training to Islamic jihadists in Syria.  Another pro-Kurdish newspaper, the <i>&Ouml;zg&uuml;r G&uuml;ndem</i>daily newspaper, which had been in operation for 25 years, has been forced to closed.  Journalists who protested against that were arrested.<br/><br/>The witnesses mentioned a number of points in their statement that they would request the Turkish Government to do.  Are they seeking that we would support those points, perhaps as a part of a motion we could put forward?  How do they believe we can best help those journalists and media organisations battling against the autocratic censorship in Turkey?  Social media was mentioned, the so-called citizen journalists and others who use the Internet.  Is the International Federation on Journalists also focusing its campaign on the government's crackdown on these areas of free speech? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1375" speakername="Gabrielle McFadden" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016110300002#D00200"><p>The witnesses are very welcome.  I thank them for taking the time to come into us this morning.  I do not ever repeat what other people have said and some of what I wanted to say has already been said, so I will not go back over it.  As was said, Turkey is a candidate country for EU accession.  Even before the coup, there were quite worrying trends regarding the suppression of freedom of expression and democracy there.  Mr. White said that 90 journalists were in jail and that some of their families were in hiding or had fled the country in fear of being arrested and there have been attempts to bring them back.  Do we know where these people are and the circumstances in which they are living, or if they have already been arrested, in what circumstances are they living?  Are all the journalists Turkish or are there other nationalities involved?  What is the atmosphere on the ground in Turkey?  As lay people, we all know Turkey from a tourism point of view, and tourism is a huge contributor to its economy.  Has it been grossly affected?  What do the witnesses know about that?  As was asked, will the witnesses name things that we, as a committee and a country, could physically do to help those journalists?  I would be interested to hear their opinions on those points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016110300002#D00300"><p>What we are hearing about this clampdown, not only on journalists but also on the judiciary and people involved in education, is very disturbing.  I had tabled an oral parliamentary question on this matter to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, on the previous occasion he took questions, which was about a week ago.  In terms of children being back at school, there are about 40,000 to 50,000 teachers who are not back in their jobs, and that will have a massive impact.  The Minister outlined what he had been doing, but this is showing a disregard on the part of Turkey for the EU, and yet it is a Union of which it wants to be member.  I brought up the case of Ahmet Altan and his brother which was very disturbing.  Ahmet was accused by the prosecution of sending subliminal or subconscious messages in a television programme. That gives us an idea of the extent of what is happening there.</p> <p>  The witnesses mentioned the lobbying of embassies.  Has that led to any significant movements?  Again, there is the matter of what we can do, which has been addressed.  I note that the witnesses' organisation is involved with other countries.  I would mention Azerbaijan as one in particular where there also seems to be a severe clampdown on the media and community activists.  I have been following the case of a photojournalist who is in jail in Cairo, as part of everything that was happening there over a year ago.  He is a photojournalist and has no political affiliations whatsoever.  He is known as Shawkan.  I have taken up his case with the Egyptian ambassador, but again there is a total disregard for answering questions about people who have ended up in jail.  I do not know if the witnesses' organisation has been involved with him, but I take this opportunity to raise his case, even though the witnesses are here to discuss what is happening in Turkey.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016110300002#D00400"><p>Will Mr. Carson and his colleagues now respond to the various points that have been made?</p></speech>

It is fair to say that democracy no longer exists in Turkey.  Despite this, on the Turkish Embassy's website in Dublin there is a great play on the commitment of the country to human rights and to democracy.  Quite clearly, that is an inaccurate description of what Turkey is just now.  I will ask my colleague, Mr. Barry White, to comment on the current situation there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.19" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Barry White" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2016110300002#D00600"><p>I will try to answer some of the questions the members raised, which are very good and very pertinent to what we are talking about.  First, I will address what the committee can do, and this is very important for all of us.  This is part of a process of raising awareness here today, which is very valuable.  One of the problems is that people do not know what is going on, which is quite ironic since journalists are not writing about journalists, but then journalists do not control the publications for which they work.  Other people make decisions on what is and what is not news.  Getting the information out is incredibly important, and this is a very valuable way of doing it.</p> <p>  Also, it is important to challenge the Turkish authorities both in Britain, which we did when we visited the ambassador there who was very polite and listened to what we had to say, and in Ireland where the same has been done.  We have to keep putting the facts before the Turkish authorities in our countries.  Turkey is a candidate country for EU accession and it is, or was, a signatory to human rights conventions.  My colleague, Mr. Gerry Carson, said something about the future of democracy there.  I would say that democracy is a very long journey and Turkey have taken a very bad turning right off the road.  Raising awareness through the mechanisms the members of the committee have here is very important.  They might like to consider inviting the Turkish ambassador to come here and discuss their concerns about media freedom and the right of expression in Turkey or they may wish to go to see him.  They may wish to initiate a debate in the Parliament.  They may wish to ask the appropriate Minister to raise these issues with the Turkish ambassador and directly with the Turkish Government, and through Europe.</p><p>As a colleague mentioned, a motion was passed by the European Parliament a few days ago and what it said, apart from highlighting the numbers, is that journalists should not be detained on the basis of the content of their journalism or alleged affiliations and that the Turkish authorities should release those journalists and media workers being held without compelling evidence of criminal activity following the coup attempt of 15 July.  Within that, there are obviously journalists who are being held, some in solitary confinement, others of whom are having difficulty getting access to lawyers.  To be honest, some lawyers are quite scared of taking up the cases because of their own futures.  There has been a purge in the Judiciary, as well as other sectors of society, so one can see the background music is not good.  I do not have the sort of details the committee would perhaps like about individuals, except to say that when individuals are held in solitary confinement it is very difficult for them to get information out and one has to rely on their families to tell one what is going on.  There is a whole set of problems there but raising awareness is a crucial thing to do.</p><p> As far as the treatment of journalists goes &ndash; we will just talk about it very briefly &ndash; there are a number of journalists from Turkey who are now in exile in Britain simply because their passports have been revoked or they have been told if they come back they will be arrested and their publications have been shut down or taken over by the state.  They are now in a sort of limbo land where they will probably be applying for political asylum in Britain because they cannot go back and if they do, they face arrest.  There is a whole series of problems there.  A number of media outlets in Turkey had stations in Britain that were closed when the outlets were closed.  Those involved are really worried about their future and if they have families back in Turkey, they are worried about that.</p><p> The Kurdish situation has already been touched on in the sense that we do not get involved in politics, as such.  We do not have a solution for the Kurdish problem and we do not offer one.  What we offer is solidarity with journalists who are facing oppression.  We know the situation in the south east of Turkey and we know the difficulty of getting information out and the treatment of people there and the treatment of journalists.  Obviously the NUJ and the IFJ stand for peace and that is what we want to see but the mechanics of that are not for us to discuss; what we are discussing is solidarity with journalists regardless of whether they are Kurdish or Turkish.</p><p> Most of the people who operate social media are not involved in trade unions so we get anecdotal evidence about the way they are shut down.  Of course it is part of the diversity of voice which we are seeking to protect with our colleagues in Turkey and therefore any attack on social media is an attack on the freedom of expression and the right of one&rsquo;s views to be put out.</p><p> I will call it a day for the moment, except to say perhaps two other things.  First, when I knew this session would be slightly shorter than we anticipated, I produced an updated list of closures for the committee members to read at their leisure.  If there is time I could also read a report of what happened when a television station in Istanbul, to which I gave an interview when I was there on 21 and 22 October, was raided and closed down.  I refer to what happened, what happened to the staff, what happened to the equipment and how it was all done.  We will see if time permits that but behind all of the figures are people, as well as the arguments about freedom of expression, the right for people to know and the dangers to democracy.  There are people and families involved and we are concerned for them as well, but in the end we offer solidarity.  We cannot do it for anyone, we just are there to offer solidarity.</p></speech>

I wish to stress the link because I know how it is being played out in Turkey when criticism comes from abroad.  It is being presented as some kind of infringement of Turkish independence and integrity.  We are both - Turks and Irish people - signatories to the European Convention on Human Rights, and that means we are co-guarantors of that and that we have a right to criticise failures of human rights in Turkey, just as the Turks have the right to criticise us.  They may well have genuine criticisms to make about this country.  What I wish to stress, and it has been specifically raised by Deputy Crowe, is the newspaper <i>Cumhuriyet</i>, which is being accused of being in support of Cemaat, the G&uuml;lenist organisation, and of being involved in the coup in so far as it is, and also of being in support of the PKK &ndash; the Kurdish guerrilla army.  If I could translate that into an Irish context, it is a bit like accusing <i>The Irish Times</i>of being responsible for what happened in the North, in that by quoting the IRA it was said to be responsible for it.  It is a bit like putting <i>The Irish Times</i>in jail because it has infringed justice by trying to quote from an illegal political party.  It is quite absurd.  This is one of the most respected newspapers in Turkey and it is being accused of involvement for merely doing what journalists should do.<br/><br/>The Government and the Members of the D&aacute;il should do the utmost they can to raise this through international institutions such as the European Union.  We also appeal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, to read carefully what we have said and to put the maximum amount of pressure on our friends and colleagues in Turkey so as to protect the journalists.</p></speech>

The government should release all imprisoned journalists held on the basis of journalistic activities, even when they support ideas the government finds offensive and halt the criminal prosecution of journalists in connection with their reporting and commentary.</p> <p>  We want the Turkish Government to halt the use of the anti-terror laws against journalists, in particular when authorities conflate the expression of political views the government finds offensive with outright terrorism.  Such a practice contravenes Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  We want to see an end to the practice of jailing journalists for prolonged periods as they await trial or a court verdict.</p> <p>  We have documented dozens of cases in which journalists have been held for many months or even years without having been convicted of a crime.  Fundamentally and comprehensively, we want a reform of all laws used routinely against the press, including provisions in the penal code and anti-terror law that criminalise news gathering and publication of critical or opposing views.</p></speech>

The Trades Union Congress in Britain made a written submission covering many of the points that people have raised because this purge is far wider than just journalists but it includes them.  It did so as the committee welcomed written submissions which addressed in particular the status in Turkey of the rights and values supported by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, including freedom of speech and assembly, minority rights and the status of democracy.  One can see there has been work taking place in Britain.</p><p>We know a number of our affiliates in continental Europe have also visited Turkish embassies to make the points that have been made both in Dublin and London.  There are four or five of them and the details are on the International Federation of Journalists website.  I do not have the information with me now.  It is certainly an international campaign to put pressure on the Turkish authorities because that is what our affiliates in Turkey want us to do.  We are not doing this on our own.  We are doing it because we have been asked to do it by them.  That is what solidarity means, as we all know, and they feel alone.  It is only when they see this sort of action being taken internationally and across Europe that they gain confidence and realise they are not alone.  One of the most valuable lessons I have learned going there is to show they are not alone.  We are only fighting for the values that we cherish in our countries and that they are fighting to maintain.</p></speech>

We could also ask the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, if he would raise at the EU Foreign Affairs Council the particular concerns about human rights issues for journalists and others in Turkey.  There will be 28 Foreign Ministers at that EU Council table, and if the Minister is agreeable to the proposal and it has not already been discussed there, it would be a very important forum for it to be discussed at.</p></speech>

I sought to find out what was going on.  I have observed the <i>odatv.com</i>trial since 2012 and it is still ongoing.  When I was in the court I noticed there was a new judge and prosecution counsel and the judge said the previous two had either fled or were in prison.  That is the state of things now.  They are tumultuous.  I have been to the courts and spoken to journalists, as well as some of the defence counsels.  I have offered solidarity and support and taken back messages.  My union adopted a journalist involved with the <i>odatv.com</i>trial all those years ago and we are still awaiting justice.<br/><br/>The important work is done on the ground with our affiliates in Turkey who visit their members and other journalists who are in prison, or else they raise awareness with the authorities about people in isolation.  The real work is done by journalists supporting other journalists.</p></speech>

I am still not clear on where the Irish Government is on this.  I asked a question of whether there has been an official statement or if our Minister has relayed the concerns directly to the Turkish Embassy.  I understand there is a European option and the Chairman made a very good proposal, which we will accept.  We can raise matters in the D&aacute;il and Seanad directly with the Minister and as individual members we can do that outside the committee.  As foreign affairs spokesperson for my party I will do that.  Do the witnesses know what has been done?

Does the Senator wish to make a statement?</p></speech>

It makes no reference to Ireland's position of neutrality.  I got a reply from the Department before I thought of putting down a motion and I wanted to see its view on it.  The reply makes absolutely no sense and it does not give a reason for neutrality not being mentioned.  For the record, it states:</p><blockquote>I wish to acknowledge receipt of your submission on our forthcoming statement of strategy.  As you know, the statement of strategy is not solely a policy document but an articulation of how we intend to implement our Programme for Partnership Government commitments.  The Global Island, which influences the statement of strategy and is referenced as a key guide, does of course have a reference to the relevant legislation.</blockquote> <p>Sir Humphrey would be agog.  That is straight out of the top drawer when it comes to a reply on why neutrality is not mentioned in our entire statement of strategy.  I am asking for the support of members for the line to be included that it is a strong core value of the State and the Irish people.</p></speech>

At issue is a statement of strategy, and a core part of the Irish position has been a clear statement of the country's neutrality.  I realise this came up during the defence part of the meeting earlier but it is important that it is restated.  I do not understand why the word is not even included in the strategy statement.  It makes no sense for it not to be included, and the committee could have a role in proposing that it be included.  The suggestion Senator Daly has put forward is entirely reasonable and it will leave no doubt around the issue.</p></speech>

The Green Paper on Defence wrongly states that Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality has its origins in the country's declared neutrality during the Second World War.  Many of us from a republican tradition argue that the Irish impulse to neutrality far predates that.  We maintain it goes back to the time of Wolfe Tone.  He produced a pamphlet on Britain and Spain in 1790.  Our neutrality has been very much part of that tradition.</p> <p>  My party is rather critical of the response of the State in respect of neutrality issues.  We should recommend forcefully to the Department that it should include this reference.  There has been an attempt in recent years to try to undermine Irish neutrality.  Clearly, the fact that it has been left out of a policy statement from the Department sends a signal that this is not central to the policy of the State.  I agree wholeheartedly with the proposal.</p></speech>

I am looking at the strategy to see where it could best be inserted.  That is a consideration.  Obviously, it is a matter for the Department of Defence.  There is a reference under the values part of the strategy to a secure world and a stable and secure rules-based international environment.  Specific reference is made to cross-departmental work, defence and the Defence Forces.  Perhaps it is not for us to say where the reference should be placed in the document, but that seems to me to be a sensible place to include it.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016110300002#A00300"><p>In commending the motion to the select committee, I will briefly outline the function of the European Defence Agency, EDA, and the background to the programmes in which Ireland wishes to participate.  The EDA was established by a joint action of the Council of the European Union in 2004, &quot;to support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future&quot;.  On 6 July 2004, the Government approved Ireland's participation in the framework of the European Defence Agency on the basis of a memorandum submitted by the Minister for Defence, in association with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</p><p>The EDA is an agency of the European Union.  The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the Commission, Federica Mogherini, is head of the agency.  Federica Mogherini is also chairman of the EDA steering board, its decision-making body, which is composed of defence Ministers of the 27 participating member states, that is, all EU member states except Denmark, which has an opt-out on defence matters under Protocol 5 to the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the European Commission.</p><p>Ireland participates in the framework of the agency and contributes in the region of &euro;311,000 to the annual costs of running the agency including its annual work programme.  Outside of the annual general work programme, the agency also supports a range of other work programmes and projects funded on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis by the member states in various compositions.  In some instances, all member states will participate in these projects and programmes unless they specifically decide to opt out.  These are referred to as Category A projects or programmes.  In other cases, a small number of member states will group together to pursue a particular initiative.  These are referred to as Category B projects or programmes.</p><p>The EDA is focused on assisting member states in capability development, obtaining better value for existing spending levels, improving competitiveness and securing greater efficiency particularly in the areas of research, technology, manufacturing and procurement, which have been notable for fragmentation and duplication.  The Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 regulates Ireland's participation in EDA <i>ad hoc </i>projects.  It prescribes that participation in Category A or B projects or programmes is subject to Government and D&aacute;il approval.  The primary reason for Ireland's participation in the EDA is to support the development of Defence Forces capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management.</p><p>I will give a brief outline of Ireland's involvement to date in EDA projects and programmes, following Government and D&aacute;il approval.  Ireland participated in a Category A programme on force protection, which is now completed.  This involved measures to protect military forces engaged in operational activities.  This is a key issue for the Defence Forces engaged in peace support and crisis management operations overseas.  We participated in another Category A programme, which is also completed, on chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear protection.  This is a key capability area for the Defence Forces.  Participation in this programme and access to the results of the research, studies and development work packages undertaken by the programme enables the Defence Forces to remain at the leading edge of capability development in this key area.</p><p>Ireland is participating in a Category B project on counter-improvised explosives devices manual neutralisation techniques, which was set up to address counter-improvised explosives devices manual neutralisation techniques training, which has been identified as a crucial skill and capability to be developed.  Manual neutralisation techniques are used for explosive ordnance disposal and improvised explosive device, IED, disposal.  Operators, on occasions, cannot use remote or semi-remote techniques to render an IED safe, and these complex explosive devices have to be neutralised manually.  For example, manual neutralisation techniques are used where there is an immediate threat to the life of hostages who have an IED attached to them.  The project began in 2014 and will run for four years.</p><p>Ireland has participated in another Category B project, which is now completed, on maritime surveillance.  This programme further developed the recognised maritime picture exchange network technology that allows for the sharing of information among the wider EU defence community in support of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy and the EU Commission's initiative to establish a common information-sharing environment.</p><p>The proposal I am putting to the committee is to seek approval for Ireland to participate in two EDA projects, one in the area of maritime surveillance and one in the area of cyber ranges.  MARSUR Networking &ndash; Adaptive Maintenance, known as MARSUR II, is a Category B project, and is a follow-on to the Category B project on maritime surveillance networking, which I mentioned, which ended in October 2015.  The objective of that project was to develop an automated information-sharing environment through the development of software technologies and the formation of a network to enhance information sharing within the maritime surveillance community.</p><p>This web-based system is now operational and information on the positions of ships, fishery protection and maritime safety and security is exchanged in a number of electronic forms between member states participating in the project.  While the national operational system in Ireland is located in the naval base, with the user interface located in the naval operations centre, the system can be accessed from a remote location, including when ships are deployed.  This is proving particularly useful for the Naval Service which is carrying out humanitarian operations in the Mediterranean.  Classified information on the location of other craft in the area, as well as the locations of migrants who need to be rescued, is being exchanged with the Italian authorities.  The original 13 member states, including Ireland, contributed &euro;80,000 each to develop the system.</p><p> The main objective of the follow-on Category B project is life cycle support of the existing maritime surveillance capability through the provision of adaptive maintenance, system upgrades and enhancements and technical support.  The project is necessary to ensure Ireland gets the full value of the initial project.  It will ensure the system is maintained, kept up to date and adapted to meet the outgoing needs of the Naval Service.  In order to maintain and increase our capability in this area, it is important that Ireland participate in the follow-on project.  It will also improve the Defence Forces' inter-operability and operational effectiveness.</p><p> I will now give the committee some detail on the second EDA project - co-operation on cyber ranges in the European Union.  The EDA Category B project aims to maintain and improve cyber resilience, as well as the levels of awareness, insight and expertise of member states' personnel.  Cyber attacks pose a potential threat to the communications and command and control systems of the Defence Forces, both at home and overseas.  The need to be able to defend Defence Forces' systems against cyber attacks has been identified as a specific capability requirement by the Defence Forces.  Cyber ranges are a virtual environment used for cyber training, exercises and technology testing and evaluation.  They also provide the means to help to strengthen knowledge of cyber defence operators and the performance of the computer information systems.  They provide tools that help to strengthen the stability, security and performance of cyber infrastructure and IT systems used by the military.  They can be remotely accessed in one country by personnel from another location or country.  Remote access to cyber ranges and joint development of exercises and training events allow participants to benefit from better quality events and increase cost efficiency.</p><p> The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has the lead role in the whole-of-government response to the cyber threat.  In 2015 it published Ireland&rsquo;s national cyber security strategy.  This document is a high level policy statement from the Government acknowledging the challenges in facilitating and enabling the digital economy and society.  The Defence Forces and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na provide inputs from the security perspective to this work.  The Government task force on emergency planning which I chair maintains cyber security as a standing agenda item.  Two members of the Defence Forces are seconded to the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment&rsquo;s computer security incident response team.  In any emergency or crisis, once defence systems are supported, the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces will provide support for this team in so far as resources allow.  Details in this regard are being developed in a service level agreement to be agreed between the Department of Defence and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Participation in the training and exercises available through the EDA Category B project will enhance the capacity within the Defence Forces to secure, protect and defend their own systems against cyber attack and also to contribute to enhanced capacity within the incident response team.</p><p> The total budget for the new maritime surveillance Category B project is &euro;675,000.  The cost of Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the project is &euro;15,000, per annum and &euro;45,000 over the life of the project.  With regard to the second project, cyber ranges, there will be no financial contribution to the project.  Member states will contribute to it in kind, that is, through participating and exchanging information and knowledge of cyber range training and exercises.  For Ireland, the maximum resource commitment is 100 man days for the life of the project.</p><p> I reiterate the benefits of our participation in both programmes.  The success of the original maritime surveillance project hinges on the positive continuation of the follow-on project, MARSUR II.  Without technical support, the services will degrade over time and ultimately become unserviceable.  In order to maintain these benefits and further increase our capability in this area, it is extremely important that Ireland participate in the project.  The cyber ranges project is an ideal opportunity for the Defence Forces to gain access to cyber ranges and enhance and protect the capability they already possess.  They will be given an opportunity to gain access to best practice and standards in an extremely cost efficient manner.  Our contribution to the project will be through participation and the exchange of information.  Cyber defence is a key capability for the Defence Forces and their participation in the project will strengthen that capability.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the EDA affords us the opportunity to keep abreast of best practice and new developments in the defence environment, particularly as it impacts on multinational crisis management operations.  By participating in EDA projects the Defence Forces gain access to the most up-to-date technologies and can develop the capabilities and skills required to fulfil their role, including in peacekeeping and humanitarian operations, at reduced cost.  The Government&rsquo;s White Paper on Defence, published in August 2015, states Ireland will identify opportunities to participate "in multi-national capability development projects within the framework of the EDA in support of the Defence Forces&rsquo; operations, capacity and capability".  The two projects being discussed are prime examples of how the Defence Forces can develop their capabilities in maritime surveillance and cyber defence.  I commend the motion to the committee.</p></speech>

We can connect with other members states, pool our resources and benefit from economies of scale in training provision and having access to knowledge and resources.  That can only be good.  As has been said by many Deputies, our participation in these training programmes and projects ensures our personnel and soldiers receive the most up-to-date training and gain expertise in order that when they are operating overseas, they can do so safely and come home safely because they will know what they are doing.  Our participation in projects such as this ensures we have access to the most up-to-date technology and expertise worldwide, which is good.</p><p>The annual cost of &euro;311,000 represents huge value for money and money well spent.  Our spend on defence as a proportion of GDP is one of the lowest in the European Union.  Over time, as more resources become available to us, we should seek to increase our spend, given the many threats we face, both at home and internationally.  Certainly, I am very happy that there is co-operation with other member states at European level.  The reason we participate is that the Defence Forces carry out many peacekeeping missions abroad.  Just because they are peacekeeping missions does not mean that there is no danger involved for our troops.  When they participate in peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions, they are sometimes under threat and fire; it is vital, therefore, that they have access to be the best training we can provide for them.</p><p>I am very happy that we have participated in a programme on chemical, biological and nuclear protection.  Unfortunately, this is the direction warfare is taking and it is becoming more sophisticated.  Things previously unseen are coming down the tracks in terms of the capabilities of other armies.  It is incumbent on the State, therefore, to ensure it is up to speed and has the most up-to-date knowledge available by sharing knowledge with other member states.  Where we can do some things very well, other states might do them slightly better and <i>vice versa</i>.  In pooling knowledge we ensure this expertise is shared.</p><p>On countering improvised explosive devices, we have such experience in this country, while at international level we have seen atrocities and people using these devices on an individual basis to harm others.</p><p>I hope we never see anything like it on our shores but at the same time we need to be prepared and we need to have training for troops.  I very much support the two projects being put forward.</p><p> In terms of maritime surveillance, more of our landmass is under water than above water.  We have a huge area to cover and protect.  The fact we can exchange information with other member states is positive.  I am particularly delighted that we were exchanging information with the Italians using the system while we were conducting our operations in the Mediterranean.  That shows what can be achieved.  I have no doubt it saved lives by directing our personnel where to go to pick up and rescue those in need.  It is a very positive programme.  The continuation and enhancement of that programme are very good.</p><p> The cyber ranges project shows we are thinking ahead.  There are already a number of threats to the country and our democracy and on an international level through cyber activity.  Our forces are very well equipped and have the best knowledge but co-operation on cyber ranges, the sharing of knowledge and the pooling of resources will minimise inefficiency.  One hundred man-days is a minimal amount to put to any project so it represents huge value to the State in terms of what we will gain back as a country.  </p><p> The Minister of State has my full support on both projects and I look forward to hearing reports on how our people have gotten on when they have been completed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.63" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1305" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016110300002#C00200"><p>I welcome the opportunity to go through this and acknowledge that minimal cost is involved but that does not mean I support it.  There is a danger in moving in the way we are moving.  I raised this when the European Defence Agency and all it entailed was first being discussed.  Nobody disagrees with increased efficiencies but part of the European Defence Agency's purpose is to increase capacity across the Defence Forces, which means expending money.  If that expenditure is being dictated by other member states, the vast majority of whom are in NATO and whose underlying desire is to enhance NATO or have interoperability between the EU military structure that is now emerging and NATO, I would question it.  The context to all this is the debate since the British referendum on EU membership.  Since the English decided they would withdraw from the European Union, there has been a rush by some countries to reignite the debate about the European army.  The Minister of State has replied to my questions on this in the past so I will not raise it as an issue here.  We will have other opportunities for that.</p> <p>  I accept that the proposals before us will incur minimal costs.  I am fully supportive of any move which will enhance the capacity of our Naval Service as it carries out its humanitarian work in the Mediterranean in particular.  I also accept that as a small country, we need to learn from other countries and other navies and on occasion to co-operate and share but there are some questions that need to be answered about these two proposals.  In some of the research I did I looked at the European Commission's joint staff working document on the implementation of the EU maritime security strategy action plan which emerged in June of this year.  It states: "Cooperation with NATO (action 1.1.3.) remains a priority for Member States as emphasised throughout the reports".  That should be answered.  Ireland does not play a role in that but it is not reflected in the Commission document.  Do we play a role in it?  When we agree with the European Defence Agency and all that entails, we become dependent.  It entails interoperability which by its very nature, especially in the field of computer technology which we are talking about here, means that we become dependent.  Becoming dependent means that there will be a huge cost if we move away from systems that are shared with other countries and that is the danger.  If one looks at the MARSUR proposal, the reason MARSUR II has been proposed, as the Minister of State said, is that the first programme is at an end and it needs to be continued because of the benefits gained from the first programme.  That means we will be tied to that programme into the future because we have invested time and effort into it.  We will have to continue to buy into such a programme because as computers, technologies and systems develop we become more and more dependent on them.  </p> <p>  We have the ability to opt out of the category B programmes because they are not binding on all member states but the category A are because we did not take the option Denmark took to opt out.  I do not know what other programmes come under the European Defence Agency.  Are there ones that we have opted out of?  Is it the case that we are in a rush to get involved in everything because we want to play with the big boys?</p> <p>  The bomb disposal proposal was mentioned by the Minister of State.  During the years the Defence Forces have gained an expertise which they have shared throughout the world and that has been recognised.  It was one of the reasons there were Irish soldiers in Afghanistan very early on in that conflict.  They were there to train Afghani police to identify IEDs and to help in whatever way possible.  On that basis, one could say it was a humanitarian approach.</p> <p>  The problem with the second project for the EDA cyber ranges is that when one looks at some of the documents in the background, the idea is that information sharing on maritime issues would not be confined to the European Union.  There is talk in the documents of going beyond the existing European Union structure.  Will the Minister of State elaborate when it is hoped that will happen?  What work has been done in recent times on expanding beyond the existing EU members?</p> <p>  The other issue is that in some ways the cyber range programme deals with a virtual environment and not actual events.  In some ways, it is setting out scenarios that would result if there was a cyber attack.  The dangers I see as a lay person, which is the problem when one is dealing with something as highly technical as cyber security, is that it will help to strengthen the knowledge of cyber defence operations.  A state is sharing its information with 26 other member states, or perhaps 25 if Denmark is not involved.  By its nature, sharing information and giving remote access in one country to personnel from another location or country undermines cyber security.</p><p>The ability to use such schemes can be undermined once other security services, military forces or navies have some idea of the work and practices involved.  Given what we have seen, even in the US presidential debate, if we are to believe what has emerged about Hillary Clinton's e-mails and whether the Russians are involved, it is other countries that are mainly involved in cyber attacks.  We have also seen supposed allies targeting cyber attacks on each other.  We need only take Angela Merkel as an example.  It was the Americans, her supposed allies, who were tapping into her e-mails and telephone conversations.  Therefore, being dependent or reliant in any way on schemes developed by other countries is a dangerous road to go down.  Those countries may currently be allies but, as we have seen from the history of Europe, in particular, that can change quite quickly.  Could we not do it ourselves?  The cost is minimal and it is a virtual environment rather than a real-life situation.  I hope we will never face the real-life situation.</p><p> The specifics of these programmes are not laid out in full in the briefing document we received from the Department or in what has been said by the Minister of State.  There was a reference to 100 hours on the part of some military personnel.  That is not huge; it is minor.  How long will it last?  Is it expected that there will be another follow-up programme?  In some ways, some kids would probably be able to do this on their computers, given it is a game, albeit an important one, if it is a virtual scenario.   I know from speaking to military personnel during the years that they are keen to develop their capabilities and their understanding of how armies are becoming more dependent on computer and IT systems.  There was a concern that armies were becoming more reliant on them and that, in the event of a war, much of their capabilities, if they were computerised and not as mechanical as they previously were, could be knocked out.  If scenarios have been developed on how to respond to emergency situations based on computer simulations, then everyone will go by the textbook.  The enemy or whoever is attacking will have a grasp of the likely response in certain scenarios because they have been practised in this virtual environment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.65" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1291" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016110300002#D00200"><p>I have had three different experiences of foreign affairs committees since I was first elected to the D&aacute;il.  The first one was very much focused on human rights issues.  The second one, in the previous D&aacute;il, added "trade" to the title of the committee.  Now this one has "defence" in its title.  We have broadened our horizons considerably in recent years.</p> <p>  Having heard the Minister of State's presentation, two things come to mind when thinking about Ireland and defence.  The first one is the preservation of our neutrality, which has been undermined in recent years.  We must be strongly committed to our neutrality.  The second one concerns the reputation of our peacekeeping forces.  Both are connected.  It is because we are a neutral country, along with our development aid programme, that we have an excellent reputation.  Our peacekeeping troops abroad have been exemplary in all their missions.  I know that there are serious issues with how peacekeeping troops from other countries handled situations, but the Irish peacekeeping troops have been excellent.  I had those two aspects in mind when reading the Minister of State's speech.</p> <p>  Perhaps I should know the answers to my questions, but defence is a new element to this committee.  My fellow Deputies here are their parties' spokespersons on defence.  Why did Ireland not look for an opt-out clause similar to that of Denmark?  What does it mean in real terms if we do not have that opt-out clause?  The participation in category A and B projects are subject to Government or D&aacute;il approval.  Again, perhaps I should know the answer, but when was the last time we had to do something that required the Minister of State to come to the D&aacute;il?  The term "international crisis management" is vague.  Keeping in mind our peacekeeping troops and our neutrality, is there a danger that we will end up in a very different role in an international crisis management situation?</p> <p>  My other question concerns fishing and the role of the Navy in protecting our fishing waters.  In years past there has been great concern on the part of the fishing industry about the attention paid to it as opposed to that paid to intruders in our waters, that is, the big factory ships.  There is a perception among some in the fishing fraternity that they were being targeted.  I am not saying whether they were breaking the law but the focus on them was disproportionate to that on other fishing fleets.  Will the Minister of State provide some further information on the protection of our fishing waters?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.66" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1365" speakername="Paul Kehoe" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016110300002#D00300"><p>I will deal with the last questions first.  Denmark is constitutionally debarred from participating.  I assure Deputy O'Sullivan that Ireland's traditional policy on military neutrality is completely unaffected by the Treaty on European Union as amended by the Lisbon treaty.  We are not and will not become, as a result of the treaty, part of any alliance or military formation.  Legally binding guarantees secured by Ireland at the European Council prior to the second Lisbon treaty referendum clearly state that the Lisbon treaty does not affect or prejudice Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  Any form of common defence can only come about if all member states agree unanimously.  Even if member states were to so agree, Ireland could not participate without a separate referendum to approve its participation.  While issues have been raised concerning the European army, nothing in the treaties provide for the establishment of such a European army.  I refer to Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh's question also.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that we are broadening our horizons and pushing out the boundaries, but I assure the Deputy that we remain neutral.  She can be absolutely assured of that because there are many people around here who would be forced to put their hands up, as it were, if we were not keeping within the realms of our neutrality.  However, when we go abroad and speak to personnel on the ground, they tell us of the importance of working with like-minded states.  We are a small country and nation.  If we do not keep up to date with what is out there, we will be left behind and we will not be able to participate in the likes of UNIFIL or UNDOF missions abroad.</p> <p>  There is a perception about sea fisheries protection.  I speak to those in the Naval Service regularly.  They treat everyone the very same.  When they are on sea fishery patrols, they do not target those from specific countries over others.  If someone is fishing illegally, they do their best to bring them to book.</p> <p>  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh had a number of questions.  We opt out of a number of projects.  It is not that we are ready to jump in to every project; we do opt out.  We have opted out on many occasions, but we examine the benefits of each and every project to the Defence Forces.</p><p>It is important that we look upon every project in that manner.</p><p> Reference was made to cybersecurity which is an absolutely huge issue, not only for this state but right across the world, because there are people ready to attack.  The question was asked if we are we allowing people to attack our systems and get access to our information.  These are training exercises.  This is not about sharing information or anything like that.  It is about specific exercises with cyber attacks that are set up in a very controlled environment.  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh made a reference to the European army.  I have responded to the Deputy about this in parliamentary questions on many occasions.</p><p> I very much welcome Deputy Lisa Chambers' comments and her support for the projects. I believe there is great value for money here, as the Deputy has outlined.  It is important to participate in chemical and biological exercises because we are in a very changing environment in a changing world.  We have to be ready for that, and participating in the projects under the EDA is beneficial to the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

I think I bounced myself into it last night when I started reading it.  I want to talk about the implementation of the EU maritime security strategy action plan.  Have we signed up to that, which dates from 2014?  If we have, were we concerned when for instance in its report on MARSUR the European Commission's joint staff working document on the implementation of the EU maritime security strategy action plan says that:</p><blockquote>[T]he MARSUR Networking community is preparing to expand to additional Member States [and that is literally what we are speaking about now] and entities such as the EU Satellite Centre and is exploring options to integrate valuable surveillance information from different Maritime Security Regimes reaching beyond the boundaries of the European Union.</blockquote> <p>That it is reaching beyond the boundaries of the European Union is the aspect I am interested in given that throughout the document it speaks of co-operation with other nation states.  In one place the document discusses increased co-operation with north African countries, in particular with a view to improving the safety of navigation in the Mediterranean.  These are laudable aims but they are beyond the bounds of the European Union and they have not been discussed, to my knowledge, in the D&aacute;il or in this committee.</p><p>When people signed up, through the referendum, to the European Defence Agency there was a presumption - perhaps wrongly by most people and I know I tried to highlight what the European Defence Agency was talking about at the time - that it was going to increase capacity and increase interoperability and not just within the European Union but beyond.  The Commission's working document on the implementation of the EU maritime security strategy action plan says that co-operation with NATO remains a priority for member states with &quot;The need to promote closer cooperation with NATO on standards and procedures&quot;.  There is continuous emphasis on NATO in what is supposed to be an EU document on maritime security.  It also says that MARSUR is the defence layer of the common information sharing environment.  Therefore, this is not about just sharing information for the sake of maritime protection, it is regarded as a defence mechanism.</p><p>The document also speaks about how &quot;At international level, relevance is given to the work developed under NATO and to its High Level Committee of Emergency Civil Planning, to the NATO Civil/Military Transport Working Groups&quot;.  They seem to be intertwined continuously and there is a logic to that because most of the EU countries are in NATO and most of their armies have developed an interoperability and a sharing of information based on their membership of NATO.  The danger is that the more we tie ourselves in to the EU military structures, our military and our IT systems then become synonymous with the NATO systems and become dependent on them.</p><p>Page 17 of that document also cites, &quot;The importance of taking into account NATO when determining the development of capacities is also suggested, as a way of enhancing complementarity of efforts while benefiting from the work already developed, in particular in the areas of normalization and standardization&quot;.  That is the concern.  I remember when the referendum was held and Ireland signed in to the European Defence Agency and Denmark did not.  These were the concerns people had, that we were getting tied.  I am not arguing about an EU army in this case.  I am whether, in all of the opt in or opt out options, full account taken of the dependence or interdependence that will arise from Ireland getting involved in programmes that are underlined or underscored by NATO which seems to have a greater interest in the European Union going in this direction?</p></speech>

Every time we speak about the Defence Forces participating in any project where we share knowledge and work with other member states, there is huge suspicion and I do not understand why.  At the end of the day, if on the one hand we support our troops participating in peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions, which I believe most Deputies do, then we cannot on the other hand say that the troops cannot participate in projects where they work with other member states.  If we are going to send troops overseas, they need to be properly equipped and they need to know what they are doing.  They need to participate in training exercises or we are sending them overseas and they are not safe.  They are not going over there on holidays.  They are going over to participate in missions that are inherently unsafe for their welfare and possibly their lives.  If the troops are not properly trained and if they do not have the most up-to-date knowledge, then they are at a disadvantage.  I do not buy this idea that somehow our neutrality is being attacked because we participate in cross-training exercises.  We should make no apology for equipping our troops to the best possible standards that we can.</p> <p>  We must ask ourselves why we do this.  We do this because we know that we will benefit from economies of scale by sharing knowledge and expertise.  We know that we will learn from other member states and other armies.  Our troops tell us this.  Every time they come back from an exercise they tell us how much they have benefited; therefore, why are we sheepishly asking for support to participate in the next training exercise? We should be fully supporting this because if we are sending them over and they are not properly trained, it is on our heads.  It is up to us to ensure they are properly trained and equipped to do the missions we send them overseas to do.</p> <p>  I have no doubt that we do opt out of some these training project projects and programmes.  I have no doubt that our troops would love to do more projects and would love to learn from and interact more with other armies.  The point is being made that we are a very small nation and we do not have the answer to everything.  We do not have access to all of the equipment available internationally and all of the knowledge.  That is why we do these programmes.  Expanding capacity or enhancing interoperability are not bad things.  They are good things, and we should be proud that we are doing them and proud to be proactive about it.  It annoys me that every time we participate in a defence mission or defence project abroad, there is a suggestion that we are somehow undermining neutrality.  At the end of the day we have a triple-lock system.  We paddle our own canoe.</p> <p>  It is important to remember that simply because another member state has its own ideas about a European-wide army or has its own idea about what they would like to do with defence policy in their country does not make any difference to what we do in our own state.  We decide for ourselves, as we have always done.  The protections are in place in the treaties to ensure that decisions with regard to our own defence policy will always be taken by ourselves in our own State.  The protections are there for neutrality and the protections are there for us to decide our own policy.  This fear and suspicion needs to be put to bed.  We should be very loud and clear in explaining to the public and to Deputies who oppose such projects why we are doing this.  We are doing it to protect our own troops because we send them overseas regularly, and if we do not train them properly, we are putting their lives at risk.</p></speech>

We partake in the maritime security strategy, but we are protected by our own treaty and the triple lock arrangement.  It is not often that I agree with Deputy Lisa Chambers, but I agree with her absolutely this morning.  She is dead right that we must participate with like-minded countries in projects and training exercises because we have a very small defence force compared with some of the larger states.  When we go abroad and see our peacekeepers with UNIFIL or UNDOF on the ground, they tell us about the importance of interoperability, working with like-minded states and the experience of co-operation.  We will take command of UNIFIL from Finbatt at the end of November.  If we did not have the opportunity to work alongside other member states before partaking in the joint battalion with UNIFIL, we would be in serious trouble.  It is a great opportunity for members of the Defence Forces to work with others from like-minded countries and participate in training exercises and the projects we are discussing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.72" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1305" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDS2016110300002#F00200"><p>In response to both Deputies, I have never said I am opposed to engaging in joint exercises or training abroad or working with countries within the European Union, but that is not the point.  The issue is whether we are aware that in making these decisions that over time we will become more dependent which will undermine our ability to take decisions for ourselves.  This is a tiny country and we do not have huge destroyers or tanks on the scale similar to that in Germany or anywhere else and no one is suggesting we should.  In fact, in some ways, there is no need for us to do so because we are a small nation on the outskirts of Europe.  We have some skills that we can sell, as I mentioned, and we can train others.  That is the benefit of co-operation.  However, one has to be careful about the underlying trend, which is why I have continuously raised this issue.  If I did not raise it, I would not be doing my job.</p><p>There is a concern.  A huge number of people in the State are concerned about the drift towards the militarisation of Europe and the world and have voted in different referendums at different levels and on occasion have won.  We have to satisfy our concerns by asking questions.  Every time we engage in international co-operation or take part in international operations with countries which are involved in military alliances, we must ensure we do not compromise ourselves in any way.  I have accepted the <i>bona fid</i>es of different Ministers and programmes.  I am not opposed to use of the virtual environment.  I have just raised questions as to whether it is as secure as we want it to be.  If one takes part in a cyber attack simulation, is one exposing oneself?  Have we taken steps to ensure those who take part in such simulations will not end up disclosing how Ireland, if it was to come under such an attack, would react?</p><p>As I said, NATO has been in existence for 60 years and the European Union is younger.  If one looks at history, in particular the history of Europe, most of the countries involved are former imperialist powers, most of which are still involved in imperial adventures abroad.  We are not.  We have suffered from this and have a different history from most of those with which we are working.  While it is cost-effective and efficient to ensure that if we are operating in the Mediterranean, we can use the best others make available because we have only one ship operating in that entire sea, one has to be concerned.  The Minister of State reassures us when the questions are asked and it is my job to obtain that reassurance.  The Minister of State has done it, as have previous Ministers, but I would not be doing my job if I did not raise concerns.</p><p>From relatives of mine in the Defence Forces who have operated overseas and participated in joint exercises, I am aware of the experience they have gained.  They have said it is a lot better than sitting in barracks or training on the Curragh because they get to learn from and train others, as we have succeeded in doing.  However, we should as much as possible seek to engage in exercise with countries which are not members jof NATO.  I am not irrational about the ease with which we can find these opportunities.  There is not a huge number of countries near our shores in which people speak English and which would be able to take part in such exercises, but one has to go looking as near to home as possible to make it cost-effective for our soldiers and sailors to benefit from the shared experience and knowledge that comes from these exercises.</p></speech>

I sincerely hope that possibility will never arise.  We also have the Seville Declaration of 2002 in which we obtained agreement among our EU partners on Ireland's position on military neutrality.  That is very clear and it is included in the Constitution.  That is our source of governance and we will stick by it.  There is also the triple lock arrangement, to which Deputy Lisa Chambers referred.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has outlined clearly that Ireland's participation in European Defence Agency projects enhances the capacity of the Defence Forces in their peacekeeping and crisis management operations.  We should take every opportunity in the Oireachtas to record our appreciation of the huge contribution made by Permanent Defence Force personnel over many decades in working in the most difficult of peacekeeping missions.  All of the soldiers involved did the country proud and, sadly, some made the ultimate sacrifice.  I represent two counties which have a huge tradition of participating in the Permanent Defence Force and know many families in which a number of siblings have participated in peacekeeping missions.  These families have always taken great pride in the fact that their members were able to participate in missions in the most difficult of circumstances.  The least the Defence Forces deserve is to be properly equipped when they participate in very challenging missions.  Anything that can enhance their capacity within the parameters we all support is welcome and necessary.  Participation, co-operation and collaboration enhance the capacity of the Defence Forces and ensure they have the most up-to-date skills and access to the most modern technology.</p></speech>

It is incumbent on us as Deputies to ensure, in respect of the protections we have all outlined that assure our neutrality, we will decide for ourselves our policy and what we will or will not participate in.  We must ensure information is provided for the public and that we tell them why we are doing what we are and set out the benefits for our soldiers.  This refers not only to the cost benefits but also to the benefits of the knowledge and training our soldiers will receive, all of which are intended to keep them safe.  We should put this information before the public to a greater extent.  We may at times have failed to inform it properly of the operations in which the Defence Forces participate and why.  We must reassure it that this remain at all times a neutral state and that we have no intention of ever changing this.</p> <p>  My comment on the suspicion of some Deputies of participation in defence operations was not directed at any one individual, rather it was a general comment to the committee.</p><p>In recent months when we had to discuss participation in the UK battle group there was huge resistance in the House to that participation.  I could not understand why because in my view it would have been an opportunity for some of our troops to gain extra experience and knowledge and to educate themselves further, which would be a good thing.  A further conversation about how we might embark on a public relations exercise, for want of a better phrase, on behalf of the Defence Forces about participation in this type of project with other European member states and how we might better inform the public of what is going on, would be very beneficial to the Defence Forces.</p></speech>

We should all give that more currency when debates on this arise.  Maintenance of our neutrality is a strong issue for us going back many decades.  That cannot be diluted in any way whatsoever.  That is the overwhelming view of the people of this country.</p></speech>

The need for the European Union to kowtow to NATO appears in every document.  I have never seen the phrase, &quot;with respect to Ireland&rsquo;s neutrality&quot; stated.  Even though we are part of a document, that is not stated anywhere in the document I have been quoting from.  There is no footnote to say Ireland is a neutral country or has the opt-out.  Our officials should ensure <i>ad nauseam</i>that it is reflected in those documents because then there will be no question of undermining our neutrality or officials not doing their job.  That is something we can refer to.  This is a working document; therefore, perhaps, there is time to do that, unless it has been passed.  There are many references to NATO and obviously it has capability but when it states the European Union must enhance its capacity in line with that of NATO, those of us who have concerns about militarisation need to see someone hold up a flag and state Ireland&rsquo;s key position and the key decisions we have taken in recent years.  That would be useful.</p></speech>

Officials have told me that predecessors of mine and other people who participated in those parliamentary meetings took the opportunity to outline exactly the Irish position.  That is what we should do at all times.</p> <p>  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh is right in one respect, we had a debate on neutrality when there was a Private Member&rsquo;s motion on a Friday in the previous D&aacute;il.  The Minister of State with responsibility for defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, was there.  I spoke on behalf of Fianna F&aacute;il.  President Juncker had not long taken over as President of the European Commission.  He had made outlandish statements in regard to common security policy.  I recall stating at the time that his remarks were totally reprehensible.  When senior Commission officials make comments, we should be quick to pounce on and reject them.</p></speech>

If we do compromise or if there is any impact on our neutrality, there is the opt-out clause.  The Deputy says we should work with like-minded countries that are not aligned with NATO but our options are limited.  The Deputy did recognise that.  We have to consider the language barrier.  The Chairman is right that when we send our troops abroad they must be fully equipped and have the skills to carry out their duties and responsibilities in a professional manner.  It is my responsibility and that of the Government to make sure we give the forces the equipment and skills to ensure they are able to carry out their duties in a professional manner.</p> <p>  The EU-NATO declaration of July this year confirms that future co-operation will fully respect the decision-making autonomy of both organisations and will not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of any member state.  It may be only two or three lines, but it is clearly stated in the declaration.</p></speech>

Conal McFeely and I were involved in the decommission of the Irish National Liberation Army, INLA, and as a result we built up some credence, perhaps, with other republican groups.  We were invited to Maghaberry Prison early in 2010 when a dirty protest was ongoing in the prison.  We engaged in a series of negotiations with the prisoners and the prison service.  During all that time we consulted with the Irish and British Governments so, to a certain extent, one could call us agents of the British and Irish Governments as well.  They were fully informed at all times of what we were doing.</p> <p>  As a result of that, in August 2010 we came to an agreement.  Part of it was negotiated in Hillsborough Castle with the British authorities and the then director of the prisons.  The interesting aspect of the agreement of August 2010 is that when we finished the negotiations, it was accepted by everybody, to the extent that the prison governor signed the agreement on behalf of the prison authorities and each prisoner in Maghaberry signed.  The difficulty is that since then neither side, to a certain extent, has implemented the agreement.  We were there for a number of years afterwards.  The then Minister of Justice, David Ford, appointed us as facilitators to monitor the implementation of the agreement, along with Rev. Dr. Lesley Carroll and Chris Maccabe, who had been in the Northern Ireland Office.  He had previously been director of prisons in Northern Ireland and had experience of the Maze Prison or Long Kesh.</p> <p>  Since then we have been working tirelessly and frustratingly on trying to get the agreement implemented on the premise that, a little like the Lansdowne Road agreement and the current unrest in the Republic, it is the only show in town.  We have provided the committee with copies of the 2010 agreement and of the stock-take we undertook two years ago.  We have also provided a brief outline of the matters that remain a source of conflict.  Our premise is that if there is ever to be peace and an end to political violence in Northern Ireland, the issues in the prison must be resolved.  Not solving them gives oxygen and focus to supporters of &Oacute;glaigh na h&Eacute;ireann, the Republican Network for Unity, the Real IRA, the New IRA or whatever IRA it is today to continue their struggle.  If we or anybody else are to have an opportunity to wean political people or armed groups back into the political sphere, we must sort out the prison.  They will never move as long as they have prisoners in prison getting treated the way people are being treated in Roe House.</p> <p>  Our formula is the one we worked out in the agreement with everybody.  We still look forward to the day when it will be implemented fully by both sides.  We must accept that it has been thwarted at various times by the prison service, by the political actions of a political party in the Northern Ireland Assembly and, for example, by the murders of David Black and Adrian Ismay.  Incidentally, the first time the trade union movement in Northern Ireland protested the murders of prison officers was when I led demonstrations against them in Belfast City Hall.</p> <p>  We have a difficulty and I hope other people will engage on it.  I look forward to the questions and answers because this is a terribly important time to have that.  A final point should be made.  Nothing has happened since May.  In May or early June, Conal McFeely, our other two colleagues and I met with the new Minister of Justice, Claire Sugden.  It was agreed that day that a review panel, comprising three named individuals, would undertake a fast, expeditious review of the current position of the implementation of the August 2010 agreement.  To date, that panel has not been established, so five or six months later there is no engagement.  That is frustrating, particularly from the point of view of the prisoners in Roe House.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.92" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conal McFeely" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016110300002#C00400"><p>I will speak on the current issues that must be reconciled and would enable Roe House to be a settled, conflict-free environment.  The focus of our endeavours was to create a conflict-free environment within the separated wing which houses republican prisoners.  Clearly, there is an issue with controlled movement.  It was agreed in the August 2010 agreement that a process would evolve whereby there would be greater free flow in how prisoners can utilise the landings and so forth.  At present, we have a situation where, of the prisoners who are housed in Roe 3 and Roe 4, only four prisoners are allowed out at any one time.  As a result of the work we did in the stock-take, we recommended that an independent person should be brought in to examine the situation and see if we could break the impasse.</p><p>The International Committee of the Red Cross, which is an internationally renowned body, took on the role of trying to resolve that issue.  It came up with a recommendation that, again, was approved by the prison administration and accepted by the prisoners but, unfortunately, when it came to implementation of that recommendation the prison authorities said they did not have the staff to do it.  It is our view that controlled movement is a major bone of contention and it needs to be resolved.  </p><p> On the issue of full body searching, we put forward recommendations on how new technology could be utilised to resolve this issue.  Mr. Peter Bunting and I visited Portlaoise Prison to see how the system is working there with prisoners who are housed as republican prisoners.  There is a mechanism available that could help resolve this situation.  It is our standing that there is newer technology available that would remove the need for full body searching, which is a degrading process not only for the prisoners who have to endure it but also for the prison staff who have to carry it out. </p><p> Another key issue is isolation policy.  This issue needs to be addressed because of the unease it causes not only within the prisons but within the wider populous.  We are told that prison policy is a devolved matter in the North but the determination of who is located on the republican wing or the loyalist wing is at the behest of the British Secretary of State.  The British Secretary of State has the power to deny people access to Roe House.  This situation needs to be addressed.  In one case, a prisoner was held in isolation for five years.  This means the prisoner was in lock-up for 23 hours for five years.  This needs to stop.  Four people were recently arrested in Lurgan.  Three of them have been allowed to go into Roe House but the fourth has been denied access to it.  This is inhumane.  These issues need to be dealt with.</p><p> The biggest issue we attempted to address in 2010 was education and skills provision.  It is non-existent within Roe House.  Prisoners are being denied access to education and other stimuli.  We know that there are a number of prisoners who would like to be involved in Open University courses, etc., and craft work.  We have been arguing now for over six years that the prison authorities should appoint an Irish tutor so that prisoners can promote their Irish language and Irish culture but this has been denied.  This is unacceptable.  </p><p> It has recently emerged that a prisoner from Derry who is being held on the signature of the Secretary of State is being denied normal process in law.  This is unhelpful.  It undermines confidence and trust within the prison system.  The wife of this particular prisoner visited the prison last Sunday with her severely disabled son.  I know this family well.  This woman is not a political activist.  She is a mother of three children, two teenage girls and a severely disabled son.  The woman has alleged - this matter has been referred to the PSNI - that she was assaulted by a prisoner officer as she was trying to deal with her disabled son.  The prison governor has written to her informing her that she will be denied family visits.  This is unheard of.</p><p> In my experience of dealing with prisons in Northern Ireland this type of situation only adds to mistrust in the ability of the prison regime to deal with these matters in a humane and sensitive way.  There is a moral issue from a prison perspective.  We would argue that the August 2010 agreement is not being implemented because of the ongoing threats and intimidation of staff.  We would argue that, as provided for in the fundamental principles of the August 2010 agreement, staff should be able to go about their work without any intimidation or threat.  Mr. Bunting alluded to the fact that over the last six years two prison officers have lost their lives as a result of the ongoing dispute within the prison.</p></speech>

I now invite Mr. Finucane to make his presentation, following which members may ask questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.95" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Finucane" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016110300002#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting me to address it today on issues surrounding Maghaberry Prison.  It is to the credit of this committee that in convening today to discuss Maghaberry Prison, it recognises the significant relationship between securing a just and lasting peace and the state and conditions within the largest prison in our jurisdiction.  While it is understandable that other areas of the criminal justice system, for example the police or the court system, have previously been under intense scrutiny in the context of implementing the Good Friday Agreement, it has led to the prison service avoiding being held to similar standards and account.</p> <p>  My name is John Finucane.  I am director of Finucane Toner solicitors, a Belfast based solicitors firm.  My firm specialises in criminal defence work, civil litigation and judicial review proceedings against many institutions but most predominantly the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  I have been attending Maghaberry in a professional capacity for over ten years and I have had a unique insight into various areas of prison life.  This includes, but is not exclusive to, dealing with sentenced and remand prisoners from all backgrounds charged with or sentenced for the full range of offences across the criminal justice spectrum.  I regularly deal with prison staff on the ground right up to governor level.</p> <p>  Maghaberry Prison has undoubtedly come under intense scrutiny following a series of damning reports and incidents.  It has been described as one of the most expensive and dangerous prisons in western Europe, run by ineffective management and supported by over-worked, under-resourced staff with low morale.  The committee need only look to August and September 2016 to see two damning prison service ombudsman reports.  The case of Sean Lynch, an inmate suffering from psychiatric issues who inflicted extreme and shocking injuries upon himself, detailed a catalogue of failures.  This report closely followed the ombudsman&rsquo;s investigation into the death in custody of Paddy Kelly in March 2015.  According to this report, an inmate, who was known to be at risk of self-harm, took a fatal overdose of his own prescription drugs, despite asking not to be put in control of them.  His overdose was foreseeable and his death preventable.</p> <p>  I have had experience of numerous inmates who suffer from various degrees of mental health and physical problems and I have yet to see any tangible improvement in how they are treated.  As recently as yesterday, I received a call from a client who has had medication prescribed by a psychiatrist arbitrarily removed by medical staff who attract numerous complaints about the way in which they deal with inmates.  It is commonplace in my experience that failure to deal with medication can easily push inmates to the readily available opportunity to self-medicate with the myriad of unlawful drugs available within Maghaberry.  Medical care is under the governance of the health trust and while a custodial environment presents obvious challenges, there continues to exist a lack of co-operation between prison and health officials, resulting in inmates suffering and, in extreme cases, dying.</p> <p>  The ombudsman has cited security concerns with little basis in reality trumping their duty of care to inmates and this is a theme which increases in severity in my experience when dealing with prisoners in the separated regime of Roe House.  Roe House is where those accused or sentenced for offences claimed or linked to dissident republicanism are housed.  It is practically a jail within a jail and operates on a different basis to inmates housed elsewhere.  I began by alluding to the historic relationship that exists in Ireland between the level of peace within society and the tension, or lack of it. within prisons.  The committee will be aware of repeated failures and missed opportunities to reach an accommodation between prisoners in Roe House and prison authorities aimed at reducing tension and securing an environment in which staff and inmates are treated safely with dignity and respect.  Areas which have yet to be resolved include controlled movement, strip searching, and access to education and trade skills.  As recently as this week, in the case of Gerard Flannigan, a client of my office, the issue of strip searching and specifically the video recording of strip searches was before the Court of Appeal in Belfast.</p><p>The Prison Service has argued that it is entitled both to record an inmate's strip search and to retain that recording for six years.  We were successful at the Court of First Instance and it would be of no surprise if this case reached the Supreme Court.  I highlight it not to get into the detail of the arguments today, but as a clear example of security concerns with little basis in reality trumping a duty of care.  Prison staff have a justifiable expectation to be treated with dignity and respect, but any democratic society must also expect that sentiment to be reciprocated.</p><p> In a similar vein, I also represent a sentenced prisoner of Roe House who has been continually frustrated in his attempts to complete an Open University degree.  Course work which must be completed online is unable to be submitted due to the denial of computers under the excuse of security.  In fact, the level of education open to prisoners in the general population far exceeds what is available within Roe House.  Essential skills, GCSEs, A levels and trade skills are all denied to inmates housed in Roe and only those capable of completing a degree level course through the Open University are capable of engaging in even a small way in education.  These examples may seem anecdotal in nature but they are just a couple of many I could raise with the committee today.</p><p> If inmates were the sole cause of conflict within the prison, they should rightfully be exposed for it.  However, the committee needs to address a prison management system that is failing not just the inmates of Roe but all inmates within Maghaberry in its apparent lack of genuine desire to show mature leadership.  In the context of the Good Friday Agreement, there must be a political will to ensure that prison reform is based on well-established human rights principles and that everyone from inmates to staff, professionals and families who attend the prison are treated with dignity and respect.  The problems of Maghaberry Prison are not insurmountable, but it takes all sides to have equally the desire to address them.  I thank the committee for its focus on Maghaberry today and I urge all members to bring their influence to bear to create a better prison environment for everyone.</p></speech>

I have three questions.  In August 2010, there was an agreement which some of the witnesses were involved in putting together.  The agreement was not implemented, however.  When Mr. Bunting was making his submission, he said one of the reasons was political interference at the Assembly.  I would like him to elaborate on that.</p> <p>  My second question is on the NIO.  We are well aware of its capacity to use extra-judicial powers to put people in prison and keep them there without giving any explanation to anybody.  Even if it has not given an explanation to politicians or Assembly Members, has the NIO given any explanation to the witnesses as to why it continues to use those powers given the team's role in trying to resolve the prison situation?</p> <p>  My third question is on Roe House, controlled movement and strip searching.  Why do prison staff insist they have to use these powers?  Are they being pressurised to use them?  It was mentioned earlier that it is very difficult for some of the staff to implement many of these measures, in particular around strip searching.  As such, why are they so insistent about having to use these horrendous powers?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Bunting" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016110300002#E00500"><p>I will answer as quickly as I can and Mr. McFeely might wish to add something.  There are a number of reasons as to why the agreement has not been implemented.  There is a view in the POA, which is probably a hangover from the days of Long Kesh, that they are not going back there.  However, anybody who has visited Roe House will know that it is nothing like the Long Kesh prison.  As Mr. Finucane said, it is a prison within a prison.  I cannot see a loosening up of the regulations.  It is a terribly congested space in many ways with turnstiles everywhere.  It is a phenomenal place.  I believe there has been interference in the sense that in our view the then Minister of Justice was probably beholden to the likes of, for example, the DUP for his position.  That probably resulted in him lacking the resolve to tackle this matter head on, despite the fact that we had reached agreement with what we believed to be representatives of the British and Irish Governments and others.</p> <p>  On the NIO, it has never really given us positive evidence or reasoning other than to say, "You do not know what we know and we cannot tell you".  One example was given by Mr. McFeely when he was talking about the person incarcerated in isolation for five years.  The reasoning in respect of that prisoner was that there was a threat to his life by some people in Roe House.  However, when he got out on bail and was walking around the streets of Northern Ireland, nothing ever happened to him.  He was never harmed.  As such, who was threatening his life?  Was it an excuse and a way to punish someone?  It is alleged that at that time he was taken out of the prison on two occasions, perhaps by agents of MI5, and taken to Lisburn police station and questioned with a view to turning him over to be an informer.  These people, whoever they were, had the power to take him out of that prison and lodge him in Lisburn PSNI station under a different name.  One has all this stuff in the middle of everything that is going on such that one does not know who is controlling the prison.  One assumes the NIO is behind some of the stuff.  I am not saying that out of conspiracy reasoning.  It is our desire totally to deal with the prison and to make it a conflict-free society because, equally, I represent the workers in the POA as well.  I would not have an agreement which put them under any threat of harm or intimidation.  I represent these people too.</p> <p>  On Roe House, I think it can become some people's view of life that they can boss people about and have a bit of power over people.  In the August 2010 agreement, by the way, we included the right to conduct strip searches if there was intelligence evidence to suggest a person was smuggling drugs, arms or parts of arms.  It was accepted by everyone in the agreement that there would be strip searching in that context.  However, it is actually done on the basis that it is part of everyday life as opposed to on the basis of intelligence.  Mr. McFeely might wish to add to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.101" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Conal McFeely" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016110300002#E00600"><p>We do not underestimate the particular difficulties in trying to manage separated wings within Maghaberry Prison.  However, it is important to say that it is not a devolved matter in terms of the issue regarding people held in isolation.  In that situation, we believe the current thinking is that the separated arrangements were established by the British Government and we now have a situation as a result of the Fresh Start agreement and a panel that met recently whereby there is talk of integrating loyalist and republican prisoners into the mainstream prison.  History informs us that if there is forced integration at Maghaberry Prison of republican and loyalist prisoners, it will make matters worse within the prison.  We can go back to further protests within the prison and that will spill out into the streets and the prisoners' old communities.</p><p> In terms of current problems, we have been told that when we talk about prisoners who are held in isolation that it is a security matter and, therefore, a matter for the security services.  We ask if that is the PSNI.  We are also led to believe it is the intelligence services.  The intelligence services have a major role to play in what happens within the prison.</p><p> It is our considered view, as people who have been involved in this particular process for over six years, that it is possible to put in place what we would call a mutual respect policy.  It would create a more positive environment within Roe House at Maghaberry Prison for prisoners and staff.  We want to know whether there is political interference and that question still needs to be answered. </p></speech>

The three contributors have painted a very depressing and worrying picture of the conditions and treatment meted out to prisoners in Maghaberry Prison.</p> <p>  My recollection is that in 2015, the chief inspector of prisons presented a very damning report on the conditions in the prison about management, inefficiencies and a lack of resources that have been referred to by all the contributors today.  Subsequently, we were given to understand that some progress has been made in implementing various recommendations and that the prison authorities had engaged positively.  Have improvements been made since the chief inspector's report in 2015?  </p> <p>  In July 2016, the Northern Ireland Executive published an action plan to follow up on the Fresh Start agreement regarding commitments to end paramilitarism.  The plan also included a commitment to establish a panel to review the operation of the separated regime.  Has that happened?  Has the progress or lack of progress in addressing these issues been monitored?  </p> <p>  Everybody on this island and on our neighbouring island should be conscious of the fact that tensions in prisons are a worrying feature in society.  By this stage we should have learned our lessons in respect of difficulties and a lack of commitment to resolve prison conditions.</p></speech>

Clearly, we thought we had an agreement at that stage.  As Mr. Bunting has alluded to, the agreement was signed off by the prisoners and prison administration.  We were commended by both the British and Irish Governments on achieving the agreement but it has stalled.  Mr. Bunting has alluded to the number of reasons the agreement has stalled.  Clearly, there was an issue with the POA, which did not want to implement the agreement because its members alleged they feared returning to a Long Kesh type of prison, but it was clearly not that situation. </p> <p>  In terms of the Fresh Start agreement and the panel, as Mr. Bunting has alluded to, we met the new Minister of Justice and given an understanding that a review panel would be set up.  The big political debate at the moment is Brexit and everything else has been put on the backburner.  Nothing has happened and a panel has not been set up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.106" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Bunting" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016110300002#F00500"><p>Deputy Smith is quite right.  I have a copy of the Fresh Start panel report.  Both Mr. McFeely and I gave evidence to it on a number of fronts.  Paragraph B8, on page 35, reads:</p><blockquote>The Department of Justice should revisit the framework related to the separated regime and arrange for an independent review to be undertaken examining the operation of the separated regime, evidencing the need for any changes and providing useful information for stakeholders to take forward.</blockquote> <p>That has never happened.<br/><br/>The second point is of equal importance.  Paragraph B9 states:</p><blockquote>Whilst ensuring that all prisoners are treated fairly, the Department of Justice should ensure that appropriate learning and training opportunities are provided to prisoners in the separated regime.</blockquote> <p>That does not happen.  The initiative has been constantly thwarted, and deliberately in my opinion.  Excuses are made such as they cannot get an Irish language teacher.  One can walk out of the prison, turn left and turn left again for about three miles to west Belfast where it is no problem to get 150 Irish teachers.  They would all volunteer to visit the prison to provide education.<br/><br/>There is another important point in the report that is hugely instrumental and important.  Paragraph B14, on page 36, states &quot;The UK and Irish Governments should consider a mechanism being put in place for a limited period to deal with any future decommissioning of residual weapons or materiel.&quot; <br/><br/>The term &quot;Irish Government&quot; refers to you guys.  The paragraph offers an opportunity to those who continue to practice paramilitarism, if we get the prison thing sorted, to move into that arena.  We could have 66 reports saying the same thing but we will never resolve the situation until we get the prison thing sorted.  We know from republican history that paramilitaries will not move away from armed conflict until there is a conflict-free environment in the prison.  They will not leave behind their colleagues in a prison where they are harassed, bullied and treated unfairly.  If we have a conflict-free environment in that prison, then and only then, we can start making some degree of movement on that recommendation about future decommissioning.  We will not do so unless we sort out the prisons and my comment is for both Governments.</p></speech>

Unannounced visits caused the dramatic report published last year and they were followed up by announced visits.  There have been improvements, as far as the report is concerned, around management structures.</p> <p>  I have seen very little progress on the ground.  As recently as this week I talked to a person sentenced inmate at Roe House, and it sounds quite ludicrous, that prisoners are not allowed to have guitars for their guitar classes as they have been told that guitars pose a security risk.  One prisoner, through the tuck shop, acquired an electronic guitar tuner.  Somebody else applied for a tuner but was told by security that it was a complete no-no.  At the risk of sounding farcical I have outlined an example.  A couple of weeks ago my office, and other offices across the board, were told that only a qualified solicitor can send a person to the prison on a legal visit but, practically, that is unfeasible.  With respect, it is not up to the prison to dictate to a legal office as to who it should send to consult with a client.  Judicial review proceedings were threatened and the prison backed down.  I found all of that a complete waste of everybody's time when there are so many problems to be dealt with by Maghaberry Prison and it is worrying to think that a governor is sitting down thinking what is the number one priority today and deciding to frustrate legal consultations.  </p> <p>  With respect to education, it has been well noted today, and even in the general prison population, I have noticed an upturn in the number of clients that I have dealt with who enter prison with mental health difficulties and some type of addiction issues.  They leave Maghaberry Prison a hell a lot worse off then when they entered the institution.  Maghaberry Prison is unique in that way when compared with Magilligan Prison, the Hydebank Wood facility and Lakewood centre, which deals with children.</p><p>I am not seeing much progress on the ground but I accept that, given the crisis level the reports represented in 2015, Maghaberry Prison is, hopefully, being steered in the right direction at a senior level and that there will be a drip down process of that progress.</p></speech>

I also thank the Chairman for facilitating this hearing because I had suggested that we needed to discuss this topic.  Those of us from the Oireachtas who have made regular visits to Maghaberry Prison and met the various authorities - from one very brief meeting with the previous Secretary of State to meetings with the Minister for Justice, the prison authorities, the Prisoner Ombudsman and the prison service - can concur with everything that has been said.  We are very aware of the frustration in the prison.  If I had to sum it up, there seems to be an almost deliberate attempt to treat prisoners in an undignified way and not to allow for their dignity at all.  It is petty things.  It was appalling that the attempts in Roe House to commemorate the 1916 Rising were prevented.  We have also visited the Unionist Bush House.  There is no doubt that there is a difference in the atmosphere and in the relationships between the staff and the prisoners there.  Progress similar to that made with the PSNI, whose members are coming from various backgrounds, has not been made with the prison staff.  What is the witnesses' opinion in that regard?  Do they see any movement being made in that regard?  Would that help?</p> <p>  On the education aspect, we have met those prisoners who are totally frustrated.  Prisons are there to punish people.  However, they are also there to rehabilitate and help them when they leave.  There are prisoners that know they will be there for years, yet there is nothing available to them.  What can we do to push the issue further?</p> <p>  There were lengthy remands in the past.  Will Mr. Finucane indicate whether there has been an improvement in that situation?  Are more people getting bail?  A couple of prisoners who are out on bail wanted to attend this meeting today.  It might even have been good to hear from them.  However, the conditions of their bail meant they could not attend.  We are on a small island and they would have been coming with reputable people who, I am sure, would have guaranteed they would return, but it could not happen.  Issues such as lengthy remands and the revocation of licences are contributing to the atmosphere in the jail.  Tony Taylor was mentioned.  I met his son, who has special needs.  How that family was treated was absolutely appalling.</p> <p>  We have been assured every time that the prisoners want a conflict-free environment, but we seem to be the only people who accept what they are saying.  There have been no physical assaults on staff in Roe House, unlike other parts of the prisons.  We have the statistics.  The expense involved is raised.  However, if the prison agreed with the controlled movement situation, there would not be a need for as many staff.  We have visited the prison in Portlaoise and the contrast is totally and utterly amazing.  The prisoners put it to us recently that it is all process and no progress.  The witnesses have now mentioned that there will be another review that has not even started.  How will the prisoners feel about that one?</p> <p>  There appears to be a conflict in that things seem to get caught in a disagreement over whether the Minister of State or the Minister for Justice have a role to play.  When we started going up first, we had interesting letters and, at times, it seemed as if they were not sure who was responsible for what, but that has been clarified.  It is always under this term of "national security".  Do the witnesses consider the new Secretary of State as being more progressive on these issues?</p> <p>  There are obvious miscarriages of justice.  There are people detained in Roe House on the basis of dubious, so-called evidence.  They are left there languishing.  There have been examples of their parole commission hearings being cancelled at the last minute although the legal teams were ready to proceed.  Their entire schedules were disrupted.  We have also had examples of men coming out after their licence had been revoked with no charges preferred.  They were innocent, yet their lives have been turned upside down and what they had been trying to do in their lives was not able to go further.</p> <p>  It is my opinion that there is a lack of political will.  When it comes to Maghaberry Prison, the attitude appears to be to shut the door, throw away the key and forget about it.  A few of us in the D&aacute;il have repeatedly raised the matter with the various Ministers with responsibility for foreign affairs through Topical Issues and the tabling of parliamentary questions.  Albeit only a few of us are involved but there is probably a little more going on down here than is being done by the parties in the North.  There seems to be a complete and utter lack of political will to move this forward.  As noted, unless this particular aspect is sorted, the rest will not be either.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.110" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Bunting" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016110300002#G00300"><p>I will attempt to address all those points.  The first thing I would say is that it is fairly evident that there is, unfortunately, a problem with recruitment to the prison service because, unlike with the PSNI, there is no cross-community percentage requirements for prison officer grades.  I know a young woman from the Nationalist community who has been subjected to a number of sectarian attacks by her colleagues.  While I say that, I was very much engaged in getting separation in the prison initially in 2006 or 2007.  It was primarily on behalf of the UDA, members of which were lobbying me.  In case anyone thinks otherwise, regardless of where I come from, I look after everyone if I think it is in the best interests of society in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  I agree with everything Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said on education.  It is crazy.  The phrase about an idle mind and the devil utilising it comes to mind.  There is no reason the prisoners in Roe House should not be the recipients of education.  We all know that the republican tradition going back as far as history has always been that it is important that republican prisoners are educated.  This helps with the reintegration into society when people leave prison.  It is common sense so that we do not have recidivism, etc.  </p> <p>  To be fair, one has to say that there has been a continuum of threats against prison officers from the outside on various websites.  That should not be happening because it complicates matters. </p> <p>  I am not sure that I would agree with downsizing or limiting the number of staff, particularly as I represent the workers.</p> <p>  I will say one thing about political will.  Under the leadership of the national chair of Sinn F&eacute;in, there has been huge movement with regard to synergies happening between, particularly, Roe 3 and Sinn F&eacute;in.  Not only is that care or collegial action focused on republican prisoners, it is also focused on the general prison population as well.  I see that as a significant movement by Sinn F&eacute;in towards a degree of sharing with, talking to and reintegrating with people who share the same tradition.  I think that has benefited the entire process and also the process outside Northern Ireland.  That is to be welcomed.  The person involved in that - I will not mention his name - should be congratulated because the national chair of Sinn F&eacute;in has played a brilliant game there and that is helping Northern Ireland move forward.</p> <p>  In the context of other political groups, the SDLP was interested.  In particular, Pat Ramsey from Derry, who is not an MLA any more, was terribly interested and was there regularly.  Unfortunately, he is no longer in the Assembly.  I do not know if anyone is there.  If I can mention it, poor old Conal and I had the misfortune to appear before the Assembly committee on justice, which was chaired by a DUP member.  I think the only members that were there were DUP members.  They wondered how dare we speak to these people, that they should be shunned, they were lepers and we should not be going near them.  We were considered two eejits.  We might be eejits, by the way, but we were "well-meaning" eejits, in the words of some of the people there.  We had a rough time.  They could not get it through their heads that if our society is to progress and we are to embed the Good Friday Agreement to move forward with a peaceful and just society, we need to be dealing with prisoners.</p><p>If we are to move forward with a peaceful, just society we need to be dealing with prisoners - loyalist, dissident republican and the general population of prisoners - but it is just to no avail.  The view seems to be that if hell is there, which they probably believe in, prisoners should be all put there right away.  It is very frustrating, and they are very difficult people to deal with, not alone on this issue but on the rest of the social and economic issues in Northern Ireland.  To attempt to get the DUP to engage with the trade union movement at times is very difficult.  It is said that we are a pan-nationalist front or an all-island body and we should not exist in Northern Ireland or that we should be connected with the TUC or another such body.  Those are problems for us as well on a broad front.  I do not envy anybody who is trying to deal with them, but let us get back to the nitty-gritty things that happen every day.  It is not my musical taste by the way, but imagine banning a CD of Foster and Allen going into a prison because of the bit of Irish music on it or censoring and prohibiting books on Irish history.  We have regressed in relation to how prisons work and how people are treated in prison.</p><p> A fact that is now coming to light is that when people say they want to go into Roe House it is sometimes used against them in court, that because they asked to go into Roe House they are obviously guilty and they are republicans.  It is quite right to say that people are left in there for ages, in what is called administrative detention.  It is a nice phrase.  People might wait two or three years to be tried, which is nonsense as well.  It is a perversity of natural justice.  Lots of things are difficult.  I believe more prisoners have been let out on bail because there has been a huge decrease in the numbers.  When we were there first there were 22, it peaked at 48 and then all of a sudden they started giving some of them bail.  The reason for that is because they had no more room for prisoners so somebody came up with the idea of doing something about it for fear that they were building up trouble.  That is more the reasoning for letting so many people out of jail, namely, to reduce the numbers and deal with the accommodation problems they had.</p></speech>

One prisoner at the moment who is not from Belfast has been told he must live in Belfast.  He cannot be at home with his family in case he runs into some local republican or dissident republican.  That is the sort of restriction they are putting on people, which is unheard of.</p> <p>  The other issue at the moment is that there is now no communication whatsoever between prisoners in Roe House and prison management.  There is no dialogue whatsoever.  It has been like that now for more than 18 months.  It is unsustainable when there is no dialogue between those who work in Roe House and prisoners.  All that will do is lead to more mistrust and conflict and the question is how we break the impasse.</p> <p>  When we spoke to the prisoners recently and when we speak to prison management or the justice Minister they all say one thing, namely, that the only way to resolve the issue is to go back to the August 2010 agreement and the fundamental principles that underpin it.  If it can, the committee should stress the fact that the solution lies within that agreement and that is the best way forward.  It is the only way to create the conflict-free environment that has been spoken about.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.113" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Finucane" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016110300002#H00300"><p>I thank Deputy O'Sullivan, who has raised a number of good points.  What she finished on was the lack of political will within the jurisdiction to deal with the issue.  As a member of the public who lives in Belfast I want the people who are in prison, no matter what they are in for, to be released from prison.  I do not want them to be any more dangerous than they were when they walked into prison in the first place.  In the general prison population we have a lot of people who are unable to meet their release criteria because they cannot complete courses they must complete by the time their sentence is up.  They simply cannot do that.  It is impossible for them to do so, either because the courses are not available or only a certain number of people are allowed to do the course.  Sometimes one will find that those people are released anyway or that they come out with addiction issues more severe than when they entered prison.  Whether society likes a specific inmate or prisons in general, rehabilitation is very important and is being deliberately under-resourced.<br/><br/>The revocation of licences was mentioned as was lengthy remands.  In respect of bail, Mr. Bunting is 100% correct, I have heard a Crown barrister stand up in the High Court and say the person has asked to be placed in Roe House and the judge can take the inference from that.  In England there are bail time limits and if one&rsquo;s case is not ready to be heard by a court within a certain amount of time, one is automatically entitled to bail.  We have a criminal justice system in the North which is very lengthy and costly in terms of the length of time police investigations take and then the length of time it takes the Public Prosecution Service, PPS, to direct and have a case ready before the court means that sometimes people spend up to three years on remand.  There seems to be a slight shift and I think the courts are under pressure due to the number of people on remand for lengthy periods of time was probably causing embarrassment as much as anything.  That was noted in a recent article by the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>.  It was a piece any PR guru would be quite proud of.  In a piece with an MI5 operative they were quite pointed in their criticism of the courts for releasing people on bail.  I find that quite worrying because I feel it is an attempt to interfere with what should be the impartiality of the judiciary, which should be left to make up its own mind without any interference.  The article and the subsequent editorials from the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>were quite clear in terms of asking why we should be releasing such very dangerous people, who have not been convicted of anything.  The view was that they should just be locked up and we should ignore them.<br/><br/>With regard to the revocation of licences, again, I am dealing with someone whom it might be slightly crude to describe as an ordinary decent criminal.  People who are out on licence for offences where they would have been held in the general population, I am aware that if they are subsequently rearrested while on licence for offences that could be described as petty, but it is a criminal allegation nonetheless, those people do not have their licences revoked until the outcome of their case and there is a decision on whether they are guilty or innocent of what might be slightly low level criminality.  With regard to people who are held in Roe House, they are at a completely different end of the spectrum.  They will not know their accuser and will probably not know what they are accused of, but one must take the word of their accused that it is so severe that the authorities just have to revoke the licence and society should take their word for it.  That is a complete subversion of due process.  It is an area on which more light should be shone.  It is an abuse of power.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Sullivan asked about the new Secretary of State.  I have not had any personal dealings with him but I see he comes from a security background and he seems to be using national security certainly with regard to legacy issues that our society struggles to deal with, as a blanket to hide behind instead of dealing with things.  I worry that national security or even security in general is an easy blanket reason to prevent people from dealing with issues that should be addressed.</p></speech>

A good test of the new Secretary of State will be how he will deal with the unlawful detention of Tony Taylor.  It will be interesting to see how he will respond to that because there is a mounting campaign on why he is being detained and the fact that due process is not being applied.</p></speech>

The devolution of policing was fought for long and hard in the Six Counties.  That has now happened but it appears that is not the case in terms of justice in prison.</p><p>The message we are getting is of the denial of fundamental human rights within the prison system.  That is very clear.</p><p> One of the major contentious issues is strip-searching.  The witnesses have indicated they have visited other prisons where there are mechanisms to search people without being degrading.  When I was in Stormont, the then Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, David Ford, went on at length about certain machinery and he spoke about a chair, if I remember correctly.  Apparently, this was going to be the magic bullet to solve all the problems with strip-searching.  Then, it was decided that this would not work.  It seems there is no political will to resolve these problems.  The witnesses spoke to the new Minister of Justice in June but nothing has happened since then and it seems the lack of political will continues.</p><p> It seems the Secretary of State over-rules everything.  Mr. Finucane referred to national security.  I have been looking recently at the Investigatory Powers Bill that is currently going through the British Parliament.  Again, there are blanket references to national security but no definition of reasonable suspicion, a concept that is relevant to some of the points raised.  The UK Criminal Finances Bill is coming through.  Again, blanket issues in respect of national security and reasonable suspicion arise.  These issues need to be addressed.  As for as the justice department, prison reform should be at the heart of what that department is about because it has become one of the most contentious issues.  I spoke to an ex-prisoner yesterday who was in Maghaberry in 1999.  The situation has become increasingly worse.  I have spoken to people recently who are out on bail from Maghaberry.  I have heard absolute horror stories from people.  Unless it is addressed, it will continue to fester.</p><p> There is a difficulty with strip-searching in particular.  The witnesses are aware of other mechanisms.  Is there any particular reason for this policy?  Is it being used to degrade prisoners?  Obviously, it is at this point, and it continues to be used for this purpose.  It is a denial of their fundamental human rights.  Can this be addressed in a more humane way?  Can mechanisms be introduced to do away with it?  I have heard that prisoners moving only 20 yd. within the prison have been strip-searched for no good reason.</p></speech>

The report or agreement is perfectly measured, patient and forensic.  I cannot understand why the recommendations have not been implemented since 2010.  The committee should agree to the call for this agreement to be implemented as soon as possible.</p> <p>  Prisons are not particularly nice places.  Prison is where prisoners are denied a variety of freedoms by the state as a form of punishment.  There is a great deal of pettiness in this case.  Obviously, there are legacy issues.  These are rather difficult to deal with, but they must be dealt with.</p> <p>  Reference was made to a multi-mode threat detector.  What exactly is that?  Can it replace full body searching?  If this method is used here in prisons, including Portlaoise Prison, what is stopping it from being implemented in the North?</p> <p>  I find it difficult to understand why there was no provision for republican prisoners to develop their Irish language skills or cultural identity.  There must be some mechanism in place, for example, using computers, to allow it.  It should be simple.  I am concerned about the references to political interference on the part of the Minister of Justice.  If that happened down here, it would be a serious national scandal.</p> <p>  I have been in Maghaberry with my colleagues, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, Deputy Pringle and Deputy O'Sullivan.  I took the view that those involved worked closely to try to alleviate the problems.  I remember going to visit Marian Price in the hospital at Hydebank Wood.  Again, I witnessed an issue that should have been resolved through common sense.  Thankfully, the right decision was made to release her.  Again, however, we came up against a situation where common sense seemed to be absent.</p> <p>  Perhaps this committee could visit Maghaberry again.  I will leave it to the committee.  We should do anything we can.  First, we need to support this agreement and ask for it to be implemented in full immediately.  We have waited six years and I thank the members of the independent assessment team for their patience.  If there is something else the committee can do, we should do it.  I would be willing to try to help in any way.</p></speech>

During the course of our research over the past five or six years, we have looked at prison technology throughout the world.  We believe the appropriate technology exists.  We are told there is a cost factor with this technology.  Within this island, the technology to deal with full body searching exists.  It is currently in Portlaoise Prison.  During the process of negotiating this agreement, Mr. Bunting and I visited Portlaoise Prison.  We talked to the head of the Prison Service about technology, especially technology to deal with political or paramilitary prisoners.  The technology referred to in our report is currently available in Portlaoise Prison.  It detects explosives, drugs and all sorts of things.  We also convinced the Prison Service in the North to bring in what is known as the body orifice security scanner, BOSS, chair.  Initially, those responsible did not want to bring it in.  Then Mr. Bunting, through his trade union connections with the Irish Prison Service, informed the head of the Northern Ireland Prison Service during the negotiations that there was a spare BOSS chair not being used in Portlaoise Prison.  It was available to be brought to Maghaberry to resolve the difficulty.  Overnight, they accepted the offer to bring in the BOSS chair.  There is also another detector in Portlaoise Prison.  In our view these measures would remove the need for routine strip-searching.</p> <p>  The technology already exists.  We are told that the reason it is not being used in the North is because it does not give them a 100% guarantee that a person does not have something hidden inside his body.</p> <p>  This is part of the problem in dealing with the issue at Maghaberry.  To all intents and purposes what we have is a security mindset, and it continues to this day.  It is stifling any opportunity to move towards a more humane prison system not only for prisoners but for prison staff as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Bunting" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016110300002#J00600"><p>To answer the question, I can keep repeating what I have said previously, but it is terribly frustrating.  I do not know how the two of us have survived.  Perhaps I will get a pension from the Northern Ireland Prison Service or something; I do not know.  To be serious, from our perspective there is both a sectarian attitude and political interference in respect of these people.  My view is that the references to legacy issues are nonsense.  They are utilised as an excuse.</p> <p>  There have been extraordinary changes.  There is a person in a control centre outside the campus who simply has to press a button for all the gates to lock.  He is untouchable.  He is in a bunker.  No one can get at this person.  He simply has to press a button if trouble starts and the whole place closes down.  Therefore, it is nonsense to suggest that people are under attack.  There is controlled movement of people.  For example, let us suppose I want to go for a shower.  Three prison officers come to my cell and take me.  They do not handcuff me or anything.  I dander over to the door across the way and go into the shower.</p><p>In the interim, if the prisoner next to me wants to go somewhere else, he has to wait until I get back to my cell and then these three merchants have to come back and unlock his door to take him to the next door.  It is absolute nonsense.  To me, it is oppression.  That is what it is.  Even allowing for the fact that there is a danger of somebody smuggling gelignite or whatever in some orifice or other, the machine we saw in Portlaoise has no difficulty detecting that.  It can detect explosives and it can detect drugs.  I know Mr. John Finucane talks about drugs generally.  The prison officers admit that there are no drugs in any of the dissident republican landings.  They do not exist there and the prison service accepts that, by the way.</p><p> Even allowing for that, these things could happen and that is what the detecting machines are for.  We called the Maghaberry Prison service on its bluff.  We got on to the prison authorities in Portlaoise through the Prison Officers Association in the Republic of Ireland.  I spoke to a person I knew who said he could get a body orifice security scanner, BOSS, chair up to Maghaberry.  He said that there was one lying around there, that he could put it on the tractor or the trailer and could have it up in Maghaberry Prison the next day.  I told the prison service we would get it one tomorrow.  Previous to that, one would have to put in an order and it would take a year to go through the procedures, processes and all that carry on.  Therefore, I said I could get one for them on loan the next day.  All of sudden, they brought it in.  However, that was still not good enough.  It is in the agreement that if detection led to intelligence, the officer would strip search the prisoner, but that has never happened.  It is used as a tool to suppress and intimidate people.</p><p> We have to look at the big picture.  Do we really want to build a peaceful and just society in Northern Ireland?  If we do, whether we like it or not, we have to do deal with these people.  It the same with everyone else.  We have to talk to everyone.  If nobody talks to them, it only adds fuel to the fire.  It is absolute nonsense to ignore them or isolate them.  What will happen can be seen in republican history.  People might go on a dirty protest.  What we all fear is somebody going on a hunger strike.  All of the oxygen would then be given to the dissidents and taken away from those people in the current Sinn F&eacute;in Party who have done a good thing by embedding the peace process.  It is the sort of a place to which there is no rationale or reality.  If we could sit down for the next six months, we still could not come up with an acceptable reason for what is happening in that prison and why it is still happening to this day.</p><p> The danger of it is that it will leave open an opportunity in which some other prison officer could be killed.  Sometimes one might believe that these mysterious people who run this system must think prison officers are expendable in order to justify their reasoning.  I am serious about that.  These things are outside my ken.  I can never understand it.  Throughout the course of six years, we have came close numerous times to breaking point or to moving away from it.  We still hang in there.  Maybe we are gluttons for punishment.  It is because we believe that the agreement we had was the best we all could have got.  Everybody signed up to it.  Despite all the agreements in the Maze, in Long Kesh and everywhere else, it was the only signed agreement by prisoners and the prison service alike in the history of the prison service in either the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland.  That agreement is there and it really should be built on.</p><p> Perhaps this committee should seek a meeting with the Secretary of State and the Minister of Justice in Northern Ireland and demand to know when we will ever have agreement and progress.  It is not the case that anybody would move to free and full movement immediately.  It would be a gradual system of movement in which more prisoners could get out monthly on the premise that there would be peace and that it would be a conflict-free prison.  In negotiations, the prison service could say that there could be seven prisoners out on the landing by Christmas, but if the prisoners mess around, intimidate somebody or hit somebody, then they return to square one as before.  In that way, it would be in everyone's interest to reach the situation in which there is a conflict-free environment, unless somebody decides to beat themselves up or something, but that is a matter for another day.  We will not discuss that now.  We live in expectancy that we could get a progressive agreement over a period of time that would suit everyone involved.</p></speech>

I am not a member of this committee, but non-members can attend and contribute as well and I wish to acknowledge that.  I thank Mr. Peter Bunting and Mr. Conal McFeeley for the work that they have been doing in trying to bring some reason and sense to the regime at Maghaberry.  As mentioned earlier, Deputy O'Sullivan, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, a couple of other members and I have been visiting the prison.  Unfortunately, I have not visited as often as the rest of them, but we have visited.  We met the prisoners in Roe House.  We met Unionist and loyalist prisoners as well in Bush House.  One of the things that I remarked on when we were there was that there is a lot more freedom of movement in Bush House than in Roe House, even though they are both under the same regime.  All one has to do is spend ten minutes looking at the landings there and one will see that Bush House is a lot freer.  One of the most frustrating things is that we have had the privilege, if it can be called that, of meeting the management after our meetings there.  To borrow a phrase from a former Deputy, talking to them was like playing handball against a haystack.  It is clear to me that that is where the problems and blockages are in trying to resolve the situation.</p> <p>  I have a couple of questions.  Mr. Bunting mentioned earlier a woman he knows who has received some sectarian abuse from colleagues on the prison staff.  We have heard anecdotally that there are problems with the retention of Catholic staff recruited into the prison service.  Is Mr. Bunting aware of that himself?  Arising from that, is there a need for a Patten commission-style report for prison service staff?  Would that go some way to changing the atmosphere?</p> <p>  I wish to ask about the role of the NIO in Roe House.  We know the role it has in keeping prisoners in the segregated prisons and in the care and supervision units.  Does the NIO have a role in Roe House itself?  Does it have a day-to-day role there that might be encouraging the continuation of strip searching and the regime there that is leading to the problems?</p> <p>  The witness met the Northern Minister of Justice in June.  Have there been any follow-up meetings or has it just been a blank ever since?  Some of us may be meeting her in the next few weeks.  We might raise those issues with her too.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1312" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016110300002#K00400"><p>What has been said here today has been very frank and useful.  I thank the witnesses for sharing their thoughts with us on what is happening in Maghaberry.  Those of us who have been there frequently would say that the witnesses have expressed very succinctly what we believed.  I initially became involved in the prison issue back in 1994.  I spent about three years on it and was over and back, mainly to Britain, at the time, although I did visit prisons in the North and once or twice in the South.  I did not expect to get back into it in 2011.</p> <p>  Between 2011 and today, I have been in and out of Maghaberry with various colleagues, mainly Deputies Clare Daly, Mick Wallace, Maureen O'Sullivan, who I think has been on virtually every visit, and Thomas Pringle, Senator Frank Feighan and some other Deputies and Senators who have been in and out on occasion.  For nearly every prison visit, we have paid another visit to Belfast to talk to the Irish secretariat, to Ministers, to the Prisoner Ombudsman, to the head of the prison service and so on.  Some people have been receptive and some have not.  It would take too long to outline who has and who has not.</p><p> Every detail the witnesses outlined is correct.  There has been no movement on controlled movement or strip-searching.  Having recently visited Portlaoise Prison on a number of occasions, the big difference there, as opposed to the loyalist wing or the republican Roe House, is human relationship.  We can write all the rule books we like but if the horse does not want to drink, the horse will not drink.  Even when some of the witnesses' reports came through, it was one step forward and two steps back.  A way was found within the small print of the rules not to act within the spirit of the thing.</p><p> Someone asked where we should go from here.  Compared with the period between 1994 and 1997, it is much more complex now because of all the different jurisdictions involved.  Once devolved government came about in Northern Ireland, I expected that there would be some collective involvement by the parties in the Executive on what happens in the prisons.  We tried that and were clearly told that the Minister for Justice is the Minister for Justice.  One side in the Executive is for reform, while the other side is against reform.  Once one side is against reform, nothing happens.  That creates an astounding and frightening political paralysis.</p><p> Two prison officers are dead.  Mr. Bunting seemed to articulate something - I do not want to misquote him - that I adverted to a few times for which I was severely criticised.  I have suggested that it is likely to be not unconnected to the prison regime.  In other words, what happens in the prison has an effect outside the prison.  None of us can prove that in law but intuition would suggest the connection is likely.  When the prison officer, Mr. Gray, a very fine person, was killed, within a week or ten days the dirty protest ended.  It breaks my heart to think that because of intransigence across the system this risk is continuing unnecessarily; it cannot be allowed to fester.</p><p> A number of things could be done.  First, the Executive could provide enough money to hear cases expeditiously and eliminate the need for long periods on remand.  I do not know how to deal with the cases where there seems to be internment without trial in the form of arresting people on suspicion of offences, bringing them to court, the court case collapses because there is literally no evidence and they are let out the door again.  That is another issue.  I do not know whether they have human rights cases there but that seems to be totally unacceptable.</p><p>  I take it that the introduction of the equipment is a Northern Ireland Office issue.  It would be fair to say that there is a certain amount of sympathy at the top of the system and as it went to implement these things down the line there seems to be a problem.  If there is an instruction from on high - for example, from the head of the Northern Ireland Prison Service - that certain modern equipment is to be used, do they have the power to be able to influence that and force people to comply?  The witnesses have been in, as have representatives of the international Red Cross.  I accept what the witnesses have said about threats on the Internet, etc., which are totally unacceptable, but it goes on.</p><p> In dealing with an intractable problem, the person who is likely to gain most is the first mover.  Many people think in negotiations she should be the last mover, but my experience always tells me that the first mover really puts it up to the other side.  In this case, since the position of power lies with the authorities because they have utter control, modest first moves should allow them to go to the other side and request reciprocation.</p><p> Can the witnesses confirm, as they seem to have said, that for all of the allegations, and in cases convictions, against these people, they are not irrational?  Sometimes people in the prison population have mental illnesses and so on.  Their conduct could not be answered for because they could not answer for themselves, not because of any badness but because of mental illness and so on.</p><p> Both here and in the North, if the segregated republican prisoners give their word not to do something, they seem to stick to that.  Therefore, if the authorities do a deal, then a deal is done and they will not act in a capricious manner.  There tends to be a group dynamic and they act as a group, which might be a good thing in certain ways, but it can pose its problems.</p><p> We normally meet the Secretary of State separately from the Minister.  Should a joint meeting be sought between the head of the prison service, the Northern Ireland Minister for Justice and the Secretary of State so that if one was passing the ball somebody would have to catch the ball because they could not put it off to a further meeting three months later.  That issue needs to be dealt with.</p><p> The witnesses have, of course, covered the licence issue.  I got involved in 2011 because Gerry McGeough was imprisoned for something that had happened in 1982.  Should the licence be absolutely indeterminate?  Down here, a prisoner released on licence would normally have committed murder or something at that level.  However, much shorter sentences attract licences in Northern Ireland.  Should there be a period after which the licences for those released on licence following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement should come to an end just as special arrangements were made that it was two years in prison?  If somebody has done something awfully wrong, there is a court and he or she can be convicted.  However, the power to say to somebody, "I'm not going to tell you and once I tell your barrister what the problem is they cannot discuss it with you" seems to be an absolutely incredible power to have.</p><p> I am sorry for going on, but five long years have been put in on this.  I doubt if a month has passed in the five years that I have not been up in the North dealing with this issue.  It has been the most intractable political problem in which I have ever been involved.  Like the witness, on many occasions I ask myself if I am mad to keep coming back, but when it is so serious it is very hard to walk away.  It has proved incredibly difficult to deal with and it does not seem to be open to any kind of rational assessment.</p><p> Dealing with the authorities here seems to be totally different.  While the physical conditions in Portlaoise Prison are not great, there is a better approach in terms of interpersonal relationships.  This can be seen from the minute one enters the room.  It is an approach that if the prisoners are fair, they will be dealt with fairly.  This means that all involved - prison staff and prisoners - will have happier lives.</p><p> Some members of the committee may never have been to Maghaberry Prison.  The chances of a prisoner escaping from Maghaberry Prison are slim.  As some of those present might know I had a relative who made a rather dramatic escape from a British prison at one stage.  Anyone entering Maghaberry Prison is required to give a fingerprint and have a photograph taken.  After passing through a series of turnstiles, one reaches the yard.  After that, one passes through a very tall gate with barbed wire.</p><p>Then one goes through a double door, and one is only inside when one goes through another double door to get into the wing.  As Mr. Bunting said, just like that, the whole prison can be closed down in two seconds.  Even within the wings there are turnstiles, and if the prison is locked down, one can be held in the recreation areas.  Believe me, there is no way out.  The idea that the prisoners might suddenly all metamorphosise through all the security and wind up walking down a road in Maghaberry defies logic, given the fantastic technology in the prison that would seem to me to make that an impossibility, particularly because of the centralised control, whereby the whole prison can be locked down literally at the flick of a switch.  It seems to be all about one thing: "We are bosses, we control you and we own you."</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for allowing me to contribute and I thank the witnesses for the information they provided.  I am probably one of the few people in the room who have never been in Maghaberry.  I am from Tipperary.  I am not exposed to and have no experience of Maghaberry other than what I read in the media and what I have read in history, etc., and I am quite shocked by what I have heard today.</p><p>Mr. Finucane raised the issues of deprivation and educational facilities.  I spent a large part of my life working with deprived people and I have always believed and told every one of them that the only way out of deprivation is education.  Regarding the issue of correspondence courses not being allowed to be transacted - I might be speaking naively but I will ask the question - is there any possibility that they might be allowed to be done through a hard copy of correspondence?  To deprive somebody who wants to enable himself through education - to use one of the witnesses' phrase - to leave the prison a better person than when he entered is unacceptable.</p><p>The other question concerns the human rights issue.  Has the independent assessment team taken a case or cases to the European Court of Human Rights <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Maghaberry?  I apologise but I must leave.  I was supposed to leave at 3.45 p.m.  I will read the witnesses' answers on the record and I hope to get an opportunity to visit Maghaberry.  I think somebody has already suggested a visit.  It would be very important for me to see it on the ground.</p></speech>

I appreciate he may have to leave.  Regarding education, unfortunately, my client's specific course requires that it must be completed online, by way of a computer.  Other prisons facilitate this, and blocks can be put on the computer very easily so that one cannot communicate or use the Internet for nefarious purposes.  This is another example of how security in Maghaberry is not based in reality.</p> <p>  I have not been involved in any cases that have reached Strasbourg yet.  One would need to exhaust quite a lengthy process, first within my jurisdiction and second the Supreme Court in London, and then seek leave or get permission before bringing a case to Strasbourg, but it would not surprise me.  Again, the overarching issue that is not being treated as the No. 1 priority here is the dignity with which all sides should be treated.  That should be at the heart of all this.</p> <p>  I think the cost has been touched on in previous reports.  Maghaberry is one of the most expensive prisons in western Europe, and the taxpayer is not getting value for money from it.  Budgets, no matter what the financial context, should not be infinite.  There is a set amount of money, and I do not see any prospect whatsoever that a security-based regime as oppressive as that at Maghaberry, and which generates as much case law as Maghaberry does, will represent value for taxpayers' money.</p> <p>  There has been talk about the background or the perception as to who runs Maghaberry.  As an example, a remand prisoner who wants out can apply for bail.  If bail is denied and something specific happens - for example, a death - he can apply for compassionate bail.  In the case of a sentenced prisoner, that must be granted by the jail and is called compassionate temporary release.  The jail constantly cites that if it is a Catholic funeral in a Catholic area, then for security reasons the prison staff cannot escort the inmate, that they are very sorry, that they are sure the prisoner will be disappointed by the news but that they cannot do it.  This causes challenges through the courts.  More often than not, the prison loses those challenges and, therefore, the taxpayer is faced with a legal bill that the prison will take on with taxpayers' money.</p> <p>  Regarding what questions could potentially be put to either a Secretary of State or the Minister of Justice, he or she should be asked to try to find out a clear figure as to how much a security-based regime costs the taxpayer.  We have been involved in cases in which people are strip-searched on their way to video link consultations with a solicitor.  Think about that: somebody leaves his cell, does not come into contact with anyone apart from a prison officer, talks to me through a screen - I am in Belfast; he is in Maghaberry - then he leaves and goes back to his cell.  He is strip-searched in that context.  Nobody can tell me there is any rational basis for that to happen, but it costs money and it then leads to further challenges, and those further challenges cost.  The controlled movement has more prison officers than I think are necessary, who could be better placed doing other things in other areas of the jail that require that attention.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.135" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Peter Bunting" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016110300002#M00600"><p>Deputy Pringle spoke about the retention of Catholic staff and a Patten-style commission for prisons.  There is most certainly a need for that, even for the sake of transparency.  I assume that we would be able to go back and check that because the numbers of Catholics and Protestants employed in the prison service must be given.  We would probably still see the same differentials which were there years ago in that context.<br/><br/>Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v probably categorises the situation in all of Northern Ireland and how it works.  The devolved Administration is put to the sword on a regular basis by the behaviour of the largest party.  I was explaining to Mr. Finucane earlier that when we were seeking the bill of rights in the context of the Good Friday Agreement and met the First and Deputy First Ministers in 2013, the latter said he was on the same page as the trade union movement - no problem - whereas our friend, Peter Robinson, said he was not on the same page as either Martin McGuinness or the trade union movement.  To say that in front of somebody is not the way to deal with things.<br/><br/>If Mr. McFeely and I had a difference, we would not tell the committee that difference, but this is the behaviour we see.  Anyway, a row ensued and I said to Mr. Robinson that, surely, this being the time of the flags protests, a bill of rights would assist his own constituents if they wanted to fly the union flag.  His very simple reply was that it was not a matter of politics, but religion.  We will never see a bill of rights in Northern Ireland which mentions sexual orientation because it is against the religion of the DUP.  This is a first minister in a modern society.  If that had been said in any other jurisdiction or any other parliament, the minister would have resigned.  This is the bubble in which one tries to do business, in which poor old Martin McGuinness must try to do business and in which everybody has to try to move on.  It is irrational in many senses.<br/><br/>It annoys me when I see letters in <i>The Irish Times</i>from people in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann - from Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's own party as well, I may add - challenging Sinn F&eacute;in about austerity and so on.  I am not a member of Sinn F&eacute;in but trying to make political capital out of the ills of people in Northern Ireland by criticising Sinn F&eacute;in is not conducive to dealing with the problems in Northern Ireland, which stem from a lack of finance from Britain and the control of one particular party which blocks everything which the Parliament or even the trade union movement tries to do.  Our biggest difficulty is that we can send off correspondence seeking a meeting with the First and Deputy First Ministers, as we have done three times this year already, but all we get back is correspondence stating that Martin McGuinness will meet us.  We know Martin McGuinness will meet us.  We want to meet Arlene Foster but, no, she blocks the meetings.  This is the biggest civic society organisation in Northern Ireland.</p></speech>

I retired last week.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v is right and he expressed our frustration as well.  It is a fact that there are complex issues surrounding this.  As Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, on high the staff can all be lovely people but the ground staff do not implement it.  Sometimes it must be said that if one is in charge of an organisation, there are occasions within the dissident body when that must be dealt with and when that nettle must be grasped.</p><p>We cannot allow a small group of people to frustrate the political mechanisms or the rights mechanisms in terms of how prisoners should be treated.  It is not compatible with what we need in our society.  The Roe House prisoners have a sense of discipline because they come from an alleged military background.  In our association with the INLA, they stood by their word on every occasion during the two-year process of decommissioning, but if you were to read the press about the INLA, you would not believe it.<br/><br/>The proposed meeting should be a joint one because everywhere one goes somebody keeps passing the buck.  The Minister for Justice passes it to the Northern Ireland Office, NIO, and it passes to the HMIP and ones goes around on an never-ending circle.  It is like a circus where the hamster is running around on the wheel.  One would never get them all in the one room at the same time.  <br/><br/>The issue of being out on licence<b></b>is a matter for Mr. John Finucane to address.  I am not a legal person.  There should be an open and transparent appeal mechanism against it and not a secret group of commissioners somewhere who can say one is not allowed to say this or to say that.  Again, that is a breach of rights.  It is a breach with respect to what we are all looking forward to having in society in terms of an open environment.  Such secrecy hides corruption and other elements associated with it.  <br/><br/>What was said about Portlaoise Prison is right.  I am always amazed by what I see there.  I was on one of the big landings there and at the end of it there was a big display of saws, chisels and hammers, which was the total the opposite of what would expect to find there.  Yet everyone had the trust that no prisoner would take any of those tools down and attempt to attack a prison officer.  They were all on display and everyone there was working away doing crafts.  In Maghaberry, one is lucky if one is allowed to have matchsticks and a tiny knife to do some craftwork.  What is found in the two of them is very contradictory and quite opposite in many ways.  I know Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned that fact that his grandfather had a wonderful escape from the old practice of having a file in a cake; he did not have a great record sometimes with the prisoners.</p></speech>

A republican prison or any prisoner out on licence - there are quite a number of them, and some of them are not dissident republicans - can at any time, at the behest of the Secretary of State or the security forces, have a hand put on their shoulder and be told they are not playing the game and they are back in jail.  That needs to be fundamentally addressed.  It may well have been one of the issues that should have been originally addressed when the Good Friday Agreement was established.  When one talks to those groups about trying to move them forward from where they are at, they will refer to two matters.  The will refer to the current situation in Maghaberry Prison and to the fact that the security forces can use this licence to put one back in jail.  The case in point is that of Tony Taylor.  That is causing much concern within that constituency as we try to move them into further dialogue.  That is an issue that needs fundamentally addressed with the Secretary of State if and when the committee meets him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-11-03a.144" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Finucane" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2016110300002#N00300"><p>Regarding Deputy Pringle's point concerning the background of prison officers, I have witnessed the influx of many young prison officers who appear to have been brought in.  I am not convinced their background would be representative of the population within Northern Ireland.  The prison environment has been a very male dominated one.  The Prison Officers Association has been referred to as a boys' club.  That needs to change, not only the religious background but the gender of the people being brought through in the way in which the PSNI was basically forced to go along that journey.</p> <p>  On Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v's questions with regard to the thinking of the inmates and the rationality, if there is any doubt about that, it should be put to them.  If there are questions about their integrity or whether they are able to stand over their side of any agreement, that should be put it up to them.  I began my opening statement by saying that if we were dealing with an issue that was solely the cause of the prisoners, they would deserve all the criticism that they get.  From my experience in dealing with inmates who are part of the discussions within the jail about what they are prepared to sign up to, they come at this with a large degree of thought and consideration.  It is not something that they rush into.  It is very different from the demands of prisoners in other parts of the prison.  </p> <p>  With regard to the Deputy's description of the security make-up within Maghaberry Prison, I had cause to see a client last year in Arbour Hill and I attended there with a barrister and the two of us spent the first five minutes laughing.  It took us a matter of seconds to get from parking the car to sitting down waiting on the client being brought to see us.  This was somebody who had been held in Arbour Hill for 20 years; it was not somebody who was a very low-level risk.  Within Maghaberry Prison, it takes at least 45 minutes to an hour from the time I park my car to the time I see the client.  That is a reflection of the fingerprinting, the dogs and the number of doors I would go through.  It comes back to what I said previously with regard to the cost.  I do not think anybody is getting value for money from Maghaberry Prison.</p></speech>

I want to point out at the start because it is important to put it on the record, given some of the previous contributions, that it is not as if there has not been any political engagement or engagement from political parties with this issue in the North.  I note Mr. Peter Bunting's comments in regard to our party chairperson but it goes back further than that.  Raymond McCartney, Jennifer McCann, Pat Sheehan, Car&aacute;l N&iacute; Chuil&iacute;n are all ex-prisoners and they have all engaged with the various groupings in Roe House and beyond on these matters going back a long number of years.  At times there have been particular individuals and organisations in there who have not wanted to engage with Sinn F&eacute;in on the issues.  That has hindered us in our ability to bring a positive resolution, focused frame of mind or approach to the issue.</p> <p>  The witnesses have painted a very depressing picture in their contributions.  I refer to hearing words like "regression" in regard to what is happening in the prison, the prevalence of a security culture and focus.  As people who over a long period of years have visited friends or relatives in prison, we know how petty and nuanced that kind of approach can get when it comes to the prisoners or their families who are visiting.  All the evidence the witnesses have presented points to that culture prevailing.  Within the broader context of prison reform and how we deal with the issues that manifest themselves in Roe House, is there an indication of progress or change of culture on foot of any number of reviews and reports that have examined the problems?  If there was, where should that focus be initially?  Should it be at managerial or staffing level?  If one happens, can it impact on the other?  Does it need to a Patten mark two?</p> <p>  My final question relates to the proposed visit by Senator Feighan and others.  The difficulty for us is that we want to see this happen and our remit is around the implementation of the Agreement and this is a core component to it.  Do the witnesses, in terms of their proposals, recommendations, suggestions and findings, believe the Fresh Start agreement offers us a pathway to resolving these issues?  What do they think the focus of this committee should be when approaching the issues specific to Roe House and the broader issues of prison reform?</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for coming here today and for giving us an insight into what is happening.</p><p>I thank my colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, also for bringing this issue to the fore.  I am shocked and saddened by what I have heard today.  I can only imagine the witnesses' frustration.  All of them have been doing Trojan work for the past few years, and I thank them for that.  I hear them when they say that at times they felt like walking away.  I imagine that comes from the frustration of not being heard.  I know what that is like.  I have worked in the addiction field for many years and I know what it feels like to try to highlight issues and not be heard.  I understand that frustration.  I hope they do not walk away because they are probably the only bit of light, and hope, the prisoners have.</p><p> I do not have the political jargon and I hope it is appropriate for me to say this.  Forgive me if it is not.  Would it be a good idea to consider putting together some type of political steering group made up of people the witnesses have already met such as Deputy O'Sullivan and Sinn F&eacute;in representatives?  We could work together, and we could use this committee.  People are interested in this area.  They want to help the situation and support the witnesses without trying to make more work for them.  We could bring people from the parties in the North who are interested in this area and start working together on going forward on this issue.  Some strategy might be put together with a view to making a change.  I have no doubt the witnesses have tried everything, but what are their thoughts on that?</p></speech>

I am aware the witnesses have been working on this for a very long time but we want to see what we can do.  I ask them to bear that in mind when they make their final contributions to allow us move forward with it.  I hope we will come back to this issue after we have done what the witnesses can recommend to us.</p></speech>

It is an opportunity we should not miss.  Clearly, politicians have a major role to play in that because it is something that has come out of our Assembly.  It was signed up to and approved by the Office of the First and deputy First Minister.  That is important, and it is an opportunity we should not miss.</p> <p>  It remains our view that, in terms of dealing with these prisoners, they are people who, if they give their word, will keep it.  The reason I believe the agreement came unstuck was because it was broken by the Northern Ireland Prison Service at the beginning of the process, which led to it unravelling.  However, I still believe it is possible, in light of what is available in terms of Fresh Start, to put in place a mutual respect policy that would lead to a more conflict-free environment.  When there is no communication between prisoners and prison staff, we need to find a mechanism whereby effective communication can be restored.  We will then begin to treat people as human beings and, in that context, move forward on issues.</p></speech>

The Senator is right.  For all who were here earlier, the Fresh Start Panel report on the disbandment of paramilitary groups indicates an endorsement of what we have done so far.  Mr. McFeely is correct that this has been endorsed by Arlene Foster.  Therefore, it is something we should use to make progress with.  It is depressing, but it gives us a little bit of light where we can move forward with regard to it.  If we are ever to get to the decommissioning issue or whatever, it is important that we work on the issue of the prisons.</p> <p>  With regard to a political steering group, anything that helps will be significant.  The big question is whether, within a political steering group, we engage with some church bodies from the Presbyterian church, the Church of Ireland or whatever in Northern Ireland.  That would be important also.  Decent people such as Sammy Douglas in the DUP and others in the Unionist Party should get into that political steering group if they have the strength to do that.  There are loyalist prisoners involved in this as well and everything we get here, they get, so they are benefiting as well.  The interesting thing about that is that, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v said, there is a different atmosphere over there.  We have been over there ourselves and it is light years away from the way people in Roe House are treated, but if we can reach the point where everyone is moving forward again, it might encourage some people from what is termed the pull community to move into that political steering group.  I thank the Chairman for the invitation.  I hope I will not be back.  It will be progress everywhere from now on.</p></speech>

We need to break that link, and that will involve everybody.  It will take more than solicitors.  Lawyers are probably the worst people to engage in processes such as this one.  It takes civic society as well as political society.  It takes a concerted effort to have the media realise that prison reform is something that benefits all of society.  Whether they are coming out of Roe House or the other houses within Maghaberry, society is much better off if people come out in a much more stable position than when they entered it.</p> <p>  My comments are very much off the top of my head, having listened to the discussions today.  The prisoners within Roe House would identify themselves as Irish citizens.  If they are being denied access to their culture, whether that be learning their language, being able to make instruments and so on, the Minister or Ministers in this jurisdiction should be engaged with that, especially in an educational format.  The concern that Irish citizens are being denied access to education, access to culture with very little downside in terms of security or an impact on anybody else is something that should be brought to people's attention.</p> <p>  In terms of this group, there seems to be surprise about some of the things that have been reported to them today.  The group should see the situation for themselves.  As many people as possible should go to Maghaberry.  The members of this committee who spoke today who have visited Maghaberry have probably remained focused on this issue because of the impact those visits had upon them.  It is a credit to all those involved, especially Deputy O'Sullivan, that they have stuck with it because prison issues are by no means popular.</p> <p>  I encourage everybody to meet.  The Department of Justice, under the Assembly, needs to be engaged and show strong leadership.  It should not allow the tail to wag the dog or allow the prison service to dictate what is and is not acceptable to it.  Unless clear examples as to how the regime can be compromised are being put forward, ideas around prison reform, if needs be, must be imposed on the prison in the way certain ideas were imposed on the old RUC to move us into an era whereby policing has very much changed.  I thank the Chairman for facilitating this meeting.</p></speech>

It might be worthwhile to seek to meet Ministers from Dublin at intergovernmental level to raise some of the points alluded to by Mr. Finucane in his concluding remarks.  Fair enough the DUP has signed up to Fresh Start, and this gives us a positive launching pad, but the elephant in the room remains the Northern Ireland Office and the more dubious influence it is suggested it has had in terms of the running of and conditions in the jail.  As part of this broader engagement we should engage with the Government in Dublin to ensure the issue is raised at intergovernmental level with the British.</p></speech>

What happens if it states it is integration and that is it?  In all my long life I have never seen a situation where we always seem to be going backwards even when we think we are going forward.  Is there a chance this will create a new problem rather than resolving old problems?</p></speech>

It has not returned to the 1980s and 1990s regime.  It is a safety aspect.  To exaggerate to make the point, diehard republicans and diehard loyalists will never be allowed to come into contact for the sake of integration.  There is a degree of mischief making by people who are pushing integration.  While integration is not something that should be laughed at, the practical reality will never be lost.  There would be a quick challenge to anybody who tried to put two people together or two groups together who would naturally come into conflict.  I do not see the integration that has been described in recent weeks ever coming to the fore, but this does not necessarily mean we have to have a security based system that has a prison within a prison.</p></speech>

It was amended and the substantive motion, which was amended by Sinn F&eacute;in, was passed by the Assembly.  It spoke about Fresh Start and the panel's review findings.  This in itself indicates at least a marginal shift, that people are prepared to look at this and not just take a traditional knee-jerk reaction to the issue.</p></speech>

We need to look at letters or meetings with the Minister for Justice and Equality and others.  They may not meet us and we must be open to this fact.

Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile has alluded to the fact the prison situation is a fundamental human rights issue in regard to the Good Friday Agreement.  Can we not have a proposal that we write to the Minister for Justice and Equality outlining our concerns, particularly from what we have heard today?  We were all aware of it, but the witnesses have encapsulated it very well for all of us.  We should also possibly arrange a meeting with the Secretary of State and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The point was well made that they tend to play off one another.  Certainly in meetings I have had in the past with David Ford we got the impression the tail was very much wagging the dog.  For those of us who have not been in Maghaberry, a visit should be arranged for the committee as a whole.  We have heard so much but we should actually see the conditions as outlined by our three witnesses today.  It is very important that the issue be addressed.</p></speech>

If we do it will be fantastic, but it has not happened to date.  Therefore, we need a process so if nothing happens we keep coming back.  If I was asked what is the most likely issue to destabilise the situation North and South it is prisons.  We know a totally different approach is taken in the two jurisdictions on the island.  We must ask ourselves which adds more to peace and stability than the other.  We have a yardstick by which to measure.  It has not posed any risk to people down here.  In fact, many of us would argue from having met and being in the situation, it reduces the risk dramatically for those outside prison, particularly prison officers.  Deputy O'Sullivan's proposal is correct, that we reflect and have a coherent approach that is stepped so we do not have a big burst and think we will solve it, because that is not my experience.</p></speech>
